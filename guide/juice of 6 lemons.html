Remove from heat and add the lemon juice. Cool to room temperature and store syrup in the refrigerator. For each glass of lemonade use 1/4 cup of syrup with a cup of fizzy water or plain water. To make lemonade ice cubes, stir 2 tablespoons of syrup per cup of water and freeze as lemonade ice cubes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 54319,&quot;Prime Cut of Veal in Vin Jaune Sauce, with King&#39;s Garden Vegetables Salt and pepper 7 ounces fresh morel mushrooms 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2/3 cup veal stock 2/3 cup French Vin Jaune or semisweet white wine Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 ounces cooked whole chestnuts 4 small carrots, quartered lengthwise 4 ounces celery root, diced into 1/4-inch cubes 4 baby turnips, quartered 4 ounces rutabaga, diced into 1/4-inch pieces 8 asparagus, cut into 3-inch pieces 4 thick prime veal chops Instructions: few hours before cooking, season the veal chops with salt and pepper, and chill in the refrigerator. Clean the morel mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and saute in 1 tablespoon of butter for 2 minutes. Combine the veal stock and wine, bring to a boil and then simmer until it is reduced by half. Add 1 tablespoon of butter, morel mushrooms and chestnuts, bring to a boil then simmer while cooking the veal. Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Saute the veal chops in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Allow at least 4 minutes per side for 1 1/2-inch thick chops. The veal should be cooked medium rare. Check for doneness. Parboil the vegetables in salted water for several minutes. They should be somewhat firm to retain their flavor, not too soft. Just before serving, saute the vegetables in butter, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54320,&quot;Sheet Pan London Broil with Asparagus Gribiche 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 4 cloves garlic, smashed Juice of 1 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds top round London broil steak (1/2 inch to 1 inch thick) 3 large eggs 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1 clove garlic, grated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped 2 tablespoons dried chives 1 tablespoon drained capers, roughly chopped 6 cornichons, roughly chopped 2 pounds pencil-thin asparagus, woody stems removed 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the London broil: Set a large resealable plastic bag in a medium saucepan and pull the edges of the bag over the sides of the pan for easy access to the bag. Add the olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, garlic cloves, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper to the bag and whisk to combine. Add the London broil and seal the bag tightly. Remove the bag from the pan and use your hands to rotate the meat, coating thoroughly in the marinade. Lay the bag flat on a cutting board and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, flipping the bag after 30 minutes. (The seasoned meat can also be stored in the refrigerator overnight. Let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before cooking.) For the gribiche: Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a boil over high heat. Use a large spoon to gently add the eggs. Boil for 10 minutes. Drain the eggs and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Crack, peel and roughly chop the eggs. Whisk the oil, mustard, vinegar, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Stir in the parsley, chives, capers and cornichons. Fold in the chopped eggs. Cover and set aside to marinate. (The gribiche can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; return to room temperature before using.) While the gribiche is marinating, position an oven rack about 4 inches from the heating element and preheat the broiler to high. Cover a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and place in the oven to preheat. Remove the steak from the bag and discard any stuck-on garlic cloves. Pull the preheated sheet pan from the oven and place the steak in the center. Broil until nicely charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into the center of the steak registers between 120 and 125 degrees F, 6 to 10 minutes depending on thickness. Transfer the steak to the cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. For the asparagus: While the steak rests, add the asparagus to the same sheet pan and toss with the olive oil. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Broil until the asparagus is vibrantly green and crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Divide the asparagus among plates and spoon the gribiche over the top. Thinly slice the rested steak against the grain and divide among the plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54321,&quot;Tiny Tomatoes Salad 1 pint yellow grape or pear tomatoes 1 pint red grape or pear tomatoes 1 small shallot, finely diced 2 tablespoons fresh basil chiffonade (slices) 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Halve the tomatoes and toss in a medium-size bowl with shallot, basil, olive oil, balsamic, and salt and pepper. Serves: 4 &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 54322,&quot;Crown Roast of Lamb 2 racks lamb, 6 to 8 ribs each, approximately 1 1/2 to 2-pounds each 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 6 cloves garlic, minced 4 teaspoons fresh thyme, chopped 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1/2 to 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 to 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.; To french the racks of lamb: Make a cut on the fat side of the ribs, perpendicular to them, about 2 1/2-inches down from the rib ends. Cut through the fat down to the rib bones. Turn the rack on end, with the bones facing up and push a knife through the flesh between each rib, using the initial cut as a guide for the knife. Cut down the side of each rib to remove the excess fat in between each rib. Using strong kitchen twine, wrap the twine around each rib at the base, nearest the meat and pull to remove all of the remaining fat and sinew from the rib bone. Bend each rack into a semicircle (meat side in and fat side out) and using kitchen twine tie them together at the base and center, in order to hold the racks together. The rib ends should be pushed outward to create the look of a crown. Rub the lamb with the olive oil. Combine the salt, pepper, garlic, thyme and coriander and press all over the lamb. Place the roast in a Bundt pan with the center of the pan coming up through the middle of the roast. Place on the middle rack of the oven and cook for 30 to 35 minutes, until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees F. This is approximately 8 to 12 minutes per pound. Remove from the oven, transfer the roast to a rack, cover with aluminum foil and let the meat rest for 20 minutes. While the meat is resting add the sherry vinegar, mustard and rosemary to the juices that accumulated in the Bundt pan while cooking. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning, as needed. Cut the string away from the roast and place cooked stuffing, rice or barley in the center if desired. Serve the warm sauce with the roast.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 54323,&quot;Black Cat Pops 8 ounces (about 24) dried Mission figs, stemmed and coarsely chopped 1 tablespoon creamy unsalted almond butter<br> 1 tablespoon water<br> 1/2 cup dark (53% cacao) chocolate chips<br> 1 teaspoon coconut or grapeseed oil, plus 1/2 teaspoon<br> 2 ounces white chocolate, chopped<br> Orange food coloring<br> One 4-inch piece of strawberry or raspberry fruit leather<br> Instructions: Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Set aside. In a food processor, combine the figs, almond butter and water. Blend until smooth, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed with a rubber spatula. Using a small ice-cream scoop, scoop 1 tablespoon of the fig mixture at a time and roll into 1 1/2-inch balls. Insert a lollipop stick into each fig ball. Place the chocolate chips and 1 teaspoon of the oil in a medium bowl. Place the bowl over a small saucepan of barely simmering water and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes. Drop the fig balls into the melted chocolate and, using a fork, roll to coat evenly. Remove the fig balls, allowing any excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl, and place on the baking sheet. Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until the chocolate has set. Using a small pair of scissors, cut the fruit leather into small squares to make noses for the cats and triangles for the ears. Dip the ends of the ears in the leftover dark chocolate and stick them on the cats. Repeat with the squares for the noses. Place the white chocolate and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of the oil in a medium bowl. Place the bowl over a small saucepan of barely simmering water and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer the chocolate to a piping bag fitted with a small plain tip. Pipe eyes and whiskers on the cats. Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54324,&quot;German Chocolate Cake 2 cups ice 2 ounces citrus vodka 2 ounces hazelnut liqueur (recommended: Frangelico) 1 fresh lemon wedge 1 teaspoon sugar Instructions: Fill a shaker with ice. Add vodka and hazelnut liqueur and shake to combine. Dip lemon wedge into sugar. Strain vodka and hazelnut liqueur into a snifter or lowball glass. Bite lemon with sugar, then drink from snifter. Swallow, then exhale.

In a small bowl, combine the crabmeat and chervil and toss gently. Cover and refrigerate. Dry the veal with paper towels, then place each slice between 2 pieces of waxed paper and, using a meat mallet or other blunt instrument like a small saute pan, pound to about 1/4-inch thickness. Sprinkle the veal slices generously with salt and pepper, then lay 1 slice of ham on top of each slice. Top each piece of ham with 1/8 of the crabmeat mixture. Roll up each veal slice into a fat tube and secure with 1 or more toothpicks. If you have time, place the birdies in the refrigerator for 20 minutes; this will help keep them sealed as they cook. In a large saute pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the veal, in batches if necessary to avoid crowding, and cook until browned on all sides, 3 to 4 min1utes per side; transfer the birdies to an ovenproof platter as they are done. When all the birdies are browned, turn off the oven and place the platter in the oven while you prepare the sauce. Add the capers to the pan and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Drain off the darkened butter, leaving the capers in the pan. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pan. When the butter has melted, squeeze the lemon juice over the capers. Add the parsley and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, pour the sauce over the platter of veal birds, and serve right away. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 54326,&quot;Hot and Sticky Wings 3 pounds chicken wings 1/4 cup ketchup 1 (18-ounce) jar apricot-pineapple preserves (recommended: Smuckers) 2 tablespoons citrus herb seasoning 2 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon chili seasoning 1 jalapeno, finely diced Instructions: Light broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; set aside. Rinse wings with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Place wings on baking sheet skin-side up. Broil wings for 8 to 10 minutes while preparing sauce. NOTE: this step can be omitted, but produces a better tasting wing. Place wings in the crock of 4 quart slow cooker. In a bowl, stir to combine remaining ingredients. Pour over wings and stir to coat. Place lid on slow cooker and cook on high setting for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Merlot, Malbec, Shiraz]&quot; 54327,&quot;Chestnut Stuffing Butter, for greasing the baking dish 6 cups 1/2-inch-cubed stale bread (country loaf)<br> 3 cups milk<br> 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons chopped shallots<br> 1 cup finely chopped onions<br> 1/3 cup finely chopped peeled carrots<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped celery<br> 1 egg, beaten<br> 2 fresh sage leaves, chopped<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley<br> 1 rind of a medium orange, grated<br> 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups cooked chestnuts, peeled and quartered<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Soak the stale bread in the milk in a large bowl for 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, onions, carrots and celery and cook 10 minutes until wilted. Drain the milk from the bread by pressing with your hands. Add the bread to a large bowl, then add the sauteed vegetables, egg, sage, parsley, grated orange rind and 1/2 cup of the grated cheese. Season with salt and pepper and mix until all the ingredients are incorporated and the stuffing is well blended. Add the chestnuts and mix well. Spoon into the prepared baking dish and shake into place with a rubber spatula. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle on the remaining 1/2 cup grated cheese and cook an additional 20 minutes or until crispy on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54328,&quot;Bayonne Gougere 1 cup milk 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup flour 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1/4 pound Gruyere cheese, grated 1/4 pound Jambon de Bayonne, finely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large saucepan, combine the milk, butter, salt, and black pepper over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, add the flour, and with a wooden spoon, stir briskly for about 1 minute to incorporate. Return to the heat and continue stirring for 1 minute, over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the cheese and ham and beat until it is incorporated and a slightly soft dough forms. Drop the dough by the spoonful onto the prepared baking sheet to form a ring (about 12 to 14 spoonfuls. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve warm on a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54329,&quot;Brown Sugar Custard with Strawberry Compote, Whipped Creme Fraiche and Almond Honeycomb 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 vanilla bean pod, seeds scraped 4 large egg yolks 1/3 cup light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 24 ounces fresh strawberries, hulled and halved 3/4 cup granulated sugar Pinch ground cloves Pinch kosher salt 1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract Juice of 1/2 lemon 1/2 cup creme fraiche Fresh mint, for garnish 1/4 cup sliced almonds 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 2 tablespoons honey Pinch kosher salt 2 teaspoons baking soda Instructions: For the custard: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Combine the cream and vanilla seeds in a small saucepan and cook until it reaches 180 degrees F or tiny bubbles form on the side of the pot. Combine the egg yolks, brown sugar and salt in a large bowl and whisk until light and smooth in color. Slowly add the hot cream mixture to the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent the yolks from overcooking. Transfer the custard to a large measuring cup or pitcher, then divide it among four 8-ounce mason jars, filling about two-thirds of the way full. Place them in a deep baking dish. Fill the baking dish with hot water, coming about halfway up the sides of the jars. Cover the jars with aluminum foil and transfer to the oven; bake until the custard jiggles like gelatin when the jars are tapped, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, uncover and transfer to the refrigerator to chill until set, about 1 hour and up to overnight. Alternatively, place in the freezer for 25 to 30 minutes. For the compote: Prepare an ice bath and set aside. Combine the strawberries, granulated sugar, cloves, salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a medium saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until the strawberries are soft, the liquid is syrupy and the bubbles are thick and slow, about 20 minutes. Cool down completely over the ice bath. (The compote will thicken as it cools.) Finish with the lemon juice. For the honeycomb candy: Line a baking dish with parchment paper. Spread the almonds in an even layer on a second baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly golden and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup, honey, salt and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepot. Whisk the solution together gently and wipe the sides of the pot down with water so it does not have any sugar crystals stuck to it. Heat the solution over medium heat until it reaches 300 degrees F on a candy thermometer, 10 to 12 minutes. Fold in the almonds and whisk in the baking soda. Immediately pour the mixture out into the lined baking dish, using a rubber spatula to smooth into an even layer. Let cool completely, about 45 minutes. Cut the honeycomb into sticks or break into shards. In a medium bowl, whisk to combine the creme fraiche with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. Place a large spoonful of the strawberry compote on top of each custard and top with a dollop of the whipped creme fraiche. Stick a shard or stick of the honeycomb into each and garnish with the fresh mint.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 54330,&quot;Oven-Roasted Crab \Buon Natale<br> 4 (1 to 1 1/2 pound) Dungeness crabs or 2 (2 pound) crabs, cooked, cleaned (reserve juices and tomalley) Reserved tomalley 1 teaspoon chili flakes 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 5 garlic cloves, minced 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Reserved crab juices 1 cup mayonnaise or aioli 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 1/4 pound butter (1 stick) 4 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons lemon zest (about 4 to 5 lemons) 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3 tablespoons roughly chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley Lemon slices or wedges, for garnish 4 to 8 slices crusty bread, toasted, rubbed with garlic cloves and drizzled with olive oil Instructions: Crack the crab reserving the juices and tomalley. Set aside. Make the tomalley sauce by pushing the tomalley through a sieve with a wooden spoon into a small pot. Add the chili flakes, thyme, garlic, and lemon juice. Mix in the reserved crab juices and bring to a quick simmer over low heat. Give it a final quick stir and remove the pan from the heat. Pour the tomalley mixture into a small mixing bowl and allow it to cool. (Start roasting the crab once the tomalley sauce is cooling.) As soon as the tomalley sauce feels lukewarm to the touch, add the mayonnaise or aioli along with the salt and pepper. Taste and add more salt, pepper, or thyme, if you like. Put a rack in the middle or lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. On the stove, in a large oven-proof saute pan or casserole, heat the butter, olive oil, garlic, thyme, and lemon zest over medium-high heat until hot. Add crab pieces and season with salt, pepper, to taste, and mix well. Put the pan in the oven and cook until the crab is hot throughout and the garlic is golden brown. (Watch carefully; the crab heats very quickly and at 500 degrees F the garlic can burn easily.) Remove the crab from the oven, drizzle with 4 tablespoons of lemon juice and scatter the parsley over the top. To serve, stack the crab on a platter and drizzle with the tomalley sauce or serve the tomalley sauce in a small bowl and allow your guests to help themselves. Garnish the platter with lemon wedges and slices of garlic-rubbed toast.

Make the topping: Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl. Work in the butter with your fingers or a pastry blender until the mixture looks like coarse meal with some pea-size lumps. Add the cream and stir with a fork until combined. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead 4 or 5 times to bring the dough together. Pat into a 1/2-inch-thick round, then use a 1 1/2-to-2-inch cookie cutter to cut out biscuits. Pat the scraps together and cut out more biscuits. Put the biscuits on a baking sheet and chill until ready to use. Make the filling: Melt the butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the peaches, flour, honey, lemon juice, lemon zest, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg and cook, stirring occasionally, until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Stir in the raspberries, then arrange the biscuits on top. Brush the biscuits with cream and sprinkle lightly with sugar. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the fruit is bubbling and the biscuits are cooked through, about 25 minutes. (If the biscuits are browning too quickly, cover loosely with foil.)

Refrigerate, changing the soaking water 2 or 3 times, until softened (12 to 24 hours, depending on how stiff it was to begin with). Drain the cod, place it in a large saucepan with the onion and the bay leaves, and cover with cold water. Bring just to a boil, reduce the heat to very low, and cover (taste the water at this stage and, if it seems excessively salty, then drain, cover again with fresh cold water, and bring to a boil). Simmer very gently until the fish is opaque and plumped, and falls apart into heavy flakes when prodded, about 20 minutes. Drain, pat dry, and remove the bones and skin, if necessary. Separate into large flakes and use right away, or refrigerate for up to 2 days before continuing with the recipe. In a large saucepan of lightly salted boiling water, cook the potatoes whole for about 20 minutes, or until they are tender but not falling apart. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, peel and cut into 1/4 inch slices. In a large heavy skillet, heat 1/3 cup of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion rings and, stirring frequently, cook until they are softened and translucent but not browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and remove from the heat. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. In a heavy saucepan, reduce the wine by half over medium high heat. Add the fish stock and again reduce by half, then add the cream and reduce by 1/3, so that you have about 2 cups liquid remaining. Pour this liquid into an earthenware or ceramic casserole about 8 inches in diameter with 4 inch sides. Spread half of the potatoes in the bottom of the casserole, cover them with half of the cod and half of the onions, using a slotted spoon to transfer the onions. Scatter half of the olives over the first layer. Repeat the layer with the remaining potatoes, cod, onions, and olives. In a small bowl, toss the cheese, bread crumbs, black pepper, and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil together, then distribute this mixture evenly over the casserole. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is golden and crisp. If desired, run the dish under a hot broiler briefly to crisp the topping even more. Scatter the parsley over the top and serve directly from the casserole. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 54338,&quot;Classic Greek Salad Topped with Grilled Calamari Skewers 20 wooden skewers 10 small whole calamari, cleaned, tentacles removed 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for grilling 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 4 garlic cloves, chopped 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon fresh oregano 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves 1 lemon, juiced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tomatoes, seeded and cut into chunks 1 medium red onion, sliced thin 1 medium cucumber, sliced thin 1/2 pound feta cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup kalamata olives, pitted 1 head romaine lettuce, torn into bite size pieces Lemon wedges, for garnish Fresh oregano leaves, for garnish Instructions: Soak 20 wooden skewers in water for about 20 minutes.

Original Bar-B-Q Sauce, plus more for serving<br> One 1 1/2- to 2-pound flank steak 2 tablespoons roasted garlic and herb seasoning, such as McCormick? Grill Mates? Roasted Garlic and Herb Seasoning<br> 6 scallions, trimmed and halved lengthwise Instructions: For the rice: Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the turmeric and cook, stirring, until toasted, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and stir to coat. Add 1 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a low simmer, cover and cook until all of the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the mayonnaise and garlic. Adjust the seasoning with salt and let cool completely. Set aside. Prepare a grill for direct and indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the side burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling. For the peppers and plantains: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium flameproof skillet over the direct-heat side of the grill until hot and shimmering. Add the peppers and cook until softened, about 5 minutes; set aside. Add the plantain halves cut-side down and cook, flipping once, until golden and caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. Let cool, then cut one of the plantain pieces in half lengthwise to make 3 strips total. Set aside.<br> For the beans: Put the beans and 2 tablespoons of the barbecue sauce in a small bowl. Add a pinch of salt and squish the beans with your hands until broken down enough to hold together but not completely a paste. Set aside.<br> For the flank steak: Set the flank steak on a cutting board with a short end facing you. Starting at one long side, slice the steak in half horizontally, leaving 2 inches at the opposite long side uncut so the pieces stay together. Open up the steak like a book so you have 1 big piece. Pound the steak with a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Sprinkle both sides of the steak with the roasted garlic and herb seasoning.<br> Position the steak vertically in front of you so the short ends are at the top and bottom of the cutting board. Pat the rice into an even layer all over the steak. Starting a third of the way in from the left side of the steak, lay down one plantain strip vertically on the steak. Moving right, line up 4 scallions next to it, followed by a third of the peppers and a third of the beans. Repeat 2 more times with the remaining ingredients, starting with a plantain strip and ending with the beans. Starting at one of the long ends, roll the steak around the filling like a jelly roll. Tie closed at 1-inch intervals around the circumference with kitchen twine. Tie 1 more piece of twine lengthwise around the meat to secure it. Coat the meat evenly with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the steak on the direct-heat side of the grill to brown all 4 sides, about 10 minutes total. Move the steak to the indirect-heat side of the grill, cover the grill and cook, turning occasionally and basting with the remaining 1/4 cup barbecue sauce during the last 5 minutes of grilling; cook, testing the temperature frequently, until the very center registers 115 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer for a steak that is well done on the outside and medium rare in the center, about 30 minutes more. Transfer the steak to a cutting board to rest for 15 minutes. Untie the steak and slice on a slight bias into 6 thick slices. Serve with more barbecue sauce on the side.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 54343,&quot;Grilled Breakfast Pizza with Sausage Gravy 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for the pizzas and oiling the grill 1 pound bulk breakfast sausage 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 1/2 cups whole milk Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound frozen pizza dough, thawed 8 ounces sharp white Cheddar, shredded (about 3 heaping cups) 4 large eggs 2 scallions, thinly sliced Hot sauce, for serving Instructions: Prepare an outdoor grill for cooking over medium heat. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, and use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a plate.<br> Reserving 2 tablespoons of drippings in the skillet (drain or add oil as needed), return it to medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture becomes loose and turns a light tan color, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Simmer, whisking frequently, until the sauce has thickened to the consistency of thin gravy, 6 to 8 minutes. Return the cooked sausage to the skillet and stir. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside.<br> Divide the pizza dough into 4 balls. Dust a clean flat work surface with flour, and roll each ball into an 8-inch circle. Transfer the dough circles to the prepared baking sheet, and brush both sides with oil.<br> Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the crusts until they start to puff and distinct grill marks appear on the underside, about 1 minute. Flip. Evenly divide the Cheddar among the crusts, leaving a small well empty in the center of each. Immediately crack 1 egg into each well. Grill, covered, until the whites have completely set and the Cheddar has melted, 8 to 10 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, reheat the sausage gravy if needed. Remove the pizzas from the grill and drizzle each with a couple spoonfuls of warm gravy. Garnish with the scallions.

Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles wet sand. Add the cream cheese and pulse until the dough comes together in large clumps. Place the dough on a floured surface and gently knead two or three times, just enough to incorporate the cream cheese. Form the dough into an oval disk, place in a plastic bag and chill, 15 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll the dough into a rectangle, about 15-by-10-inches. Cut the dough with a sharp knife into 6 squares, about 5-inches each. Beat 1 teaspoon water and the egg in a small bowl, to make an egg wash. Fill each dough square with about 2 teaspoons applesauce. Use your fingertips to moisten the dough edges with a little water. Fold the dough over to create a triangle. Use your fingers to press the dough gently together, then crimp the seal with a fork. Brush the tops of the triangles with the egg wash. Sprinkle the egg washed-tops with the cinnamon sugar. Place the triangles on a baking sheet lined with parchment and bake until the triangles are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Be careful, the filling will be hot, so cool the empanadas about 15 minutes before eating. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54346,&quot;Kardea&#39;s Caramel Apple Cake Nonstick cooking spray or unsalted butter, for greasing the pan 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan<br> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 3 medium apples (I used a mix of green and Pink Lady apples)<br> 1 1/2 cups vegetable or canola oil<br> 2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup dark brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 large eggs<br> One 11-ounce package caramels, preferably Kraft Caramels 1/4 cup whole milk<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Mix until the cereal is completely coated. Using a scant 1/4 cup measure, roll the rice and marshmallow mixture into golf ball-size balls. Be sure to compress the cereal mixture tightly. Skewer a lollipop stick through the center of the ball. Repeat with remaining mixture and sticks. Melt the chocolate over a double boiler. Dip each cake pop into the melted chocolate. Remove and allow any excess to drip off, spinning slightly, to coat completely. Stick the pops into a piece of floral foam or a bowl full of rice to stand upright so that the chocolate can set up slightly. Let sit 5 minutes. Dip the top half of each pop into the sprinkles. Place the sticks back in the foam or rice and place in the refrigerator to set up completely, or allow to set for several hours at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 54363,&quot;Onion Soup Mix Turkey One 15-pound turkey One 2-ounce packet onion soup mix 1 stick (8 tablespoons) salted butter, softened 2 cups turkey or chicken broth 1 small onion, peeled and quartered 1 lemon, cut into eighths 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 to 4 cups chicken broth Kosher salt, optional Instructions: For the turkey: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey (reserve for another use) and place the turkey breast-side up in a roasting pan. Remove 1 tablespoon of the onion soup mix and mix with the butter. With your fingers, gently loosen the skin of the turkey breast and rub the butter under the skin. Sprinkle the remaining soup mix all over the turkey and gently rub. Pour the broth into the bottom of the roasting pan. Place the onion and lemon in the cavity of the turkey. Roast for 12 to 15 minutes per pound, basting occasionally and tenting the turkey if it starts to get too brown, until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 3 hours to 3 hours 45 minutes. Remove the turkey to a platter and loosely tent with foil while you make the gravy. For the gravy: Pour off all of the drippings into a bowl or fat separator. Return the roasting pan to low heat. Add in about 1/3 cup or so of the fatty drippings and discard the rest of the fat, saving the remaining liquid. Sprinkle in the flour and cook, stirring, until the flour is incorporated and bubbly, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the roasting liquid and bring to a simmer. Add enough of the chicken broth to reach the desired consistency and volume. Simmer until slightly thickened, a few minutes. Taste before adding any salt, as the onion soup mix is salty. Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54364,&quot;Dulce de Leche Coffee Cake with Pumpkin Pie Spice Crumbs 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice Pinch of fine salt 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more, for the pan 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup sour cream 2/3 cup dulce de leche Instructions: Combine the flour, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice and salt in a small bowl and mix well. Add the butter and mix thoroughly with your fingers or a fork until all of the butter has been evenly distributed and incorporated into the flour. Form into small to medium clumps with your fingers. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Beat together the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour, beating until just incorporated. Spoon half of the cake batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula. Sprinkle half of the crumb topping over the batter. Spoon the remaining cake batter on top and smooth the top. Sprinkle on the remaining crumb topping. Drizzle the dulce de leche over the top. Bake until the cake and topping are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan 20 minutes, then invert onto a plate; invert back onto a rack to cool completely.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 54365,&quot;Turkey Burgers with Mango Slaw 1 pound ground turkey 1 tablespoon jerk seasoning, plus more for sprinkling 1 small green apple, peeled and grated 1/2 cup finely chopped scallions 1/4 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup mayonnaise, plus more for brushing 1/4 cup mango chutney, roughly chopped 3 cups shredded green cabbage 1 carrot, shredded Canola oil, for the grill 4 hamburger buns or challah rolls, split Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high. Mix the turkey, jerk seasoning, apple, 1/4 cup scallions and the panko in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Form into four 1-inch-thick patties and make a small indentation in the middle of each with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up on the grill. Refrigerate. Whisk the mayonnaise and chutney in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, carrot and the remaining 1/4 cup scallions, season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Brush the grill with canola oil. Grill the turkey patties until browned and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Brush the cut sides of the buns with mayonnaise and sprinkle with jerk seasoning; toast on the grill, about 30 seconds. Serve the burgers and slaw on the buns. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 54366,&quot;Shoestring Potatoes with Garlic Mayo Canola oil, for frying 3 large Idaho potatoes, peeled 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1 tablespoon lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 365 degrees F. Line a sheet tray with paper towels.<br> Cut the potatoes using the thin julienne attachment of a mandolin. Rinse the potatoes in water, then spin dry in a salad spinner. Make sure the potatoes are dry so they don&#39;t spatter in the hot oil. Fry in batches until crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the cooked fries with a slotted spoon and drain on the prepared sheet tray. Season with salt immediately. Make sure the oil heats back to 365 degrees F between batches of fries. Repeat for the remaining potatoes.<br> In a bowl, mix the mayonnaise, garlic and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with the fries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 54367,&quot;Linguine with Tuna Puttanesca Kosher salt 12 ounces linguine 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 2 tablespoons capers, drained 1/2 cup roughly chopped kalamata olives One 28-ounce can San Marzano tomatoes 4 basil leaves, torn, plus more for garnish One 5-ounce can albacore tuna packed in olive oil Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the linguine and cook until al dente. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring, until slightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the capers and olives and fry 2 more minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the skillet with your hands and reserve the juices. Cook until the tomatoes are slightly dry, about 2 minutes. Add the reserved tomato juices, the basil, and salt to taste and cook until the sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tuna with its oil, breaking it up with a fork, and season with salt. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water, and return it to the pot. Add the sauce and the reserved cooking water and toss. Season with black pepper and garnish with more basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54368,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Beer Battered Moroccan Asparagus with Dip 2 cups flour 1 tablespoon Moroccan spice blend Zest of 1 lemon Kosher salt 12 ounces beer 1 bunch thin asparagus Vegetable or peanut oil, for frying Chilled Moroccan Spice Dip, recipe follows 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup grated onion pulp, made with the biggest side of box grater 1/4 cup loosely packed chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons sour cream 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons Moroccan spice blend Kosher salt Instructions: Add 1 cup of the flour to each baking dish. Set one aside for your dredging station. In the other add the spice blend, lemon zest and a nice pinch of salt, and whisk. Slowly stir in the beer until the batter thickens to a pancake consistency. If there is a sip of beer leftover, don&#39;t waste it, drink it! Rest the batter for 5 minutes. Fill a large pot 3- to 4-inches deep with oil and heat until a deep-fry thermometer reaches 350 degrees F. To fry, first dredge the asparagus in the flour, then shake off lightly and run through the batter. Immediately and gently lower the asparagus into the oil. Fry until the batter is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Cook in batches to avoid overloading the pot, which reduces the overall temperature of the oil. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat for the remaining asparagus. Serve warm with the chilled Moroccan Spice Dip. In a medium bowl stir together the mayonnaise, onion pulp, parsley, sour cream, lemon juice and spice blend. Taste the dip and season with a pinch of salt, if needed. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 54369,&quot;Couscous and Zucchini 10 ounces couscous 2 cups boiling water 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 zucchini, diced 1 tablespoon green onion, sliced 2 tablespoons mint, sliced thin Salt Instructions: Add couscous to boiling water, remove from heat and cover.

Gently fold in the dry ingredients. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag set with plain tip. Pipe into rings on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 54371,&quot;Aarti&#39;s Hot (not heavy!) Homemade Garam Masala 1/4 cup green cardamom pods, shelled, husks discarded (about 2 tablespoons of seeds) 3 tablespoons whole cloves 4 large black cardamom pods, shelled, husks discarded (about 1 tablespoon of seeds), optional 3 large cinnamon sticks (if you have the kind you get at Indian stores, it&#39;s about 3 tablespoons of cinnamon bark bits) Instructions: Add the green cardamom seeds, cloves, black cardamom seeds and cinnamon sticks to a spice/coffee grinder and grind until fine. Store in an airtight container away from direct sunlight. Most garam masalas contain cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and black peppercorns. Some folks add cumin and coriander, but I don&#39;t like the earthy flavour they add. And in fact, if you buy yours at the supermarket, it will not only contain cumin and coriander, it will also contain a bunch of other things. HOWEVER, it probably won&#39;t contain very much cardamom, cloves or cinnamon. That&#39;s because... those are the expensive ones! So what you&#39;re buying is a lot of stale filler! I have nothing against it in a pinch, or if you&#39;re just starting out and don&#39;t know if this spice blend is for you... but if you can&#39;t find it at the supermarket, or if you&#39;re ready for the real thing, try my version. I don&#39;t use black peppercorns, but if you like, you can add a teaspoon or so. It doesn&#39;t take very long to make a batch; the only thing that&#39;s annoying about it is getting all the little black seeds out of the green cardamom pods. Use a pestle to crush the little beauties open, and discard the husks, or simply buy the seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Gewrztraminer, Riesling, Garnacha]&quot; 54372,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Mango Margarita Salsa 3 mangos, peeled and chopped 1/2 cup chopped red onion<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br> 1 red jalapeno or serrano pepper, seeded and finely chopped<br> 1 scallion, finely chopped (both white and green parts)<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons margarita mix<br> Instructions: Add the mangoes, red onion, cilantro, jalapeno, scallion and 1 tablespoon margarita mix to a large bowl.

In a small bowl, combine the butter and cocoa to make \cocoa butter. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on the pan and brush with cocoa butter. Sprinkle evenly with 2 tablespoons of sugar, then place another sheet of phyllo on top. Brush with cocoa butter, sprinkle with sugar, lay another sheet of phyllo on top, brush with cocoa butter, and sprinkle with sugar. Cover the stack with parchment paper. Place another pan on top to weight it down. Then place another, empty sheet pan on the very top. (This is to keep the phyllo from buckling during baking). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the phyllo is dark brown. It&#39;s very difficult to tell, as it&#39;s so chocolate-y looking as it is. Remove the whole stack of sheet pans and let cool (do not unstack the pans). To assemble the dessert, break the phyllo up into random pieces about 3-inches square. Place a dab of mascarpone on each of 4 plates and press 1 phyllo piece down on it. Spoon on a heaping tablespoon of mascarpone in the center and surround it with raspberries. Place another phyllo piece on top and repeat, topping off with a final phyllo piece.

Place the tomatoes in the skillet with the vegetable oil, salt and pepper, and honey or sugar. Arrange together as tightly as possible. Sprinkle the tomatoes with the bread crumbs - this will soak up some of the juice which come out of the tomatoes during cooking. On a well-floured counter, roll out a circle of puff pastry the same size as the top of the skillet. Place the puff pastry over the tomatoes, tucking it around them so the tomatoes are encased. Brush the pastry with the lightly beaten egg on the top only. It does seem a bit pointless, as this will be the underneath of the tart, but I like that bit of extra crunch that it adds to the pastry and it looks so much more presentable for that minute before you turn it upside down! Bake in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the puff pastry is well puffed and golden brown. Remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes, then tip away the excess liquid (if any) and put a large plate upside down on top of the skillet. Using oven gloves, press the plate down hard and then quickly flip the whole thing so the skillet is upside down and the plate is on the bottom. I do this over the sink because there is usually some leakage! Remove the skillet. Once the tart is cold, rip up some basil or mint leaves and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Add salt and pepper if required. Serve cold with cold meats, cheeses, olives, or salads. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 54382,&quot;Spiced Apple Cake Unsalted butter, for buttering the baking pan 6 small Granny Smith apples, peeled and sliced<br> 1/3 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 4 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup almond flour<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, at room temperature<br> 3 tablespoons powdered sugar Instructions: For the apples: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Whisk the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla until smooth in a 1-quart measure. Pour into the dry ingredients, and whisk until creamy. Cover and let stand while you prepare the apples. For the apple mixture: Quarter each apple, then peel, core, and slice each quarter crosswise 1/8-inch thick, letting the slices fall into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar mixture and lemon juice and toss well. Melt the butter in a heavy 12-inch skillet over moderate heat, then let it foam up and subside. Add the apple mixture and saute 2 minutes, stirring often. Pour in the water, reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook 5 minutes. Uncover, raise the heat to moderate and boil, uncovered, shaking the skillet often, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, just until all juices boil away. Scoop the skillet mixture into a 1-quart measure and reserve. Preheat the oven to 150 to 200 degrees F. To cook the pancakes: Generously oil the bottom and sides of a well-seasoned 10-inch omelet pan or spray with nonstick vegetable cooking spray and set over moderate heat for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat, pour in a scant 1/3 cup of the pancake batter, and tilt the pan first to 1 side, then to another, until the batter coats the bottom of the pan in a thin, even layer. Set the pan on a hot pad on the counter, then by hand, arrange 1/2 cup of the apple slices on top of the batter in the pan, distributing them as evenly as possible. Pour in another scant 1/3 cup batter, covering the apples as uniformly as possible. Tilt the pan gently to distribute the batter more evenly, if necessary. Set the skillet over moderate heat and cook the pancake, uncovered for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low and cook, uncovered, 2 minutes longer, until the pancake has dried around the edge and holes begin to appear on top. Spray a small, thin-bladed spatula with the cooking spray, carefully loosen the pancake around the edge, then shake the pan over the heat several times until the pancake moves freely. Quickly spray a large, flat round plate with the cooking spray and ease the pancake onto it right side up. Using potholders to protect your fingers, invert the omelet pan on the plate, then invert once again so the pancake is in the pan uncooked side down. Set over moderate heat and cook the pancake, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Slide onto a large round, ovenproof plate, cover with foil, and set in the warm oven. Cook the remaining pancakes the same way, recoating the skillet with cooking spray before each new pancake. As each new pancake finishes cooking, slide on top of the foil-covered pancake, top with more foil and return to the warm oven. When ready to serve, slide each pancake onto a heated plate and dust with vanilla sugar. Broiler method: Set the broiler rack 6 to 7 inches below the heating element and preheat the broiler. Follow the basic recipe, but be sure that the omelet pan or skillet you use has a flameproof handle. As soon as a pancake has browned 3 minutes in the skillet on top of the stove, transfer to the broiler and broil 3 to 3 1/2 minutes, until nicely tipped with brown. Carefully loosen the pancake around the edge with a spatula, ease right side up onto a large round plate, cover with foil, and keep warm. Cook the 3 remaining pancakes the same way. Dust with sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54395,&quot;Bananas Foster Cheesecake Topping 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> 2 to 4 bananas, depending on size, sliced on the bias<br> 1/2 cup dark rum<br> 12 mini cheesecakes Instructions: Place a skillet over medium heat and melt the butter.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 54405,&quot;Ricotta 4 quarts whole cow&#39;s milk 2 cups goat&#39;s milk 2 cups heavy cream (preferably not ultra pasteurized) 5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Instructions: Put both milks, the cream, and the lemon juice into a large nonreactive saucepan or stew pot. Turn the heat to low and bring to 194 degrees using a candy thermometer, making sure it does not touch the bottom or sides of the saucepan or pot. This will take about 2 hours. Line strainer or small colander with cheese cloth. When curds form on the surface of the liquid, remove them with a skimmer or slotted spoon and transfer to the strainer. Increase the heat to medium and after 8 minutes, skim some more, until all the curds are removed and only milky liquid remains. Leave the curds to drain for 1 hour, then transfer them to container and refrigerate. Fresh homemade ricotta will stay fresh for about 4 days in the refrigerator and may be used in recipes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54406,&quot;Homemade Fromage Blanc 2 quarts whole milk, as fresh as possible 1 cup heavy cream (optional) 2 cups fresh buttermilk 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, strained 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt, if desired Heavy Cream, for serving Instructions: In a large, heavy saucepan, add the milk and the cream for a richer fromage blanc. In a mixing bowl, combine the buttermilk and lemon juice and stir to combine well. Add the buttermilk-lemon juice mixture to the milk and begin to heat the milk, over low heat and very slowly, to 175 degrees F. While the milk is heating, stir only twice, making 2 strokes each time, with a heat-proof spatula or other flat utensil. Check the temperature often. As soon as the temperature reaches 175 degrees F, remove the pot from the heat and allow to sit, undisturbed, for 10 minutes. Line a large colander with 2 layers of fine cheesecloth and set over a large bowl. Gently ladle the curds and whey into the colander and allow to drain until the drips of whey slows, about 2 minutes. Tie the corners of the cheesecloth together to form a hanging pouch, and hang pouch over a bowl and allow to drain until the cheese reaches the desired consistency. Serve as is, with preserves, honey or fresh fruit, or add salt or fresh herbs, to taste, and enjoy as a savory appetizer. If a rich cheese is desired, spoon or pour a bit of heavy cream over the top before serving. Also, if a very smooth product is desired, beat the cheese briefly with an electric mixer before serving. Refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 1 week. If cheese is marinated in oil with fresh herbs, it will keep, refrigerated, for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 54407,&quot;Do It Yourself Chocolate Sculpture 16 ounces white chocolate, tempered 32 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered Cocoa butter, melted Powdered food coloring Instructions: For the Base: Using an offset spatula, spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate over a sheet of bubble wrap, making sure to create a big enough base to support the rest of your design. When that has set, repeat the procedure using bittersweet chocolate. Let the chocolate set slightly. If you want to trim the outside edge to a specific shape, use a paring knife to make that cut before the chocolate has set completely. When the chocolate is set, peel off the bubble wrap.<br> For the Tube: Cut a piece of acetate the length and width of the tube you would like to make, and set it on your work surface. Make cocoa butter paint by mixing cocoa butter with powdered food coloring to desired consistency, and place it in a shallow dish. Dip the stenciled paint roller in the cocoa butter paint and roll onto the acetate. When the paint has set, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate over the painted acetate paper. Roll the acetate into a tube so the acetate is on the outside and tape it closed. Set aside and allow the chocolate to set. When the chocolate has set, remove the acetate. If you need to trim the tube to fit your presentation, heat a chef&#39;s knife and let the heat of the knife cut the chocolate. Do not apply pressure or your tube will break.<br> For the Dome: Coat the inside of your dome mold with cocoa butter paint. When the chocolate has set, use a ladle to fill the mold with white chocolate. (It will make an interesting marbled effect if you spread the chocolate around with your fingers.) When the mold is full, empty the chocolate back into the bowl. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the mold clean and place it upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip of the mold clean again with a paring knife. This is important because when the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. When the chocolate has set, unmold it by gently pressing on one side of the chocolate. The chocolate should release easily. For the Textured Plastic: Cut shapes from heavy textured plastic. Spread chocolate all the way to the edge of the plastic and let it set. When it has set, carefully peel the plastic away from the chocolate and set aside. You can make textured chocolate triangles by using a sharp paring knife to cut out triangles when the chocolate is partially set. Tile the triangles so they overlap slightly and use chocolate to \glue\ them together. If trimming is necessary, use a hot chef&#39;s knife to \cut\ the chocolate.<br> For the Sea Sponge: Using sea sponge dipped in cocoa butter paint, sponge paint onto an acetate sheet. Another method is to spread white chocolate onto an acetate sheet, let it set, then sponge paint on top of the chocolate.<br> For the Marbled Chocolate Box: Using a spoon, drizzle white and bittersweet chocolate inside a plastic box. Use your fingers to spread the chocolate and create a marbled effect. Using a ladle, fill the box with white chocolate, and when it&#39;s full, empty it back into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the box should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the plastic box clean and place the box upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip of the box clean again with a paring knife. This is important because when the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden.<br> If you are very adventurous, you can give the molded box an interesting finish by using a paint spray gun instead, however the spray gun must be unused. Start by placing the mold in the freezer for 10 minutes. Mix equal parts of cocoa butter and melted chocolate together and strain the mixture. Pour it into the spray gun container, making sure it is very warm. Remove the mold from the freezer and use the spray gun to \paint\ the outside of the mold. How to Temper Chocolate (From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache]&quot; 54408,&quot;Chicken, Fig, and Pancetta Bites 12 fresh or dried figs, split 2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins or boneless, skinless chicken thighs A drizzle balsamic vinegar A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper 24 slices pancetta, available at deli counter 1 package 3 or 4-inch wooden party picks Instructions: If using fresh figs proceed to the preheat instructions.

Add cheese, hot dog, pastrami and top with sauerkraut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54427,&quot;Swiss Roll 4 eggs 4 1/2 ounces caster sugar (superfine), plus 3 tablespoons for sprinkling or use icing sugar (confectioners&#39;), for dusting 2 tablespoons warm water 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour 6 tablespoons raspberry or strawberry jam 8 ounces heavy cream, whipped Instructions: Despite appearances, Swiss rolls are in fact very simple to make. The cake itself has no butter in it, so you can feel justified in spreading it with lashings of jam and whipped cream. Use any kind of jam you like; apricot or blackberry, for instance, would do just as well as raspberry or strawberry. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Line the base of a 10 by 15-inches Swiss roll or jelly roll pan with greaseproof or parchment paper. Brush the base and sides of the pan with melted butter, and dust with flour.<br> In a large bowl or in an electric food mixer, whisk the eggs, and sugar together, until light and fluffy, and then add the water, and vanilla extract.<br> Sift in the flour, about a third at a time, and using a large metal spoon, fold it into the egg mixture.<br> Pour the mixture gently into the prepared pan, and bake in the oven until the center of the cake is slightly springy and the edges have shrunk a little from the sides of the tin, about 12 to 15 minutes.<br> Spread out a piece of parchment paper (slightly larger than the tin in size) on a work surface and sprinkle evenly with caster sugar (this stops the roll from sticking to the paper). Turn or invert the pan onto the sugared parchment paper, and then carefully remove the tin and parchment paper from the bottom of the cake.<br> Place a slightly damp, clean tea or kitchen towel over the cake while it cools- this will prevent it from drying out and cracking when you roll it.<br> When the cake is cool, spread the jam sparingly over the cake, leaving a 1-inch border. Repeat with the whipped cream. With the longest side facing you, roll up the Swiss roll away from you, then transfer to a plate to serve. Sprinkle the cake with caster sugar or dust with icing sugar to finish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54428,&quot;Chocolate Cake 1 3/4 cups all purpose flour 2 cups sugar 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa 1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1 cup milk 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup boiling water Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Add the bell pepper, garlic, shallot, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook until the bell pepper is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan; cook until mostly evaporated, about 1 minute. Add the heavy cream and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes; discard the thyme. Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree; season with salt and pepper and add up to 1 more teaspoon vinegar, if needed. Preheat a grill to high and generously oil the grates. Rub the fish with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Rub the asparagus with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the fish skin-side down until the skin is marked and crisp, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip and grill until just cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes. Grill the asparagus, turning occasionally, until charred in spots, 4 to 5 minutes. Spoon the pepper sauce onto plates. Top with the fish and asparagus; sprinkle with the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 54430,&quot;Coffee Compuestas 12 (4-inch) flour tortillas Vegetable oil, for frying 3 tablespoons instant espresso powder 2 teaspoons hot water 2 cups mascarpone 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons sugar 2 cups mixed berries or other fruit cut into bite-sized bits Instructions: Cut the tortillas to approximately 4-inch diameter circles (it&#39;s a good idea to put them on a cutting board and, using a plate as a template, slice around the tortilla with the tip of a sharp paring knife). Spread the tortillas on a dry surface for about 2 hours to let them dry; this will prevent them from splattering. In a skillet or electric fryer, heat 1-inch of oil to 375 degrees F. If you do not have a thermometer, wait until the surface of the oil begins to shimmer -- if it smokes, it&#39;s too hot. Drop a tortilla into the hot oil and hold it submerged with a pair of tongs for 20 seconds. Continue to fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it turns golden brown and floats to the top of the oil, surrounded by a thin ring of tiny bubbles. Flip the tortilla over and fry for 30 seconds to tan the other side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. In a bowl, dissolve the espresso powder in 2 teaspoons of hot water. Mix the mascarpone and confectioners&#39; sugar and fold in the dissolved espresso powder with a rubber spatula. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Place the tortillas on an ungreased cookie sheet. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkle the sugar mix over the fried tortillas. Bake for 4 minutes or until the sugar just melts. Just before serving, spread the flavored mascarpone on 6 of the tortillas. Arrange the berries or fruit on the mascarpone and place the remaining tortillas on top, sugared side up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54431,&quot;Pancetta and Escarole Baked Pasta 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes One 28-ounce can whole plum tomatoes, crushed by hand One 15-ounce can whole plum tomatoes, crushed by hand 4 large sprigs fresh basil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 pound diced pancetta 1/2 head escarole, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 pound dried penne 3 cups shredded mozzarella 1 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Mix the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and 1 tablespoon of the Dijon in a small bowl or measuring cup. Pour the marinade over the mushrooms, flipping to make sure each is coated. Let marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature. While the mushrooms are marinating, prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates with olive oil, then place the shallots on the grill and grill on both sides until they are softened, charred around the edges and have grill marks, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove the shallots to a plate or work surface. Next add the split rolls to the grill, cut-side down. Grill, in batches if necessary, until they have grill marks, 45 to 60 seconds, then remove to a platter or work surface. Place the mushrooms stem-side down on the grill. Cook until the mushrooms start to develop grill marks and soften and brown all over the bottom, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip the mushrooms and cook until browned and softened on the bottom, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip again (to stem side down), turn off the heat, add the cheese, if using and cover (use a large metal bowl or aluminum foil on a grill pan) until the cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. While the mushrooms cook and cheese melts, mix the remaining 2 tablespoons Dijon and the mayonnaise together. Dividing evenly, spread the mixture on both toasted halves of the rolls. Add the grilled shallots to the top half of the rolls, and the tomatoes and lettuce to the bottom halves. Transfer your mushrooms to the rolls, dividing evenly.

Moisten the breadcrumbs with a little bit of olive oil. Shuck the oysters: There is a top flat \lid\ and a bottom cupped shell for each oyster. Insert the tip of an oyster knife into the hinge where the two shells come together in a point. Twist until the lid pops open. Pull the knife out and wipe it clean so you don&#39;t get mud in the oyster. Insert the knife back into the oyster from the opposite side of the hinge, lightly scraping against the top shell to disconnect the muscle. Then go under the oyster to cut the muscle on the bottom. Flip the oyster over onto the prettier side. Top each oyster with a teaspoon of the creamed spinach, a piece of bacon and a bit of the breadcrumbs. On a baking sheet, create a small mound of coarse salt for each oyster to prevent them from tipping over. Nestle the oysters in the salt mounds, and bake until the bacon is cooked and the breadcrumbs browned. Transfer the baked oysters to a serving platter and garnish with a sprinkle of fennel pollen. If desired, garnish with grated horseradish and a drizzle of smoked olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the spinach. As soon as it&#39;s wilted and tender, drain and run under cold water. When the spinach is cool enough to handle, squeeze out any excess water. If you have used whole spinach with long stems, roughly chop it; you should have 1 1/2 cups of chopped spinach. Finely mince the fennel and onion. Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat and glaze it with the olive oil. Add the fennel, onion, garlic and a few pinches of salt, and cook until the onion is translucent; you don&#39;t want it to brown. Add the flour and stir. When the flour has gathered up all the onion mixture, add the Herbsaint and bring to a boil. Let it reduce by half before stirring in the milk to make a bechamel. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook at a low simmer until the sauce thickens to the point where it coats the back of a spoon, and where drawing your finger down the spoon leaves a clear line. Pour half of the bechamel into a blender along with 1/2 cup of the spinach. Blend until completely smooth. Add the remaining spinach to the pan with the remaining bechamel, then add the spinach puree. Heat, stirring, and season with salt and pepper. Finish by stirring in the butter, nutmeg and Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 54474,&quot;\Freeform\ Cheesecake Poured over Fresh Fruit 12 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature Pinch salt 2 whole lemons, zested and juiced 2 tablespoons almond liqueur 4 eggs, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 32 ounces mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 6 to 8 cups fresh fruit, cut into bite-size pieces 1/2 lemon, juiced 4 tablespoons sugar Instructions: In an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add a pinch of salt and the lemon zest. While the mixer is running, gradually pour in the lemon juice and almond liqueur. Incorporate the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl once or twice. Gradually add in the sugar and beat until completely blended, then add the mascarpone and beat until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a large heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over saucepan partially filled with barely simmering water, but do not let the water touch the bottom of the bowl. Cook until the mixture reaches 170 degrees F on a candy thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The temperature rises quickly in the final minutes, so at that point stir almost constantly to prevent lumps. When the sauce reaches 170 degrees F, remove the saucepan, with the bowl still inside, from the heat. Allow the sauce to stand for 15 to 30 minutes. The temperature will continue to rise to 180 degrees F and then cool gradually. If desired, strain the sauce through a fine sieve. Toss the fruit with the lemon juice and sugar. Arrange the fruit in individual serving bowls. Spoon 1/2 cup of the sauce into each bowl. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 54475,&quot;Buffalo Drumsticks 1 pound Greek yogurt 1 tablespoon garlic powder<br> 1 tablespoon onion powder<br> 2 teaspoons ground cumin<br> 2 teaspoons garlic salt<br> 2 teaspoons smoked paprika<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 24 medium chicken drumsticks<br> Neutral oil, for deep-frying Hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s, as needed Melted unsalted butter, as needed Blue cheese dressing, for serving Instructions: Combine the yogurt, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, garlic salt, smoked paprika, black pepper and kosher salt in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Add the drumsticks and turn to coat. Marinate overnight (at least 12 hours) in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the marinade, place on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F. When ready to serve, fry the drumsticks until the skin is crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Toss them with hot sauce and butter in a large bowl (use more butter than hot sauce for a mild heat and more hot sauce than butter for a spicier flavor). Serve with blue cheese dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 54476,&quot;Pot of Greens 4 pounds mixed greens 2 yellow onions 2 cloves garlic 3 tablespoons peanut oil About 4 cups chicken stock, or to cover Pepper vinegar Instructions: Trim away any tough stems, then wash the greens: Rinse each leaf separately. Put all of them in a sinkful of water and let stand for 5 minutes. Now, lift them out of the sink and drain away the water and all the grit that has settled to the bottom. Repeat the sink bath until you don&#39;t see any grit when you remove the leaves. Chop the onions and crush the garlic cloves. In a heavy pot large enough to hold all the greens, warm the oil over medium heat. Set aside about half of the onions and add the remainder along with the garlic to the pot. Saute until softened about 5 minutes. Add the greens, turn to coat in the oil, and then pour in the stock to cover. Bring to a boil and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the greens are tender. The timing will depend on what you are cooking; collards can take up to 40 minutes or so, while beet greens will cook in 1/2 that time. Transfer to a serving bowl. Pass the reserved onion and pepper vinegar at the table for sprinkling over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54477,&quot;Kourabiedes (Greece): Walnut Sugar Cookies 3/4 cup walnuts 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 large egg yolk 1 tablespoon brandy 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 to 2 tablespoons orange flower water 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toast the walnuts until golden brown and fragrant, about 6 minutes. Let cool, then chop about half of the nuts (you should have about 1/2 cup chopped). Pulse the remaining nuts in the food processor until finely ground (about 1/4 cup ground). Stir the flour, baking powder, salt and nuts together in a medium bowl. Set aside. In another medium bowl, beat the butter, sugar, egg yolk, brandy and vanilla extract together with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture gets light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. At low speed, stir in the nut mixture to make a crumbly dough. Cover the bowl and set dough aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or coat with nonstick spray. With a tablespoon, scoop out 1-inch pieces of dough and roll into balls between the palms of your hands. Pinch the ends of the balls to make a football shape. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cookies set and start to brown, about 18 minutes. Remove cookies from the oven and immediately sprinkle them lightly with the orange water. (If you don&#39;t have a brush, simply dip your fingers into the water and flick it over the cookies a few times.) Take care not to douse them, just enough for them to carry the scent of flowers. Put the confectioners&#39; sugar in a bag, and add 5 to 6 of the warm cookies to it. Very gently toss the cookies to coat with sugar. Remove them from the bag and cool cookies on a rack. Repeat with remaining cookies. Serve. Busy baker&#39;s tips: Dough can be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Baked cookies can be wrapped in plastic, then aluminum foil, for up to 2 weeks. To serve, let cookies come to room temperature before dusting with confectioners&#39; sugar. Cook&#39;s Note: If you can&#39;t find orange flower water, try specialty stores or online. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 54478,&quot;Seasonal Clafouti 1/2 cup low-fat or nonfat milk 1/2 cup nonfat or part-skim ricotta cheese 2 large eggs 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups fresh cherries Instructions: Set the oven at 425 degrees F.<br> In a food processor or blender, combine the milk, ricotta, eggs, sugar, flour, and vanilla, and process until smooth.<br> Spread the fruit evenly over the bottom of an 8-inch ovenproof skillet or deep-dish pie plate.

Simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add apple cider and continue to cook until the mixture is thick and syrupy, another 5 to 10 minutes. Prepare the candied pumpkin seeds: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread pumpkin seeds out on baking sheet and bake, stirring once, until nicely toasted and golden, about 10 minutes. Set the pumpkin seeds aside. Keep the oven on. Heavily grease another baking sheet with neutral oil or nonstick spray and set aside. Combine sugar and water in a medium sized sauce pot and mix well. Place pot on stove over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved. Add pumpkin seeds to the syrup and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Using a slotted spoon, drain pumpkin seeds out of the syrup, spread out onto the greased baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Toast seeds in the oven for about 15 minutes or until they are very crunchy. Let cool completely before using. Prepare the Brussels sprouts: Trim the stem end of the Brussels sprouts and cut a cross about 1/4 inch deep in the top of the sprouts. Heat the oil in a sauce pot to 315 to 325 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the Brussels until dark golden brown and very crispy, 5 to 8 minutes per batch. Drain Brussels on a paper towel and sprinkle with salt immediately. Put Brussels in a large bowl with the apple reduction and toss until the Brussels are well coated with the sauce. Plate the Brussels in a large bowl or platter and crush or chop the pumpkin seeds before garnishing on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 54480,&quot;Totani e Patate 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 1 cl pepper 9 1/2 ounces/250 g totani (flying squid) or other squid, cleaned and cut into strips<br> 2 cups white wine 8 cherry tomatoes 4 potatoes, peeled and chopped<br> Salt, to taste Small bunch parsley, finely chopped Instructions: Heat up the olive oil in a large pot along with the garlic and cl.

Turn the heat up to high and char both sides of the beef well. To keep the beef rare to medium rare, cook quickly, turning once only after the beef has browned on the first side. Remove the beef from the pan, place on a warm platter, and set aside. Add the diced onions and poblano peppers to the saute pan, evenly spread out and cook till wilted. Add the cumin and combine well to toast the spice again. Working carefully away from the flame, add the tequila to the pan, deglaze the pan by swirling the tequila and set back over low heat to reduce. Add the lime juice and reduce to almost dry before adding the veal stock. Reduce the stock by half over high heat and add the orange liquor and fresh orange zest. Cook for 2 minutes and then add the heavy cream. Do not allow to boil but gently simmer for 2 minutes before adding the salt and pepper. Serve the beef on a bed of sauce with corn pudding on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 54487,&quot;Zucchini and Artichoke Fritters 3 cups mayonnaise 1 cup sour cream<br> 1/4 cup buttermilk<br> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br> 6 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped<br> 4 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped<br> 3 tablespoons onion powder<br> 2 tablespoons garlic powder<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 pound zucchini, grated on the large holes of a box grater 1 1/2 teaspoons plus a pinch kosher salt<br> 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch chunks<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 4 eggs<br> 4 ounces Parmesan, grated, plus more for garnish<br> 2 ounces fontina cheese, grated<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley, plus more for garnish<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup artichoke hearts, roughly chopped<br> Oil, for frying Instructions: For the farmhouse dressing: Put mayo, sour cream, buttermilk and red wine vinegar in a large mixing bowl. Whisk to combine until smooth. Add the dill, parsley, onion powder, garlic powder and salt and whisk until well combined. For the fritters: Toss grated zucchini with pinch of salt. Place in a colander with a plate on top to push down. Allow to sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove zucchini from colander and squeeze with a dish towel to remove any excess moisture. Put butter and salt in a medium saucepan with 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Add flour and stir with a wooden spoon or sturdy whisk until mixture comes together, about 1 minute. Lower heat and cook for 1 minute more. Transfer dough to bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix at medium speed to cool mixture slightly. Increase speed and begin to add eggs, one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. (Let dough come back together after the addition of each egg.) After final egg has been added, beat until dough is smooth and glossy, about a minute more. Stop machine and add grated cheese, parsley and pepper, then mix briefly to combine. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Fold in the grated zucchini and chopped artichokes. Scrape down sides of bowl and remix, then transfer mixture to a disposable pastry bag. (Mixture can also be dispensed into oil using a 1/2-ounce ice cream scoop.) Heat oil in a deep-fryer or several inches oil in a heavy-sided pot to 350 degrees F. Cut about 1 1/2 inches off the end of the pastry bag. (The more you cut, the larger the fritters will be.) Squeeze bag and pinch off a quarter-size amount of dough, then slowly drop into the oil. Use a slotted spoon to move fritters around in the oil so they cook on all sides. Remove after 4 to 5 minutes. Toss with some more grated Parmesan and chopped parsley. Serve with farmhouse dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 54488,&quot;Grilled Pizzetta with Ricotta, Sausage, Arugula and Chili Oil 5 to 6 Fresno chili peppers, roughly chopped 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons dry yeast 1/2 teaspoon sugar<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for coating bowl and grill 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for coating bowl and grill<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for coating pan 8 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casings removed 1 cup ricotta<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 sprig fresh oregano, leaves removed and gently chopped<br> 1 bunch of arugula, trimmed<br> Instructions: For the chili oil: Bring the chilies and oil to a simmer in a small saucepan; remove from the heat and let the peppers steep in the oil for at least an hour or until the dough has risen and you&#39;re ready to make the pizzas. This can be done way in advance. For the dough: In a small bowl, add 1/2 cup warm water (if the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate). Add the dry yeast and sugar, stir to combine and let sit for 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty; this is what you want. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water mix. Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth, clean work surface dusted with flour and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency. Lightly coat the mixing bowl with oil, return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour. For the pizza topping: Coat a large saute pan with oil, add the sausage and bring to medium heat. Cook the sausage until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve. While the sausage cooks, mix together in a medium bowl the ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano and oregano. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and preheat a grill. When the dough is ready, portion it into six golf-ball-size pieces. (If you&#39;re not using the dough right away, wrap each ball individually in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.) Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like; I like irregular shapes). Brush the grill with oil and arrange each piece of dough on the grill; you might need to work in batches here. Grill until the dough is stiff and crisp and has lovely grill marks on it, then flip and repeat on the second side, moving occasionally so the bottom doesn&#39;t burn. Put the pizzas on baking sheets, smear each with some of the ricotta mixture, top with sausage and put as many pizzas as will comfortably fit in the oven; bake until the cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Again, you may have to work in batches. Remove the pizzas from the oven, top with arugula and drizzle with the deliciously spicy chili oil! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 54489,&quot;Mashed Potatoes 2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced 1 stick butter, cubed 1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream Salt and white pepper Instructions: Place the potatoes in a pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the potatoes until fork tender, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and drain. Place the potatoes back in the pot and return to the heat. Stir the potatoes, constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes to dehydrate the potatoes. Remove the potatoes from the heat. Add the butter. Using a hand-held masher, mash the butter into the potatoes. Add enough cream until desired smoothness is achieved. The potatoes should still be sort of lumpy. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54490,&quot;Lemon-Pepper Slather 1 teaspoon white peppercorns 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse sea salt 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup finely grated lemon zest (from 4 large lemons) 2 cloves garlic, smashed Instructions: Pulse the peppercorns in a spice grinder until coarsely ground.

Let sit until the dasima swells until doubled in size and the water turns slightly green-yellow, about 30 minutes. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; boil until the dasima starts to foam around the sides, 1 to 3 minutes. Discard the dasima, then add the radish and simmer until the radish is soft enough to be easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the guk-ganjang and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Discard the radish; you should have about 4 cups broth. Set aside. For the bulgogi: Whisk the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, sesame oil, garlic and few grinds of black pepper together in a large bowl until combined and most of the sugar is dissolved. Add the beef to the marinade and toss until the beef is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours. For the assembly: Soak the dangmyeon noodles in a large bowl of lukewarm to warm water until they bend around your hands nicely when lifted, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain in a colander and set aside while preparing the other ingredients. To assemble the dish, place the onion over the bottom of a 12-inch high-sided skillet or shallow pot with a lid. Follow with the soaked dangmyeon noodles. Then add as much or little of the bulgogi, oyster mushrooms, shiitakes, tofu, enoki, carrot, crown daisy, minari, cabbage and scallions as you like to the pot (pack the ingredients in as the mushrooms will cook down). Carefully pour the prepared dasima broth in; you can start off with 3 cups or add all 4 cups of the both for a soupier version. Cover with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil over high heat and let cook until the vegetables are tender and cooked through and the bulgogi turns brown, 2 to 4 minutes. (If you want more broth, add some water and season with salt.) Serve immediately with rice on the side. And don\u2019t forget to dig down to the dangmyeon noodles on the bottom! &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 54492,&quot;Instant Pot Meal Prep Breakfast Burritos 1 link chorizo sausage, removed from casing Nonstick cooking spray, for the molds and foil<br> 1/4 cup crumbled cooked bacon<br> 1/4 cup shredded Cheddar<br> 2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper<br> 2 tablespoons diced red onion<br> 8 large eggs plus 6 whites<br> 3 tablespoons heavy cream<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup frozen spinach, thawed and drained<br> 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon grated Parmesan<br> Twelve 8-inch flour tortillas, warmed<br> Hot sauce, salsa and ketchup, for serving<br> Instructions: Heat a medium skillet over medium heat.

Add the carrots, celery, onion and leek and cook until soft and starting to caramelize, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the fillets from either side of the fish by first cutting down the backbone and then working from head to tail. I always leave the tail attached to one of the fillets because I like the look of it. Discard the head and bones, or save them for making stock. All of this, of course, you can have done by the fishmonger. Heat the oven to 425 degrees F/220 degrees C with a baking sheet on the rack (the hot baking sheet will ensure that the skin stays crisp).<br> When the vegetables are ready, pour over the wine and continue cooking until it has evaporated completely and the vegetables are sticky, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat, stir through the shrimp and thyme, and set aside.<br> Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan (or the washed-out saute pan) large enough to accommodate the fish fillets. When sizzling hot, sear the fillets skin-side down just long enough to make the skin crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove.<br> Take the baking sheet from the oven with oven-mitted hands. Drizzle on a little oil. Lay on the fillet with the tail, skin-side down. Top with the stuffing. Lay on the second fillet, skin-side up.

Use immediately, or follow proper canning guidelines below. Sterilizing Tips: Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed. To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Leave in a preheated 175 degree F oven for 25 minutes. Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes. Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes. As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands. After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 54509,&quot;Penne with Vodka Sauce 1 quart Simple Tomato Sauce, recipe follows, or store-bought marinara sauce, blended until smooth 1 cup vodka 1/2 cup heavy cream, at room temperature 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1 pound penne 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 stalk celery, chopped 1 carrot, chopped 2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes 4 to 6 basil leaves 2 dried bay leaves Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional Instructions: Simmer the tomato sauce and vodka in a heavy large skillet over low heat until the mixture reduces by 1/4, stirring often, about 20 minutes.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the butter, shallots, garlic, parsley, and lemon juice. Mix all ingredients well with a small spoon. Lightly season butter with salt and pepper, until desired taste is achieved. When butter is at desired flavor, begin to scoop a small amount of herb butter in each shell of escargot. If there is extra butter left over after each shell has been filled, go back and continue the process, adding extra butter, until all the butter has been used. Put the stuffed shells into the fridge and allow to sit for about 20 minutes, giving the butter enough time to solidify in shells. While the shells are in the fridge, set the oven to 350 degrees F. When the butter is solid in the shells, remove from fridge and transfer shells into an oven-safe pan. If possible, avoid placing shells on a sheet tray, as we want the snails to cook in the butter as much as possible. Cook snails for 15 minutes, max. Serve snails, in shells, on top of toasted pieces of baguette, or in a fresh tomato-based sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 54544,&quot;Meat with Lentils Lamb bones 1 cinnamon or bay leaf 2 garlic cloves 8 1/2 ounces dal (chana dal) 8 1/2 ounces toor dal (oiled variety) 2 ounces tamarind Salt 3/4 teaspoon tumeric powder 6 green chilis, chopped 3 tablespoons coriander leaves, chopped 25 curry leaves 8 tablespoons oil 8 1/2 ounces onions, sliced 6 cloves 6 green cardomoms 4-inch cinnamon stick 2 teaspoons red chili powder 3 teaspoons garlic puree 3 teaspoons ginger puree 1 1/2 pounds mutton pieces 3 tomatoes, chopped 6 dried red chilis, broken into bits (optional) 3 garlic cloves, sliced 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds 1/3 teaspoon garam masala powder Instructions: Put lamb bones to boil in 5 cups water with cinnamon or bay leaf and garlic clove for 30 minutes.

Put 1/2 cup flour, the yeast and sugar in a food processor and pulse to combine. With the motor running, add 3/4 cup hot tap water (about 115 degrees F). Turn off the motor and add the cornmeal, cheese, olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1 cup flour. Pulse until the dough forms a ball, then continue pulsing until smooth but still wet, about 15 more times. Make the pizzettes: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until soft and elastic, 12 to 15 times, dusting lightly with flour if too wet to handle. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a 1/4-inch-thick disk, about 14 inches across. Using a 3-inch-round cutter, cut the dough into 16 rounds, gathering and rerolling the scraps if needed. Transfer the rounds to the prepared pans. Mix the olive oil, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Brush each round lightly with the herb oil, then top each with a slice of soppressata and 2 to 3 tomato slices. Sprinkle with the parmesan. Bake one sheet at a time, until the crusts are golden, about 8 minutes. Drizzle the pizzettes with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and top with the basil leaves.

You should have about 1/2 cup chopped garlic. Scoop into a small (1-quart) saucepan, measure in the oil (you need it all for even cooking) and 1/2 teaspoon salt and set over medium-low heat. Stir occasionally as the mixture comes barely to a simmer (there should be just a hint of movement on the surface of the oil). Adjust the heat to the very lowest possible setting to keep the mixture at that very gentle simmer (bubbles will rise in the pot like sparkling mineral water) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is a soft, pale golden (the color of light brown sugar), about 30 minutes. The slower the cooking, the sweeter the garlic. Add the lime juice to the pan and simmer until most of the juice has evaporated or been absorbed into the garlic, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chiles, then taste the mojo de ajo and add a little more salt if you think it needs it. Keep the pan over low heat,so the garlic will be warm when the shrimp are ready. Scoop the lime wedges into a serving bowl and set on the table. The shrimp: Devein the shrimp if you wish: One by one, lay the shrimp on your work surface, make a shallow incision down the back and pull or scrape out the dark (usually) intestinal tract. Set a large (12-inch) heavy skillet (preferably nonstick) over medium-high heat and spoon in 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil (but not any garlic) from the mojo. Add half of the shrimp to the skillet, sprinkle generously with salt and stir gently and continuously until the shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in half the cilantro or parsley, if you&#39;re using it. Scoop the shrimp onto a deep serving platter. Repeat with another 1 1/2 tablespoons of garlicky oil and the remaining shrimp. When all of the shrimp are cooked, use a slotted spoon to scoop out the warm bits of garlic and chiles from the mojo pan, and scatter them over the shrimp. (You may have as much as 1/3 cup of the oil left over, for which you&#39;ll be grateful--it&#39;s wonderful for sauteing practically anything.) If you&#39;re a garlic lover, you&#39;re about to have the treat of your life, served with the lime wedges to add sparkle. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 54567,&quot;Crispy Prosciutto Cups with Sausage and Apple Stuffing 12 ounces fennel sausage, bulk or removed from casing 12 ounces hot Italian sausage, bulk or removed from casing 5 ribs celery, minced 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and diced into 1/4-inch cubes 1 onion, minced 2 tablespoons fresh minced parsley 1 tablespoon fresh minced sage 1 tablespoon fresh minced thyme 2 cups low-sodium chicken stock Freshly cracked black pepper 1 (12-ounce bag) cubed country-style stuffing (recommended: Pepperidge Farm) 2 cup dried cranberries 4 large eggs, beaten 48 pieces prosciutto di Parma, thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a large skillet set over medium-high heat, brown the sausage. Use a potato masher to press the sausage in the pan. It assures a nice crust forms on the sausage. Then, using a wooden spoon, break apart the sausage as it cooks. Once the sausage is brown, add in the celery, apples and onion and saute until fragrant and softened, about 5 minutes. Add in the parsley, sage and thyme, and then add the chicken stock and scrape up any brown bits that have formed on the bottom of the pan. Season with pepper, turn off the heat and set aside. Add the bread cubes to a large mixing bowl and add the sauteed sausage and vegetable mixture. Toss to combine, and then add in the dried cranberries. Once the mixture has cooled slightly, add in the eggs and toss until all ingredients are combined. Line each cup of 2 nonstick muffin pans with 2 slices prosciutto. Let the prosciutto hang over the cups. As they bake, this becomes crispy and delicious, plus the prosciutto shrinks up a bit as it cooks as well. Press the prosciutto slices into the muffin cups to create space for the stuffing. Once the muffin cups are lined, fill each cup with a heaping amount of stuffing. Bake the stuffing cups until golden brown on top and the prosciutto is nice and crispy around the sides, 20 to 25 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven and let cool in the muffin tins until they are cool enough to touch, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove, serve and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 54568,&quot;Broccoli with Pecan Brown Butter Kosher salt 2 pounds broccoli, cut into florets 1 stick salted butter 2 shallots, chopped 3 cloves garlic, chopped 2/3 cup chopped toasted pecans Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon lemon juice Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat and add the broccoli.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. For the pickled jalape?os: Place the sugar, vinegar, salt and 1/2 cup water in a container. Shake to combine, then add the jalape?os and let sit for at least 30 minutes. For the pate choux: Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup water with the butter, cinnamon and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, add the flour all at once and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture has formed a ball, has a slightly sweaty sheen to it and has pulled away from the pan. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until it cools down, 2 to 3 minutes. The mixture does not have to be cold, just cool enough not to cook the eggs when added in the next step. Beat in 2 eggs, 1 at a time. Do not add the second egg until the first is fully incorporated. Check the consistency of the batter; it should fall off the spoon in a smooth, elastic stream. If it does not, whisk the third egg in a separate bowl, add half to the batter and beat until smooth. Check the consistency again and add the other half, if needed. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe six 4-inch-long eclairs onto the prepared sheet pan, making sure to leave at least 1 inch between each eclair. They grow! Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, then set aside to cool. For the sweet corn pastry cream: Meanwhile, whisk 1/2 cup of the heavy cream and the cornstarch in a small bowl until there are no lumps. Set the slurry aside. Place 4 cups of the heavy cream, 1 cup of the sugar and 2 teaspoons of the vanilla extract in a medium saucepan. Turn the heat to low and allow it to come to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, place the eggs and remaining 1 cup sugar in a large bowl and beat aggressively with a whisk until the mixture thickens and turns pale yellow. When the cream comes to a boil, remove from the heat. Whisk half of it into the egg-sugar mixture, then immediately whisk the cream-egg-sugar mixture back into the saucepan of hot cream. Turn the heat to medium and whisk for 2 to 3 minutes, then gradually whisk in the reserved slurry. Cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture has thickened to the consistency of a pudding. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Place the bowl in an ice bath until the pastry cream is completely cool, at least 10 minutes. Place the corn kernels, remaining 1/4 cup heavy cream and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a medium saucepan. Bring to a low boil and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender, add half the pastry cream and blend until smooth. Fold the mixture into the remaining pastry cream, then transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip. Set the bag with the sweet corn pastry cream aside. For the glaze: Set up a double boiler over medium heat. Place the white chocolate chips and coconut oil in a heatproof bowl and set the bowl over the boiling water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir until the chocolate has melted. For serving: Cut a small hole in the end of each eclair using a paring knife, then fill the eclairs with the sweet corn pastry cream. Pour the melted white chocolate over the eclairs, then arrange the fresh strawberries, freeze-dried strawberries and pickled jalape?os on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54584,&quot;Thai Coco Cocktail 2 1/2 ounces coconut rum 1 1/2 ounces Fresh Lemongrass Syrup, recipe follows 1 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice (about 1 juicy lime) Very thin slice lime or spear of fresh lemongrass, for garnish 2 stalks fresh lemongrass, coarsely chopped 2 cups water 1 cup sugar Instructions: Fill a cocktail shaker or small pitcher with ice. Add the rum, lemongrass syrup, and lime juice. Cover and shake vigorously, or stir, until combined and chilled, about 30 seconds. (In general, by the time the shaker mists up the drink is ready.) Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with lime on the rim or the lemongrass spear in the drink. Serve. Place the lemongrass, water, and sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Strain the mixture and cool. Cover and refrigerate for up to a week.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (If you have only one baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.) Whisk the sugars, eggs, oil and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk the flours, salt and baking soda in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips and dried fruit. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart on the pans. Bake until golden but still soft in the center, 12 to 14 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer the hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve. Store the cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54586,&quot;Triple Chocolate Tiramisu 5 large egg yolks 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup Marsala wine 1 cup white chocolate chips<br> 1 pound mascarpone cheese, softened at room temperature<br> 1 cup heavy (whipping) cream<br> 1 1/2 cups brewed espresso or very strong coffee, cooled 1 tablespoon vanilla<br> One 7-ounce package savoiardi or ladyfingers<br> 2 cups halved strawberries<br> 1 square semisweet chocolate, for grating<br> Chocolate Curls, recipe follows, for topping 3 ounces semisweet chocolate 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening<br> Instructions: In a saucepan, bring some water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Have ready 2 mixing bowls that will fit over the top of the pan but not sink all the way in. Put the egg yolks in one of the mixing bowls off heat. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar and whisk until the yolks start to turn pale. Place the mixing bowl over the saucepan with the simmering water. Slowly add 1/2 cup of the Marsala wine and whisk to combine. Cook over the simmering water until thick, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl, about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool. Put the white chocolate in the second bowl and melt over the pan of water. Set aside to cool. Put the mascarpone in a bowl and stir until smooth. Pour in the cooled white chocolate and mix to combine. Combine the cream and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a mixer and whip until not quite stiff. Add the mascarpone-white chocolate mixture and chilled egg yolk mixture to the bowl of whipped cream and fold gently. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Put the brewed espresso, vanilla and remaining 1/4 cup Marsala in a bowl or measuring cup. Arrange about a third of the ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9-by-13-inch pan. Spoon a small amount of the coffee mixture over each ladyfinger (keep it under 1 tablespoon per cookie and you&#39;ll be fine). Plop one-third of the cold cream mixture on top and spread it into a layer. Make a layer of one-third of the halved strawberries and grate over some semisweet chocolate. Repeat the layers 2 more times. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours before serving; this allows for more moisture to soften the cookies and the whole mixture to meld together. To serve, spoon out helpings onto individual plates. Top with Chocolate Curls. Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl with the vegetable shortening and microwave until melted and hot, 30 to 45 seconds. Stir to combine. Pour the melted chocolate mixture onto the underside of a clean baking sheet and then spread it in a very thin layer with an offset spatula or knife. Put in the freezer for a few minutes. After a few minutes, check to see if it is set by pressing with your fingertip; it should leave the slightest mark but not a depression. Using a sharp-edged spatula, begin to scrape the chocolate from the bottom of the baking sheet--it will curl. Transfer the curls to a cold pan or plate and put in the freezer to harden. Store in the freezer in a ziptop bag until needed. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 54587,&quot;Pecan, Sour Cream Waffles 1 cup whole milk 1 cup sour cream 2 eggs 3 tablespoons butter, melted 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon Pinch kosher salt 1/2 cup pecans, toasted and chopped fine Instructions: Heat waffle iron.

Let the butter melt, then slowly simmer the cream until it reduces slightly, about 10 minutes. Be careful that the mixture doesn?t boil over; if it does, reduce or remove from the heat. Break the bread up into 1-inch pieces. Day-old bread is best but any bread will work. Place the bread in a large mixing bowl and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease an 8-inch-by-8-inch cake pan. Add the reduced heavy cream mixture to the bread pieces and mix until combined. Transfer to the prepared cake pan and sprinkle the kosher salt over the top. You want just a light sprinkle to give it that salty and sweet taste. Bake until firm in the middle, like brownies, about 20 minutes.

Cook just until the fat is rendered out, 5 to 7 minutes. (The bacon should not brown at all.) Remove the bacon from the pan and place in the bowl of a small food processor. There should be about 2 tablespoons of bacon fat that has collected in the pan. Place the buns into the warm bacon fat, cut-side down. Toast the buns they are until golden brown around the edges, about 2 minutes. Set aside for burger assembly. Pulse the par-cooked bacon in the food processor until it is coarsely ground, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer the bacon to a large mixing bowl. Add the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Use your hand to gently work the bacon and seasonings into the ground beef. Divide the meat into 4 portions (6 to 7 ounces each). Loosely pack the meat into 4 thick patties, using your thumb to create a shallow dimple in the center of each. Sprinkle the outside of each patty with salt and pepper as desired. Preheat the grill and generously oil the grill grates. Place the patties on the grill and cook to the desired degree of doneness, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Top each patty with a slice of American cheese and cover the grill to allow the cheese to melt, 30 seconds. Assemble the burgers and top with ranch, lettuce, tomato slices and red onion. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 54611,&quot;Chipotle-Inspired Vegetarian Burrito Bowl 1 small onion, one half cut into thick wedges through the stem and the other half finely diced 1 medium poblano cl<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 chipotle pepper and 2 tablespoons adobo sauce (from one 7-ounce can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce)<br> 2 cloves garlic<br> 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce 2 teaspoons tomato paste<br> 1 teaspoon chili powder<br> 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> One 14-ounce package extra-firm tofu, drained well<br> Brown rice, for serving Black beans, for serving Shredded romaine lettuce, for serving<br> Prepared pico de gallo, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to broil. Place the onion wedges and poblano on a rimmed baking sheet and rub with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Broil, turning several times with tongs, until the poblano has collapsed in on itself and the vegetables are charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven. When the poblano is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin, stem and seeds. Transfer the poblano to a blender. Add the charred onion wedges, chipotle pepper and adobo sauce, garlic, soy sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, vinegar, cumin, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Blend until smooth, then set the poblano mixture aside. Cut the tofu crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick planks, then press the pieces between a couple paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool.<br> Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet, then add the diced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 6 minutes. Using your hands, tear and crumble the tofu into very small pieces and add to the skillet. Cook, stirring to combine, until warmed through, about 2 minutes.<br> Add the poblano mixture and 1/2 cup water to the skillet and cook until it\u2019s bubbling all over and the tofu has absorbed some of the sauce, about 5 minutes. Add 1 to 2 more tablespoons water if the mixture gets too dry (it should be saucy). Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed.<br> Serve over rice and beans and top with lettuce and pico de gallo. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 54612,&quot;Sweet Potato Pie 1 quart vegetable oil, for frying 2 cups self-rising flour or all-purpose flour 1/2 tablespoon salt 4 tablespoons sugar 1/4 pound (1 stick) margarine, melted 1/8 to 1/4 cup cold water 3 pounds sweet potatoes 1/4 pound (1 stick) margarine Cinnamon Nutmeg 3 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups sugar Instructions: In a one-gallon saucepot heat one quart of vegetable oil to 350 degrees F. To make the dough, mix the flour, salt, and sugar together and cut in the margarine by hand to create a coarse cornmeal texture. Then add the water until it is tacky. Roll the dough into a ball. Cut dough into ten equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough out on a floured surface to a diameter of 6-inches and about 1/8-inch thick. Set aside until you are ready to fill the dough. To make the filling, first peel the sweet potatoes. Then large dice the potatoes and put in a medium size saucepot. Add water to cover potatoes and bring to boil. Potatoes are done when fork tender. When sweet potatoes are finished boiling, drain well. In a food processor, while still hot, add the potatoes, margarine, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and sugar. Mix on medium speed until smooth. To assemble pies, put 1/4 cup of the filling in the center of a dough circle. Fold over in half and seal with water. Crimp edges with a fork to completely close. Place pies in oil once the temperature has reached 350 degrees F. (If temperature is below 350 degrees F the oil will absorb the margarine in the pie dough and cause it to be excessively greasy.) Pie should be cooked in 7 to 8 minutes and will have a golden brown color. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 54613,&quot;Boozy Watermelon Pirate Ship One 18- to 20-pound seedless watermelon One 1-pint bottle dark rum 1 mango, peeled and cut into chunks 1 pineapple, peeled and cut into chunks 1 papaya, seeded, 2 long slices reserved and the rest cut into chunks Instructions: Set the watermelon on its side (stem ends facing left and right) and cut off a small flat piece of rind so the watermelon is stable. Use the screw top of the rum bottle to trace a circle on the top of the watermelon. Cut out the circle to make a hole exposing the flesh. Tilt the watermelon on its side and press the bottle into the watermelon all the way up to the neck. Turn the watermelon back so the bottle is facing downward. Put the watermelon on a tray and refrigerate until all the rum soaks in, 12 to 24 hours depending on the density of the watermelon. To make the ship: Cut off the top half of the watermelon in one piece lengthwise, just above the stem. Use a melon baller to scoop out as many balls as possible from the top and bottom halves of the melon and put them in a large bowl. Scrape the top and bottom halves down to the rind with a spoon. The bottom half of the melon will be your ship.<br> Use a paring knife to cut a notch about 1 inch deep and 3 inches wide on each side of the ship. Mark 4 evenly spaced portholes under each notch using an apple corer (don&#39;t press all the way through). Use a paring knife to cut out the marked circles.<br> Toss the chunks of mango, pineapple and papaya (reserving the slices) with the watermelon balls in the large bowl and fill the boat. (If there is a little fruit salad leftover, use it to refill the boat as your guests eat.) To make the sails: Cut the top half of the watermelon in half lengthwise and use the pieces to make sails. From the center most curved sections of the rinds cut out two 3-inch square sails. Cut two 2-inch sails and one 1 1/2-inch sail from the remaining rind pieces. Trim the backs of the sail to make them neat, but leave them thick. Thread 3 of the sails onto a 12-inch wood skewer in this order: a 3-inch sail on the bottom, 2-inch sail in the middle and 1 1/2-inch sail on the top. Thread the remaining 2 sails on an 8-inch wood skewer with the largest sail on the bottom. Stick the skewers with the sails into the fruit, putting the 3-sail mast in the back.<br> Use a paring knife to cut 4 small flags from the papaya slices. Stick a flag on the top of each skewer mast. Stick 2 toothpicks in the back of the boat and add a flag to each.<br> Refrigerate until ready to serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 54614,&quot;Grilled Pound Cake with Cream Cheese Glaze and Grilled Peaches 2 peaches, ripe but firm, halved 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 3 tablespoons sweet white wine, such as marsala wine 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/2 store-bought pound cake, sliced into 2-inch slices 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/4 cup powdered sugar 1 tablespoon orange zest 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice Instructions: For the grilled peaches: Prepare the grill to high heat.

Mix the curry powder, onion powder and cayenne together in a small bowl. Rub the chicken breasts with the seasoning mixture. Add the minced garlic to the chicken, mixing so the garlic is distributed throughout the chicken. Marinate the chicken, spices and garlic together for 30 minutes. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add 1/4 cup olive oil. Sprinkle the chicken with kosher salt and sear it, in batches, until golden brown on each side. Remove the chicken to a plate. Add the sliced onions and diced potatoes and saute until the onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Then add the chicken back in along with the chicken stock. Bring to a boil and lower to a simmer. Cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 45 minutes to an hour. For the rice: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Then add the rice, coconut milk, granulated garlic, onion powder, thyme, bay leaves and 2 cups water. Cook, uncovered, until the rice begins to peek through and begins to absorb the moisture. Then, stir in the chickpeas. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Season with salt. Serve the chicken curry over the coconut peas and rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 54630,&quot;Crispy Chicken 2 Ways 1 poblano pepper 7 slices stale whole wheat bread 1 garlic clove 2 tablespoons olive oil (30 milliliters) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled (about 50 grams) 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (65 grams) 1/4 cup mayonnaise (60 milliliters) 2 eggs Instructions: Using a pair of metal kitchen tongs or a fork, hold the pepper over the flame of a gas burner until well charred, turning occasionally. Alternatively, char the pepper under your broiler set to high, turning occasionally until charred. Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic or a plate to seal in the steam and set aside. Tear the bread into small pieces and roughly chop the garlic. Add both to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse until the mixture is finely ground into breadcrumbs. Add the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and pulse to combine. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the breadcrumb mixture. Toast, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a shallow dish and spread into a thin layer to cool completely. Meanwhile, peel the charred skin off of the pepper, finely dice and add it to a small bowl along with the crumbled feta. Mix well to combine and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and set out two baking sheets. Prepare the chicken by removing the tender from each and slicing two of the breasts into four or five long pieces that are about the same size as the tenders. Slice a pocket into the side of the two remaining chicken breasts and stuff each with the pepper and feta mixture. Scatter the flour into a shallow dish. Season with salt. Beat the mayonnaise and eggs together in a separate shallow dish. Set up a breading station with the flour, egg mixture and toasted breadcrumbs. Dredge the tenders by coating in flour, dipping in the egg and finally pressing into the breadcrumbs to coat. Continue with the rest of the tenders, placing the coated pieces onto one of the baking sheets, leaving space between each. Coat the stuffed chicken breasts as you did the tenders, being careful not to let any of the stuffing fall out, and place onto the second baking sheet. Place both the tenders and the stuffed chicken breasts into the oven, placing the stuffed breasts onto the lower shelf if needed for space. Bake until cooked through to 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes for the tenders and 25 to 30 minutes for the stuffed breasts. Allow the chicken to rest for 3 to 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 54631,&quot;Bone-In Pork Roast with Broccoli Rabe, Sweet Italian Sausage, and Roasted Peaches 1 center-cut bone-in pork roast, about 5 pounds 1 gallon water 1 cup kosher salt 1 cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon whole peppercorns 1 bunch fresh thyme, divided Salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil 4 carrots, peeled 1 head garlic, split 1 onion, halved 2 shallots, halved 1 pound sweet Italian sausage 2 garlic cloves, slivered Pinch red pepper flakes Pinch fennel seed 1 1/2 pounds broccoli rabe, trimmed 2 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon whole mustard seed 2 tablespoons fresh tarragon 1 dozen peaches 2 cups apple juice 1 tablespoon butter Instructions: Have butcher cut the chine bone in between each rib of the pork roast to make carving easier. Leave the fat cap on for added moisture and flavor. Line a large stockpot or bucket with a plastic bag. Pour water into the bag and dissolve salt and brown sugar. Add peppercorns and a few thyme sprigs. Place the pork roast in the bag of brine. Tie the bag closed so the pork is submerged. Refrigerate for 6 hours, the brine will tenderize the meat. Remove pork from the brine and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lay thyme sprigs all over the pork roast, season with salt and pepper, then secure with butcher&#39;s twine to help hold the shape. Coat a roasting pan with a little olive oil and set on 2 burners over high heat until almost smoking. Sear the pork, fat side down, until caramelized. Turn the roast to brown all sides, this should take about 10 minutes. To flavor the pork drippings, scatter carrots, garlic, onion, shallots and more thyme sprigs in the pan, then transfer the roast to oven. Roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast registers 150 degrees F, approximately 1 hour. Heat olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Brown the sausage links on all sides until cooked through. Remove the links from the pan and slice on a bias. Add slivered garlic, red pepper flakes and fennel seed, stir to incorporate. Return the sausage back to the pan, along with broccoli rabe and chicken broth. Saute with the stock for 5 minutes until the rabe is wilted. Whisk together balsamic vinegar, honey, mustard seed, tarragon, and about 1/4 cup olive oil. Slice peaches in half lengthwise and remove pits. Pour the marinade over the peaches, tossing to coat. Place peaches cut side down in a baking pan and roast for 12 to 15 minutes until soft. Remove the pork to a cutting board and let it rest while preparing the pan sauce. Discard the aromatic vegetables from the roasting pan, set pan on 2 burners over medium heat. Deglaze with apple juice, scraping up the brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Reduce by a third. Season with salt and pepper; whisk in butter to smooth out. Cut the twine and carve the roast. Serve family style on a platter with broccoli rabe, sausage, and roasted peaches.

Add the remaining potatoes, corned beef, cooking liquid, onion, garlic, mustard, parsley, thyme, and nutmeg. Season generously with pepper and mix well. Store in the refrigerator overnight or at least 3 hours. Set up for poaching the eggs: Combine the water, vinegar, and salt in a large skillet and bring to a gentle simmer. Preheat a large well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 cup of the butter and heat. When the foaming subsides, add the hash mixture and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Using a spatula, press the mixture down into a cake the size of the skillet. Cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the hash begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking, shaking the skillet to loosen the hash occasionally, until the underside is browned and crusty, about 6 minutes more. To flip the hash, set a plate the size of the skillet on top of the pan. Invert the pan so the hash falls on to the plate as an intact cake. Invert the hash onto another plate, cooked-side up. Return the skillet to the medium-high heat; add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. When the foaming subsides, slide the hash into the skillet cooked-side up. Cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, for 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the underside is browned and crispy, about 5 minutes more. While the corned beef hash is cooking, crack an egg into a cup and carefully slide it into the hot poaching liquid. Quickly repeat with all the eggs.

Tap the mold on the counter to encourage the air bubbles to depart. When the mold is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of each cavity should be evenly coated with chocolate. Scrape the mold clean with an offset spatula and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean again, with a chef&#39;s knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat with as many candy molds as you would like. For the filling: Place the coconut milk in a pan and bring to a boil. Stir in the corn syrup, coconut rum and rum. Place the white chocolate and in a large mixing bowl. Pour the hot coconut milk over the chocolate in the bowl and mix thoroughly. Stir in the shredded coconut. Allow the mixture to come to room temperature (though it should still be soft enough to pipe). Place the mixture in a piping bag and fill each chocolate cavity with the coconut mixture, to just shy of the top of the cavity. Allow this to set until the mixture hardens, about 2 hours. Use an offset spatula to cover the openings of each cavity with more tempered bittersweet chocolate. When the chocolate has begun to set, use an offset spatula to scrape away the excess chocolate. Allow the chocolate to set completely. Overturn the mold and give it a quick rap on the counter. The chocolates will release from the mold. They are ready to serve. Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.

Saute the onions until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, coriander, cumin and jalapeno pepper and saute another 2 minutes to release the aromas. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they are juicy. Add the potatoes, bell pepper, salt and pepper, and stock. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Add the corn and heat through another 2 minutes. In a blender, puree half of the soup with the milk and cheese. Stir the puree back into the soup pot. Adjust seasoning. Heat slowly until soup is warmed through and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54668,&quot;Sloppy Jose with Chorizo, Charred Poblanos and Avocado Crema 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, leaves and tender stems 1/4 cup sour cream 1 avocado 1 lime, zested and juiced Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 poblano peppers, seeded, ribbed and cut into 1/4-inch-by-2-inch strips 1 teaspoon ground cumin Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 2 pounds fresh Mexican chorizo One 12-ounce jar salsa (I like chunky, but use whatever you like) Salted butter, at room temperature, for toasting the buns 4 fresh telera or bolillo rolls 1 cup shredded Chihuahua cheese Instructions: For the avocado crema: Place the cilantro, sour cream, avocado, lime zest and juice in a food processor and run until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and reserve, covered with plastic wrap pressed directly on top to keep from browning. For the filling: Preheat a heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over high heat, and then add in the oil. Add the poblano peppers, season with cumin, salt and pepper and toss to coat. Saute until the peppers are slightly soft and blistered, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. In the same skillet, add the chorizo and cook over medium heat, breaking up with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Cook the chorizo until well browned and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. If your chorizo has extra fat you can drain it on a paper-towel-lined plate to remove excess fat and then add the chorizo back to the pan along with the salsa. If your chorizo doesn&#39;t have that much fat, just add in your salsa and keep the party going. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. For the sandwich build: Slice, butter and toast each of the rolls until golden brown and crusty. Sprinkle some cheese on the bottom bun, and then a hefty spoonful of the hot chorizo. On top of the chorizo place some poblanos. Smear the top bun with lots of avocado crema and serve &#39;em up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 54669,&quot;Orchiette Pasta with Wild Mushroom Cream Sauce 12 ounces orchiette pasta 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound assorted wild mushrooms, stems trimmed, wiped clean, and thinly sliced 1/4 cup chopped shallots 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives Instructions: In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente. Drain and return to the pot. Cover to keep warm. Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shallots, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add the cream, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan and adjust the seasoning, to taste. Add the pasta, stir to coat with the sauce, and cook until the pasta is heated through, 1 minute. Remove from the heat and divide among 4 serving bowls or plates. Sprinkle each serving with chives and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 54670,&quot;Banana Splitsville 2 cups sugar 1 cup water 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 4 bananas Sugar for coating Instructions: Combine the sugar, water, and corn syrup in a small, heavy saucepan and place over high heat. As soon as the sugar has dissolved, heat your thermometer under warm tap water (to prevent thermal shock) and attach to side of pan, making sure that the bulb is completely submerged. Do not stir the mixture or agitate the pan at this stage. When the mixture reaches 230 degrees, reduce the heat to medium and allow the sugar to color gradually. As the temperature approaches 300 degrees the color will start to turn to amber. At this point, it&#39;s safe to swirl the pan gently to help distribute the heat evenly. As the caramel heads towards 340 degrees, it will reach a deep amber color. Remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir with a metal spoon, allowing it to cool until the caramel falls from the spoon in a solid stream, like a string. When it does, it&#39;s doodad time. Form doodads by holding the spoon 12 to 16 inches over the caramel and drizzling the patterns on the parchment. (Hint: allow the spoon to unload into the pan for a few seconds before attempting doodad. This will allow a narrower stream.) Quick back and forth motions or side to side movements are best. It&#39;s all in the wrist. Allow doodads to cool for 15 minutes then peel the paper off (not the other way around). Stack in an airtight container with wax paper between each piece. After making 15 to 20 doodads, you should have sufficient caramel remaining to move on to the sauce phase. So, return the remaining caramel to medium high heat and continue cooking until you see the first sign of smoke. Immediately remove from the heat, and add the cream, all at once, at arms length. (It will boil furiously.) Once the mixture calms down, return to medium heat and boil 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool to room temperature, move to squirt bottle and refrigerate for up to a week. To make the bananas brulee, quarter the bananas (peel on) and rub into sugar to coat thoroughly. Remove peel and place on cooling rack over several layers of foil. (Don&#39;t try this on your dining room table.) Don your safety goggles and fire up your torch. Hold the torch so that the very tip of the flame barely touches the banana, and move quickly back and forth until the sugar melts, turns brown, and bubbles. As soon as it looks like caramel, move on. You know you&#39;ve got it down when a solid, glasslike sheet of gold (no graininess) has formed on the banana. To do the split (so to speak), squirt a pattern of caramel sauce on a chilled plate, top with 4 banana pieces (Lincoln log style), top with the ice cream of your choice (we like our peachy vanilla from Churn Baby Churn), and finally, a doodad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54671,&quot;Colombian Chicken Stew: Sancocho 7 cloves garlic 3 medium carrots, chopped 1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped 1 green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped 1 small Spanish onion, chopped 1 habanero cl, chopped 2 cups chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 gallon water 3 low-sodium chicken bouillon cubes 1 tablespoon ground cumin Salt and pepper One 3-to 4-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces 1 small yucca, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces 1 green plantain, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces 5 all-purpose potatoes, halved 2 ripe plantains, peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces 4 ears corn, cut in 3 pieces Instructions: In a blender, puree the garlic, carrots, peppers, onion, cl, and 1 cup cilantro.

Add the egg whites, almond extract and orange blossom water or rosewater, if using, and stir with a spatula to combine. At first it will seem like there is not enough liquid to hold everything together, but just keep on mixing and it will eventually form a dough. Pat the dough into 2 discs, then wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and position two racks in the center of the oven. Use your hands to grease the kransekake molds liberally with butter or coconut oil, then set aside. (I prefer to set the molds on large baking sheets so that they&#39;re easier to move around.)<br> Working with one dough disc at a time, chop off a piece of dough and roll it into a rope that&#39;s a generous 1/2-inch thick (or, if you&#39;re pulling your kitchen ruler out, just go with 5/8-inch thick), dusting with additional almond flour if the dough is sticky. Coil the rope into the molds, then pinch off any excess dough and pinch the ends to seal them together. Continue the process, re-rolling scraps as needed, until all of the molds are filled. Don&#39;t worry about overworking the dough! Bake until golden; begin checking for doneness at 9 minutes. You&#39;ll likely need to bake these layers in batches, which is totally fine; just keep any dough that you&#39;re not working with covered and in the refrigerator.<br> Let the rings cool in the pans, then carefully pop them out (a small offset spatula or butter knife will help) and transfer to a baking sheet or wire rack.<br> Stack the rings up using dots of the royal icing as \glue\ (I do dots at 12 o&#39;clock, 3 o&#39;clock, 6 o&#39;clock and 9 o&#39;clock).

Use a boning knife to butterfly flank steak: Working across the grain, make a cut down the center, but only halfway through meat. At the top of that cut, make perpendicular cuts, one in each direction, this time with the grain. Again, cut only halfway into steak. Repeat perpendicular cuts at the other end of the center cut. Cuts should resemble the letter H. At the top of the original center cut, hold the knife parallel to the meat and insert knife. Slice toward you, making a pocket. This cut should almost reach the outer edge, halfway through the meat&#39;s thickness. Repeat on other side. Open the flaps. Season meat liberally on both sides with salt and pepper, then place it cut-side up, wide side facing you. Season with marjoram, cumin and garlic and cover it with a fairly even layer of parsley-cilantro mix. Then arrange carrots, olives, and onions horizontally over the full width of the meat. Scatter a relatively even layer of watercress over all. Roll meat up from the bottom like a jellyroll; grain of steak should run length of roll. Tie in 3 or 4 places with butcher&#39;s twine. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or roasting pan large enough to accommodate rolled steak. Deeply brown it on all sides, about 15 minutes total, then transfer pan to oven and roast for about 30 minutes, until meat is cooked through. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes before serving. Or, put meat in a clean baking dish, weight it with a plate with something heavy on it and chill overnight.

Peel the potatoes, and cut each into 3 by cutting off each end at a slant so that you are left with a wedge or triangle in the middle. Place the potatoes into salted cold water in a saucepan, and bring them to a boil. Boil the potatoes for 4 minutes. Drain the excess water from the potatoes using a colander and then tip the potatoes back into the empty saucepan. Sprinkle the semolina over the top of the potatoes. Hold a lid firmly on top of the pan and shake the potatoes around to coat them well and so that their edges disintegrate or fuzz and blur a little: this facilitates the crunch effect later. Place the goose fat into a large roasting tin and heat in the oven until very hot. Then carefully place the semolina-coated potatoes into the hot fat and roast the potatoes in the oven for 45 minutes to an hour or until they are darkly golden and crisp, turning them over halfway through cooking. If the oven is hot enough they probably will not need more than about 25 minutes a side; and it&#39;s better to let them sit in the oven (you can always pour off most of the fat and leave them in the tin) until the very last minute. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54689,&quot;Chilled Spring Pea Soup with Crab Salad, Creme Fraiche, and Mint Kosher salt 1/2 cup sliced shallots 1/4 cup sliced garlic 1 tablespoon toasted coriander seeds Freshly cracked black pepper 1 Fresno cl, sliced, seeds and stem included 4 cups shelled English peas 3 to 4 cups creme fraiche, cold 1 small bunch mint, leaves picked 2 cups Jonah crabmeat, picked through for shells 1/4 cup torn mint leaves Salt and freshly cracked black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1/4 cup sliced scallions 2 limes, zested and juiced 2 pickled Fresno chiles, minced, recipe follows 8 snow peas, julienned 2 pounds Fresno chiles Sherry vinegar Sugar Kosher salt 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons black peppercorns 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 4 sprigs fresh marjoram 3 garlic cloves Instructions: For the soup: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium heat. Add enough salt to make it taste like the ocean. Add the shallots, garlic, coriander seeds, freshly cracked black pepper, to taste, and sliced chiles, and bring back to a boil. Taste the water and season with salt, if needed. Add the English peas, bring the soup back to a boil and allow it to cook until the peas are al dente, about 30 to 45 seconds. Using a strainer or spider, add the pea mixture to a blender with 2 ladlefuls of flavored liquid, the creme fraiche and the mint leaves. Puree until smooth. Pour through a wired mesh strainer into a bowl over an ice bath to cool very quickly. Continue to stir until chilled. Taste for seasoning. For the crab salad: To a large bowl, add the crabmeat, mint leaves, salt and pepper, to taste, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, sliced scallions, lime zest, lime juice, and the chiles. Lightly toss with a fork. Do not overwork. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed. Ladle the soup into serving bowl. Top each bowl with a large spoonful of the salad. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and garnish with julienned snow peas. Pack the chiles into 2 (1-quart) jars and cover them with water to come within 1/2-inch of the rim. Pour the water out into a measuring cup. Note the volume, pour off half the water, and replace it with sherry vinegar. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and 2 tablespoons salt for every 3 cups liquid. Pour the vinegar mixture into a nonreactive saucepan and add the bay leaves, coriander seeds, black peppercorns, cumin seeds, marjoram, and garlic. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.

Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted, about 1 1/2 minutes. Pour about three-quarters of the sifted confectioners&#39; sugar into the marshmallows and stir to combine. Once the mixture becomes too stiff to stir, grease your counter and hands with shortening (or wear greased latex gloves) and dump the mixture onto the counter. Knead, adding more confectioners&#39; sugar a little at a time, until the fondant is very smooth, not sticky and holds its shape in a ball without relaxing. Use right away or grease it lightly with additional shortening, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for several days. (Let return to room temperature before using.) For the flowers and butterflies: Divide the fondant into 3 pieces. Working with one piece at a time, made an indentation in the top with your thumb and drop in food coloring (start with about 4 drops). Grease your hands and counter with shortening (or wear greased latex gloves). Knead the dough until the color is even, adding more food coloring if you want it darker. Wrap in plastic while you repeat with the remaining pieces of dough and different colors. To make a rose, pinch off a walnut-size ball of the fondant color of your choice. Very lightly dust your work surface with confectioners&#39; sugar (just enough so it doesn&#39;t stick; you don&#39;t want the fondant to look dusty). Roll the fondant to a scant 1/8-inch thickness. Use a small round cutter (about 1 1/4 inch) and punch out 10 to 12 rounds. Roll the first round around itself to create the inside of the rose. Continue to roll the pieces around each other, starting one petal halfway after the previous. Press the bottom together and peel the petals back slightly to open the rose. To make a daisy, pinch off a walnut-size ball of the fondant color of your choice. Very lightly dust your work surface with confectioners&#39; sugar (just enough so it doesn&#39;t stick; you don&#39;t want the fondant to look dusty). Roll to a scant 1/8-inch thickness. Use a 6-petal flower cutter (any size between 2 and 2 1/2 inches) to cut out as many flowers as you can. Use a toothpick to press a line down the center of each petal. For each flower, roll some fondant in a contrasting color into a ball slightly smaller than the center of the flower. Press to flatten slightly and poke the top all over lightly with a toothpick . Brush the bottom lightly with water and stick it in the center of the flower. Lay the flowers inside an egg carton to dry so the petals stand up, 2 to 3 hours. To make a butterfly, pinch off a walnut-sized ball of the fondant color of your choice. Very lightly dust your work surface with confectioners&#39; sugar (just enough so it doesn&#39;t stick; you don&#39;t want the fondant to look dusty). Roll the fondant to a scant 1/8-inch thickness. Use a 6-petal flower cutter (any size between 2 and 2 1/2 inches) to cut out a few daisy shapes. Cut and remove the top and bottom petal with a paring knife, leaving a V-shaped notch; the 4 remaining petals should look like a butterfly&#39;s wings. Pinch off 4 tiny pieces of fondant in a different color and roll into balls. Flatten to make spots for the butterfly&#39;s wings and attach to the wings, using a little water to adhere. Pinch off a small piece of fondant in a third color and roll into a snake about 2 inches long. Snip the top third in half lengthwise with scissors and pull apart to make antennae. Attach to the body with a little water. Lay a piece of parchment over a rolling pin and lay the butterfly on it, face-down, to dry, about 4 hours and up to overnight.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 54694,&quot;Eggplant Sandwiches 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 8 slices (1/2-inch thick) eggplant 1 egg, lightly beaten Salt and pepper Pesto to taste 8 slices (1/4-inch thick) fresh mozzarella 4 whole fresh basil leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet. Dip the eggplant in egg and fry the eggplant for about 3 to 4 minutes a side or until tender. Set the eggplant slices on a baking pan and season each slice with salt and pepper. Spread each slice of eggplant with pesto and top with a slice of mozzarella cheese. Bake for 5 minutes or until the mozzarella melts. Set one eggplant slice on top of the other if you wish, to form more of a towering sandwich and garnish with fresh basil leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 54695,&quot;Pork Chops with Applesauce and Grits 8 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 yellow onion, chopped<br> 2 cups stone-ground grits (the coarser the better!)<br> 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br> 2 cups heavy cream<br> Dash of cayenne, or to taste<br> 1 1/2 cups grated Monterey Jack or other cheese<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Six 1/2-inch-thick boneless pork chops<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cups Applesauce, recipe follows 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar<br> 3/4 cup pure maple syrup<br> 6 pounds mixed apple varieties (Gala, Honeycrisp, Golden Delicious), peeled, cored and cut into eighths 1 cup apple juice or water<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> 1/2 cup light brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon cinnamon<br> Instructions: For the grits: In a large pot over medium heat, cook the bacon and onions until the bacon is chewy and the onions are translucent, about 1 minute. Pour in the grits and add the chicken broth. Stir together and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 40 minutes. Add the cream and cayenne, stirring them into the grits. Cover the pot and keep cooking over very low heat, stirring occasionally to keep them from sticking, until the grits are tender but still have a bite to them, another 20 to 30 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste. For the pork chops: Melt the butter with the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Add the pork chops to the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. (They&#39;ll finish cooking in the skillet later.) Remove the pork chops to a plate. Put the skillet back on the heat, add the Applesauce and pour in the wine and vinegar. Cook until the liquid reduces by half, about 5 minutes. Pour in the maple syrup, stir it in and allow it to come to a bubble. Add the pork chops to the skillet, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for another 20 minutes. To serve, spoon a generous helping of grits onto a plate. Lay a pork chop on top of the grits, and then spoon the apples over the top. Be sure to get a little extra pan sauce onto the plate. Throw the apples, apple juice and lemon juice into a pan and bring it to the boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until the apples are soft, about 15 minutes. Stir through the sugar and mix until melted. Add the cinnamon and stir through. Puree the mixture in a food processor, blender or food mill.

Place 3 tablespoons of the butter and the starter in the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and work on low speed until creamy and homogeneous, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and sift the flour mixture over the creamed starter, return the mixer to low and work until a soft dough forms, about 1 minute more. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 equal pieces. Press each piece into a 1/4-inch-thick rectangle and wrap in individual pieces of plastic wrap. Refrigerate between 8 and 24 hours (see Cook&#39;s Note). Place two racks nearest the center of the oven and heat to 350 degrees F. Line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper. Retrieve one piece of dough from the refrigerator and dust both the dough and your pasta maker with flour. (Continue to dust the pasta roller and the dough as needed to prevent sticking.) Starting on the widest setting, typically labeled \1,\ feed the dough through the roller. Then fold the dough into thirds, as you would a letter, turn 90 degrees and run it through again. Fold the dough into thirds again, turn, and pass it through the roller. Adjust your pasta maker to the next setting and roll the dough through 3 times without folding. Repeat this step 3 times more on both the 3rd and 4th settings. Transfer the dough to one of the prepared half-sheet pans and repeat the process with the remaining dough, arranging two sheets of dough per pan. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and brush onto the dough. Sprinkle with a generous pinch of kosher salt. Dock the dough thoroughly with a fork and cut into 1-inch squares with a pizza wheel. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the pans 180 degrees and rotate from top to bottom. Continue baking until the crackers just begin to brown around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and immediately transfer the crackers on the parchment to a rack to cool completely before serving, about 20 minutes. Lid tightly and store at room temperature. To begin: Mix together 125 grams flour and 125 grams water with a clean hand in a medium glass bowl. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let sit undisturbed at room temperature until the mixture is full of bubbles and has nearly doubled in size, usually 2 to 3 days. During this time, yeasts and bacteria from the air and from the flour and probably from you will set up housekeeping in the bowl (see Cook&#39;s Note). For daily feeding: Peel back any crust that may have formed and transfer 20% of the culture (50 grams) to a clean, wide-mouthed jar. Stir in 100 grams flour and 100 grams water, loosely screw on the lid and stash at room temperature for 24 hours. (The culture will have a stinky-sour smell at this point.) Discard the rest of the original mixture. Repeat step 2 every 24 hours for 5 days. By then the culture should smell yeasty-sweet-sour, which means you&#39;re ready to put the starter to work. The cheese crackers are to be made with the discarded percentage of starter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 54705,&quot;Chicken and Peaches 2 tablespoons butter 4 peaches, pitted, thickly sliced or halved 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 pieces boneless, skinless chicken thighs 2 pieces boneless, skinless chicken breast Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 shallot, chopped 1 (2-inch) piece ginger, grated or minced 3/4 cup chicken stock 2/3 cup peach preserves 2 teaspoons hot sauce (recommended: Frank&#39;s Red Hot) 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce Instructions: Heat a medium skillet with the butter over medium heat. Add the peaches and the juice of 1/2 lemon, and cook until tender and lightly golden, 10 minutes. Turn off the heat. While the peaches cook, heat 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan, in a large skillet over medium-high to high heat. Cut the chicken breasts in half across the center of each breast to make 4 equal portions. Add the chicken breasts and thighs to the pan and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 12 minutes, then remove to a plate and cover with foil. Drizzle the pan with the remaining extra-virgin olive oil, half a turn of the pan. Add the chopped shallot, and the ginger, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the stock, the preserves, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce and season with black pepper, to taste. Cook over medium heat for a couple of minutes to thicken. Arrange the chicken and peaches on a platter and douse with peach sauce. Portions are 1 piece of light meat and 1 thigh per person. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54706,&quot;Stuffed Cheesy Pizza Bones 4 ounces part-skim, low-moisture mozzarella 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons dried oregano 2 tablespoons sesame seeds 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon flaky salt 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 1 pound pizza dough, at room temperature 4 teaspoons whole milk ricotta 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted Marinara sauce, warmed, for serving Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment. Cut the mozzarella into 1/2-by-1/2-by-2-inch-long sticks and set aside. Mix together the Parmesan, oregano, sesame seeds, red pepper flakes, salt and garlic together in a bowl; set aside. Pat the pizza dough into a 16-by-8-inch rectangle with a long side facing you. Using a sharp knife or pizza wheel, cut the dough in half lengthwise. Quarter each piece so you have eight 4-by-4-inch squares. Spread 1/2 teaspoon ricotta in the middle of a square and place a piece of mozzarella on top. Fold the dough over the cheese to completely encase it. Starting from the center, pinch the seams closed, carefully pushing out any air as you go. Repeat with the remaining dough and cheese. Working one at a time, put a piece of dough into the seasoning mixture and press down firmly to coat all sides. On a clean, dry work surface roll the dough gently but firmly into a torpedo shape that is about 10 inches long. Tie the dough into a knot at each end and place it seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pieces of stuffed dough.

Sprinkle the exterior with salt and place on a hot grill top for 3 minutes. Flip and cook another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and baste generously with the BBQ sauce. Flip and continue cooking for a couple more minutes, continuously flipping and basting the burgers. For the bread: Place the rack in the middle of the oven and set the oven to broil. Mix the melted butter with the garlic and brush on the cut sides of the bread. Top with the cheese and place under the broiler just until the edges are lightly crisped, about 2 minutes. For the sandwich build: After your beautiful garlic bread is done, place 2 burgers on each bottom half of bread. Top with some pickles and the top half of the garlic bread. Slice each portion in half, yielding 4 sandwiches. Serve with the remaining BBQ sauce on the side and get ready to impress your family and friends. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 54730,&quot;Arroz Amarillo with Peas Juice of 1/2 lemon 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, loosely packed 1/4 cup olive oil 1 medium onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 cup long-grain white rice 2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade 1 cup fresh peas or frozen petits pois 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a small saucer, stir together the lemon juice and the saffron and leave to soak for 15 minutes. In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute more, until the aroma of the garlic is released. Add the rice and stir for 3 to 4 minutes, until the kernels are slightly toasty and make a clicking noise on the pan. Stir in the lemon juice and saffron mixture, then add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the fresh peas, if using, otherwise add the frozen peas during the last 10 minutes of cooking time. Reduce the heat so that the liquid is simmering. Cover and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54731,&quot;Texas French Toast Bananas Foster 3 eggs 1/3 cup milk, preferably whole 1/3 cup heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) 1/8 teaspoon sea salt 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 cup unsalted butter 2 cups packed brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup dark rum 1 tablespoon creme de banana liqueur, optional 3 bananas, peeled and sliced 6 thick bread slices, preferably French toast bread (brioche) or Texas toast Instructions: Batter: In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients until a smooth batter is formed. Sauce: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter, then add the brown sugar. Stir continuously until the sugar has dissolved. Add the cinnamon and orange juice and bring to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat, pour in the rum and creme de banana, if using, then return the pan to the heat. Brush down the sides of the pan with water using a pastry brush. Remove from heat. In a small saute pan, add 1/4 cup of the caramel sauce and the bananas. Saute over high heat until just warmed through. Keep warm. Toast: Preheat a griddle or a nonstick pan over high heat. Dip the bread slices into the batter, then put them on the griddle, turning over after 2 minutes. To each serving plate, add 1/4 cup of the caramel sauce and top with the French toast. Spoon the bananas, over the toast and drizzle with some of the caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Merlot]</p><p>&quot; 54732,&quot;Americana Banana Roll 1 cup sifted cake flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon baking powder 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 large egg, room temperature 1/2 cup (1 large) mashed ripe banana 1 tablespoon sour cream 1 teaspoon lemon zest 5 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream 2 tablespoons sour cream 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup fresh raspberries, room temperature 3 tablespoons red currant jelly Instructions: Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 375 degrees. Using a paper towel, lightly grease a small area in the center of a 12 x 15 1/2 x 1/2-inch baking sheet with solid shortening, and line the pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang at each short end (the dab of shortening holds the foil in place). Lightly grease the foil with shortening, and sprinkle with allpurpose flour. Shake the pan to distribute flour, and tap out excess. Pour the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in that order into the triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper to distribute the ingredients; set aside. Crack the egg into a small bowl, and whisk briefly just to combine the yolk and white. Combine the mashed banana, sour cream, and lemon zest in a small bowl; set aside. Place the butter in the bowl of a heavyduty mixer. With the flat beater (paddle), cream the butter on medium speed (#5) for 30 to 45 seconds, or until it is smooth and lighter in color. (This is a small amount in a large bowl, but you can adjust most heavyduty machines so the attachment reaches lower in the bowl.) Maintaining the same speed, add the sugar in a steady stream. Then stop the mixer, and scrape the mixture slinging to the sides into the center of the bowl. Continue to cream at the same speed until the mixture is light in color and fluffy in appearance (about 3 to 4 minutes). With the mixer still on medium speed, pour in the egg, very cautiously at first, as if you were adding oil when making mayonnaise. Continue to cream for 1 to 2 more minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl at least once. When the mixture is quite fluffy and has increased in volume, detach the beater and bowl. Tap the beater against the edge of the bowl to free the excess. With the aid of a metal spatula, lift half the flour mixture, and sprinkle it over the creamed mixture. Stir it in with a rubber spatula. Then add the mashed banana mixture, stirring to blend. Scrape the sides of the bowl with each addition. Add the remaining flour mixture, and stir until smooth. Scoop the thick batter onto five different areas over twothirds of the prepared baking sheet. With a metal spatula, spread and coax the batter to cover the twothirds of the sheet. Now extend it to the rest of the sheet in as even a layer as possible. (At first you will not believe it will cover the entire sheet, but it will. You do not have to rush. The layer will be very thin, but that is just the way it should be. It will increase in volume in the oven.) Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cake is light golden brown, the sides are beginning to contract from the metal, and the cake springs back when lightly touched in the center. Remove the pan from the oven. Using a thinbladed knife, gently release any portion of the cake sticking to the long sides of the pan. Pull up on the foil overhangs, one at a time, to release foil from the pan&#39;s edges. Finally, loosen foil from the bottom of the pan by gently lifting up on the flaps, and transfer it to a large rack to cool. Place a sheet of foil over the cake, and manipulate the foil in a tent fashion (this holds in the moisture as it cools, but prevents sticking to the cake). Cool for 30 minutes. Combine the filling ingredients in a 1 1/2 quart deep mixing bowl, and whip them until some cream dropped from the beater or whisk does not disappear on the surface of the mixture in the bowl. Another test is to draw the beater or whisk through the center of the cream in the bowl; if the track stays in place, you are ready to spread the filling on the cake. The cream will appear soft, shiny, and smooth but stiffer than for most desserts. It will coat the cake layer, sticking to it and staying in place when rolled. Assembling The Dessert: Lift the cake on its sheet of foil so that one of its long sides is parallel to the edge of your counter. (The cake will be rolled lengthwise.) Spread the cream evenly over the cake with a rubber spatula, up to 1 inch before reaching the long end farthest from you. (Some of the filling will move to that end as you roll.) Begin rolling by flipping the edge of the cake nearest you over onto itself. Then, with the aid of the foil that extends on either side of the cake, roll the cake lengthwise until you reach the other end. With you hands, wrap some of the roil around the roll to assist you in rounding the shape as you work toward the other end of the cake (otherwise, the cake will stick to your hands). Cut each end of the roll on the diagonal for eye appeal, and sprinkle a light coating of powdered sugar over it to disguise any cracks in the cake. Lift it onto a serving plate with the aid of a long, wide spatula or a baking sheet without sides. If desired, decorate top of roll with Glazed Raspberries. To decorate the top of the roll, place the raspberries into a 3 quart bowl. Heat currant jelly just until it&#39;s almost melted, but not hot. Pour the jelly through a strainer over the berries (push it through the strainer with a rubber spatula.) Gently slide the rubber spatula under the berries, and fold the two together. Repeat this three more times. The object is to coat the berries evenly. Carefully scoop the raspberries on top of the cake, down the length of the roll.

Slice each zucchini on the diagonal into 12 slices (24 slices total). Brush one side of each zucchini slice with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Working in 2 batches, place them oil-side down on the grill pan and cook for 2 minutes. Flip each slice and continue grilling until they have grill marks but are still somewhat firm, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool. Slice the mozzarella into 6 slices, then cut each slice in half. Slice each tomato into 6 slices crosswise (12 slices total). To make the dressing: Combine the mayonnaise, pesto and vinegar in a small bowl and stir together until well combined. To assemble the sliders: Top a slice of grilled zucchini with 1 teaspoon of the dressing. Arrange one of the half-slices of mozzarella on the dressed zucchini slice so that it fits the zucchini. Arrange a slice of tomato on top, followed by a basil leaf. Spread a teaspoon of the dressing on a new slice of zucchini and top the stack as if building a sandwich. Secure the slider with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining ingredients until you have 12 sliders.

Sprinkle and cover both sides of the tuna steaks with the blackened spice mix. (You will have leftover spice mix that you can store for future use. The blackened spice is great on any meat.) Coat a large skillet with olive oil and put over high heat. Sear the tuna on both sides, about 15 seconds. Remove, slice and set aside. For the Cajun shrimp: Fill a saucepan over half full with water and put over high heat. Add the Cajun seasoning and shrimp to the water. Once you start seeing the water come to a boil, the shrimp are done. They only need a few minutes. Drain the shrimp in a strainer and put to the side. For the crab salad: Add the crab, mayo and sriracha to a bowl and mix. Set aside. For the spicy mayo: Add the mayo and sriracha to a bowl and mix. Set aside. For the taco salad bowl: Fill a deep pot with 5 to 6 inches of oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Place a tortilla in the middle of the pot and push down with a ladle to create a bowl shape. Keep the tortilla emerged in the oil until the tortilla turns a golden brown color, 1 to 2 minutes. Once done, flip the tortilla over and fry the other side for an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and set aside. (Alternatively, premade taco bowls can be purchased in any Latin markets.) Arrange the shredded lettuce in the center of a plate. Alternate the avocado and tuna slices around the rim of the plate. Put the shrimp in the center of the bed of lettuce. Drizzle with some of the spicy mayo, eel sauce and sriracha around the rim of plate over the avocado and tuna slices. Place the taco salad shell upside down on top of the lettuce and shrimp.

Make a well in the center and add egg, yolk and salt. Combine slowly with milk to form a smooth batter. Allow to stand 4 hours. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a crepe pan. Place a small ladleful of batter into the pan and roll it around until it covers the pan base. Cook until waxy bubbles appear on the surface then turn the crepe over with a palette knife. Finish cooking and remove to a plate. Continue until 8 crepes are made. Poach celery for 5 minutes in boiling salted water. Place clarified butter into a casserole dish on top of the stove. Add the carrot and onion and fry until golden. Add the chicken, cover and allow to steam 10 minutes. Add cold water to cover, bring to a boil, and simmer for 1 1/4 hours. Remove chicken and cut into small pieces and reduce chicken stock to 2 1/2 cups. Strain. To make the sauce, melt the butter in a pan and add the flour. Stir to form a roux and whisk in the milk to form a thick sauce. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add the wine and simmer 10 minutes. Add the chicken stock and simmer 5 minutes longer. Add poached celery to the chicken flesh and then combine with 2 cups of the sauce. Add 3 tablespoons of cheese to remaining sauce. Lay crepes onto an ovenproof dish.

Grease a 13 by 9 by 2 inch pan, an 8inch oven-proof bowl and a 6 inch loaf pan. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar, then beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the cooled, melted chocolate and the vanilla extract, then gradually stir in the milk. In a separate bowl, sift the flour, baking soda and salt. Slowly add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, stirring until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pans, about two thirds full (begin with the loaf pan, followed by the bowl and then the baking pan). Bake the 13 by 9 by 2 inch pan and the bowl for 45 to 50 minutes, and the loaf pan for 35 to 40 minutes. Insert a toothpick into the center to see if the cakes are done. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, vanilla extract and melted chocolate. In a separate bowl, sift the confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa powder. Gradually add it to the butter mixture, blending well after each addition. Mix in enough milk to make the frosting \muddy.<br> For the decorations:<br> To create the roof on the Witch&#39;s House, cut the corners off one end of the small loaf cake (a job for older kids). Place the house in the 2 by 3-inch slot, securing it with toothpicks or a bamboo skewer. Then \paint\ the house with orange frosting.<br> Tile the roof of the house with chocolate graham crackers and frosting. Add a few scary details: windows made of broken chocolate cones with orange icing grids and a peanut cookie door with a candy doorknob. Surround the house with shoestring licorice barbed wire. Then add a flying witch. Use a toothpick to attach the witch&#39;s face (a gumdrop cut in half, lengthwise) to her hat (a chocolate cone) and to her broomstick (licorice with three slits cut in the end).<br> Cover a large cutting board or piece of cardboard with aluminum foil. Place the 13 by 9 by 2inch cake on the top of the foil to create the \graveyard.\ On one end, place the bowl-shaped cake to create the \hill.\ Generously frost the graveyard and hill. Next, cut a 2 by 3-inch rectangle, about 1 inch deep, on top of the hill to accommodate the house. To create the gravestones, break peanut cookies in half and pipe on scary sayings with orange frosting (R.I.P., Boo and so on). Secure in the muddy frosting. Next, make ghosts in the trees. Use scissors to cut three crooked branches in a piece of licorice. Tuck two mini marshmallows between the branches and place tree on a piece of waxed paper. Microwave for 10 seconds to slightly melt the ghost. Give the ghost two mini chocolate chip eyes, then plant the trees in the mud. Next, add the creepy walkway leading up to the house. Draw a crooked path from the base of the cake up to the witch&#39;s door with a toothpick (use this as your guideline). Outline the path with chocolate-covered raisins, then sprinkle with broken green hard candies. At the entrance to the pathway, add a chocolate graham cracker drawbridge. For a frightful finishing touch, outline the graveyard with broken chocolate cone fencing. Set the Witch&#39;s House in a place for all to see and scream at. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 54752,&quot;Smoked Cheddar Hush Puppies Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup cornmeal<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup sliced pickled okra<br> 1/2 cup shredded smoked Cheddar<br> 1/2 cup corn kernels<br> 3 scallions, sliced<br> 1 large egg, lightly beaten<br> Honey mustard, for serving<br> Instructions: Pour enough oil in a large Dutch oven to fill about a third of the way.

Using a mandoline or a sharp knife, slice the plantains into very thin slices, about 1/8-inch thickness. Pour the oil into a large, heavy bottomed pot and heat it to 350 degrees F. The oil level should come one-third of the way up the sides of the pot. If there is too much oil, it will overflow when the chips are added. Alternatively, use a deep-fryer. Fry the plantain slices in batches in the hot oil until crispy and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir them a bit while they fry to prevent them from sticking together. Remove the plantains and drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with the spice mixture and serve. Alternatively, the plantain chips can be cooled and stored in an airtight container for up to 10 days. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54754,&quot;Tex Mex Shrimp and Squash Grain Bowl with Avocado Dressing 1 cup uncooked quinoa 3 cups 2-inch chunks butternut squash Olive oil cooking spray, for the squash<br> 2 teaspoons ground cumin<br> Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 small avocado, pitted and peeled 3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk<br> 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1/2 jalapeno, optional<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, optional<br> Juice of 1 lime, plus additional if needed Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 teaspoons minced garlic<br> 1/3 cup chopped red onion<br> 1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined<br> 1 teaspoon chili powder<br> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 3 cups chopped kale leaves<br> Juice of 1 lime, plus additional for garnish<br> Garnish: chopped fresh cilantro, sliced green onions Instructions: For the squash: Prepare the quinoa according to the package instructions.

Cook the pancetta with 1 tablespoon water in a large saute pan over medium heat until crispy and most of the fat has rendered, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes. Pierce the potatoes all over with a fork and put in a large paper bag. Fold the top of the bag over several times. Microwave on high for about 15 minutes, carefully flipping the bag every 5 minutes. The potatoes are done once a cake tester or skewer easily pierces the flesh. Remove the potatoes from the bag and put on a baking sheet. Allow the potatoes to cool for 5 minutes. Once the pancetta is crispy, use a slotted spoon to transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Stir the half-and-half, a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper into the rendered fat. Use a sharp paring knife to cut a lengthwise slit in the center of each potato. Carefully remove the flesh, leaving about 1/2-inch around the inside. Reserve 1/2 cup of the potato flesh for another use. Place the remaining flesh in a mixing bowl along with the half-and-half mixture, 2 1/2 cups of the Parmesan, the scallion whites, half of the pancetta and a large pinch of salt. Mash with a potato masher until mostly smooth. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Scoop the mashed potato mixture back into the skins. Make a large well in each potato deep enough to hold an egg and crack an egg into the well. Bake until the egg is just starting to set, about 10 minutes. Remove the potatoes and cover the eggs with the remaining Parmesan. Switch the oven to broil and broil until the eggs no longer wiggle when you shake the baking sheet, 3 to 5 minutes, checking frequently. To serve, top each potato with the reserved crispy pancetta and scallion greens and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 54756,&quot;Chorizo, Spinach and Chickpea Saute 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided 1/2 pound Mexican chorizo, casing removed One 19-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1/4 onion, sliced 1 cup diced button mushrooms 1/2 cup marinated artichoke hearts 2 teaspoons minced garlic 2 pounds fresh baby spinach 1/4 cup chicken stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Put 1 tablespoon olive oil in saute pan, add chorizo, breaking apart as it cooks.

Bake until the salami slices are browned (much like bacon), watching closely to ensure they brown evenly, about 10 minutes. They will crisp as they cool. Transfer the salami bacon to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to absorb the excess oil. Set aside to cool. For Burgers: Combine the pork, onion, garlic, salt, Greek seasoning and black pepper in a large bowl and mix just until evenly combined, do not overmix). Form the meat mixture into 4 equal patties a little larger in diameter than the kaiser rolls, so that when they shrink after cooking they will fit the roll perfectly. Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to medium heat. Once the grill is hot, cook the burgers until the juices run clear and patties are firm to the touch, about 6 minutes per side. Do not overcook or the burgers will be dry and tasteless. Top each burger with 2 slices of the provolone cheese during the last 2 minutes of cooking to melt the cheese. Remove the burgers to a plate and tent with foil and allow to rest for a couple of minutes while you prepare the rolls. Whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl. To assemble the burgers: Split the rolls in half and toast the cut surfaces lightly on the grill or in pan, just before the patties are done.

For the frying: In a large pot or fryer, bring at least 2 inches of peanut oil to 375 degrees F. Using 2 spoons or a medium ice cream scoop, scoop out some batter and slowly lower it into the oil. Drop in a few more and cook, flipping if needed, until the hush puppies float and are golden all around, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to a wire rack over a baking sheet and season with a sprinkle of salt. Repeat with the remaining batter. For the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, hot sauce and sugar. Use as a dipping sauce for the hush puppies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 54769,&quot;Baby Lima Beans Braised in Lemon 3 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest 1/3 cup olive oil 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced 3/4 cup pine nuts, toasted (see Note) 6 cups fresh or frozen baby lima beans (about 2 pounds) I 1/4 cups water Juice of I lemon 3/4 tablespoon coarse sea salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 8 green onions, thinly sliced 1/2 bunch fresh mint, leaves only, cut into chiffonade Instructions: Mash the butter together with the lemon zest and set aside. In a large heavy skillet heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the jalapeno, pine nuts, lima beans, water, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat so that the liquid is simmering. Simmer uncovered for about 8 minutes, until the beans have absorbed all the liquid. If the beans are still not tender and they have absorbed all the water, add a little more hot water. When the beans are tender, stir in the green onions and remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon butter and the mint, taste for seasoning, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 54770,&quot;Yum Yum Shrimp Taco 2 cups sugar 1 cup unfiltered apple juice<br> 1 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1/2 cup lime juice<br> 1 cup mango puree<br> 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons red crushed pepper 2 habaneros, minced Zest from 2 to 3 limes (reserve the limes for the dressing) 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1/4 kosher salt<br> 1/4 tablespoon ground black pepper<br> 1 cup lime juice 1 cup soy sauce<br> 1/3 cup mirin<br> 1/3 cup olive oil<br> 1/4 sriracha<br> 1/2 daikon, grated 1 small to medium napa cabbage<br> 2 bunch scallions<br> 1 large carrot<br> Vegetable oil, for cooking 2 1/2 pounds 21/25 shrimp, peeled and deveined 8 flour tortillas<br> 1 bunch fresh cilantro, optional<br> Sriracha, for serving Instructions: For the mango ginger habanero glaze: In a large pot over medium heat, add sugar, unfiltered apple juice, apple cider vinegar, lime juice and 1 cup water. Stir until sugar dissolves. Add mango puree, ginger, red crushed pepper and habaneros. Stir well and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until mixture has cooked down to half the amount and is thick and sticky, 2 to 3 hours. Cool and transfer to a squirt bottle for easy application. For the sweet lime pepper: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 170 degrees F. Spread the lime zest on a baking sheet and bake 1 hour, then blend into a powder with a high-powered blender. Mix lime powder in a bowl with the sugar, salt and pepper and, boom, you got some Sweet Lime Pepper. For the soy lime dressing: In a small bowl, whisk lime juice, soy, mirin, olive oil and sriracha. Transfer to a squirt bottle for easy application. Dressing tends to separate, so shake or stir before use. For the slaw: Gather grated daikon in a ball or cheesecloth and squeeze out all the excess water. (Avoiding this step will lead to very wet tacos.) Peel any bruised or wilted leaves from cabbage and thinly chop about 2 inches from the bottom, avoiding the core. Chop the scallions and carrots. Mix all ingredients in a large bowl and reserve for later. For the yum yum shrimp tacos: Preheat a flat griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Oil pan with vegetable oil and drop shrimp in pan. Sprinkle generously with sweet lime pepper, then cook for 2 minutes. Flip and cover again with sweet lime pepper and cook for 2 minutes. Add some mango habanero glaze and toss shrimp until a little caramelization forms on the shrimp (being careful not to burn them), another 2 to 3 minutes. Line 2 shells with a handful of the slaw, then add soy lime dressing. Add cilantro if using. Place shrimp atop the tacos, then top with sriracha. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 54771,&quot;Giant&#39;s Thumbprint Butter Cookies 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 1/4 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise, soft insides scraped out 1/8 teaspoon salt 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup apricot, raspberry, or another jam of your choice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Add the carrots and cook, stirring constantly, until just tender, but not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and set aside; reserve the skillet.<br> For the eggs: Whisk together the eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until incorporated. Wipe the skillet clean. Add the vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat. Pour in the eggs and and swirl the pan until the mixture covers the entire surface area. Cook until the eggs are set on the bottom, about 1 minute. Flip carefully to keep the egg crepe in one piece and cook 1 minute more. Slide onto a plate or cutting board to cool, then cut the crepe into 4 equal strips horizontally. Layer all the strips together and cut into 1/4-inch strips, then set aside; reserve the skillet.<br> For the mushrooms: Wipe the skillet clean, add the vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until browned, 6 to 7 minutes, stirring halfway through. Transfer the mushrooms to a medium bowl. Add the soy sauce, garlic and sesame oil, mix well and set aside; reserve the skillet.<br> For the spinach: Bring a large pot of water to boil over medium-high heat and prepare an ice water bath. Add the spinach to the boiling water and blanch until it turns bright green, about 30 seconds. Remove the spinach with tongs or hand-held strainer and transfer to the ice bath immediately; reserve the pot and water. Once the spinach is completely cooled, remove it and squeeze dry. Cut the spinach into 1 1/2- to 2-inch pieces. Transfer to a medium bowl, add the sesame oil, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix well and set aside.<br> For the japchae: Bring the pot of water back to the boil. Add the noodles and cook, stirring constantly to ensure the noodles don\u2019t stick on bottom of the pot, until noodles become mostly clear but are still opaque in the center and bend over the handle of a large wooden spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. (At this point, the noodles aren\u2019t cooked through all the way.)<br> Drain in a strainer and rinse under cold running water, rubbing the noodles between your fingers and gently massaging them in the water. Drain and then rinse again, repeating 2 more times to remove any excess starch. Set aside in the strainer and allow to drain well.<br> Wipe the skillet clean. Add the 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef and cook, stirring often, until browned (being careful not to burn the garlic), 5 to 6 minutes. Set aside; reserve the skillet.<br> Wipe the skillet clean. Add the 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add the drained noodles and cook, stirring and mixing constantly with tongs, until there is a slight cooked smell of starch, the noodles are completely coated in oil and any moisture is cooked off, 6 to 7 minutes. (You\u2019ll hear a lot of sizzling sounds starting around the 2 minute mark; that\u2019s fine.)<br> Add the soy sauce, reduce the heat to low, and loosen the noodles back up again for 1 to 2 minutes; they will turn golden brown from the soy sauce. Once all the soy sauce has absorbed, transfer the noodles to a large mixing bowl. Immediately add the sesame oil, sugar and rice syrup and toss until incorporated and the sugar has melted.<br> Add the cooked onions, peppers, carrots, mushrooms, spinach and beef and toss until thoroughly mixed.

Lightly spray 2 half sheet trays (each 18 by 13 inches) with cooking spray and line each with parchment paper then spray the parchment generously. Sift together the almond flour, powdered sugar, cake flour and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the whole eggs until smooth and set aside. Using an electric mixer, whip the egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Sprinkle in the granulated sugar and whip on high speed until the mixture reaches soft peaks, about 1 minute. Gently fold in half of the egg whites into the flour mixture until combined, then fold that mixture into the remaining egg whites and fold until fully incorporated. Fold in the melted butter. Divide the batter equally between the 2 prepared sheet trays and spread evenly--it will not reach all four sides of a pan and that&#39;s okay. Bake, rotating 180 degrees halfway through baking, until the edges of the cakes are lightly golden and the surface springs back when touched, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the sheet trays to room temperature. For the buttercream: Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or in a medium bowl using a hand mixer, start whipping together the butter, powdered sugar and salt. Mix in a little bit of the milk at a time so the mixture is not too dry. Add the vanilla. Turn up the mixer speed and whip until the buttercream is smooth. If the buttercream is too wet, mix in a bit more powdered sugar; if it&#39;s too stiff, mix in a bit more butter. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl once or twice to make sure everything is combined. Use immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 24 hours or in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Re-whip if the buttercream is cold. Divide the buttercream equally between 2 small bowls. Add the pink gel color to one of the bowls and whisk well to combine. Add the blue gel color to the other bowl and whisk well to combine. Transfer each buttercream to its own piping bag fitted with a star tip. For assembly and decorating: Working with 1 cake at a time, gently turn out onto a cutting board and remove the parchment. Using a 1 1/2-inch round cutter, cut each cake into 36 rounds. Pipe the pink buttercream around the edges of 8 cake rounds. Pipe the blue buttercream around the edges of another 8 cake rounds. Place 1 teaspoon of the jam in the middle of each frosted cake round. To stack the cakes, place any frosted cake round on top of another frosted cake round then top with a plain cake round. Repeat to create a total of twenty-four 3-layer mini cakes. Drizzle the melted candy melting wafers over the cakes, pipe a buttercream rosette on top of each and decorate with sprinkles and/or sugar flowers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 54775,&quot;Mac and Cheese Lorraine Salt 1 pound gemelli pasta or other short cut pasta 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 pound bacon, chopped 2 onions, quartered and thinly sliced 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup chicken stock 1 cup whole milk Freshly ground black pepper 2 cups shredded Gruyere Pinch freshly grated nutmeg, to taste 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard Instructions: Heat water for pasta, salt water and cook pasta to al dente.

Put the squash on a sheet tray, toss lightly with olive oil and toss in the oven. Roast the squash until a fork slides in and out easily, about 45 minutes. Remove the squash from the oven and let cool. Remove the skin and puree until smooth. Place 3 cups squash puree in a large mixing bowl, reserve the rest for another purpose. For the crust: In the bowl of a food processor combine all the flour, sugar, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, nutmeg and salt. Toss in the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like grated parmigiano. Add in the egg yolk and a few drops of the ice water. Pulse until the mixture starts to come together into a ball. Add a few more drops of water if the mixture still seems dry. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work board. Using the heels of your hand, schmear the dough straight forward and roll it back with your fingertips. Repeat this process two more times. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Remove the dough from the fridge and let warm up for 5 minutes. Roll the dough out into a large circle and lay in a deep pie dish. Trim the dough all the way around so there is only 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the dough under and crimp the edges decoratively. Make sure the edges don&#39;t extend beyond the pie plate rim. Prick the dough all over with a fork. Lay aluminum foil over the dough to cover and fill the pie plate with baking beans. Place the pie plate on a sheet tray and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and baking beans and bake for 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Reduce the heat in the oven to 350 degrees F. For the filling: In a small bowl, beat the eggs until they are smooth. Beat in the cream. Add the cream/egg mixture to the squash puree and beat to combine. Beat in the condensed milk, brown sugar, bourbon if using and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is well combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the squash mixture into the prepared pie shell. Place on the sheet tray and place back into the oven for 25 minutes. Rotate the pie and bake until the mixture barely jiggles when shaken, another 20 to 25 minutes. If the crust starts to get too dark, place a pie shield ring on the pie to protect the edges from burning. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for at least 1 hour before cutting. Whip heavy cream with a pinch of cinnamon until stiff peaks, and top the pie as a garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 54781,&quot;Calamari Fries with Homemade Cocktail Sauce and Ponzu Mayo Canola oil, for frying 1 pound fresh squid, cleaned 1 cup all-purpose flour Sea salt Freshly cracked pepper 4 eggs, beaten 1 cup panko breadcrumbs Lemon wedges, for serving Homemade Cocktail Sauce, for serving, recipe follows Ponzu Mayo, for serving, recipe follows 1 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon freshly grated horseradish 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Juice of 1 lemon Freshly cracked black pepper 3/4 cup mayonnaise 3 tablespoons Asian chili sauce 2 tablespoons ponzu 1 clove garlic, minced Instructions: Heat canola oil to 360 degrees F in a pot.<br> Slice the squid against the grain into strips.

Season the sole with salt and pepper, to taste, and lightly dust the sole with flour, shaking off the excess. Dip the sole into egg whites coating entirely, shaking off excess, press into hazelnut breading. Refrigerate for 10 minutes or up to 24 hours. Heat a large saute pan on medium heat. Add 2 ounces canola oil and the sole. Cook for approximately 1 minute, checking carefully with a spatula to make sure they are golden brown. Flip and continue cooking for 1 minute longer and then transfer to sheet pan. Repeat the process with the remaining oil and sole. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes (depending on thickness of fillet) or until fish is cooked through but still moist. Mashed Potatoes: Cook the potatoes through in a 6-quart stock pot with 4 quarts of salted water for approximately 30 minutes. Drain potatoes well. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed. Add half-and-half, shallot puree and salt and pepper, to taste. Cover and keep warm. Vegetables: In a pot big enough to hold all the vegetables, bring salted water to a boil. Drop in vegetables and cook until al dente, approximately 2 minutes, drain well. Toss back in pot, season with salt and pepper and add butter, if using. Keep warm until ready to serve. Marsala Wine Buerre Blanc: Reduce the Marsala wine and shallots in a heavy bottom pan over medium-high heat and reduce to 1/2 cup. Add heavy cream and bring back to simmer.

When the oil just begins to smoke, add the sausage, breaking it into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sausage is browned and crispy, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Reduce the heat to low. To the same skillet, add the red pepper flakes, garlic and shallots. Season with salt. Add the oregano and stir. Cook until the garlic and shallots are tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Place a strainer over a medium bowl. Quarter the tomatoes and, working over the strainer, scrape the seeds and \jelly\ from each piece. Push the liquid through the strainer and discard the seeds. Add the tomato flesh and liquid to the shallot mixture and stir in the sugar and 1 tablespoon salt. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the tomato flesh starts to lose shape, about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and simmer until the tomato sauce is mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to boil and add salt. Cook the pasta, stirring so it doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom, until al dente (chewy but not hard or raw tasting), 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving a bit of the pasta cooking water, and set aside until the sauce is finished. Transfer the tomato sauce to a blender and puree until smooth. Add the balsamic vinegar and blend again. With the blender running, pour the remaining 1/2 cup oil through the top in a slow, steady stream. Blend in 1 cup water then transfer the sauce to a large skillet and add salt to taste. Place the skillet over medium heat and add the pasta. Stir to combine with a wooden spoon. Cook until the sauce and pasta are heated through, about 6 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water to thin it out. Drain any excess grease from the sausage and stir it into the pasta. Season with salt. Tear the basil leaves over the pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 54812,&quot;Vegetarian Hand Rolled Sushi (Temaki) Sushi rice, recipe follows Nori Carrot, julienned Orange and red bell peppers, julienned Cucumber, julienned (Chinese B without seeds, or regular is also ok) Asparagus Avocado Scallions, julienned Black sesame seeds White sesame seeds Black sesame seeds/salt combination 3 1/3 cups short grain rice 4 cups water, plus 1/4 cup water 6 tablespoons rice vinegar 5 tablespoons sugar 3 teaspoons salt Instructions: Place a half sheet of nori horizontally in front of you on your mat. Place rice on left third of nori, leaving border of nori all around. Place filling ingredients vertically across middle of rice. Fold near corner of nori over to begin folding into cone shape. Continue to roll until cone is formed. Serve with pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce as condiments. Rinse rice in water until the water runs clear and then drain in a colander for 1 hour. Place the drained rice in a rice cooker or in a pot with a tight-fitting lid and add 4 cups water. Over medium heat, cover and bring the water to a boil. Boil for about 2 minutes, reduce heat and allow to simmer for another 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes, or until water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, remove lid, and place a towel over pot. Replace lid and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. While the rice cooks, combine vinegar, sugar and remaining 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Heat over low temperatures, stirring, until sugar and salt dissolve. Let cool. Empty rice into a hangiri (or other nonmetallic) tub and spread it evenly over the bottom with a shamoji (or large wooden spoon). Run the spatula through the rice in slicing motions to separate the grains. While doing this, slowly add vinegar mixture. Add only as much as is necessary; the rice should not be mushy. If you have help, fan the rice with an uchiwa (fan) during the cooling and mixing procedures. Do not refrigerate the rice. Keep it in the tub covered with a clean cloth until ready to use. The rice will last one day. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 54813,&quot;Chili-Lime Pork Tenderloin over Soft Polenta with Hungarian Wax Peppers and Corn 4 limes, juiced 2 tablespoons cl powder 1 Hungarian Wax pepper, roughly chopped* (See Cook&#39;s Note) 1 pork tenderloin, trimmed (about 10 ounces) 3 cups chicken stock 1 cup fine cornmeal 1/4 cups chopped Hungarian Wax peppers (about 1 pepper) 1/4 cup crema Mexicana 2 tablespoons butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 onion, chopped 1/2 cup chopped Hungarian Wax peppers (about 2 to 3 peppers) Kernels from 4 ears of fresh corn 1/2 cup queso fresco Instructions: Stir together the lime juice, cl powder, and Hungarian pepper.

Place the bacon on a baking sheet lined with a rack. Roast until the bacon is crisp but still pliable, 20 minutes. Using a large spoon, scrape the gills out of the mushrooms. Toss the mushrooms with olive oil and some salt and roast for 20 minutes. Divide the ground beef into 8 portions; season generously with salt. Roll each portion into a ball and flatten into a patty. Make a nest or indentation in four of the patties and fill each with 2 ounces of the fontina. Place the remaining patties on top of the cheese-filled patties, pinch firmly to close, and then press and shape the patties. Coat a large saut pan with olive oil and add the onions. Season with salt and cook until the onions are starting to brown and are very soft and aromatic, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat. Heat a large griddle or flat-top over medium-high heat. Coat the griddle lightly with olive oil and cook each burger until very brown and crusty, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Cut the rolls almost all the way in half, leaving one side intact, so they open like a book. Place open-side down on the griddle and toast. Place a burger on the bottom half of each roll. Break the bacon strips in half and place 4 halves on each burger. Divide the onions among the burgers. Cut each mushroom in 3 slices and arrange on top of the onions. Top with the remaining fontina. Place the burgers on the baking sheet and roast or broil until the cheese has melted. Top each burger with baby arugula and close the roll. Serve hot.

Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. For the pancakes: Whisk together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.<br> Whisk together the milk, sour cream, egg yolks and lemon zest in another medium bowl. Whisk the yolk mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (the batter will be lumpy). Allow the batter to rest while you whip the egg whites.<br> Beat the egg whites in a separate medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.<br> Heat an ebelskiver pan over medium heat for 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low and brush 4 of the wells generously with melted butter so there is some butter pooling at the bottom of each (the butter should barely sizzle when it hits the pan). Fill each buttered well with about 1 tablespoon batter. Repeat with the butter and batter in the remaining 4 wells. (You are working in batches to prevent the butter from burning.) Allow the batter to cook slightly around the edges, about 30 seconds.<br> Carefully spoon about 1 teaspoon of the ricotta filling into the center of each ebelskiver, then press 2 blueberries (or just 1 if large) into the center. Spoon about 1 tablespoon additional batter on top of the blueberries so the wells are very full. Cook until the bottom crusts are golden brown, an additional 2 1/2 minutes.<br> Push a wooden skewer through the raw batter and into the bottom crust of each ebelskiver to turn it slowly. Allow the raw batter to flow back into the well and create a new bottom crust. (If an ebelskiver does not slide up easily or hold its shape, slide it back to its original position and give it more time to cook and set.) Cook until the new undersides are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Check all sides of the ebelskivers: If there are pale spots on some, turn them pale-side down so they brown against the bottom of the pan for a few seconds. When they are done, the ebelskivers should be deep golden brown all over and a skewer inserted deep into the pancakes, avoiding the filling, should come out clean. If you find that some are cooking much more quickly than others, rotate the pan occasionally to even out the heat. Remove the ebelskivers from the pan.<br> Repeat the process with the remaining melted butter, batter, filling and blueberries to make 6 more ebelskivers. By the second batch, the pan will be significantly hotter, so you may need to reduce the heat or remove the pan from the heat occasionally to ensure even cooking. Dust the ebelskivers with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm drizzled with honey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54818,&quot;Thanksgiving Mules 1 heaping tablespoon dried cranberries, for garnish 2 ounces simple syrup, plus more for soaking the cranberries 6 ounces vodka<br> 4 ounces orange juice<br> 4 ounces unfiltered cranberry juice 4 ounces ginger beer<br> Instructions: Put the dried cranberries in a small bowl and add enough simple syrup to cover.

Add the sausage link pieces and cook until heated through and browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet and cover. In the same skillet, throw in the onions and peppers, season with the Montreal steak seasoning and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly charred on the edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to the baking sheet and cover. Meanwhile, heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Whisk together the half-and-half, salt, pepper and eggs in a medium bowl until light and airy, 20 to 30 seconds. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in the skillet. Add half of the egg mixture and spin the skillet to make sure the egg is evenly spread. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to ensure the eggs aren&#39;t sticking. Once the omelet begins to set, 45 to 60 seconds, lift and rotate the skillet slightly, letting the runny eggs go under the edges into the skillet. Use your spatula to lift the edges slightly if needed. Return to the burner and sprinkle half of the cheese onto the omelet. Allow the omelet to sit untouched for an additional 15 to 20 seconds, or until completely set. Slide onto a cutting board and repeat with the remaining butter, egg mixture and cheese.

Crush the crackers in a food processor or resealable bag. Pour them into a bowl and stir in the melted butter and sugar. Press into a pie pan and bake until golden and set, 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. For the filling: In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt the baking chocolate until stirrable (about 45 seconds on high). Set aside to cool. It is important for the bowl and ingredients to be cold for the next stage of making the filling--to get the right texture and result. In a large chilled bowl with an electric mixer, beat the sugar and butter until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. When the melted chocolate is cooled, drizzle it over the butter/sugar mixture. Add the vanilla extract. Beat the mixture thoroughly until combined (on a stand mixer, you will be using the whisk attachment). Turn your mixer to a medium speed and over a period of 15 to 20 minutes, add in the 4 cold eggs, one at a time, leaving about 5 minutes between each egg addition. Once the pie filling is well mixed, pour it into the baked pie shell, scraping every last speck of it out of the bowl. Smooth out the pie filling and place the pie in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours (preferably longer). For the topping: Add the heavy cream and sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip until it is stiff. Cover the pies with a thick layer of cream. Grate the semisweet chocolate over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54825,&quot;Deep Fried Stuffed Olives 24 large pitted green olives 1/2 cup flour 1 cup fine breadcrumbs 2 eggs, beaten 1 cup olive oil Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 shallot, diced 1 pound ground veal Salt and pepper 1/2 cup veal stock 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs 1 egg, beaten 1/4 pound gorgonzola cheese, crumbled Instructions: Chuck Hughes&#39; scrumptious deep fried stuffed olives are a bar snack that can&#39;t be beat. For the olives: Place the olives in a bowl and cover over with water. While preparing the stuffings, let them soak about 30 minutes to remove the excess salt. Drain the water, rinse the olives and dry completely with a paper towel.<br> For the stuffings: In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and cook the shallots. Add the ground veal, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook about 5 minutes. Add the veal stock and continue to cook over medium heat until the liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes.<br> Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Transfer the veal mixture to a bowl. Add the Parmesan, parsley, breadcrumbs and egg. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix together and set aside.<br> To assemble: Starting from the end (opposite the hole on top), cut the olive away from the pit in a spiral, as if you&#39;re peeling an apple. The olive will coil. Place the olive meat in a bowl.<br> Pinch a bit of the veal mixture between your thumb and forefinger and roll into a small ball. Shape the olive meat from half the olives around the filling, so the olive regains its original shape. Place on a baking tray, cover with plastic wrap and set aside. Proceed the same way for remaining olives and the gorgonzola cheese.<br> Coat the olives lightly in flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. To avoid the stuffing from seeping out, repeat the process twice to get a thick breading. Set aside.<br> Pour the olive oil into a medium frying pan and heat until the oil bubbles. Fry the olives until the breading is golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Serve the olives while warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 54826,&quot;Breakfast Sausage Corn Dogs 1 cup stone-ground cornmeal 1 cup self-rising flour 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk 1 large egg About 14 cups vegetable oil, for frying 12 precooked breakfast sausage links 1 1/2 teaspoons apple pie spice 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting 1 1/2 teaspoons ancho cl powder 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped 1/4 cup sliced fresh chives 3/4 teaspoon mustard powder 1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper Maple syrup, hot sauce and/or ketchup, for serving Instructions: For the batter: Whisk together the cornmeal, flour, granulated sugar and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the milk and egg in a small bowl. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir until combined. At this point, you can leave the batter plain or you can add the ingredients for the sweet, spicy or herb-mustard options. For the corn dogs: Fill a deep, medium pot a little more than halfway with vegetable oil. Attach a deep-fry thermometer and bring the oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Fill a tall glass about three-quarters full with some of the batter. Push the pointed end of a 6-inch wooden skewer about halfway through each sausage. Line a baking sheet or large plate with paper towels. Once the oil is hot enough, dip 1 sausage in the glass of batter until fully submerged and completely coated. Let any excess drip off, then dip completely in the hot oil, holding it by the skewer for a few seconds until the batter is set. Then let it go to bob and fry in the oil. Continue dipping in batches so you&#39;re frying only 2 or 3 at a time, turning the corn dogs in the oil as needed with tongs and adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature, until deep golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Let the finished corn dogs drain on the paper towel-lined baking sheet, then transfer to the oven to keep warm while you dip and fry the remaining batches. Fill the glass with more batter as needed. If making the sweet version, dust each corn dog with confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve with desired dipping sauces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Garnacha]&quot; 54827,&quot;Hong Kong Egg Tarts 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 11 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 large egg, beaten 3 1/2 tablespoons cold water 5 tablespoons whole milk 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons evaporated milk 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: For the butter dough: Put the flour and butter in a food processor and process to a thick, smooth paste, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to plastic wrap using a metal spoon and shape into a 5-inch square. Chill in the refrigerator until needed. For the water dough: Put the flour, sugar, salt and 3 tablespoons of the beaten egg in the same food processor (reserve the remaining beaten egg for the egg filling). Pulse a few times to combine. Stream in the cold water while pulsing until a ball forms that is shaggy and not sticky, about 2 minutes. Wrap the dough into a rough square with plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for 20 minutes.<br> For the egg filling: While the doughs are resting, put the milk and sugar in a small pot and heat over high heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Let cool completely, about 5 minutes.<br> Whisk together the eggs and reserved beaten egg in a large bowl until no visible egg whites remain, about 1 minute. Whisk in the evaporated milk, vanilla extract and cooled milk mixture. Strain the filling through a fine-mesh sieve twice into a 2-cup liquid measuring cup with a spout. Skim off any foam on the surface of the egg filling. Wrap the measuring cup with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until needed.<br> Prepare the pastry: Roll the water dough on a lightly floured surface using a rolling pin to a 10-inch square. Position the butter dough in the center of the water dough in the shape of a diamond. Wrap the outer dough around the butter layer and seal in the edges; make sure to brush away excess flour with a pastry brush. Roll the dough out to a 6-by-12-inch rectangle. Fold both short sides toward the center and then fold in half like closing a book. Wrap in plastic and chill in the freezer for 20 minutes.<br> Roll out the dough to a 6-by-12-inch rectangle with the smooth side of the dough to the left side. Fold both short sides toward the center and then fold in half like closing a book. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for 20 minutes. Repeat this process of folding and resting one more time.<br> After the final 20-minute rest, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to an 11-by-14-inch rectangle, slightly thinner than 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out 12 rounds of dough using a 3 1/4-inch round cutter. Stack the rounds with plastic wrap between each layer and chill in the freezer until firm, about 10 minutes.<br> Center one dough round onto each of twelve 3-inch egg tart molds and press the dough up the edges of each mold from the bottom to the top, thinning out the bottom. Put the egg tart molds on the prepared baking sheet. Dock the bottom of each dough round 3 times using the tines of a fork. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Carefully pour the egg filling into the 12 tart shells (about 1 1/2 tablespoons in each; there should be about 1/4 inch of space between the egg filling and top edges of the crust). Bake the egg tarts until the crusts are starting to brown around the edges, 20 to 22 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake until the crusts are light golden brown and the fillings have puffed slightly, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool in the oven with the door ajar until the egg filling gently settles back down, about 5 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Remove the egg tarts from the molds and enjoy slightly warm or completely cooled.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 54828,&quot;Tangy Meatloaf Burgers 1 small onion (1/2 sliced into rings, 1/2 diced) 1 pound meatloaf mix (ground pork, beef and veal) or ground turkey 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (preferably panko) 1 large egg 1 teaspoon sweet or smoked paprika 1/3 cup ketchup 1/3 cup duck sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 potato buns or other rolls, split Lettuce, sliced tomato and pickle slices, for topping Sweet potato chips, for serving (optional) Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high. Soak the onion rings in a bowl of cold water. Meanwhile, combine the meatloaf mix with the diced onion, parsley, breadcrumbs, egg, paprika, 1 tablespoon each ketchup and duck sauce, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Gently form into four 1-inch-thick patties; make an indentation in the center of each. Brush the patties with the olive oil and grill until marked on the bottom, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the remaining ketchup and duck sauce in a small bowl for brushing; set aside a few tablespoons. Turn the patties, brush with the ketchup mixture and continue grilling until cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Toast the buns, if desired. Spread the buns with the reserved ketchup mixture. Drain the onion rings. Serve the patties on the buns; top with the onion, lettuce, tomato and pickles. Serve with sweet potato chips, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 54829,&quot;Creamy Three-Cheese Baked Mac 1 pound large shell pasta Kosher salt 2 teaspoons olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 cups whole milk, at room temperature Pinch nutmeg Kosher salt and finely ground black pepper 1 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar 1 cup shredded Parmesan 1 cup shredded white American cheese 2 cloves garlic, grated or mashed to a paste 1 cup butter cracker crumbs 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon dried herbs, such as basil, oregano or parsley Instructions: For the noodles: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cook the pasta in boiling super salty water (like the sea) until just tender, or al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water, and set aside. Strain the pasta from the water. Drizzle a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish with the olive oil. For the cheese sauce: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour so that it&#39;s smooth and pasty, then cook for 2 minutes more, stirring occasionally, so the roux does not stick to the pan. Pour in the milk 1 cup at a time and stir until smooth. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally so there are no lumps and nothing sticks to the bottom and edges of the pan, for 10 minutes. Season with the nutmeg and 1 teaspoon salt. Reserve 1/4 cup of each of the cheeses and set aside. When the bechamel sauce is smooth and velvety, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic and remaining 3/4 cup of each of the shredded cheeses. Add the reserved pasta water. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper as desired. Place the pasta in the prepared casserole dish and toss to lightly coat with the olive oil. Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and stir well to combine. Sprinkle the reserved 1/4 cup of each of the cheeses over the pasta. Give the dish a little shake to help settle the sauce. For the topping: In a small bowl, mix together the cracker crumbs, melted butter and dried herbs. Press the cracker crumbs on top of the pasta. Bake until golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 54830,&quot;Root Vegetable Patties 2 parsnips, peeled and grated 1 large carrot, peeled and grated 2 cups shredded frozen hash brown potatoes 3 scallions, whites and greens chopped A handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 2 tablespoons flour 1 egg, beaten Salt and pepper 1/4 cup canola oil Instructions: Combine all ingredients except oil in a bowl.

Bring the mixture to a boil over low heat and season generously with salt. Take the seasoning to the edge of too salty. To do this you MUST taste as you go. Polenta acts as a salt eraser, if you don&#39;t season abundantly here you will never recover from it. Once the liquid is at a boil and is seasoned appropriately, sprinkle in the polenta whisking constantly. Once the polenta is combined switch over to a wooden spoon and stir frequently until the polenta has become thick. Taste the polenta to see if it has cooked through. If it still feels mealy and grainy, add some more milk or water and cook it to a thick consistency. Repeat this process, as needed, until the polenta feels smooth on your tongue, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and stir in the chopped sage and mascarpone. Line a 7 by 7-inch square pan with plastic wrap. Pour the polenta into the prepared pan. Cover the top with more plastic smoothed onto the surface of the polenta. Chill in the refrigerator until needed. (All of this can totally be done ahead of time, like yesterday! Cool!) When ready to use, remove the polenta from the pan and cut into desired shapes. Coat a nonstick saute pan with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot and starting to smoke just a little, add the polenta shapes. Cook the polenta on both sides and finish by sprinkling with a little bit grated Parmigiano. Transfer to a serving platter and serve while hot.

Line 2 baking sheets or plates with paper towels. Mix the mayonnaise, lemon zest, lemon juice and garlic in a small bowl.<br> Put the chives, cilantro, parsley, vinegar, lime juice and paprika in a blender and pulse until combined. Season with salt and pepper and slowly add 1 cup oil while blending at high speed. Add 1 tablespoon water and blend until combined. Drain the potato peels on 1 of the prepared baking sheets or plates and pat dry.<br> Add half of the potato peels and fry, gently turning halfway with a spider or slotted spoon, until golden brown, 2 minutes 30 seconds. Transfer to the second prepared baking sheet and season with salt. Bring the oil temperature back to 350 degrees F, then fry the remaining potato peels.<br> Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the egg and fry until the edges get nice and crispy and the yolk is just set and still runny, 1 minute 30 seconds.<br> To serve, drizzle 2 tablespoons of the lemon mayo and 1/4 cup (3 ounces) of the herb sauce on a platter then scatter the peels on top so they resemble a bird\u2019s nest.

Finely chop the nuts in a food processor or coffee grinder. Transfer nuts to a bowl and mix in brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and cloves. Brush a 13 by 9-inch baking pan with melted butter and set aside. Cut a piece of cardboard into a 13 by 9-inch rectangle. Unroll the phyllo dough and lay the sheets flat on a work surface. Set the cardboard template on the stack of phyllo and trim the excess so they fit the pan. Keep the pastry covered with a damp, not wet, towel as you work to prevent drying out. To build the baklava, you will alternate 3 layers of dough with 2 layers of nuts. Start with a stable base of 8 sheets on the bottom, brushing each with melted butter. Spread 1/2 the nut mixture evenly over the stacked sheets. Cover with 4 sheets of phyllo, painting each with melted butter, then sprinkle again with remaining nut mixture. Top the last layer of nuts with 8 layers of phyllo as you did for the bottom. Drizzle any remaining butter over top. If you have time, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes so the butter will set and make the baklava easier to cut. Using a sharp knife, make 5 cuts across lengthwise, then cut diagonally to form diamonds. Baklava is more difficult to cut after it is cooked because the pastry becomes so flaky. Bake for about 40 minutes until golden and flaky. If the top browns too quickly during baking, tent with foil. To make the syrup: combine the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer for 10 minutes until thickened. Remove the orange peel, cinnamon stick, and whole clove; set aside to cool. Remove an end piece of the baklava and tilt the pan to allow the butter to collect in the corner. Spoon out the excess and discard. With the pan flat, pour the syrup evenly over the hot baklava. Allow to stand for several hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54834,&quot;Summer Squash Casserole 1 tablespoon canola oil, plus more for the dish 3 yellow squash, sliced 1/4 inch thick (about 1 pound) 1/2 sweet onion, chopped 4 zucchini squash, sliced 1/4 inch thick (about 1 pound) 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1 cup lowfat milk 1 1/4 cups grated Cheddar Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 cup panko breadcrumbs 1/4 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs such as parsley, chives and basil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Lightly grease the bottom only of a 9-inch springform pan that has been lined with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Add the extract and eggs, beating well after each addition. Add the flour and cocoa and mix well to combine. The batter will be stiff. Spread in the pan. Set aside. For the baked chocolate cheesecake: In a large bowl, cream the cream cheese and ricotta with the sugar until smooth. Add a small amount of the cheese mixture to the melted chocolate and combine well. Once the little bit of cheese mixture and chocolate is mixed well, add it back to the rest of the cheese mixture and beat until well combined. Add the eggs and flour and beat well. Smooth over the top of the cake batter in the pan. Bake until the cheesecake is set in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. Cover with foil during last 10 minutes to prevent over browning. Remove from the oven and cool. A cheesecake is not like a regular cake. It is considered set when the center is still wobbly. After you chill the cheesecake, it will set without wobbling. At this point let the cake cool. Once it is cool, you need to chill the cake for an hour or two. For the vanilla cream cheese mousse: Once your chocolate and cheesecake base has been chilled, you can start making the third layer. Beat the heavy whipping cream until stiff and set aside. In separate bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla with a mixer in large bowl until well blended. Fold the whipped cream into cheese mixture until just combined. Spread the mixture over the baked cheesecake layer and chill well (freezing the cake at this point works well and makes spreading the final layer easier). Make sure you chill for several hours to make sure all the layers are set. For the dark chocolate/white chocolate ganache: Place the chopped dark chocolate in a large bowl. Heat the cream and butter over low heat until just boiling. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the cream mixture. Pour the rest of the cream mixture over the chocolate and let set about 2 minutes, or until it begins to melt. Stir to combine. Repeat for the white chips using the reserved cream mixture. Let cool slightly until spreading consistency. Using a sharp knife, gently run the blade around the edge of the cake to loosen. Remove the cake sides from the pan and place the bottom with cake on a serving plate or stand. Spread the frosting over the top and sides. Drizzle the white chocolate lightly over the top. Using a knife or toothpick, run it lightly over the top to swirl to create desired effect. At this point, I would place the white chocolate ganache in a pastry bag and use a small round tip to decorate the top of the cake instead of trying to just drizzle it on top. You have more control. Press the mini chips (regular size works too) into the frosting on sides until completely coated to create a \crust.\ Place the cake in the fridge to chill while preparing the final frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54841,&quot;Black and Tan Irish Stout Lager beer Instructions: Fill a pint glass half full with the lager beer.

Line a baking sheet with parchment.<br> In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form. Lower the speed and gradually beat in the sugar. Add the amaretto and vinegar and beat at medium speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 8 minutes longer. Using a large kitchen spoon and your barely damp fingers, shape the meringue into twelve 4x3-inch ovals on the parchment-lined baking sheet.<br> Place on the lowest rack in the oven and bake for about 45 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Store in a tightly closed plastic container at room temperature.<br> For the Genovese Butter Cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Butter and flour an 8-inch springform pan.<br> In a large metal bowl, beat the eggs, yolks and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until tripled in volume, about 7 minutes.<br> Place the bowl over a saucepan of water, bring the water to a simmer, and whisk for 1 to 2 minutes to warm the eggs slightly. Remove from the heat.<br> Sift the flour and baking powder together and fold into the egg mixture. Transfer one-eighth of the batter to a small bowl and whisk the melted butter into it. Pour the cake batter into the prepared cake pan.<br> Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack. (The cake can be made a day ahead if tightly wrapped in plastic.) For the Zabaglione Filling: Make a water bath by filling a large deep pot half-full with water. Combine the yolks, cream sherry, sugar and orange zest in a large bowl (preferably copper, to get more volume). Place the bowl over the water and, while whisking the eggs vigorously, bring the water to a simmer over medium-low heat. Continue whisking for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and is light and fluffy. Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool. (Leave the water bath over low heat.)<br> Place the gelatin sheet, if using, in cold water to soften. When soft, squeeze out the excess water, then whisk into the egg mixture. Or, for powdered gelatin, put 2 tablespoons cold water in a small dish and sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Let stand for 1 minute to soften, then whisk into the egg mixture. Return the bowl of egg mixture to the simmering water bath and whisk constantly over medium-low heat until the gelatin is fully dissolved, about 2 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the eggs, as they may curdle, and make sure when whisking to bring all of the mixture up from the bottom of the bowl. Refrigerate until cold, whisking occasionally, then fold in the whipped cream. For the Cream Frosting: In a medium bowl whip the cream with the sugar, vanilla, and brandy to stiff peaks. Set aside in the refrigerator.<br> For the Simple Syrup: Over medium heat, dissolve the sugar in 1/4 cup water and the sherry.<br> To Assemble: Place the cake on a cake stand. With a long sharp knife, trim off the very top (about 1/8 inch) of the cake. To slice the cake into 3 equal rounds, score 2 evenly spaced lines all around the sides of the cake. Cut into the score lines about 1 inch deep all the way around the cake, then make a clean cut all the way through the cake to separate it into three layers.

Season them on both sides with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, heat a large fry pan over medium heat, and place the goose skin side down in the pan. Slowly render the fat from the goose until the skin is crisp. Lower the heat if necessary to ensure that the skin is nicely browned but not black. Drain the pan of the fat leaving about a tablespoon behind. The drained fat may be reserved for future use. Increase the heat to medium high, and flip the goose breasts. Sear the goose flesh side down until nicely browned (about two to three minutes). Remove the goose from the pan and allow it to rest. Meanwhile, prepare the farro and the sauce according to the recipes. Spoon two ounces of farro onto four serving plates. Place the goose skin side down on a cutting board. Slice it on a radical bias and fan it out equally among the four plates. Spoon the sauce over the goose. Serve immediately. Heat the court-bouillon over medium low heat. Add the farro and the cranberries. Stir gently using a wooden spoon until the stock is completely absorbed by the farro. Stir in the butter, and incorporate using the wooden spoon. Season with the salt and pepper. Serve immediately as an accompaniment to game birds. In a nonreactive sauce pot, bring the court-bouillon to a slow simmer. Meanwhile, in a large braising pan, saute the vegetables and garlic in the olive oil until tender. Add the farro, and stir with a wooden spoon while continuing to saute until the farro in pearlized (begins to change color). Season with the salt and pepper. Using an 8 oz. ladle, add a ladle full of stock to the farro. Stir the farro from the bottom, and allow the stock to become almost completely absorbed by the rice. Repeat the procedure until the farro has cooked for exactly 20 minutes. Remove from the heat, and stir in the thyme. Transfer immediately to a two large sheet pans. Spread the farro out evenly using a rubber spatula. Allow the farro to cool in the walk-in cooler. Transfer to a container, and label and cover tightly. In a stock pot over moderate heat, sweat the vegetables in the grape seed oil until tender. Add the white wine and the bouquet garni.

Beat the whole eggs, egg yolk and olive oil in a measuring cup and slowly pour into the food processor with the machine running; process until the dough forms a ball. (If the dough is too sticky, pulse in more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.) Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times to form a smooth ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest 30 minutes. Make the filling: Stir together the ricotta, Parmesan and Pecorino in a bowl. Transfer to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag and snip a corner. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Wrap 3 of the pieces individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Lightly flour the remaining piece of dough and feed through the widest setting on a pasta maker, then fold in half and feed it through again. Move to the next setting and feed the dough through, lightly flouring as needed; repeat until you reach the third-to-last setting. (You should be able to see your hand through the dough.) Lay out the sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface. Trim each end so the sheet is about 2 feet long. Halve the dough lengthwise and cut into about 2 1/2-inch squares. Pipe about 1 teaspoon filling on the center of each square. Run a damp finger along the edge of half of the square, then fold over to make a triangle, pinching the edges to seal. Set the triangle on a floured surface. Repeat with the remaining squares. Take one triangle and, with the fold at the bottom, moisten one of the bottom corners and wrap both bottom corners around your pointer finger like a ring, pinching the corners together to seal; transfer to a floured baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining triangles, then cover the baking sheet lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 pieces of dough and filling. Refrigerate the pasta, covered, until ready to cook. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 4 to 5 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain the pasta and toss with your sauce, adding the reserved cooking water as needed to loosen. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 54851,&quot;Hot Spiced Buttered Rum 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 3 cups unsweetened pineapple juice 4 ounces dark rum 4 long cinnamon sticks Instructions: In a small bowl mix the butter with the sugar, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice, until thoroughly combined.

Melt the shortening in a saute pan until completely liquefied, then add the cassava flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and salt to make a roux. Cook, stirring the roux with a fine whisk, for about 3 minutes. Add about a third of the chicken broth to the roux and cook, whisking constantly, until it begins to thicken.

Sprinkle with salt (which helps prevent its browning) and cook over low to medium heat until soft (about 5 minutes). Add the lentils, stir well and then cover generously with cold water. Bring to the boil, then cover and let simmer gently for 1/2 an hour or so until cooked and most, if not all, the liquid&#39;s absorbed. I don&#39;t add salt at this stage since the sauce provided by the sausages later (and which will be poured over the lentils) will be pretty salty itself. So, wait and taste. And remember, you can of course cook the lentils in advance. Anyway, when either the lentils are nearly ready or you&#39;re about to reheat them, put a heavy-based frying pan on the burner, cover with a film of oil and add the bruised garlic. Cook for a few minutes then add and brown the sausages. When the sausages are brown on both sides - which won&#39;t take more than 5 minutes or so - throw in the wine and water and let bubble up. Cover the pan, either with a lid or aluminum foil, and cook for about 15 minutes. Using a fork, mash the now-soft garlic into the sauce and taste for seasoning, adding a little more water if it&#39;s too strong. Remove the lentils to a shallowish bowl or dish (I evacuate the sausages from their cooking pan, plonk the lentils in, then proceed) then cover with the sausages and their garlicky, winey gravy.

Add the cream and whisk until the eggs look foamy and light. Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Melt the butter until it foams, then turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the eggs. Using a heat resistant rubber spatula, slowly stir the eggs from the outside of the pan to the center. Once the eggs begin to set, stirring slowly will create large, cloud-like curds. This sounds easy but perfect scrambled eggs that are soft and custard-like with no brown color are a sign of a really good cook. This process takes about 10 minutes. Season the eggs with a few cranks of black pepper and good salt, like fleur de sel.

Trim excess fat from meat, and cut meat in small chunks, thin or fat, your preference. Dredge meat in flour. Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil in heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat, in batches, and brown; do not cook through. It&#39;s easier to control the cooking if fewer pieces are in the skillet at 1 time. Remove meat and set aside. Leave remaining olive oil in skillet. In a separate skillet, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saute until all the liquid is rendered. To the pan with the olive oil, add onions and garlic and saute until onions are glassy. Push to 1 side of pan. In the center of the pan, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and garlic salt, cracked pepper, and cayenne pepper, to taste. When heated through, add tomato paste, 1 tablespoon flour, and bouillon. Mash into a paste, then slowly add water while stirring constantly, taking care to smooth out lumps. All the while, keep stirring and add sherry. When you feel it is sufficiently \saucy, return the meat to the pan and cook through. Add the mushrooms and fold together. It is important to do all of this at the last moment before serving so that the meat is tender. Then add sour cream and serve immediately over rice. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 54894,&quot;Mushroom Crepes Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying baking dish 3 tablespoons butter<br> 1/4 cup chopped white onions 3 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 2 cups chopped baby bella mushrooms 2 cup chopped cremini mushrooms 2 cups chopped oyster mushrooms 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 store-bought crepes<br> One 14-ounce can cream of mushroom soup, preferably organic<br> 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Unwrap to defrost at room temperature and then crust in a warm oven. Meanwhile, heat a couple of tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, cubanelle peppers, cl pepper, and garlic to tender-crisp, 5 minutes more. Cool and store the mushroom mixture. To reheat the mushroom mixture: Add a splash of stock or water over medium heat and season with salt and pepper. To reheat the sausages: Add a splash of stock or water to the sausages to loosen the sauce. Add a ladle of sauce to the mushroom pan. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Split the bread horizontally then halve into 4 large pieces. Arrange the bread pieces on cooling racks set over baking sheets to allow the heat to circulate all around the bread. Halve the sausages lengthwise. Dot the bread with sauce, top with the sausages cut-side-down, dot with more sauce and top with peppers and cheese. Bake the bread 12 to 15 minutes, or until melted and brown at the edges. Garnish with parsley and serve. For the braciole: Defrost, drain, and wring the frozen organic spinach dry in a clean kitchen towel and separate with your fingertips while adding to a mixing bowl. Season the spinach with salt, black pepper, and a little nutmeg. Add the chopped hard-boiled eggs, currants, pine nuts, finely chopped garlic, and cheese to the bowl and gently combine. Season the meat with salt and pepper and arrange each steak with one of the narrow ends near you. Divide the filling evenly among the meat slices. Scatter the filling over the meat leaving a 1/2-inch edge or border on the sides. Fold the edge over the filling and tuck in the edges as you roll each bundle to secure the filling. Wrap and roll the remaining bundles and secure with kitchen twine to cover the ends and middle, like wrapping a package. Heat a large Dutch oven with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil a couple of turns of the pan over medium-high heat. Brown the meat bundles 6 to 8 minutes to evenly caramelize the meat all over. For the sauce: Remove the bundles from the pan and add 1 tablespoon more olive oil, give a turn of the pan to coat. Add the chopped carrots, onions, sliced garlic, bay leaf and season with salt and pepper. Let the vegetables cook 5 minutes to soften, then stir in the chopped rosemary and sage for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir to develop the fragrance, then add the white wine and scrape up the pan drippings. Stir in the chicken stock and tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes with a spoon or potato masher. Bring the sauce to a bubble, add the meat back to the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook 2 hours more, stirring occasionally. After 2 hours, brown the sausages in a frying pan with a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan. Add the browned links to the sauce and gently submerge them, nestling them in with the meat bundles. Simmer the mixture 30 minutes more to cook the sausages through and combine their flavor into the sauce. Bring a pot of water to a boil for pasta. Salt the water and cook the pasta to al dente. Reserve a cup of starchy cooking liquid just before draining. Remove the meat bundles to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove the sausages to a separate plate to cool. Drain the pasta and return to a hot pot. Add 1 tablespoon butter, cut into pieces, and half of the sauce, toss to combine, adding a little starchy cooking water to make it all come together for you. Cut the string from the meat and serve the meat dotted with more sauce and sprinkled with fresh parsley on large dinner plates with hot pappardelle pasta topped with fresh basil and some shaved Parm alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo]&quot; 54897,&quot;Herb Coated Goat Cheese 36 (1/2-inch-thick) slices baguette 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 2 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 (11-ounce) log soft fresh goat cheese 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or Meyer lemon olive oil Fresh herb sprigs, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange the bread slices on 2 heavy baking sheets. Drizzle 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the bread slices. Bake until the crostini are pale golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the herbs, lemon zest, pepper, and salt in a medium bowl to blend. Using about 2 teaspoons of cheese for each, form the goat cheese into 1-inch diameter balls. Roll the cheese balls in the herb mixture to coat completely. Arrange the cheese balls on a platter. Drizzle the extra-virgin olive oil over and around the cheese balls. Serve with the crostini. Garnish with herb sprigs. The crostini and cheese balls can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store the crostini in an airtight container at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate the cheese balls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 54898,&quot;Meringue Snowwomen 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 1 cup sugar<br> Pinch fine salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract<br> 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, plus a few for decoration<br> Multicolored nonpareils, for decorating<br> Orange sprinkles, for decorating<br> Sour gummy candy belts, for decorating<br> 36 pretzel sticks<br> Instructions: For the meringue: Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Fit a large pastry bag with a 1/3-inch diameter plain tip and coupler. Combine the egg whites, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer set over a pan of simmering water to make a double boiler. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is hot to the touch (it should read 140 degrees F on a candy thermometer), about 4 minutes. Put the bowl on the mixer with the whisk attachment. Whisk on low to cool the mixture for about 30 seconds, then gradually increase the speed to high and whip until the mixture is no longer warm and forms very stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the peppermint extract. Fill the pastry bag with the meringue. Working at a 90-degree angle to the baking sheet, pipe and lift the bag to form the base of the snowwoman, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Lift the bag slightly to finish the ball, then pipe another slightly smaller ball on top. Lift slightly again and form one more slightly smaller ball for the head. Continue to pipe, leaving an inch in between, until you have 16 to 18 snowwomen. Wet your finger and gently smooth any sharp points on the heads. Bake until the snowwomen are shiny, bright white and dry throughout, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the oven and let the snowwomen cool and continue to dry in the oven, about an hour more. For decoration: Melt the semisweet and white chocolate chips in separate bowls in a microwave or double boiler. Dip the top of the heads in white chocolate, then add nonpareils to make hats. Dip a small paintbrush in the semisweet chocolate and dot on eyes, eyelashes and buttons. With a separate brush, dab a small bit of the white chocolate between the eyes and stick on an orange sprinkle for a carrot nose. Cut the candy belts to make scarves. Wrap the scarves around, using a dab of white chocolate to affix and close the scarves. Set 2 pretzel sticks parallel to each other with a space in between, like skis. Attach the skis with a smear of white chocolate on the bottom of a snowwoman and set the snowwoman on top. Repeat with the remaining snowwomen so they&#39;re all skiing. Let set. (You can stick them in the refrigerator for a few minutes to hurry this along.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 54899,&quot;Banana Buttermilk Waffles 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder ? teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs 1? cups buttermilk, at room temperature 1 very ripe banana, mashed, plus 1 banana, for serving (optional) 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for the waffle iron 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract ? cup heavy cream, very cold 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar ? cup toasted walnuts, broken into small pieces Maple syrup, for serving Instructions: Whisk the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.

Cook onions, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes or until onions are soft and caramel in color. Heat a heavy griddle pan over medium high to high heat. Wipe griddle with a drizzle of oil using a paper towel. Sear and cook thin sliced steaks until brown but not crisp, about 2 minutes on each side. Cook steaks in single layers in 2 batches and tenderize by cutting into meat with the side of your spatula while they cook. When the steaks are browned, just before you remove them from heat, sprinkle them with garlic salt and pepper. When all of the steaks are cooked, line each of your split rolls with 2 slices of provolone cheese. Pile 1/4 of your meat and onions on to the griddle and mix together with your spatula. Pile the meat and onions into rolls on top of the cheese. The heat from the meat and onions will melt the cheese.

Wrap the foil around the log, twist the ends closed and place in the freezer until firm, about 20 minutes.</li><li>Using a sharp knife, cut a series of slits into each potato, with about 1/8-inch between slits and cutting about three-quarters of the way through. Unwrap the butter log and thinly slice two-thirds of it into about 24 rounds. Slip the butter slices into every 3 to 4 slits of each potato, using about 6 slices per potato. Wrap each potato tightly in nonstick aluminum foil, sealing the foil on the top side of the potato.</li><li>Place directly on the oven rack and bake until very tender, about 1 hour. Carefully open the top of each potato package to let out the steam and expose the tops. Bake until browned and crisped, about 10 minutes more. Unwrap each potato and drizzle with any accumulated flavored butter from the foil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54936,&quot;Fall Figs Stuffed with Stilton Cheese, Wrapped in Prosciutto and Chateau Elan Port Wine Syrup 4 brown Turkish figs, ripe 2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto 2 ounces Stilton cheese 3/4 cup Chateau Elan port wine Instructions: Cut figs into quarters and place them in a saucepot with the port wine and bring to boil, simmer and reduce by 2/3.

Wrap the beets in aluminum foil and roast in the oven until the beets are tender and a paring knife inserted in the center is met with no resistance, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Once cooked, set aside until they are cool enough to handle. Then, using a paper towel, rub the skin off the beets and then cut into moons or dice.<br> Mix the goat cheese with the rosemary and thyme until combined and set aside.<br> Gather up the rest of the ingredients and have them at the ready before you grill your bread.<br> Preheat a cast-iron grill pan, or a grill, to medium-high heat. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and stretch and press with your hands to form a thin, rectangular shape. If you need to, pick up the dough and let the natural weight of the dough stretch itself out. It doesn&#39;t need to be perfect, matter of fact it is better when it&#39;s not. Once you have the dough in the shape you like, brush one side of the dough with olive oil and lay that side down flat onto the preheated grill. Cook the dough until it is charred and has a crisp texture, about 5 minutes, brush the other side with some oil and then flip the dough and char the second side. Once the bread is charred and cooked, remove it from the grill and assemble the flatbread.<br> Spread the herbed goat cheese onto the flatbread. Toss the arugula with some lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper and then place it on the flatbread. Top with sliced beets and crispy bacon and another drizzle of olive oil. Cut the flatbread and serve.<br> In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you&#39;d like!<br> Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don&#39;t need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature, it should just feel warm to the touch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 54940,&quot;Citrus-Scented Sugar White or raw sugar Citrus peel, some cut with a peeler and some with a zester Clear jars, (with tops) such as mason jars Instructions: Fill jars with sugar to a depth of 1/2-inch.
