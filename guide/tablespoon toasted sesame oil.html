oyster mushrooms 3.5 ounces maitake mushrooms 1/4 cup vegetable oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced 6 ounces spinach (about 1/2 bunch), stemmed 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds Instructions: For the noodles: Add the dangmyeon to a large heatproof bowl. Bring 8 cups water to a boil in a kettle or medium pot and pour the boiling water over the noodles, making sure the noodles are completely covered. Let sit until the noodles are pliable and al dente, about 10 minutes. For the sauce: Meanwhile, whisk the soy sauce, mirin, sugar, corn syrup, sesame oil and garlic in a medium bowl until most of the sugar is dissolved and the sauce is homogenous. Set aside. Drain the noodles and rinse under cold running water, rubbing the noodles between your fingers and gently massaging them in the water. Drain and then rinse again, repeating 2 more times to remove any excess starch. Allow to drain well, then transfer to a bowl and season with the soy sauce and sugar. Set aside. For the vegetables: Thinly slice the shiitakes. Cut the king oyster mushrooms in half crosswise and slice into the same thickness as the shiitakes. Tear and shred the oyster and maitake mushrooms into thin pieces, about the same thickness. Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil to a large nonstick skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Add half of the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring once halfway through, until browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms and an additional 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the same skillet. Add the onions and some salt and pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until just tender with a little bite, about 1 minute. Transfer to the plate with the mushrooms. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the same skillet, then add the seasoned noodles and spinach. Cook, stirring and mixing constantly with tongs to cook off the moisture from the noodles and wilt the spinach, about 2 minutes. Add the reserved mushrooms and onions and prepared sauce. Cook, tossing constantly to coat the noodles and vegetables evenly, until the sauce is absorbed, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and toss with the sesame oil. Transfer to a large serving bowl or plate and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Serve hot or warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31254,&quot;Almond Cake 1/2 cup fine yellow cornmeal 1/2 cup cake flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup almond paste, cut into half-inch pieces 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for dusting 4 egg yolks 2 eggs 1/4 cup sour cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour an 8-inch round cake pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, cake flour and baking powder. Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and almond paste on high speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add vanilla extract and slowly pour in confectioners&#39; sugar. Mix until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Raise speed to high and add the egg yolks and whole eggs, one at a time. Reduce speed to medium and add the sour cream and dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the surface with a spatula. Bake in the lower third of the oven for 35 minutes, or until the cake is golden and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool. Remove from pan and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 31255,&quot;Mashed Potato Polpetti (Patties) 3 cups mashed potatoes Grey salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Flour, for dredging 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil Leftover gravy Instructions: Re-season potatoes with salt and pepper, stir in cheese. Take a mayonnaise or peanut butter lid, line with plastic wrap to use as a mold. Pack the potato mixture into the lid, unwrap it and place the patty on a baking sheet. You may refrigerate them covered with plastic wrap until the next day, or fry immediately. To cook, dredge the patties in flour. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, add patties. Just before frying, dredge the patties again with flour. Add the patties to the oil without crowding them (you may have to cook them in batches). Cook until underside is golden brown, about 5 minutes, flip and brown the other side. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Serve hot with leftover gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 31256,&quot;Crostini with Ricotta and Goat Cheese Salt and pepper 24 (1/2-inch-thick) slices baguette bread 3 tablespoons olive oil 4 ounces soft fresh goat cheese 1/4 cup whole milk ricotta cheese 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh basil leaves 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon peel Instructions: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the bread slices. Grill the bread until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Stir the goat cheese, ricotta cheese, basil, lemon peel, and remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a small bowl until smooth and creamy. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Spread the cheese mixture over the crostini. Arrange the toasts on a platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Prosecco]&quot; 31257,&quot;Curried Tuna Salad Two 6 ounce cans white meat tuna packed in water, drained 3 tablespoons minced red onion, soaked in cold water for 5 minutes, drained 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander (cilantro) 1 tablespoon golden raisins, plumped in 2 tablespoons warm water for 10 minutes, drained 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, like soy, peanut, or corn 2 teaspoons Madras-style curry powder 6 tablespoons mayonnaise Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lime juice plus more to taste Serving suggestions: 2 cups mixed lettuces or 3 to 4 pita breads Instructions: In a mixing bowl break the tuna up with a fork. Toss with the onion, fresh coriander, and raisins. In a small saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat, add the curry powder, and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove pan from the heat and set oil aside to cool. Add the curry oil to the mayonnaise, season with salt, and pepper to taste and add the lime juice. Gently mix the tuna with the seasoned mayonnaise. Serve on a bed of lettuce or in a sandwich. Yield: 3 to 4 servings &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 31258,&quot;Hot Fudge Pudding 1 cup all-purpose flour 2/3 cup sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa 1/2 cup milk 2 tablespoons butter, melted 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup brown sugar, packed 3/4 cup boiling water 1/2 cup raspberries 1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 medium ramekins or 4 by 4-inch baking dishes, and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and 1/4 cup cocoa. Whisk in the milk, butter, and vanilla, just until smooth. Divide the batter between the 2 baking dishes. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and remaining1/4 cup cocoa, and sprinkle evenly over the batter. Carefully pour 3/4 cup boiling water over each dish and add about 8 raspberries to each dish. Bake 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Top with a dollop of whip cream and a few fresh raspberries. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 31259,&quot;Lima Bean Soup with Parmesan Bacon Crisp 2/3 cup diced onion 3 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/3 cup diced carrot 1/3 cup diced celery 3 cups lima beans, thawed 1 apple peeled, cored, pitted and sliced 4 cups chicken broth Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup fully cooked crumbled bacon Sour cream, for plating, optional Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large heavy-bottomed pot, cook onion in butter and oil over medium heat until translucent about 10 minutes. Add the carrot and celery and cook another 5 minutes. While vegetables are cooking, place lima beans in boiling water and cook until very soft about 10 minutes. Drain lima beans and add to the pot with the sliced apple. Pour in the chicken broth. Lower heat and simmer an additional 5 minutes. Then puree with a hand blender. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. For the Parmesan Bacon Crisp: Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Make 4 to 5 lines with the Parmesan, about 1-inch wide and 4-inches long. Sprinkle with bacon. Bake for about 7 to 10 minutes or until golden and crisp. Remove from oven and let cool. Peel crisp from foil and serve with soup. Cook&#39;s Note: For additional flavor, add an additional 1/2 cup of Parmesan and 1/4 cup bacon to the soup before pureeing. Also a dollop of sour cream adds a creamy finish to this healthy soup.

If the base of the eggplant is very large, cut it in half lengthwise. Soak the sliced eggplant in a large bowl of warm, salted water for 1 to 2 hours. Make sure the eggplant is completely submerged in the salt water. Scramble the 3 eggs with salt and pepper to make an egg wash. Remove eggplant slices from the salt bath, shake off excess moisture, and dip into egg wash. Then dip the eggplant slices, 1 at a time, into a flat plate filled with seasoned bread crumbs, covering all surfaces, and set aside. Continue breading the eggplant until all slices are done. Discard excess egg wash and bread crumbs. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan and allow it to heat up. (Add more oil as necessary during cooking.) Add the breaded eggplant slices to the pan, cover and cook until you begin to see the eggplant become translucent, about 5 minutes. If it begins to burn, lower heat and allow it to cook slowly. Using a large spatula, turn eggplant onto the other side and cook 1 to 2 more minutes with the lid on until eggplant is completely tender. When eggplant is completely cooked, remove from frying pan and place onto paper towels to blot any excess oil. Place 2 or 3 eggplant slices onto warmed Italian roll, top with shredded mozzarella cheese, then warm marinara sauce.

F. Brush a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Line the dish with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the long sides. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the granulated sugar and cocoa powder in a large bowl to remove any lumps. Whisk in the eggs and vanilla until well combined. Whisk in the melted butter in 2 additions until smooth. Whisk in the flour mixture just until smooth. Spread in the baking dish. Make the cookie layer: Stir the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Beat the butter and both sugars in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla to the butter-sugar mixture and beat just until smooth. With the mixer on low speed, beat in the flour mixture just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips with a spoon or spatula. Flatten a handful of the cookie dough until 1/2 inch thick and place on top of the brownie layer. Continue to flatten pieces of dough and add to the top, using your fingers to smooth the dough into an even layer covering the entire brownie layer. Bake until the top is golden and puffed and the edges are crisp and just beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely, at least 1 1/2 hours. Make the glaze: Combine the chocolate chips and heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Drizzle over the bars and cut into squares. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 31267,&quot;Chicken Potpie Turnovers 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 onion, chopped 1 carrot, chopped 1 stalk celery, chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons dried thyme 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup white wine 1 cup chicken stock 1 teaspoon dijon mustard 1/2 cup frozen peas 1 1/2 cups cubed or shredded cooked chicken<br> 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed 1 large egg 1 clove garlic, halved 1 teaspoon dijon mustard 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar Small splash of soy sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 6 cups mixed greens (the darker the better; not iceberg!) Instructions: Make the turnovers: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and celery, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook until the carrot softens, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for an additional minute, stirring frequently. Add the flour and cook off the raw flavor, about 1 minute more. Turn up the heat to medium high and deglaze the pan with the wine. Whisk in the stock and dijon mustard. Add the peas and chicken and cook at a very low simmer until the sauce thickens up into a gravy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. On a floured surface, unfold the puff pastry and cut into 4 squares (cut once horizontally and once vertically). Gently roll out each square, increasing the size of the square by about 20 percent. Place on a baking sheet and spoon the chicken mixture in the center. Fold the squares in half diagonally to create triangles. Pinch the edges together to create turnovers (use a little water if needed to bind). Press the edges with a fork to create a decorative border. Whisk the egg with a splash of water and brush the turnovers with the egg wash. Cut a small slit in the tops to allow the steam to escape during baking. Bake the turnovers until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool at least 10 minutes before serving as the insides will be very hot. Meanwhile, make the salad: Rub the inside of a large wooden bowl with the garlic clove and then either discard it or save it for another use. Put the mustard in the bowl and whisk in the vinegar and soy sauce (a French secret!) vigorously for about 10 seconds to get a creamy consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle in the olive oil as slowly as possible with one hand while whisking as quickly as possible with the other hand to emulsify. Lay the salad greens on top of the dressing and toss just before serving. Serve with the turnovers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 31268,&quot;Slow-Cooker Pulled Pork Sandwiches | How to Make Pulled Pork in a Crock Pot 1 2-pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch pieces 1/2 onion, roughly chopped 4 cloves garlic Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3/4 cup ketchup 2 tablespoons spicy yellow mustard 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup sliced pickles, plus 2 tablespoons brine 2 teaspoons hot sauce 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 slices Texas toast or other thick white bread 1 1/4 cups prepared coleslaw Instructions: Combine the pork, onion, garlic, 1/2 cup water, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker.

Always wash and dry chicken on the inside so it doesn&#39;t steam and it bakes crispy. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, drizzle with a few tablespoons of oil, and season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. (Make sure you season in the cavity, under the skin, and over the skin as this is the main seasoning. You could add a few teaspoons of a ground dried spice if you want to add flavor.) Let bird sit at room temperature while the oven heats up, about 20 to 30 minutes. Place chicken on a roasting rack, on a cooling rack, on your toaster oven rack, or on a bed of vegetables (heads of garlic, halved onions, or lemons work) and set in a roasting pan or baking dish. Roast until skin is golden-brown, about 20 to 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F and roast, basting with pan juices, until juices run clear when thigh is pierced and temperature is 160 degrees F, about 40 to 60 minutes more (depends on the size of the bird).

For the mushrooms: Drizzle the Worcestershire sauce over the sliced mushrooms in a large bowl, toss to evenly coat and set aside. Mix the all-purpose flour, cornstarch and Cajun seasoning together in a medium bowl. Mix together the yogurt and fizzy water in another bowl until smooth. To triple coat the mushrooms, working in batches, first dip in the flour mixture, then coat in the yogurt mixture and then back to the flour mix once again, so they are evenly coated. Repeat until they are all coated. Heat approximately 1 inch of vegetable oil in an extra-large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the mushrooms and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes on each side.

Place in a medium stockpot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until the potato pieces can be easily pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes, reserving 1 cup of the water. Let the water cool until it is warm to the touch (about 100 degrees F), about 10 minutes.<br> Mash the potatoes and measure 1 packed cup. You will probably have extra potatoes; I suggest adding some salt, butter and a dash of cream and eating them!<br> In a large heatproof mixing bowl, add the flour, reserved water, yeast and potatoes and mix with a wooden spoon to combine. Add 3 tablespoons of the oil and the salt and mix to combine.<br> Knead the dough on a clean surface while adding more flour (up to 1 1/2 cups) until your dough is soft and slightly tacky, 5 to 7 minutes. Add in the olives towards the end of kneading.<br> Drizzle a layer of oil in a large bowl and coat the dough in the oil on both sides. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.<br> When the dough has doubled in size, add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil to a 12-inch round cast-iron skillet or a similar-sized heavy-bottomed pan to coat the pan. Spread the dough into the skillet so it covers the bottom. If it&#39;s bouncing back a lot, let the dough rest a few minutes and try again.<br> Cover and let rise in a warm place, about 1 hour. Alternatively, you can let it rise in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. If you refrigerate it, it won&#39;t rise as much. Bring it to room temperature before the next step. Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Use your fingers to make dimples in the dough and drizzle with more oil.<br> For the menorah: Remove the outer darkest layer of the onion and cut into 3 thin pieces that are 1 1/2 inches long to make up the menorah stand. Dice the rest of the onion layer into 1-centimeter pieces to make a decorative border around the edge of the dough.<br> Cut off one side of the red pepper, avoiding the seeds. Trim a 2-inch curved piece to be the very bottom of the menorah stand. Then trim 3 thin flatter pieces that are 1 1/2 inches long to make up the menorah stand. Dice the remaining piece of red pepper into nine 1/2-centimeter pieces to make the candle wicks that will be placed between the asparagus candles and the tomato flames.<br> Trim each piece of asparagus to fit the middle of the skillet, making sure 1 piece for the shamash (lighter candle) is slightly longer and the other 8 pieces are of equal length. Place the longer shamash piece on top of the dough in the center, then arrange the other 8 asparagus pieces in a row, spacing them out evenly on each side of the shamash. The shamash should be a little taller and the other asparagus pieces should be the same height.<br> Add the 9 diced red pepper pieces on top of the asparagus pieces to make the candle wicks. For the flames, slice the grape tomatoes in half lengthwise, remove all the seeds and place one of them cut-side down above each red pepper piece to make a flame (you&#39;ll have 1 grape tomato half left over).<br> For the base of the menorah, place a single row of olives below the asparagus, then alternate between the thin slices of red pepper and onion in the center to make the menorah stand. Place the 2-inch curved red pepper piece at the bottom of the stand, curving downward. Finally, make a decorative border by alternating between the remaining olives and diced onion around the edge of the dough.<br> Brush everything with oil and bake until very golden brown, about 30 minutes. When done, brush with even more oil and sprinkle with salt. Eat!

Transfer to a sheet tray lined with parchment paper and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the blueberries and granulated sugar to a saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Stir to combine and break up the blueberries with a wooden spoon. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon zest and juice and mix to combine. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool. Roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thick and trim into a rectangle. Evenly drop 4 spoonfuls of the filling along one half of the longer side of the dough rectangle and fold the dough over to cover the filling. Press down between each filling pocket and along the edges to secure. Cut between each filling pocket to make 4 rectangular pastry pockets. Place the pastry pockets on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove to a sheet tray lined with a rack to cool before icing with the glaze. For the glaze: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a large bowl. Add the vanilla bean paste, salt and egg whites and mix to combine. Add the lemon zest and juice. Mix well to combine and add the poppy seeds. If the glaze seems too thick, add a little bit more lemon juice. Drizzle the lemon poppy seed glaze over the top of the pastry pockets and garnish with the Candied Cashews. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk the water and egg white in a bowl until frothy. Add the cashews, granulated sugar, vanilla bean paste and salt and toss to combine. Transfer the mixture to a parchment-lined sheet and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool.

Turn each over, pour the egg into the hole, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until the bottoms of the bread are golden brown, the egg whites are set and the yolk is still runny, 4 to 5 minutes. For the last minute of cooking, cover the pan with a lid to cook the egg white completely through. (The sandwich round may finish cooking faster.) Transfer the sandwich with the egg to a serving plate along with the sandwich round, to dip into the egg yolk. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31305,&quot;Apple-Cherry Lattice Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 3 tablespoons ice water 3 tablespoons cold vodka 3 pounds assorted apples (such as Cortland, Granny Smith and McIntosh) Juice of 1 lemon 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup jarred cherries in syrup or whole cherry jam 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon pure almond or vanilla extract Pinch of allspice 1 large egg, lightly beaten Coarse sugar, for sprinkling Instructions: Make the crust: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor to combine. Add one-quarter of the butter; process until it disappears into the flour, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture looks like cornmeal with bean-size bits of butter. Combine the water and vodka and drizzle over the flour mixture. Pulse until the dough just starts coming together but stop before it gathers into a ball. Divide evenly between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and gently pat each into a disk, using the plastic wrap to help you. (If the dough seems dry with large bits of butter, turn it out onto a work surface and use the heel of your hand to press the dough together.) Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Make the filling: Peel and thinly slice the apples; toss in a bowl with the lemon juice. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add the apples and cook, tossing occasionally, until juicy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; fold in the cherries, flour, extract and allspice. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate; refrigerate until ready to fill. Place a piece of parchment paper on an inverted baking sheet. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round, transfer to the parchment and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Transfer the dough (on the parchment) to a work surface. Using a fluted pastry wheel or a chef&#39;s knife, cut the dough into 14 to 16 half-inch-wide strips. Weave into a lattice on the parchment. Slide back onto the baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Pour the filling into the crust. Gently slide the lattice off the parchment and onto the fruit, adjusting as needed; trim the excess dough if needed, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhanging dough under itself. Brush the lattice with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Refrigerate the pie 30 minutes. Position a rack in the lowest position of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Place the pie on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 1 1/2 hours.

Bring to a boil then turn the heat off and let it sit for at least 1 hour. (*Big tip: This can be done ahead and used for LOTS of different things.) Using a mandoline, slice 1 potato extremely thin, (paper thin), in elongated rounds. Lay a piece of parchment paper on a clean, dry work surface. Arrange 3 potato slices in an overlapping vertical line pressing them together as you put them on the parchment. Repeat this process until you have a 4 by 6-inch overlapping potato rectangle that replicates fish scales. Brush the potato \scales\ with the infused oil and sprinkle with salt. Season the halibut with salt. Lay the halibut fillet closer to 1 end of the potato rectangle than the other and then roll the fish up in the potato slices, using the parchment to help facilitate the rolling. Press to compact and really adhere the potatoes to the fish. Brush the outside of the potatoes with the infused oil to seal the potatoes and to prevent the potatoes from turning brown, this will also help make a nice tight \fish package. Reserve the fish in the refrigerator while preparing the remaining fillets. Refrigerate the fillets for at least 1 hour before cooking. To cook the fish: Add the infused olive oil to a large nonstick saute pan until the bottom is generously covered and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Season the fish with salt and add to the pan. Cook the fish on both sides for 3 to 4 minutes frequently spooning the excess oil over the fish to \baste\ it. The potatoes should be crispy golden brown and very well flavored and the fish will be succulent inside its crispy \scales. Transfer to serving plates and serve.

Season the inside of the chicken cavity with salt and pepper. Put the crushed garlic, chopped onion and dry herbs inside the cavity of the chicken. Using the twine, tie the legs closed. Use the olive oil to rub the entire outside of the chicken with an even coat of oil. Pick the herb from the stem and coarsely chop them before sprinkling the herb liberally and evenly on the chicken. Place the chicken into the pre-heated roasting pan and roast at 425 degrees for the first 45 minutes of roasting. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to roast for an additional 1 hour. Remove from the oven and pierce the thigh: if the juices run clear when pierced allow to rest on a platter for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. If the juices are still pink return to the oven for more roasting time. While the chicken is resting, place the roasting pan on top of the stove, remove any chicken fat with a spoon, and, over medium heat, deglaze the pan drippings with the chicken broth. Use a spoon to scrape up all the crusty bits (that&#39;s where the most concentrated flavor is) and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and strain the liquid into a gravy boat to pass at the table.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31322,&quot;Passion Yellowtail Snapper 2 (7-ounce) portions yellowtail snapper fillets, rinsed Pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons dry white wine Passion Fruit Beurre Blanc, recipe follows 2 teaspoons toasted sweetened coconut 6 slices mango 1 small shallot, minced 1 teaspoon olive oil 1/4 cup dry white wine 4 passion fruit (or 1/2 cup passion fruit juice) 1/4 cup softened unsalted butter Pinch salt and freshly ground white pepper Instructions: Season the yellowtail fillets with salt and pepper, then dust 1 side only with flour, shaking off any excess.

Set aside. Drain the artichoke hearts and reserve the liquid. Place the artichoke hearts in the food processor and pure, using some of the liquid if necessary to facilitate pureing. Set aside. Heat up the olive oil in a large saucepan, then add the pured carrot, celery and onion and cook on high heat for 1 minute, stirring constantly because they can burn easily. Add the pured artichoke hearts and their liquid and 4 cups water. Bring the soup to a boil on high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer gently for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring every few minutes so that it doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pan! Mix the cornstarch with 1 cup warm water in a small bowl, using your hands to make sure the cornstarch is fully dissolved, then add the mixture to the soup and bring it back to boil. If the soup is too thick for your taste, add a bit more water; if it is too thin, add a bit more cornstarch mixed with water. Don\u2019t overdo it, because a bit of cornstarch goes a long way. Add the cream to the soup and stir, then remove the pot from the stove. Add the grated cheese to the soup a bit at the time, using a whisk to work it into the soup so that it doesn\u2019t form large clumps. Add 1 tablespoon salt, then taste the soup and, if you think it is necessary, add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31331,&quot;Chez Ray&#39;s Scandia Glogg 1 lemon, zested 1 orange, zested 3 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon allspice 2 teaspoons cinnamon 2 teaspoons ground cloves 2 cups boiling water 2 quarts red wine, such as Pinot Noir 1 cup Aquavit (a Scandinavian liquor) Instructions: Place zest, sugar, and spices in saucepan and cover with boiling water.

For each pot of crabs, add water, beer, and approximately 1/4 packet of crab boil seasoning to pot. Bring to boil. With gloves on, remove crabs from bushel, you may have to pull them apart (carefully!) and put/shake a few at a time into pot. It is best to grab them from behind to avoid the claws, as their legs only move forward. Add enough crabs to fill bottom of pot. Sprinkle more crab boil seasoning over first layer of crabs. Continue, alternating crabs and seasoning until pot is nearly full, leaving about an inch at the top. Cover tightly. Steam over high heat for 14 to 16 minutes, or until shells are bright orange. Halfway through cooking time, shake pot to redistribute seasoning. When done, remove pot from heat. Drain over sink the accumulated liquid from pot. Spread crabs onto large tray; place in center of table where guests help themselves. Serve with small dishes of melted butter and, for those who like added seasoning, place small bowls of extra crab boil seasoning on table.<br> Eating guidelines: It is easier to learn how to eat crabs from an expert, but if none is available, here are step-by-step instructions. First, pull off claws and legs. Break legs and check for meat. Sucking is okay. Some like to save the claws for last because they are rather dessert-like, although the \lump\ meat from the body is prized most. Next, turn the crab on its back. You will see an elongated part of the shell that looks like a \T.\ Some call it the key, even though it doesn&#39;t look very much like one. The female key is plumper; the male&#39;s is more elongated. Pull the key back, breaking it off, which makes the rest of the shell easy to remove. Now the body of the crab is shell-less. You will now see the long rib-like strips on either side of the cavity. These are the crab&#39;s gills. Edible, but not very good. Pull them off, and you will more easily be able to break the crab in half. When you do this, you will most likely now see a good amount of white, fleshy \lump\ crab meat. Continue opening the small sections to expose more meat. You will not need mallets or hammers for this. When you are ready for the claws, break them in half at the joint. Take a wooden mallet and whack the large half hard. Don&#39;t be shy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31334,&quot;Bean, Egg and Cheese Molletes Two 6- to 7-inch long soft white rolls, split lengthwise 8 ounces shredded pepper jack cheese<br> One 15- to 16-ounce can refried beans (about 1 1/2 cups) 4 slices thick-cut bacon, roughly chopped 1 to 2 ripe juicy tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick (you need about 12 slices) Kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 4 large eggs, beaten well with a fork 3 scallions, thinly sliced<br> 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves Salsa and hot sauce, for serving (optional)<br> Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Toast the bread under the broiler cut-side up until brown around the edges, about 2 minutes. Put the pepper jack in a medium bowl and the refried beans in another medium bowl. Cook the bacon in a medium cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring once or twice, until crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Use a slotted spoon to scoop the bacon into the pepper jack, then use a fork to toss them together. Stir 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings into the refried beans and mix well to combine. Scrape any remaining drippings into a small bowl. Do not wipe out the pan. Put the rolls cut-side up on a baking sheet. Divide the beans equally among the rolls, spreading them to the edges. Shingle slices of tomato on top and sprinkle lightly with salt. Drizzle a little bit of the reserved bacon fat, if you have some, over the top.<br> Add the butter to the skillet and melt over medium heat. Beat the eggs again until frothy. Add them to the skillet and cook, using a rubber spatula to pull in the edges as they set and tilting the pan so uncooked egg runs underneath. (You might have to scrape a little of the egg to the sides of the pan as it cooks.) Do this until most of the egg is set, but some uncooked, gooey egg is still sitting on top, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Use a metal spatula to cut the egg up and put pieces on top of the tomatoes. Top the egg with the pepper jack and bacon mixture.<br> Broil the molletes until the pepper jack is bubbly and brown, turning the baking sheet as necessary to prevent burning, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the scallions and cilantro. Serve with salsa and hot sauce, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 31335,&quot;Brownie Cupcakes a la Mode 1 1/4 sticks (5 ounces) unsalted butter, softened and cut into pieces 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped 2/3 cup boiling water 1 1/4 cups sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 cup finely chopped toasted walnuts 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips 1 pint vanilla ice cream 1/4 cup prepared hot fudge sauce 2 tablespoons rainbow colored sprinkles 12 jarred maraschino cherries with stems, drained and patted dry Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line one 12-cup standard muffin tin with paper cupcake liners.

When they begin to thicken, stir gently with a large spoon to create large flaps in the scrambled eggs. The eggs will be darker in color and thicker than normal scrambled eggs. Spread 1 teaspoon of butter on each of the bread halves. For each smorrebrod, at 2 corners that face each other diagonally, place 2 slices of cucumber. At the other 2 corners, place about 1/4 teaspoon of salmon roe. Cover the rest of the bread with about 1/12 of the egg mixture. Repeat until all smorrebrod are done.

Coat a large wide pot lightly with olive oil. Lay the duck legs skin side down, in a single layer, in the pan. Cook the duck legs low and slow over low heat to render the fat. This process will take a while, don&#39;t rush it. It is really important to render as much fat out of the duck legs as possible. Once the pan is full of fat, turn up the heat and brown the duck legs on both sides. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Once the legs have rendered and are nice and brown, remove them from the pan and reserve. Add the onions and season with salt. Stir to coat with the duck fat. Cover and cook over medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes. Once the onions are really nice and wilted, remove the lid and cook for another 15 minutes or until the onions start to caramelize. Taste to make sure they are very well seasoned, add salt if needed. Return the duck legs to the pan, snuggle them in with all the onions and add the wine, thyme and bay leaves. Cover the pan and place in the preheated oven. Braise the duck in the oven for about 90 minutes. Stir the onion and duck every 30 minutes to be sure that the onions are not burning. When done, the duck should be incredibly flavorful, tender and falling off the bone. Remove the tough lower stems from the dandelion greens, wash and spin them dry. Cut them into 1 -inch lengths. Place the greens in a large bowl with red wine vinegar. Season with salt and some of the warm duck fat. Strain some the onions out of the duck fat and toss them in with the greens. Place a large mound of the dressed dandelion greens on each serving plate, lay a duck leg on the greens and top with a little more of the onions. It&#39;s just ducky!!! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 31345,&quot;Chilaquiles Strata with Tomatillo Salsa and Tomato-Corn-Avocado Salad with Green Onion Vinaigrette 12 large tomatillos, washed and quartered 4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped<br> 1 large red onion, peeled and chopped<br> 3 tablespoons canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup spinach leaves, blanched and squeezed dry<br> 1/2 cup cilantro leaves<br> 1 tablespoon chipotle puree<br> Juice of 2 to 3 limes<br> Clover honey, to taste<br> Unsalted butter, for the baking dish 10 large eggs 1 cup milk 1 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese 1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 3 cups coarsely crumbled baked or fried blue corn tortilla chips 1/4 cup grated cotija cheese 2 teaspoons canola oil Kernels from 1 large ear sweet corn<br> 1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, halved<br> 2 Hass avocados, diced<br> 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 green onions, chopped<br> Juice of 2 limes<br> 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br> 1/3 to 1/2 cup olive oil<br> Clover honey, to taste Instructions: For the tomatillo salsa: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Add the onions and a pinch of salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for about 1 minute. Add the sage and cook until the onions stop releasing water (about 3 minutes). Add the water, cover and cook until the onions are very tender (about 10 minutes). Uncover and saute until the onions are very soft and the pan is dry again (about 2 minutes). Season well with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Peel back the pork skin and spread the onions directly on the fat layer. Fold the skin back over the onions and tie closed with kitchen string. Season well all over with the Fennel spice. Arrange the meat on a rack in a roasting pan and cook until the meat is very tender (approx. 6-8 hours). The meat is ready when it pulls away easily if picked at with a pair of tongs. It is often easiest to cook the meat overnight or put it in the oven in the morning and let it cook all day - it doesn&#39;t need to be attended. FENNEL SPICE RUB: Put the fennel seeds, coriander seeds and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium heat. Watch carefully, tossing frequently so the seeds toast evenly. When light-brown and fragrant, pour the seeds onto a plate to cool. They must be cool before grinding or they will gum up the blades. Pour the seeds into a blender or spice grinder and add the salt.

At this point use your hands to bring the mixture together to form a dough. Place the dough on a lightly floured work service and kneed until shiny. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for about 1/2 hour. While the dough is resting, make your filling by mixing together the ricotta, lemon zest, nutmeg, mint and Parmesan - you may want to reserve a little Parmesan and mint for serving - and then carefully season to balance the flavours. Squeeze a little lemon juice into the mix to loosen it a bit. If you&#39;re partial to a little bit more Parmesan, mint or lemon, then do personalize the dish to your liking. Roll good teaspoons of the mix into little balls ready to fill your caramella. Run dough through pasta machine on its thickest setting a until it is smooth and shiny. Reduce setting each time until the pasta is roughly as thick as a beer mat. Cut the pasta into 10 (4 by 2 1/2-inch) rectangles. Fill the middle with the little balls of filling and brush lightly with water. Roll up. Keep on a flour-dusted baking sheet in the refrigerator until you need them, and try to cook them as fresh as possible. Make as many as you can, but I like to serve about 4 per person.

Pour the cream into a saucepan over medium-low heat. Scrape the vanilla caviar (seeds) from the vanilla bean and add it to the cream. Bring almost to the boil, then turn off the heat. Place the egg yolks in a large bowl and add the sugar. With a whisk, mix the eggs and sugar together like crazy until they are a very pale yellow, about 4 minutes. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Pour the hot cream into the bowl through the strainer to remove any skin or impurities in the cream. Slowly drizzle 1/2 cup of the hot cream into the egg/sugar mixture while whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from cooking. Continue adding the rest of the hot cream to the bowl very slowly, whisking constantly until fully incorporated. You can add the cream a little more rapidly as the mixture warms; touch the side of the bowl to gauge the mixture&#39;s temperature. Gently stir in the lemon zest. Arrange 4 shallow ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet. Ladle the mixture into the ramekins until they are roughly three-quarters of the way full. Carefully place the baking sheet in the oven. With the rack slightly pulled out, gently pour hot water into the baking sheet until it reaches two-thirds of the way up the outside of the ramekins. Bake until the custard is set but not brown on the top, roughly 22 minutes. Watch closely as these can brown very quickly toward the end. Allow them to cool completely on the baking sheet. Refrigerate the custard-filled ramekins, covered, for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. When you are ready to serve, sprinkle each of the custards generously with superfine sugar. Using a kitchen torch, crisp the sugar until it is light brown and just bubbling; a back and forth motion works best. Be sure to work quickly to avoid cooking the custard below. This step can be done within an hour of serving. Garnish each custard with Black and Blue Berries. Put 1/2 cup each of the blackberries and blueberries in a saucepan and add the sugar, blackberry jam, honey, lemon zest, vanilla extract and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Using a potato masher, mash the berries gently until they are good and broken up. Add the remaining 2 cups each blackberries and blueberries to a mixing bowl. Pour the warm berry mixture over the fresh berries and fold everything together with a spatula until well coated. Allow everything to cool 10 minutes or so before serving. Serve atop your favorite dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31391,&quot;Cheddar Corn Chowder 8 ounces bacon, chopped 1/4 cup good olive oil 6 cups chopped yellow onions (4 large onions) 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup flour 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric 12 cups chicken stock 6 cups medium-diced white boiling potatoes, unpeeled (2 pounds) 10 cups corn kernels, fresh (10 ears) or frozen (3 pounds) 2 cups half-and-half 1/2 pound sharp white cheddar cheese, grated Instructions: In a large stockpot over medium-high heat, cook the bacon and olive oil until the bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes.

Line an 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on at least 2 sides. Butter the foil. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder and salt in a medium bowl. Melt the butter and chocolate in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, then remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Stir in the sugar and eggs, then add the flour mixture and stir to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with just a few crumbs adhering, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan on a cooling rack, then place in the freezer to firm up, about 30 minutes. Use the foil overhang to help lift the brownie out of the pan and carefully flip it over onto a cutting board, making sure that it does not bend or crack. Peel the foil away from the bottom, then discard the foil and line the baking sheet with plastic wrap.<br> Using a warm knife, trim the rough edges off of the brownie so it is even (the brownie should be 16-by-12-inches). Cut the brownie in half crosswise, resulting in 2 pieces that are 12-by-8-inches. Lay one of the brownie pieces onto the prepared baking sheet, top-side facing down. Working quickly, use a large ice cream scoop to spread the ice cream evenly across the brownie, getting close to the edge. Use an offset or rubber spatula to help smooth out the sides and top of the ice cream. Place the other brownie piece on top and gently press to create one large ice cream sandwich. Fold the plastic wrap around the assembled ice cream sandwich to help hold its shape, then return it to the freezer to harden, at least 6 hours or up to overnight. Use a warm knife to cut twenty-four ice cream sandwiches. Roll the edges of each sandwich into the chopped espresso beans until they stick to all of the exposed ice cream edges.

Lay the chicken between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet, gently pound the chicken to 1/4-inch thickness. Take care not to pound too hard because the meat may tear or create holes. Lay 2 slices of cheese on each breast, followed by 2 slices of ham, and 2 more of cheese; leaving a 1/2-inch margin on all sides to help seal the roll. Tuck in the sides of the breast and roll up tight like a jellyroll. Squeeze the log gently to seal. Season the flour with salt and pepper; spread out on waxed paper or in a flat dish. Mix the breadcrumbs with thyme, kosher salt, pepper, and oil. The oil will help the crust brown. Beat together the eggs and water, the mixture should be fluid.

While still hot add the remaining ingredients and mash well. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31434,&quot;Shrimp Pontchartrain 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small yellow onion, diced<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 4 ounces Chardonnay<br> 1 lemon, halved<br> 1 tablespoon dried thyme 2 teaspoons paprika<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne powder<br> 1 1/2 cups chicken stock<br> 2 cups heavy cream<br> Kosher salt and ground black pepper Cornstarch, for thickening<br> 8 ounces crawfish tail meat<br> 16 (size 16/20) raw shrimp with tails (about 1 pound), peeled and deveined 3 to 4 cups cooked rice, for serving<br> Instructions: Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat; add the butter, onion and garlic and saute until translucent. Deglaze the pan by adding the Chardonnay and making sure to scrape all the delicious bits that may have started to stick from the bottom. Juice the lemon through your fingers into the saute pan, tossing any seeds, then throw the lemon rinds in the pan as well. Simmer this mixture until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in thyme, paprika and cayenne, followed by the chicken stock, then bring everything to a rolling boil. Add the heavy cream and bring back to a boil. Upon reaching a second boil, immediately reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Carefully remove and toss the lemons. Season your creamy base with salt and pepper. To thicken the base into Pontchartrain sauce, you will need to combine 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water into a thin paste, or slurry, in a bowl, and slowly whisk into your simmering base. Continue to make and add slurry at the same 1-to-2 ratio as needed and add a little at a time until sauce starts to show gentle trails behind the whisk, much like a thin gravy. Once adequately thickened, add the crawfish tail meat to the sauce and simmer for another couple minutes to cook out the raw cornstarch flavor and heat the crawfish through. And now you have Pontchartrain sauce! At this point it can be refrigerated for up to 3 days before serving. To prepare for serving, add the Pontchartrain sauce to a saute pan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the raw shrimp to the sauce and simmer until the shrimp have become opaque and begun to curl, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Place a pile of rice on each of four plates, then top each with 4 cooked shrimp and spoon the Pontchartrain sauce over everything. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 31435,&quot;Magret of Duck with Fig and Shallot Compote 1 tablespoon olive oil 12 shallots, peeled 1 cup fruity red wine (Zinfandel, Merlot, Pinot Noir) 3/4 cup chicken stock 12 dried figs (Calimyrna or Smyrna), stems removed 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1 tablespoon sugar Pinch ground cloves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 duck breast halves with skin (about 1/2 pound each) Instructions: In a skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, 10 minutes. Add the wine, chicken stock, figs, lemon zest, sugar, and cloves. Decrease the heat to low and simmer until the figs are very soft but still retain their shape, about 30 to 45 minutes. Then increase the heat to high and simmer until the sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the duck breasts on a work surface, skin side up. Using a sharp knife, score the skin in a grid pattern, going through half the thickness of the skin but not through to the meat. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the duck breasts, skin side down, and cook until the skin is golden and the fat from the skin has rendered, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the duck breasts over, season with salt and pepper, and transfer the skillet to the oven. Cook until the duck breasts are medium-rare, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven, remove the duck, cover it with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. In the meantime, warm the fig sauce. Cut each duck breast on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan the slices out on each plate, spoon the warm sauce over the top, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 31436,&quot;Chocolate Chip Cookie Cupcakes 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/3 cup milk, at room temperature 2 tablespoons cocoa powder 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted 1/4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Pinch fine salt 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position the oven rack to the middle. Line two 24-cup mini-muffin tins with cupcake liners. For the cookie crust: Combine the flour, salt and baking soda in a small bowl and set aside. Beat the butter and both sugars together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until creamy, about 4 minutes (or in a large bowl if using an electric mixer). Add the egg and vanilla and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Adjust the speed to low, add the flour mixture and beat until incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips. Drop 1 heaping teaspoon of cookie dough into each liner and press down firmly. Bake until slightly puffed and golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool until warm to the touch, and then press down the crust once more. Cool completely. For the brown sugar cake: Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the eggs and light brown sugar together on medium-high speed until light and foamy, about 2 minutes (or in a large bowl if using a hand-held electric mixer). While beating, gradually pour in the butter and then the vanilla. While mixing slowly, add half the dry ingredients, then add all the milk, and follow with the rest of the dry ingredients. Take care not to overmix the batter. Drop 1 heaping teaspoon of batter on top of each cookie crust. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, rotating the tins about halfway through, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the cupcakes on a rack in the tins for 10 minutes, and then remove from the tins and cool on the rack completely. For the chocolate frosting: Combine the cocoa powder and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand-held electric mixer). Mix on low until combined. Add the vanilla and salt. Continue to mix on low speed and add the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk in alternating batches. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until fully incorporated and smooth. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a round or star tip and pipe small chocolate drops on top of each cupcake. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah]&quot; 31437,&quot;New Orleans Shrimp Pizza 1 (6.5-ounce) package pizza dough mix (recommended: Betty Crocker) 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning 1/2 cup hot water 1 cup chunky tomato sauce 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or more if needed 1 teaspoon crushed garlic 1 cup shredded mozzarella 1/3 cup frozen chopped green pepper, thawed (recommended: PictSweet) 1/3 cup frozen chopped onion, thawed (recommended: Ore-Ida) 1/2 pound pre-peeled medium shrimp Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Add thyme and bread crumbs, they will fry and begin to toast, but watch out because they will spit. Stir for a couple of minutes until the bread crumbs are really crisp. Season with a little salt and pepper, and lay on a kitchen towel, just to get rid of the excess oil (if any, and remove the garlic cloves). Place spaghetti into fast-boiling, salted water and, while cooking, add leftover oil and chopped garlic in a pan and heat gently. As the garlic begins to soften lay the anchovies over the top. After a few minutes you will see the anchovies begin to melt, then it is a nice idea to squeeze the juice of 1/2 to 1 lemon and sprinkle in dried chili. When your spaghetti is cooked until al dente, drain and toss into your pan with the anchovies. Make sure all the spaghetti is coated in sauce and then taste 1 piece of pasta, it might need a little more lemon juice and a little extra seasoning.

Heat a large (12-inch) saute pan over low heat and add 1/2 cup of the boiling water to the pan. Add both butters to the pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring slowly, until the sauce has emulsified. Meanwhile, add the Fettuccine to the boiling water and cook for approximately 1 to 2 minutes, until just tender. Using tongs, transfer the cooked pasta to the saute pan. (Do not drain the pasta water.) Add an additional 1/2 cup pasta cooking water, if required, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Continue to cook on low heat for 2 minutes, tossing to coat the pasta with sauce, until the sauce is well incorporated. Remove the pan from the heat and add the finely grated Parmesan in a slow steady stream while tossing the pasta. If needed, add more pasta water to loosen the sauce. Divide the pasta among four bowls, top each serving with the aged Parmigiano-Reggiano and more freshly ground pepper and serve. Place the 00 flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the egg yolks, a few at a time. Continue to mix until the dough is smooth. If it is a touch dry, add a few drops of water. The dough will be bright yellow. Turn the dough onto a smooth, lightly floured surface and knead by hand until it forms a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into three equal portions and flatten the first portion into an oval about 3/4-inch thick. Remove the dough hook attachment from the stand mixer and attach a pasta roller attachment (or use a manual pasta roller for the next step). Set the attachment to the widest setting and run the first portion of dough through the roller. Fold the dough in on itself in thirds, rolling to knead out any air bubbles, and feed it through the roller two more times on the same setting, folding the dough in on itself and rolling between each. Change the attachment to the next setting and repeat the process, working your way through each width setting twice until the pasta is almost transparent. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Remove the pasta roller attachment from the stand mixer and attach the fettuccine attachment. Cut each rolled-out pasta sheet into 12-inch pieces and feed the pieces, one at a time, through the machine. Sprinkle the cut fettuccine lightly with flour and place in bundles on a parchment-lined sheet pan that has been sprinkled with semolina flour. Set aside until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 31459,&quot;Rigatoni with Smoked Turkey and Hot Cherry Peppers 4 smoked Turkey Wing sections, about 4 pounds, recipe follows 1 (32-ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes 1/4 cup olive oil 1 large yellow onion, halved and sliced 1/4-inch-thick (about 2 cups)<br> 4 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced 2 bottled hot cherry peppers, cored, seeded and cut into thin strips Kosher salt 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1/2 cup dry red wine 1 cup homemade or canned reduced-sodium chicken broth 1 pound rigatoni 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil or flat-leaf parsley leaves Grated Parmesan or Pecorino-Romano, for garnish 1 1/2 tablespoons hickory or mesquite wood chips or 2 tablespoons alder or cherry wood chips, soaked 3 whole small turkey wings (about 1 1/4 pounds each) or 6 wing segments from smaller wings (about 4 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Smoke the turkey wings according to the directions below. This can be done up to two days in advance of making the sauce. Wrap the turkey wings in plastic wrap and store them in the refrigerator until needed.<br> Drain the tomatoes in a colander over a bowl. Locate the core on the tomatoes and gently pull out, taking as many seeds along with the cores as you can. Don&#39;t worry about any seeds you leave behind. Chop the tomatoes coarsely by hand or by squeezing them with your fingers right at the colander. Return the tomatoes to the liquid in the bowl.<br> Heat the olive oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic and cherry peppers. Season lightly with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are crisp-tender, about 8 minutes.<br> Stir in the tomato paste and cook, stirring once or twice, until the paste bubbles and takes on an orange tint, about 3 minutes. Pour in the wine, bring to a boil and cook for a minute or two.<br> Carefully pour the tomatoes, their liquid and the chicken broth into the pot, tuck the wings into the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering and cook, covered, until the turkey meat begins to fall from the bones, about 1 hour. Pluck the wings from the sauce and set them aside to cool. Remove the sauce from the heat.<br> When the wings are cool enough to handle, pull off the skin and remove the meat from the bones, shredding it coarsely as you go. Stir the meat into the sauce. Taste and season with salt if necessary. The sauce can be prepared in advance and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 months.<br> About half an hour before you&#39;re ready to serve the pasta, heat a large pot of salted water to a boil. Bring 4 cups of the sauce to a simmer. (Refrigerate or freeze any remaining sauce.) Stir the rigatoni into the water and continue stirring gently until the water returns to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente, about 10 minutes. Ladle off and reserve about a cup of the pasta cooking liquid and drain the pasta well. Return the pasta to the pot and place it under low heat. Stir in the reserved 4 cups of sauce and the basil. If the sauce doesn&#39;t flow smoothly over the pasta, stir in the reserved pasta cooking water as necessary.<br> Remove the pot from the heat, stir in a handful of grated cheese, and spoon the pasta onto a serving platter. Pass additional grated cheese at the table if you like. Prepare stovetop smoker with soaked wood chips according to manufacturers instructions. Trim any excess fat from the wings and cut the wings into individual segments if necessary: first cut off and discard the wing tips; we won&#39;t be smoking those since they have no meat. Next, cut the remaining part of the wing into two pieces at the joint. To make this easier, make a small cut near the joint and, with your hands, bend the wing until it is nearly straight. If you take a careful look at the joint, you will notice a space between the joint, that&#39;s where you want to cut. Once you do a few of these, you&#39;ll get the hang of where to cut.<br> Season each wing section with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a scant 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Rub the seasoning vigorously into the turkey.<br> Smoke until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the wing near the bone registers 170 degrees F. (To be sure, probe a few different pieces before deciding they&#39;re done.); about 45 minutes after closing the smoker lid. (Begin checking the wings for doneness with an instant-read thermometer after 35 minutes.)<br> If the turkey wings haven&#39;t reached the proper temperature after 45 minutes, heat the oven to 350 degrees F and bake the wings until done as described above.<br> Use smoked turkey wings to season your favorite bean soups, vegetable soups or baked bean dishes. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 31460,&quot;Taco Lasagna 1 teaspoon canola oil 1 pound ground beef sirloin 2 tablespoons chili powder<br> Kosher salt<br> Two 16-ounce jars salsa 1 pound no-boil lasagna noodles Two 16-ounce packages part skim mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 1/2 small head iceberg lettuce, shredded 1 large beefsteak tomato, diced 1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar<br> 1/2 cup crushed tortilla chips Instructions: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the ground beef and sprinkle with the chili powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, breaking apart chunks of meat with the back of a spoon, and stirring often, until meat is crumbled and browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the salsa and 1 cup of water, bring to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.<br> Spread a quarter of the meat sauce over the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Lay a third of the noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly and breaking them to fit, if needed. Leave a 1/2-inch space around the edges of the baking dish. Top the noodles with another quarter of the meat sauce and a third of the mozzarella. Make another layer with a third of the noodles, a quarter of the meat sauce and a third of the mozzarella. Repeat, making a final layer with the remaining third of the pasta and quarter of the sauce, making sure that the top layer of noodles is completely covered in sauce. Top with the remaining third of the mozzarella. Cover loosely with foil and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling and the noodles are tender when pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove the foil and cook 15 minutes more. Let rest 10 minutes.

Sprinkle the pork with freshly ground black pepper and seal in the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. When ready to cook, move the pork to the counter to bring it to room temperature. Preheat the grill for cooking over medium heat (350 to 400 degrees F). Cut the peaches in half crosswise around the pit (not through the stem) for easier release. Twist the halves in opposite directions to release the flesh from the pit. Twist the pit out of the peach, cutting tightly around the pit with a paring knife, if necessary. Drizzle the peaches cut-side up with the remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar. Drain off the marinade and sprinkle the pork with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Rub the grill grates lightly with oil and grill the pork until it has nice grill marks and releases easily from the grill, about 8 minutes. Turn the pork and cook another 5 minutes. Once more, turn to another side and cook an additional 5 minutes. Remove the pork and cover it loosely with foil. Allow to rest 5 to 10 minutes to let the juices redistribute. Meanwhile, place the peaches on the grill cut-sides down and cook until they have nice grill marks, release easily from the grill and are softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle the pork and peaches with basil and additional salt and pepper to taste. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 31478,&quot;Pink Lemonade Moscato Punch 4 ounces raspberries (about 64 raspberries) 2/3 cup sugar 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about 10 small lemons), plus 12 thin lemon rounds for garnish One 750-milliliter bottle pink sparkling Moscato, chilled<br> 6 large mint sprigs Instructions: Put 2 raspberries in each compartment of 2 standard 16-cube ice cube trays. Fill the trays three-quarters of the way with cold water. Freeze until solid, at least 6 hours and up to overnight. Meanwhile, combine the sugar and 2/3 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat then reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Let the simple syrup cool completely, transfer to a container and refrigerate. When ready to serve, whisk together the simple syrup and lemon juice in a large pitcher. Add the Moscato and stir to combine. Divide the ice cubes among 6 glasses and fill with the Moscato mixture.

If using regular broccoli, peel the stems with a vegetable peeler first so that they cook evenly, then cut the rest into large chunks. Pour about a 1-inch puddle of salted water into a large saute pan and bring to a boil. Add the broccoli and cover with a lid; let boil/steam for 2 minutes. Drain well and pat dry on paper towels, wringing out as much extra liquid as possible. Chop into small (roughly 1/2-inch) bits. Wipe the saute pan dry and heat over medium. Add the olive oil and let it heat for a full minute. Add the garlic and pepper flakes, cooking until the garlic is just beginning to turn golden, about 1 minute. Add the broccoli and cook 1 to 2 minutes more, seasoning with salt. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the lemon zest and juice, Pecorino and more salt and pepper flakes to taste. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the slices of bread on a baking sheet and lightly toast on both sides. Scoop the broccoli mixture onto each slice of bread, lay a slice of provolone over it and run under the broiler until the cheese has melted and begun to blister. Eat. Repeat.

(DO NOT leave the oven - keep an eye on the marshmallows - they toast very quickly). Remove the s&#39;mores from the oven and top with the chocolate covered grahams, chocolate side down. Press lightly to spread the chocolate to the edges. Let the s&#39;mores cool for 1 to 2 minutes before devouring. To make s&#39;mores the old fashioned way, and you have access to open flame, either a gas stove or fireplace, put 2 jumbo marshmallows on a metal skewer. Spread 1/2 teaspoon chocolate on each of 8 graham squares (this will be the bottom of the s&#39;more). Dollop a teaspoon of chocolate onto the center of the remaining 8 squares and reserve (these are the tops). Toast the marshmallows over an open flame until brown (or charred), as desired. While holding the skewer, put the toasted marshmallows onto the center of the bottom graham square. Invert a graham cracker top over the marshmallows and press lightly while you simultaneously pull the skewer from the marshmallows to create a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining marshmallows and serve while still warm. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 31522,&quot;Vegetable Pakoras 1 cup besan (Indian chickpea flour; see Cook&#39;s note) 2 tablespoons rice flour<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric<br> 1/4 teaspoon ajwain (carom) seeds, optional (cumin seeds can be substituted) 1/8 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice<br> Canola or peanut oil, for deep-frying 1 yellow onion, cut into rings<br> 2 cups curly kale, ribs removed, torn into 3-inch pieces<br> 2 cups 1-inch cauliflower florets Ground black lime, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: Whisk the besan, rice flour, salt, turmeric, ajwain seeds and baking soda together in a large bowl. Add the ginger, lemon juice and enough water (roughly 1/2 cup) to form a batter. (Consistency-wise, it should be slightly thinner than heavy cream.) Warm the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until it registers 375 degrees F on a thermometer. Set a cooling rack over a paper-towel lined baking sheet. Drop the onions, kale and cauliflower into the batter. Using tongs or your fingers, knock the excess batter off each piece before dropping into the hot oil. Fry in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry smaller, thinner vegetables like the onions and kale for 1 to 2 minutes. Fry the cauliflower for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pakoras from the hot oil using a spider. Set on the cooling rack, then quickly sprinkle with salt and the ground black lime. Eat hot! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 31523,&quot;Zuppa Maritata 1/4 cup minced green onions, with tops 1/2 cup minced mushrooms 1 tablespoon olive oil Dash of cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 6 cups brown chicken stock, made with extra oregano and garlic 1/4 pound vermicelli, broken 1 recipe Chicken Balls, cooked, recipe follows, or 1 1/2 cups diced cooked chicken 3 eggs, beaten 1 cup half-and-half 6 tablespoons freshly grated Romano, plus extra for garnish Salt, black pepper and minced fresh oregano Dash paprika Minced fresh Italian parsley leaves 1 1/2 cups ground white-meat chicken 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh parsley leaves 1 egg, beaten 1/2 cup fine bread crumbs 1 tablespoon freshly grated Romano 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper Instructions: Saute the green onions and mushrooms in the oil until soft, sprinkle with the cayenne pepper, salt, oregano, and lemon juice while cooking. Add the stock, bring to a boil and stir in the vermicelli. Cook for 7 minutes after the soup comes back to a boil. Reheat with Chicken Balls or diced chicken. Beat together the eggs and half-and-half, whisk in 1/2 cup hot soup and return to the rest of the soup. Heat, but do not boil. Add the Romano and adjust seasonings, to taste, with salt, pepper and oregano. Sprinkle with paprika and Italian parsley and pass extra Romano at the table. Mix together all ingredients, form into balls the size of large marbles, and refrigerate several hours. Cook in simmering salted water or broth to cover for 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 31524,&quot;Cheesy Barley Gratin 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the baking dish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups pearled barley 6 ounces Gruyere, shredded (about 2 cups) 2 cups shredded mozzarella 1 cup grated Parmesan 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs 1 large yellow onion, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces (about 2 cups) 2 large cloves garlic, finely minced 1 1/2 teaspoons finely-chopped fresh thyme 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 cups whole milk Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease a 3-quart baking dish with butter and set aside. Fill a small pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the barley and boil until just cooked through but still slightly chewy, about 20 minutes (it will continue to cook in the oven). Drain and rinse. Meanwhile, put 2 tablespoons of butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Combine the Gruyere, mozzarella and parmesan in another medium bowl. Add the panko, 1 cup of the cheese mixture and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the bowl with the melted butter. Use your hands to work the butter into the cheese and breadcrumbs. Set aside. Melt the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter in a wide large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. (The butter will start to foam and brown specks will form, but that is okay; this will add a lot of flavor to the finished dish.) Reduce the heat to medium, add the garlic and thyme and stir constantly until the garlic is just softened, about 1 minute. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until a thin paste forms around the onion mixture, about 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce to a simmer, stirring occasionally until the sauce is a thin gravy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the shredded cheese mixture and cooked barley. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper. Spoon into the greased baking dish. Sprinkle the reserved cheesy breadcrumbs evenly on top of the barley and bake until bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 31525,&quot;Potato Nests with Peas, Ham and Cream Cheese Nonstick cooking spray 2 thick slices deli ham (about 4 ounces total)<br> 16 ounces (about 3 1/2 cups) frozen shredded hash browns, thawed (about half of a 30-ounce bag) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature Finely grated zest of one lemon 2 tablespoons milk 1/4 cup frozen peas<br> 2 tablespoon chopped chives (1/2-inch pieces) Paprika, for serving Instructions: Position two racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup and a 24-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray and set aside. Cut the ham into small matchsticks similar in size to the hash browns. Set aside and reserve 1/3 cup of the ham. Mix the remaining ham, hash browns, 1 teaspoon salt and some pepper in a large bowl. Divide the mixture evenly among the sprayed cups, using about 1 rounded tablespoon each. Press the mixture in a thin layer across the bottom and up the sides of each cup to make a nest, leaving the edges uneven and jagged.<br> Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the nests are dark brown around the tips and golden and crisp on the outside, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese, lemon zest, milk 1/2 teaspoon salt, and some pepper together in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed. Scrape the mixture into a resealable plastic bag, cut off the tip and set aside. When the nests are ready, remove them from the oven and let sit until they are cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Carefully lift the nests out of the tins using a small offset spatula or butter knife and transfer to a cookie sheet. Pipe the filling evenly among the nests. This may be done ahead; the nests can be set aside at room temperature until ready to serve, up to two hours.<br> When ready to serve, heat the filled nests until the cream cheese is warm and the potatoes are crisp, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the frozen peas and cook until they are warm but not shriveled, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain the peas in a colander, shaking to remove excess water.<br> Transfer the nests to a serving platter. Top each with 1/4 teaspoon of the reserved ham, 3 peas and about 1/4 teaspoon chopped chives. Sprinkle with paprika and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 31526,&quot;Homemade Salsa and Tortilla Chips 1 pound tomatoes, diced 1 red onion, finely diced 1 jalapeno, finely diced and seeded 1 clove garlic, smashed 1 lime, juiced 3 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper Peanut oil, for frying 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder 8 to 12 corn tortillas Instructions: Add all salsa ingredients to a bowl and toss.

Spray two 18-by-13-inch half-sheet pans with baking spray and line with parchment. Coat with baking spray and dust with flour, knocking out any extra. Whip the egg yolks with 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until thick ribbons form, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and rinse and dry the bowl. Add the egg whites and salt and whip on medium high speed until foamy, about 1 minute. With the machine still going slowly add the sugar and beat until glossy stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Using a large spatula fold the egg whites in to the yolks until well combined. Add a quarter of the flour and fold it until combined. Repeat 3 more times until all the flour is added.<br> Divide the batter evenly between the 2 prepared pans. Bake until lightly springy when touched, about 12 minutes. Dust 2 clean large kitchen towels with the confectioners&#39; sugar and flip the cakes out onto the towels with the short sides facing you. Working with 1 cake at a time, remove the parchment and roll up each cake starting from the short end. Set aside to cool. For the frosting: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold the heatproof bowl of a stand mixer above the water. Add the granulated sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites to the stand mixer bowl and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes. Continue to beat, tossing in the butter a couple of chunks at a time, making sure the pieces are incorporated before adding more. After all the butter is incorporated continue whisking on medium-high speed. The mixture will deflate and appear curdled. Continue whisking until the buttercream comes back together with a smooth and spreadable consistency, about 5 minutes. Slowly drizzle in the vanilla while beating until smooth and light, about 5 minutes more. (If the frosting is very soft or begins to break, refrigerate until set but still spreadable and then beat until light before using.) Transfer 3/4 cup of the frosting to six small bowls. Color them red, orange,, yellow, green, blue and purple and transfer them to piping bags and set aside. Cover the remaining white frosting and set aside.<br> To assemble: Unroll the cooled cake layers so they lay flat. Transfer the cakes to a cutting board using a serrated knife to divide each cake in half lengthwise, creating 2 long strips of cake (4 total). Starting ?-inch from the top of each piece of cake pipe an even line of red frosting lengthwise on each piece. Repeat with the remaining colors.<br> Take one strip of frosted cake and roll it into a tight jelly roll. Add another strip of cake, matching the ends and coiling it around the center roll as you would a cinnamon roll; repeat with the remaining cake strips, trimming the ends to fit as necessary. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.<br> Trim the ends of the cake so they are flat and transfer to a cake board or platter, standing the cake up on one end and securing it to the surface with a dollop of the reserved white frosting.<br> Spread a thin layer of the white frosting over the top and sides of the cake for a crumb coat. Chill the cake in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set the coat.<br> Frost the cake with the remaining white frosting, using an offset spatula to create swirls if desired. Decorate the top edge of the cake with sprinkles as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31532,&quot;Grilled Clambake 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil 1/3 cup chopped fresh dill 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives 1 cup mayonnaise 1 serrano cl pepper, finely chopped (seeded for less heat) 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving 6 cloves garlic (2 finely grated, 4 thinly sliced) Kosher salt 24 jumbo shrimp, shells on (about 2 1/4 pounds) 1 tablespoon sugar 24 littleneck clams, scrubbed 3 pounds fingerling potatoes 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground pepper 2 pounds lingui?a sausage or kielbasa 4 ears corn, shucked 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 1/2 small fennel bulb, cored and thinly sliced 2 large shallots, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 cup dry white wine Instructions: Toss the basil, dill and chives in a small bowl.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Fit a baking sheet with a wire rack. Pat the turkey breasts dry and season heavily with salt and pepper all over. Put the olive oil in a large skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Sear the breasts skin-side down until light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip the breasts over and add the garlic, thyme, rosemary and 4 tablespoons of the butter to the skillet. Once the butter has melted, use a spoon to baste the turkey breasts with the herb and garlic infused butter for 30 seconds. Transfer the breasts to the rack on the baking sheet, pour the butter and herb mixture over the breasts and cook, basting every 15 minutes, until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the breast reaches 160 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Dip them briefly in boiling water to loosen the skins. Peel, cut in half, remove and discard the seeds. Dice the tomatoes and have ready beside the stove. Bring the water to a boil in a large pot and season with salt while you prepare the sauce. The pasta will cook in 10 minutes and the sauce will take 15 minutes to cook entirely. Drain the anchovy fillets, rinse off the excess salt under cold water, pat dry, and chop roughly. Heat the olive oil in a sauce pan over medium heat. When hot, add the chopped anchovy fillets and saute over medium heat until the anchovies actually begin to dissolve and melt away. Add the rings of sausage and saute briefly before adding the clams in their shells. Add the garlic to the pan and before the garlic begins to brown, add the diced tomato, salt and pepper and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, before adding the white wine. Place a lid on the pan and cook until the clams steam open. When the water is boiling, cook the pasta according to package directions, timing it so the pasta will be completed at about the same time as the sauce. Just before you drain the pasta, add the basil to the sauce and continue cooking for just a minute longer. Remove the sauce from the heat and toss in a bowl with the drained pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 31569,&quot;Mac &amp; Cheese with Red Peppers &amp; Tomatoes 1 pound ziti or penne pasta 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 clove garlic, crushed 21/2 cups fresh bread crumbs, preferably from sourdough bread 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme 6 ounces shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese (about 2 cups) 4 ounces shredded fontina cheese (about 11/3 cups) 3 ounces shredded smoked Gouda cheese (about 1 cup) 1 recipe hot Bechamel Sauce, recipe follows 10 sun dried tomatoes, 1 jarred roasted red pepper, seeded and diced 1 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 cups milk 1 sprig fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 sprig fresh thyme 1/2 bay leaf 1/2 onion studded with 1 clove Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch freshly grated nutmeg Instructions: 1.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.<br> 2.

Add cold water, by the quart, to cover the chicken by about 1 inch. Add 1 tablespoon of salt to each quart of water. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. When you&#39;re ready to cook, mix the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika, and cayenne in a large, shallow platter until well blended; season generously with salt and pepper. Stir together the buttermilk and hot sauce in another large, deep platter or wide, shallow bowl; season with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture. Dip them into the buttermilk and then roll them in the seasoned flour again to make a good crust. Put the chicken pieces on a piece of parchment or waxed paper, or on a clean platter, while you heat the oil. Pour about 3 inches of oil into a large deep pot; the oil should not come more than half way up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces.

Add the onions, mushrooms, celery and garlic and saute until tender. Add the flour and form a roux, stirring to incorporate the butter and flour. Slowly add the vegetable stock and stir until smooth. Continue to cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. If the sauce looks too thick you can add more stock or water to thin it down. Add all the blanched vegetables to the sauce along with the fresh herbs. Cook for 5 minutes, gently stirring, over medium heat. Add the mascarpone and heavy cream and allow to reduce for another 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper. While the sauce is simmering, add the canola oil to a large skillet, over medium heat, until smoking. Slice the bread into triangles and shallow-fry on both sides until golden brown. Remove from the oil, drain on paper towels and set aside. To serve, place a ladle of vegetable stew into each large soup bowl and garnish with fried toast points. Cook&#39;s Note: Blanching vegetable is a great way to speed up the cooking process of any dish and is very simple to do. Simply cook vegetables in boiling salted water until vegetables are still firm but cooked, then remove from boiling water and place into a bowl of iced water to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 31575,&quot;Jelly Doughnuts with Strawberry-Rhubarb Jam Nonstick cooking spray 3/4 cup bread flour, plus additional for dusting work surface and sprinkling batter 1 tablespoon fresh yeast, or 1 (1/4-ounce) package active dry yeast 3/4 cup whole milk 2 3/4 cups pastry flour 1 vanilla bean, cut in half lengthwise 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, cubed 6 eggs 1/2 cup sugar, plus more for tossing doughnuts 1/4 teaspoon salt Oil, for deep-frying Strawberry-Rhubarb Jam, recipe follows 1 cup sugar 1 vanilla bean, cut lengthwise, seeds reserved 2 cups diced rhubarb, cut into 1-inch pieces, about 4 stalks 1/4 cup red wine 4 pints small to medium strawberries, hulled and diced Instructions: Line 2 or 3 baking sheets with parchment paper and then spray with nonstick spray. Dust lightly with bread flour.<br> Crumble the fresh yeast into the bowl of an electric mixer, or sprinkle in the dry yeast. In a small saucepan, warm the milk until it is no longer chilled and is just barely lukewarm, about 105 degrees F. Pour the milk over the yeast and whisk to dissolve. Add 1 1/2 cups of the pastry flour to the milk and whisk 2 or 3 times to just barely incorporate. Sprinkle the rest of the pastry flour over the mixture to cover the top. Do not mix this any further. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap so that it is airtight, and place in a slightly warm place until the top layer of flour has cracked noticeably, about 4 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, remove the vanilla bean seeds by scraping the length of the bean with the back of a knife. Place the seeds in a saucepan with the butter and melt together over low heat. Set aside.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar and salt. Add the vanilla-butter mixture and quickly whisk into the eggs. Pour the egg-butter mixture into the mixing bowl with the flour. Mix on low speed for a few seconds to incorporate the flour, and then increase the speed to medium and mix for 1 minute. Add the 3/4 cup of bread flour and mix on low for a few seconds, then on medium for 2 minutes. The batter will be lumpy and quite sticky. Transfer to a large greased bowl and cover completely with plastic wrap so it is airtight. Return the bowl to the warm spot and let rise until it doubles in size, about 2 hours.<br> Once it has risen, sprinkle 1/4 cup of bread flour over the surface. With your hands, gently tuck the sides of the dough under itself to deflate it. Cover the bowl again and let the dough rise until it has doubled in size again, about 45 minutes.<br> You will need a significant amount of bread flour to coat your work surface. Choose a surface that is cool to the touch. Sprinkle a thin blanket of flour over it, and using a pastry scraper, pour 1/3 of the dough over the flour. Then sprinkle the surface of the batter with more bread flour. With the palm of your hand, gently press the dough down to about 1/2-inch thick. Dip the end of a 1 1/2-inch round cutter in flour and begin to cut the doughnuts out. Rather than picking them up with your fingers, use the cutter to push the doughnut off the end of the counter and on to the palm of your hand. Or try using a small spatula dipped in flour to lift the doughnut off the counter, being careful to keep the round shape. Then gently place the doughnuts on the floured baking sheets. Repeat until you have cut all the doughnuts. Wrap the baking sheets with plastic and refrigerate the doughnuts as you work. (Bring to room temperature before frying).<br> To fry, add enough oil to come halfway up the sides of a large saucepan and heat to 350 degrees F.<br> Carefully drop the doughnuts into the oil, about 6 at a time, making sure you do not overfill the pot. Fry the doughnuts until they are golden on both sides, about 3 minutes total. Drain on paper towels, and then toss into a bowl of sugar to coat. Fill doughnuts with Strawberry-Rhubarb Jam, if desired. Place the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add enough water to moisten all of the sugar (about 1/4 cup). Be sure to brush down the sides of the pot with a pastry brush to remove any stray sugar granules. Cook the sugar over high heat until it caramelizes and turns golden, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the rhubarb and the wine. Cook, stirring, over high heat, until the rhubarb softens and becomes a pulp; be careful; the mixture will splatter.<br> Add 1/3 of the strawberries to the pot and stir quickly into the rhubarb pulp, working over high heat. Cook until the berries turn into jam and the liquid has mostly evaporated from the pot, about 8 minutes. Add another 1/3 of the berries and quickly stir until just softened. Add the last batch of berries, turn off the heat, and stir gently. Allow the jam to sit undisturbed about 10 minutes. If using to fill the doughnuts, refrigerate the jam so it sets up and filling is easier. Keep refrigerated. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 31576,&quot;Tomato Martini Ice cubes 1 1/2 ounces gin 1 teaspoon dry white vermouth 3 ounces Tomato Water, recipe follows 2 tablespoons tomato based vegetable juice (recommended: V-8) 1/2 lemon, plus a twist for garnish Couple drops Pernod, optional Salt and freshly ground black pepper Hot sauce Garnish: Olive, cherry tomato, and cocktail onion on a swizzle stick or toothpick Instructions: Fill a cocktail shaker or small pitcher with ice cubes. Add the gin, vermouth, tomato water, vegetable juice, and a healthy squeeze of lemon juice. Add a couple drops of Pernod if desired--it adds a nice background flavor, but more than 1 or 2 drops will overpower the drink. Season with salt, pepper, and a dash of hot sauce.

Place a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Paint the eggplant slices with extra virgin olive oil. Or pour extra virgin on a plate and dip the eggplant into the oil, scraping off excess with a spatula. Brown the eggplant slices in one layer in a hot skillet, 3 or 4 minutes per side, and transfer to a plate as they are done. Blend the tomatoes, basil, and garlic in a food processor until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Cut the mozzarella into 4 slices and divide each slice in four. Place 8 slices of eggplant on a nonstick baking pan and top each slice with 1 teaspoon tomato puree, spread in a thin layer. Place a piece of mozzarella in the center. Cover the mozzarella with another eggplant slice, teaspoon tomato sauce, and another piece of mozzarella. Cover with a third eggplant slice and top with remaining tomato sauce.

(This will allow it to heat more evenly and not dry out.) Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Place the ham in a shallow roasting pan fitted with a rack. Using a paring knife, score the fatty side of the ham by gently slicing lines 1/2-inch apart, crisscrossing on an angle to create a diamond pattern. This will allow the glaze to soak into the ham. Add the chicken stock to the bottom of the pan, then cover the pan in foil. Cook for 40 minutes, basting every 10 to 15 minutes. To make the glaze, warm the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the ginger and cl flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar, honey, lime juice and Dijon mustard. Bring to a simmer, then cook until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Set aside the glaze in a bowl, leaving about 1/4 cup behind in the pan for finishing. Remove the ham from the oven and raise the oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the foil from the ham and discard the drippings from the pan. Brush the ham liberally with half of the glaze. Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes, then brush again. Bake again until dark and caramelized, another 15 minutes. Remove the ham to a rimmed platter. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup glaze to a simmer over medium-low heat. If using the bourbon, remove the glaze from heat and add the bourbon. Using a lighter, flambe the alcohol in the pan and very carefully pour over the ham. (The alcohol can be omitted and you can just put the warm glaze over the ham.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31596,&quot;Oven Fried Chicken 6 tablespoons butter 2 chickens, cut into 8 pieces each 1 1/2 cups flour 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons garlic salt 2 teaspoons oregano 2 eggs 1/2 cup dried bread crumbs Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cut a piece of foil 8 by 16-inches. Butter the corners and sides of an 8-by-8-inch baking pan. Line the pan with the foil, leaving an overhang on two sides. Beat the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium and add the egg yolk, syrup, vanilla extract and vanilla bean seeds if using. Reduce the speed to low, add the flours and salt, all at once, and beat until just combined. Add the walnuts and continue to mix until fully combined. Using your hands, drop the dough in pieces evenly into the prepared pan. Flour your hands lightly and press the dough together and into the corners of the pan. Put a piece of waxed paper on top of the dough and use something square and heavy-another pan, a pound of cold butter-to press the dough into the pan and make a smooth, even top. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes. When it is firm, use a fork to score the dough all over. Bake until deep golden brown and starting to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 45 minutes. Cool completely on a rack, about 2 hours, then wrap with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature overnight. Place a lightweight cutting board or a baking rack over the top of the pan. Flip and set on the counter. Gently pull the pan from the foil and the foil from the pan to lift off the pan. Gently peel the foil off the bar. Place another lightweight cutting board on top, and flip the bar right-side-up. Using a sharp, serrated knife, slice the square in half.

Remove the fruit from the peel, leaving the white membrane or pith attached to the peel. Save the fruit for another use. Slice each quarter peel on a diagonal into strips about 1/2-inch wide. If you cut them evenly, they will look nicer when displayed. Place the sliced grapefruit peels in a nonreactive 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and add enough water to cover the peels by about 1-inch. Place over high heat and bring to a rolling boil. Remove from the heat and strain. Return only the peels to the saucepan, cover again with fresh water, and repeat the boiling and draining process three more times. It is really important to change the water because it retains the bitterness of the peel. After the fourth boil, drain the water as before and return the peels to the saucepan. Add the sugar and enough water to cover the peels by 1-inch. Place over low heat and let simmer for 2 hours. During this time, the sugar will sweeten and preserve the natural flavor of the peels. After 2 hours, they will be soft and translucent and the syrup will be thick. Let the peels cool in the syrup and keep them stored in the syrup, refrigerated, in an airtight container until you are ready to serve. They will keep this way for up to three weeks. When ready to use, allow the peels to drain on a wire rack for a few hours to remove the excess syrup. Put the rack over a baking sheet so the syrup does not drip all over the work surface. Once fully drained, you have three options for serving: First, you can serve them as they are. Second, you can place the peels in a medium-sized bowl filled with granulated sugar. Roll the peels around in the sugar until they are well coated. Third, you can dip the sugared peels into the bittersweet chocolate. Dip two thirds of each sugared peel into the bittersweet chocolate. Gently wipe the excess chocolate from the end of each peel before placing on parchment paper. The chocolate should set in a few minutes if it is tempered and the kitchen is not too hot. Whatever variation you choose, present the peels on a plate or in a small bowl or in petits fours cups. Once the peels have been sugared and dipped in chocolate, they can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to three days. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 31619,&quot;Guava Bread Pudding 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) butter 1 loaf brioche bread, cut into cubes 1 cup brown sugar<br> 1 cup white sugar<br> 1 tablespoon ground allspice<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon ground nutmeg<br> 2 cups milk<br> 5 large eggs<br> 1/4 cup golden raisins<br> 1/2 cup guava paste<br> 1 cup marshmallows 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: For the guava bread pudding: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Instructions: Combine the flour, Parmesan, mascarpone, salt, cayenne and butter in the bowl of a food processor and pulse, pulse, pulse, until it looks very dry and crumbly--what I like to call the Parmesan stage. Add the eggs and pulse until the mixture forms a ball. Remove the dough from the food processor, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Coat a large saute pan generously with olive oil. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and bring the pan to a medium heat. When the garlic has become golden brown and is very aromatic remove it and discard, it has fulfilled its garlic destiny. Add the Swiss chard stems, leeks and 2 to 3 tablespoons of water and season with salt. When the water has evaporated and the stems and leeks are soft, add the leaves. Season the leaves with salt and saute until they are very soft and wilted. Remove from the heat and allow the Swiss chard to cool. In a large bowl combine the ricotta, Parmesan, eggs, cayenne and the Swiss chard mixture. Mix to thoroughly combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed (it will). Set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let warm up for about 10 to 15 minutes, this will make it really much easier to roll out. Dust a large clean work surface with flour and roll the dough into a large circle about 1/4 to 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a large sheet try lined with parchment paper. Lay the dough out flat, don&#39;t worry about the overhang on the sides. Put the filling in a large circle in the center of the rolled out dough leaving a 3 to 4-inch border of dough along the outside edge. Fold the dough up around the filling to make a \free-form pie. Brush the top of the dough with egg wash and bake in the preheated oven until the crust is firm, golden brown and shiny, about 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing, this will allow it to up for easier slicing. Serve hot or at room temperature. What a delightful lunch!!! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 31626,&quot;Pork Steamed Buns 1 (1/2 to 1-pound) rack spareribs 3/4 cup hoisin sauce 1 cup shredded cabbage 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced 1 package active dry yeast 1/2 warm water 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading 1 1/2 cups cake flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 cup warm milk 1 tablespoon canola oil, plus more as needed Instructions: For the filling: Put the rack of spareribs into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in the hoisin sauce, close the bag and toss gently to coat. Put the bag into a bowl and marinate the ribs in the refrigerator for 3 hours or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Put the ribs into a sheet pan along with all the marinade. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, slide it into the oven and bake until the meat easily separates from the bone, about 2 hours. Baste them every 30 minutes during the cooking process. Remove the ribs from the oven and let them rest. When cool enough to handle, pull the rib meat from the bones and coarsely chop. Then, in a large bowl, toss the pork together with the cabbage and scallions. If the mixture seems too dry, add in a bit more hoisin sauce. For the dough: Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl. After a few minutes, the yeast will begin to foam and bubble. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and baking powder. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the warm milk, canola oil, and the activated yeast. Work the dough to produce a shaggy mass. Turn it out onto a floured board or countertop and knead until the dough becomes smooth, soft, and pliable, about 5 to 10 minutes. Put it into a lightly oiled bowl and turn it over once to coat. Cover the bowl in plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise undisturbed for 40 minutes to 1 hour. The mass should double in volume. For the assembly: To form the buns, remove the dough from the bowl and roll it into 1 long rope. Cut the rope into 12 equal portions. Roll each piece and set them aside in a bowl. Using a rolling pin, flatten each ball into 4-inch circles, leaving the center slightly thicker then its edges. Put a heaping tablespoon of the filling into the center of each disk and pinch the tops closed to seal. Arrange the buns on a parchment lined sheet tray and cover them with a clean kitchen towel. Alternatively, place the buns into a large 3-level bamboo steamer lined with parchment paper, 4 buns per level. Allow the buns to rest for 10 minutes. In the meantime, fill a bamboo or stainless steel steamer with water and bring it to a boil. Cut 12 (4-inch) rounds from some parchment paper. When ready to cook, place the buns on the parchment rounds and into the steamer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31627,&quot;Curtis Provencal Dressing 5 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons cider vinegar measured 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 3 teaspoons chervil Instructions: Mix mustard and cider vinegar, drizzle in oil and whisk until thickened, add chopped chervil and season with salt and pepper. TIP: CHOPPED SALAD IN ENDIVE LEAVES Finely chop your favorite salad fixings such as peppers, cucumbers, onion, blue cheese and mix with your favorite vinaigrette. Separate endive leaves to equal lengths and fill for hors douevres, right before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 31628,&quot;Coriander-Crusted Halibut with Rice Noodles and Ginger Broth 1/4 cup freshly ground coriander Fleur de sel, to season 4 (6-ounce) pieces halibut fillet Canola oil, to cook 1 1/2 tablespoons minced ginger 2 leeks, white part julienned 1 tablespoon fish sauce 6 cups chicken stock 2 limes, juiced 1 tablespoon minced cilantro leaves, save 4 whole sprigs for garnish 1 package (8-ounce) thin rice noodles, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes until soft Instructions: For the Coriander Crusted Halibut With Rice Noodles And Ginger Broth: Preheat an oven to 450 degrees. Place the coriander on a small plate. Season the halibut on both sides with salt and dredge the top only with the coriander. In a hot saute pan coated with oil, sear the top first until brown and fragrant. Flip and place pan in oven for 8 to10 minutes or until the fish in flaky and hot in the middle. Concurrently, in a hot saucepan, coat lightly with oil and saute the ginger and leeks until soft, about 4 minutes. Deglaze with fish sauce and add stock. Bring to a simmer and reduce by 20 percent. Check for seasoning then add lime juice and cilantro. Right before serving, add the soft rice noodles. Bring to temperature then serve. PLATING In large, warm pasta bowls, ladle the broth, leeks and noodles. Make a small pile in the middle with the mixture and top with halibut. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.

Add butter and pecans. Stir continuously and continue cooking until nuts begin to brown or start popping (290 degrees). Remove from heat. Add vanilla and soda and stir thoroughly. Pour quickly in several pieces on large buttered surface. Do not spread with knife or spoon. Allow to cool slightly. Stretch and pull with hands until very thin. (The thinner it is stretched, the more brittle it will be.) When cooled and hardened, break into small pieces. Store in airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 31630,&quot;Entremet Giftbox 1 recipe White Chocolate Mousse, recipe follows 1 recipe Old School Sugar Cookies, recipe follows 1 recipe Glaze, recipe follows Gold petals, for decorating<br> Cornstarch, for dusting 1 pound gum paste Royal Icing, recipe follows Dragees, for decorating<br> 8 ounces chopped white chocolate 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch kosher salt1 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 7 extra-large eggs, separated 5 drops lemon juice 6 sticks (3 cups) butter, softened 2 cups sugar 1 tablespoon lemon zest 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 teaspoons baking powder 4 extra-large eggs plus 1 egg yolk 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring 2 cups cake flour 7 teaspoons unflavored gelatin 3 cups granulated sugar 1 3/4 cups chopped white couverture chocolate 2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk Red gel food coloring<br> 4 cups powdered sugar (approximately) 3 extra-large pasteurized egg whites 1 teaspoon lemon juice -or- 3 tablespoons meringue powder 5 to 7 tablespoons water -or-<br> 4 cups royal icing powder (CK products is my favorite) 1/2 cup water Instructions: Fill each dome mold cavity to 1/4-inch from the top with White Chocolate Mousse, then place an Old School Sugar Cookie on top of each, pressing lightly to make it level. Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours, and unmold onto a wire cooling rack set on a sheet pan. Pour the Glaze over the domes to make an even coating on each. Top each dome with a gold petal. (Makes 12 entremets; reserve remaining for another use.) Line a sheet pan with acetate, dust evenly with cornstarch and set aside.<br> Lightly dust your workspace with cornstarch and roll out the gum paste to 1/8-inch thick. Using the 4-inch square stencil, cut 1 square. Place the 3 1/2-inch square stencil in the center of the 4-inch square, then score the gum paste around the stencil; cut all the way through to prevent pulling and warping the shape of the frame. Repeat 7 more times. Transfer the frames to the lined sheet pan and allow to dry 8 hours or up to overnight.<br> Fill a cornet with about 1/3 cup Royal Icing, snip the tip (about 7 millimeters) and begin piping your design in each frame, connecting the lines to the edges of the frame. Set aside to dry completely, about 2 hours.<br> Once dry, carefully brush any excess cornstarch off the frame and balance the frames on little cups or vessels of the same height so that the frame is suspended flat. Fill another cornet with another 1/3 cup Royal Icing, snip the tip (about 4 millimeters) and begin to pipe thin lines, starting at the edge of the frame, allowing gravity to let them drape down a bit. Connect again at the thicker dried Royal Icing and connect finally at the opposite edge of the frame. Continue with all frames and allow to dry completely, 1 to 2 hours.<br> Once all are dry, begin building the box. Set the entremet in the center of a dessert plate. Fill a cornet with Royal Icing and cut a 7-millimeter hole at the tip. Pipe a line of Royal Icing along the bottom edge of 2 frames. Set them around the entremet at a 90-degree angle and seal the seam where they are joined with more Royal Icing. Repeat with another 2 frames to build the walls surrounding the entremet. Pipe along the edges of one more frame piece and balance on the top of the walls to make a complete box. Pipe the seams and decorate with dragees. Allow to dry completely, about 2 hours, then serve. Put the chocolate, butter, vanilla and salt in the top of a double boiler (or heat-proof bowl over simmering water). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cream with 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar until thick but still smooth. Scrape it into a bowl, put it in the fridge, then clean the stand mixer bowl and whisk really well. In the cleaned stand mixer bowl using the clean whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar until you have a fluffy meringue, 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside at room temperature.<br> Without cleaning the bowl, whip the egg yolks and remaining tablespoon sugar until light and fluffy. (This will take a few minutes, so go stir your chocolate. If it is melted, pull it off the heat and set it aside.) When the yolks are light, creamy yellow and fluffy and the chocolate is slightly warmer than room temperature, fold them together. Next, fold in the meringue, and finally, fold in the whipped cream.<br> In a big bowl, combine the butter, sugar, lemon zest, salt and vanilla and mix until smooth and fluffy. Stir in the baking powder, taking care to mix well. Add the eggs and egg yolk and stir well. Add the flours and gently stir until a smooth ball forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and put in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet (or sheets) with parchment paper (no cooking spray). On a floured surface, roll out tennis ball-size pieces of dough to about 1/4 inch thick and cut out the shapes you want, for the entremets use a 3 inch round cutter. Lay them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 1/4 inch between each cookie. Bake for 8 minutes, or until lightly golden. Let the cookies cool on a wire rack.

Whisk together the gelatin and 1/3 cup water and set aside to bloom. Combine the sugar and 1 cup water in a small pot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and whisk in the gelatin to dissolve. Pour over the chocolate, then allow to sit a minute. Add the condensed milk and emulsify with a hand blender. Color to the desired shade of red with red gel. Cool to 86 degrees F before pouring over the Entremet.<br> Using a stand mixer and the whisk attachment, whip most of the powdered sugar with most of the other ingredients. Whip for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the royal icing holds its shape and is bright white (not translucent). If it is too soft, add more powdered sugar. If it is too stiff, add a bit more liquid, drop by drop. If you are using only one color, add a few drops of the color at this point and keep whipping until you have the shade you want; otherwise, proceed to the next step. To store royal icing, the ideal way is to scrape it out of the bowl and into a plastic, disposable piping bag, then leave it at room temperature. Don&#39;t cut the bag until you&#39;re ready to use the royal icing, and don&#39;t overfill the bag?you want enough room to tie the back of the bag off to keep the royal icing airtight. If any air comes into contact with the royal icing, it gets hard and that part of the icing is useless. Never attempt to mix the hard bits back into the royal icing?you&#39;ll ruin the whole batch. The other accepted method of storing royal icing is to scrape it into a plastic or ceramic bowl, and cover it with a wet paper towel. This method works, but it wastes both paper towels and royal icing. It&#39;s also just annoying. When you&#39;re piping small designs, you want to use very small parchment piping bags. It&#39;s easy to stick the nose of a large piping bag into a smaller one and extract exactly how much you&#39;ll need. When the icing is in a bowl, you have to use a spoon to get it out. The spoon is difficult to get into a piping bag, and you&#39;ll keep using spoons and wasting royal icing. Get with the times people. Do it right and don&#39;t waste food.

Add the trout, making sure they are submerged. Cover the container and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.<br> Remove the trout from the brine, rinse thoroughly with cold water and pat dry. Place the trout skin-side down on a rack set in a half baking sheet. Place the rack in the refrigerator for drying, 21 to 24 hours or until the trout skin becomes shiny and somewhat tacky to the touch.<br> Prepare the smoker using pecan or apple wood chips so that it maintains a temperature of 190 degrees F. Place the trout onto the smoking racks, skin-side down, separating them by at least 1/4-inch. Place the smoking racks in the smoker. Adjust the heat as needed and cook until the trout is cooked through, has darkened in color and has the desired level of smoke flavor, about 20 minutes. Remove the flesh from the bones of the trout and flake the trout into medium pieces.<br> For the Meyer lemon dressing: Whisk the lemon juice, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, honey, zest and sprinkle with salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified.<br> For the assembly: Place several pieces of the trout into individual lettuce leaves, drizzle with some of the Meyer lemon dressing and top with the carrots and parsley.

Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the sage, garlic and jalapenos and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the squash, vinegar, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and stir to combine. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash begins to soften, 6 to 8 minutes. Uncover and add the red pepper and half of the parsley. Cook until the squash is completely soft and lightly brown, 6 to 8 minutes more. Remove from the heat.<br> Make 8 small indentations in the squash with a measuring cup or the back of a ladle. Crack the eggs into the indentations and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Return the pan to medium heat, cover and cook until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 4 minutes.<br> Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 31635,&quot;Budino di Lorenzo di Magnifico 1 large panettone, about 2 pounds 1/4 cup water 1 1/2 cups sugar 3 cups whole milk Zest of 1/2 lemon 4 extra large eggs 1 stick butter, melted Instructions: Cut off the domed top and the side and bottom crust of the panettone leaving about a bit over a pound&#39;s worth. Trim the pannettone further so that it fits very snugly into the dish you have chosen and comes just to the top edge of the dish. Slice it crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Leave them exposed overnight to the air or put them on a cookie sheet in a very low oven for an hour or so, until the panettone has dried out a bit. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine the water with 3/4 cup of the sugar in a heavy, 2-quart saucepan. Stir over high heat until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid clears. Cook undisturbed until the edges start to brown; then swirl the pan continuously and vigorously until all the sugar has caramelized to a golden amber color. Immediately pour the caramel into the souffle dish. As the caramel cools and hardens, turn the dish in all directions so that the inside is evenly coated. The caramel will spread further in baking. In a saucepan, bring the milk and lemon zest to a simmer, remove from the heat and allow to cool for a few minutes. In a large bowl, mix well the remaining 3/4 cup sugar with the eggs. Gradually stir in the hot milk. Trim one slice of panettone so that it fits into the bottom of the souffle dish. Spoon 2 or 3 tablespoons of melted butter over it and then enough of the custard mixture to cover the panettone. Let it absorb the custard, adding more if necessary to cover. Repeat with additional slices of panettone, melted butter, and custard until the dish is filled to the very top. With each slice (and especially the last), use your palm to hold down the panettone until it completely submerged and saturated with custard. Do not compress the panettone, or the budino will be too dense. Drizzle any remaining butter over the top. Place the souffle dish into a larger pan filled with enough very hot tap water to come three-quarters of the way up the side of the dish. Bake for about an hour and a half. The top should be puffed and brown, the pudding should begin to pull away from the sides of the dish, and the internal temperature should rise to between 160 and 170 degrees. Allow the pudding to cool for at least 15 minutes. Just before serving, run a thin knife around the inside of the dish and unmold the pudding by inverting the souffle dish onto a large plate. Serve warm, cut into wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 31636,&quot;Daniela&#39;s Quince and Cranberry Compote 2 cups apple juice or apple cider 1/2 cup sugar 1 cinnamon stick 1 pound quinces, peeled, cored, cut into 1 inch pieces 14 ounces fresh cranberries Instructions: In a heavy bottomed saucepan, combine juice, sugar, and cinnamon stick.

Pulse the tomatoes until they are coarsely chopped, being careful not to puree. Set aside. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. For the Lentil Loaf: Place the lentils in a large saucepan of cold water. Bring the water just to a boil over high heat. Carefully drain the boiling water and rinse the lentils. Meanwhile, in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat, bring the broth to a boil. Add the rice and return the liquid to a boil. Decrease the heat to low, cover the rice, and gently simmer without stirring for 10 minutes. Stir in the lentils, onion, carrot, and celery. Cover and continue cooking without stirring until the rice and lentils are tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes longer. Turn off the heat. Sprinkle the corn over the rice and lentils and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff the rice with a fork. Cover and let stand for 5 more minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread 1 tablespoon of the butter over a 10 by 4 1/2 by 3-inch loaf pan. In a heavy, large skillet, cook the spinach over medium heat until the spinach wilts, about 3 minutes. Drain and squeeze the excess liquid from the spinach.

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners. For the tea: Pour the boiling water over the tea in a small heatproof bowl and let it steep while you heat the cream. Heat the cream in a pot over medium heat, stirring, until just boiling. Do not overheat as it might separate. Add the cream to the tea mixture and let it steep for at least 15 minutes. For the crust: Pulse the biscuits in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add the butter, granulated sugar and salt and mix well. Place about 2 tablespoons of the crumb mixture into each cupcake liner and press into the bottom. (There will be some leftover crumbs; use them to sprinkle over the caramel sauce if desired, or on top of other desserts.) Bake until the crusts are light golden brown at the edges, about 7 minutes. For the cheesecake: Beat together the cream cheese and jaggery in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until just mixed, less than 1 minute. Strain the cream mixture and press on the tea leaves to release as much flavor as possible. Add the infused cream, cardamom powder, ginger powder, vanilla and salt to the cream cheese mixture and beat until just combined. Mix in the eggs by hand one at a time, until just combined. (Take care not to overmix or the cheesecake may puff up and crack when baking.) Pour the batter equally over the prepared crusts, filling each one almost to the top, and smooth the tops with the back of a spoon. Bake until the outside of the cakes are set but the centers are still slightly loose, about 20 minutes. Let the cheesecakes cool in the pan for 1 hour. It is normal for the cheesecakes to sink a little in the middle. Gently remove the cakes with the muffin liner, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Remove the liners just before serving. Drizzle the Salted Chai Caramel Sauce over the cheesecakes. Store any leftover cheesecakes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Combine the tea, cardamom and ginger in a small heatproof bowl. Pour the boiling water over the mixture and let it steep while you heat the cream. Heat the cream in a pot over medium heat, stirring, until just boiling. Do not overheat as it might separate. Add the cream to the tea mixture, mix well and let it steep for 15 minutes. Combine the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, swirling the pan but not stirring, until the mixture turns a medium amber, 8 to 10 minutes. Watch the mixture towards the end as it can go from a nice caramel to a burnt caramel very fast. Remove from the heat. Strain the cream mixture and press on the tea leaves to release as much flavor as possible. Carefully add the cream mixture to the caramelized sugar. It is normal for the mixture to bubble like mad. Add the butter and salt and mix well until the butter is melted. Let cool completely, then transfer to jars and refrigerate up to a month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 31643,&quot;Rice Paper Summer Rolls 16 (6-inch) rice paper rounds 8 leaves lettuce, washed, dried and torn or chopped 1 cup shredded peeled carrots 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves 1/2 cup fresh Thai basil leaves 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves 32 slices cooked pork or 32 poached or grilled shrimp, split lengthwise in half, or use half pork and half shrimp<br> 1/2 cup fish sauce 2 cups cooked rice vermicelli, rinsed and drained 1 tablespoon sugar, or to taste 1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger 1 teaspoon Vietnamese cl-garlic paste, or to taste, or chopped fresh chiles, to taste Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Lime wedges Instructions: For the rice paper summer rolls: Dip a sheet of rice paper a 1/3 of the way into a bowl of hot water for about 2 seconds.

Place a heavy pot over medium-high heat with at least 1-inch of vegetable oil for boneless chicken and 2 inches for whole pieces. Heat oil to 350 degrees F; it is important to monitor and maintain the temperature, or the soy flour breading and your oil will burn. (Portable deep fryers at home are great for this.) In a medium bowl, mix the eggs and cream to make an egg wash. In a separate larger bowl, mix all the breading ingredients together. Season the chicken well with salt and pepper. Dip it first in the breading, then in the egg wash, and then back in the breading again, making sure to coat well on all sides. Pat off any excess breading and then carefully place into hot oil and fry until golden brown and crisp, just a few minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Boneless chicken breasts, if thinly cut, may cook all the way by frying alone, but whole chicken will not because of how fast soy flour browns. It is best to place any chicken you fry with soy flour on a sheet pan and finish by baking at 350 degrees F for an additional 10 minutes for boneless chicken and 20 to 25 minutes more for cut up chicken pieces that have bones. The internal temperature of the chicken should register 165 degrees F. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 31649,&quot;Avocado Truffles 1 1/2 cups dark or semisweet chocolate chips, melted 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 2 ripe avocados, mashed<br> 1 cup cocoa powder or hot chocolate mix<br> Instructions: Add the melted chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon and mashed avocado to a medium bowl and mix until combined.

Line a large baking tray with parchment paper. Arrange the bacon on the tray, and bake for 10 minutes or until crisp. Drain the bacon on paper towels. Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs, cream and salt. Melt the butter in a nonstick frying pan over high heat, taking care not to let it burn. Pour the egg mixture into the pan, and cook for 20 seconds, or until the eggs just set around the edge. With a wooden spoon, gently bring the egg from the outside of the pan and fold it over itself to the center. Leave the eggs to cook for another 20 seconds, and then fold them again in the same way. When the eggs are just set, remembering that they will continue cooking as they rest, remove the heat. Insert a couple bacon pieces into each bread roll and top them with some egg, arugula, and a spoonful of the tomato relish. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until soft. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for another 2 to 3 minutes. Add the capsicums and sweat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until soft. Add the spices, cl and tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add in the sugar, bay leaf and tomatoes. Bring the pan to a low simmer and cook for 40 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, before serving.

Put the wire racks in the baking sheets and coat each generously with cooking spray. Combine the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and cayenne in a large re-sealable plastic bag. Combine the eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in another large plastic bag; combine the breadcrumbs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a third large plastic bag. Add about half of the zucchini sticks to the bag with the flour and use a combination of your hands and shaking the bag to coat the zucchini. Remove the zucchini and shake off any excess flour. Transfer to the egg wash and repeat until coated. (It&#39;s less messy if you use only one hand for the dry ingredients and the other for the wet.) Let any excess egg drip off before transferring to the breadcrumb and repeat until fully coated (you&#39;ll still see some green and white of the zucchini peeking through the breading). Transfer to the prepared baking sheets and coat the breaded zucchini generously with cooking spray (there&#39;s no need to turn them). Repeat with the remaining zucchini. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom about halfway through, until golden brown and tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the Buffalo sauce: Combine the hot sauce, butter and vinegar in a small saucepan and heat over medium, stirring, until all of the butter has melted and the sauce is warm. Set aside and keep warm. Arrange the fries on a platter and drizzle them with the Buffalo sauce. Sprinkle the blue cheese and celery leaves over the top. Serve with celery and carrot sticks if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 31662,&quot;Panini Under a Brick 4 par-baked ciabatta rolls 1 pound left-over roast pork 1/2 pound smoked ham or Canadian bacon 4 slices smoked provolone cheese Olive salad (recipe to follow) 2/3 cup chopped green olives 1 teaspoon Sambal Oelek 2 tablespoons, chopped dill pickles 1 rib celery, chopped 1 cup cabbage, sliced thin then roughly chopped 1 heaping tablespoon finely minced onion of your choice 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons chopped parsley Instructions: Mix everything in a bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to make sandwiches. Assembly Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice the ciabattas in half and layer 1/4 of the roast pork into each, followed by 1/4 of the ham, then cheese (if using) and finished with the olive salad. Put the top on each ciabatta and wrap each one individually in foil. Place the sandwiches on a baking tray, place a slight smaller baking tray then place foil-wrapped brick on top of sandwiches (you will need 2 bricks). Bake for about 20 minutes until the sandwiches are crunchy on the outside, gooey in the middle. Unwrap immediately and serve. Cooking Under a Brick Cooking anything under a brick sounds odd at first, but it&#39;s really a useful tool for sandwiches, boneless chicken pieces, burgers, steaks, even shrimp-anything that is dense enough not to fall apart beneath the weight of the brick (which typically weighs about 4 1/2 pounds). What the brick does for chicken breast is compress the chicken so that it cooks uniformly, making all surface area golden and crispy. A foil wrapped brick is great to use on sandwiches in place of a Panini press because it does the same thing as the expensive appliance. Using a brick as a Panini press works great in a small toaster oven, too. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 31663,&quot;Metropolitini Ice 8 ounces gin 1-ounce bourbon 1-ounce orange liqueur Maraschino cherries, for garnish Instructions: In a pitcher filled with ice, add the gin, bourbon, and orange liqueur.

Whisk the granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup milk. Whisk half of the hot milk into the egg mixture until smooth, and then gradually whisk the egg mixture into the heated milk. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the peanut butter until melted. Transfer to a bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface and chill until set, at least 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F with a rack set on the middle shelf. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the bacon on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Brush both sides of the bacon with the maple syrup. Bake until golden brown and slightly crispy, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, 20 to 25 minutes. Place on the lined baking sheet and cool completely. The bacon will continue to crisp as it cools. Break each piece of cooled bacon in half. Whip the heavy cream and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer to soft to medium peaks. Refrigerate until ready to use. To assemble, loosen the chilled pudding by whisking it until smooth and creamy. Spoon 1/4 cup of the pudding into the bottom of a 10- to 12-ounce glass. Layer in this order: 1/4 cup crushed waffle cookies, half of a sliced banana, 1/4 cup whipped cream, 1/4 cup pudding and a light sprinkle of additional crushed waffle cookies. Top each parfait with a dollop of the remaining whipped cream and 2 bacon halves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 31665,&quot;Tuscan Olive Harvest Ribolita 3 (12-ounce) jars cannellini beans 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided 1/2 pound smoked ham hock or 1/2 pound chunk prosciutto 3 cloves garlic, chopped, plus 1 whole clove 6 cups water, divided 1 sprig fresh thyme 1 sprig fresh rosemary 1 leek, white and light green only, minced and rinsed 1 yellow onion, minced 1 carrot, small diced 1 celery stalk, small diced 2 bay leaf 1 pound Tuscan black cabbage, chopped 1/2 pound napa cabbage, chopped 3/4 cup, tomato puree 6 slices Italian bread, sliced 1/2-inch thick Freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Beat the meringue powder and water in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until medium glossy peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until the icing is thick and stiff peaks form; add more water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, if the icing is too thick to pipe. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/8-inch round tip. Pipe hands (2 1/2 inches tall and 1 1/2 inches wide) onto the prepared baking sheets. (Do not press the pastry tip against the baking sheet -- the hands might break.) Pipe and fill a 1-inch triangle \anchor,\ pointed-side down, at the bottom of each hand. Pipe knuckles onto each finger. Reserve the remaining icing in a resealable container to fix any broken bones. Let the hands dry overnight. Make the pudding: Whisk the milk, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch and salt in a large saucepan until smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk about 1/2 cup of the warm milk mixture into the egg yolks, then pour the mixture into the saucepan. Continue to cook over medium heat, whisking, until thickened, about 9 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the chocolate until melted and smooth. Whisk in the butter and vanilla. Divide the pudding among 12 small bowls. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of each and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or overnight. Loosen the hands from the parchment with an offset spatula. Use the reserved icing to repair any broken bones. Gently press the hands into the pudding cups and sprinkle with crushed cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 31679,&quot;Buona Lisa Pizza 1/2 cup thin strips roasted yellow or red peppers 10 cherry tomatoes, halved 1/4 cup sliced fresh basil 3 cloves garlic; 1 minced, 2 sliced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound pizza dough, thawed if frozen All-purpose flour, for dusting Cornmeal, for dusting 6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 1 1/2 cups) 3 ounces provolone cheese, shredded (about 3/4 cup) 2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted 4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled Instructions: Place a pizza stone or an inverted rimmed baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat to 500.

Boil until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove soybeans from their pods and add to a pot (reserving about 1/2 cup for texture in a separate bowl) along with chicken stock. Set aside until needed, at which time you will heat and then puree just before serving.; For the rice: Rinse rice in strainer under cold water. Add rice, 3 3/4 cups cold water and salt to a saucepot. Cover and let soak for a half hour. Remove lid, then turn heat to medium and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes without removing the lid. Transfer to a mixing bowl, stir in tarragon, vinegar, and cover with a clean damp kitchen towel and keep at room temperature.; For the stuffing: Remove the meat from the Peking duck, reserving the skin and bones in a saute pan. Finely shred enough duck meat to make 6 tablespoons shredded duck, and place in a mixing bowl. Stir in scallions, hoisin sauce, and ginger soy syrup and set aside at room temperature until needed.; For the filet mignon: Cut a slit in the top center of each steak to hold the stuffing. With a spice grinder, with a mortar and pestle (if you are strong and persistent), or with a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, pulverize the wasabi peas, peppercorns, and salt, together. Stuff the steaks with even amounts of the duck mixture and tie up with butcher&#39;s string to help them keep their shape through the searing process. Coat each filet with the wasabi/peppercorn mixture and set aside briefly. Return to the edamame and heat the beans and chicken stock over medium-high heat until the chicken stock is reduced by half. Remove from heat and keep warm. For the sauce: To the pan of duck skin and bones, add enough water to cover and the demi-glace. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half and strain through a chinois. Discard the skin and bones. Season the reduction with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer to a small bowl and keep warm by nesting the bowl in another bowl of hot water.; To cook the filet mignon: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in a saute pan with oven safe handles (reserving the other tablespoon of oil). When the oil begins to shimmer add the steaks to the pan, stuffed side down first, and sear, leaving undisturbed for the first 2 minutes or so to let the caramelization process begin to allow the stuffing to integrate into the meat and to prevent tearing the beef. Add the reserved grapeseed oil and flip the steaks, searing the other side in the same way, leaving undisturbed for about 2 or 3 minutes. Transfer to the oven to finish to an internal temperature of 125 degrees F as measured with an instant-read thermometer, about 8 to 15 minutes depending on the thickness. Remove from oven and let carryover cook to about 132 degrees F for medium-rare, or cook to your liking. When you have placed the filet mignon in the oven, puree the edamame with an immersion blender and toss in the reserved whole beans for texture. Cover and keep warm. Remove steaks from oven, if done, and let rest as indicated above. For the rice: Using a 3-inch circle cutter, form the sushi rice into \cakes.\ Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and lightly fry the rice circles until golden brown on each side. Leave each side undisturbed for the first 2 to 3 minutes to prevent the \cakes\ from breaking apart. For the carrots, heat the canola oil in a saute pan and deep-fry carrots. Spoon some edamame puree in the left center of serving plate and some duck essence (sauce) on the right center of plate. Place a sauteed circle of rice in the center topped with a stuffed steak and 2 fried carrots on the very top. In a pan lightly coated with oil, combine garlic, ginger, and scallions over medium heat, season with salt and pepper, and let sweat. Deglaze pan with soy sauce, honey and lime juice. Let reduce by 30 to 40 percent until the mixture becomes a syrup, about 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool and transfer to a bottle. Store in the refrigerator. Yield: about 2 cups or 32 servings of 1 tablespoon each. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 31693,&quot;Four Seasons Pizza: Pizza Quattro Stagione Pizza Dough, recipe follows 2 cups grated mozzarella 2 cups grated Fontina 6 ounces button mushrooms, sliced 3 tablespoons olive oil Salt and pepper 1/2 pound steamed clams (Manila or Littleneck) 1 tomato 8 thin slices prosciutto, cut into julienne 1 1/2 cups Tomato Sauce, recipe follows 2 tablespoons basil, chiffonade 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey 1 cup warm water, 105 to 115 degrees 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small onion, minced 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon tomato paste 2 pounds Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced 1 cup homemade Chicken Stock or store-bought, heated, recipe follows 3 ounces butter, cut into small pieces 1/4 cup basil, chiffonade Salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 to 6 pounds chicken bones, including necks and feet, coarsely chopped 1 medium carrot, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch slices 1 medium onion, peeled, trimmed, and quartered 1 small celery stalk, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch slices 1 small leek, cleaned, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch slices 1 sprig fresh thyme 3 sprigs fresh parsley with stems 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon whole white peppercorns Instructions: Prepare the dough 1 hour prior to making pizza.

Slice the onions into 1/4-inch-thick slices and separate into rings. Combine the buttermilk and 3 tablespoons salt in a large bowl. Put the flour in a second large bowl and the cracker meal in a third large bowl. Working in handful-size batches, dip the onion rings in the buttermilk until all are moistened, then put in the bowl of flour and use your hands to dust with the flour to coat. Carefully shake off excess flour and then quickly dip the rings back in the buttermilk to moisten once again. Put the rings in the bowl of cracker meal and use your hands to dust with the meal to coat. Carefully shake off excess meal from each ring and transfer to a shallow pan or baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining rings so all are dipped and coated. Refrigerate the rings for at least 4 hours to set the coating (overnight is best).

When the mushrooms are nicely browned on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes, remove to a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of the oil to the pan and spread out the beef in a single layer. Cook without stirring until browned on one side but not completely cooked through, 1 minute. Transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet, and toss in the carrots and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Stir for about 1 minute, then add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and stir continuously until it turns a shade darker, 30 seconds. Pour in the beef stock mixture, making sure all of the cornstarch gets in the pan. Return the beef, mushrooms and potatoes to the pan. Simmer until the sauce thickens and the flavors are incorporated, 2 minutes. Check for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and parsley. Serve with the buttered egg noodles. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 31721,&quot;Roasted Cauliflower Risotto 1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley 1 head cauliflower, florets cut into 1/2-inch pieces, stems chopped 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup sliced almonds 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped 1 1/2 cups short-grain Italian rice (such as arborio or vialone nano) 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 cup dry white wine 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 ounces Italian fontina cheese, grated (1 1/2 cups) Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 475 degrees F. Toss the cauliflower florets with 1 tablespoon olive oil on a baking sheet. Spread in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Roast on the upper oven rack, 5 minutes. Add the almonds and roast until the cauliflower is tender, about 15 more minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Add the onion and cauliflower stems and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and garlic and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the broth, 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt; cover and bring to a boil.

Place on hot grill and grill until tender, constantly rotating, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 31723,&quot;Porcini Crusted Elk \Wellington, Creamed Spinach and Foie Gras in Puff Pastry 8 (6-ounce) portions elk loin, trimmed flour for dredging 2 eggs, beaten 1/2 cup porcini mushroom dust (or other dried mushroom dust), recipe follows Canola oil 1 pound small spinach leaves 1/2 cup Parmesan, grated 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons butter, room temperature 2 sheets puff pastry Salt and pepper 1 cup dried mushrooms, such as black chanterelle, porcini, or a mix Instructions: Dredge loin in flour and shake off any excess. Dredge in eggs and then roll in the dried mushroom dust. In a hot skillet, add canola oil to coat the bottom, and sear each fillet over high heat until seared on all sides. Set aside. In a pot of boiling, salted water, blanch spinach for about 1 minute, until leaves are tender. Strain and immediately place in a bowl with ice and water to stop the cooking process. Squeeze out any excess water from the spinach with your hands and place in a food processor. Add Parmesan, heavy cream, butter, and salt and pepper, to taste. Process until mixture is smooth and resembles a course paste. Spread the spinach mixture on 1 (16-inch) sheet of plastic wrap. The mixture should be 1 inch from the edge and about 8 inches long. Place seared loin on the far end of the spinach and use the plastic wrap to surround the rest of the meat with the spinach. Twist the ends to make the roll tight. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to set the spinach. Remove puff pastry from the freezer to thaw. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out puff pastry until 1/4-inch thick. Place as many rolls as you can side by side on the sheet and cut pastry in between them (you will have the long strips from the width of the rolls). Roll each piece of pastry around the roll, leaving the twisted plastic sticking out the side, like candy. Roll until the pastry overlaps and cut off any excess. Brush the end with egg wash and seal tightly. Press the pastry firmly around the roll and squeeze the ends around the plastic. Prick pastry with a fork in several places. Place on a sheet pan or cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and place in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until puff pastry is golden brown. To make sure meat is cooked to your liking, cut in half and check the doneness. If the meat is too rare, place the meat back in the oven for a few more minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut each steak in half. Hold on to the bundle as you pull the plastic wrap out the side. To do this, grab the end of the plastic that was sticking out (the twisted end) and pull. Some of the spinach mixture will be lost but most will still be inside. In a spice grinder (coffee grinder) grind mushrooms until finely ground. Do not use your regular coffee grinder. Purchase one especially for grinding spices.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Ribera del Duero]&quot; 31724,&quot;Toffee-Pecan Skillet Brownies 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 4 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup finely chopped pecans 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 1 stick unsalted butter 2 tablespoons dark corn syrup 3/4 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans Flaky sea salt, for topping (optional) Butter pecan or vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Make the brownies: Preheat the oven to 325?. Butter a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Combine the butter and chocolate in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until melted and smooth, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in both sugars until dissolved. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, until smooth and glossy, then whisk in the vanilla. Whisk in the flour and kosher salt until combined, then whisk in the pecans. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared skillet. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the brownies are slightly cracked on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let the brownies cool in the skillet. As soon as the brownies come out of the oven, make the toffee topping: Combine the brown sugar, butter and corn syrup in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium to maintain a steady simmer and cook, without stirring, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Carefully pour in the heavy cream (it might boil up slightly) and simmer until thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the pecans. Let cool until thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes. Pour the topping on the brownies and let set, 1 hour. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if using. Serve with ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 31725,&quot;Mini French Fries 3 large russet potatoes 1 quart peanut oil Kosher salt Instructions: Peel the potatoes, then shred them on the largest holes of a box grater.

To prepare Pimento Cheese, in a medium mixing bowl, combine Cheddar and Jack cheeses, mayonnaise, cream cheese, pimento peppers, pickle juice, horseradish sauce, and mustard; mix until well combined. To prepare Honey Slaw, in a small mixing bowl combine mayonnaise, honey, and cabbage; mix until well combined. Heat a 12-inch nonstick grill pan over medium-high heat. Add bacon and cook until the bacon is crispy, about 5 minutes, flipping once. Drain on paper towels. Pour off almost all of the bacon fat from the pan, leaving a very thin layer. To make the patties, combine the beef, country ham, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compacting it, mix well. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and form into patties to fit the buns. Using the same grill pan as before, cook the hamburgers over medium-high heat for 3 minutes per side or until cooked medium rare. Meanwhile, place buns on a rack in the oven. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes. Also, place the plates that the burgers will be served on in the oven to heat. To assemble the burgers, spread a generous amount of Pimento Cheese on the cut sides of the buns. On each bun bottom (on top of the Pimento Cheese), place a thin layer of Honey Slaw. Top the slaw with a burger patty, 2 slices of bacon, and crushed potato chips. Add the bun tops.

Weight with a plate to keep them submerged, and leave to soak for 1 or 2 hours, or until they are completely flexible. Place the raisins in a small bowl, cover them with the apple juice, and leave to macerate. With an electric mixer, beat the lard or butter until it is light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and half of the fresh masa, and beat them into the mixture. Little by little, alternate adding the milk and the remaining masa, beating in between each addition, until the mixture is the consistency of thick batter. Beat in the salt, baking powder, and cinnamon and continue beating for 1 minute longer. Separate out 12 of the largest and most flexible husks, they should be at least 6 inches wide and 6 or 7 inches long. Reserve the remaining husks for tieing the tamales. If there aren&#39;t enough large husks, overlap them to give a nice wide surface to spread the dough on. Pat the leaves dry with a tea towel. Place about 1/3 cup of the batter in the center of each husk, top with a few raisins (use a slotted spoon to remove the raisins from the apple juice) and figs, and wrap and tie the husks as usual to enclose the dough.

F. Bring a small pot of water to a boil over medium heat. Put the peppercorns in a fine-mesh sieve and add to the water; simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the sieve and let the peppercorns drain. Spread the peppercorns on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake until dry, 8 to 10 minutes. (Cooking the peppercorns mellows out their strong flavor.) Roast the potatoes: Raise the oven temperature to 375? F. Toss the potatoes with the olive oil in a large bowl and season with kosher salt. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on the pan. Put the baking sheet in the center of the oven and roast until the potatoes are browned and tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Season the steaks: While the potatoes cook, use the bottom of a small skillet to crush the peppercorns on the baking sheet \u2014 they should break into coarse crumbs. Season the steaks on both sides with kosher salt, then press them into the crushed peppercorns. Cook the steaks: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until it begins to visibly smoke. Shut the heat off underneath the skillet and use a pair of tongs to place the steaks in the pan in a single layer. Turn the heat to medium and brown the steaks on the first side, 4 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness. (Resist the temptation to turn them over or move them as they cook!) Flip the steaks using the tongs and brown on the second side, 4 to 6 more minutes. Take the temperature of the steaks using a meat thermometer. Rare registers between 125? F and 130? F; medium rare is 130? F to 135? F; and medium is 135? F to 140? F. Place the steaks on a rack set on a baking sheet to rest while you make your sauce. Make the sauce: Remove the excess grease from the skillet. Add the butter and shallots and cook, stirring, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook until the liquid reduces almost completely, about 1 minute. Whisk in the mustard and Worcestershire sauce, then add the stock and reduce until decently thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve the steaks: Place the steaks on plates and spoon the sauce on top. Arrange the potatoes next to the steaks. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 31765,&quot;Gluten-Free Mushroom and Ricotta Pizza Gluten-Free Pizza Dough, recipe follows Cooking spray 1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella 1/2 cup part-skim ricotta 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced Kosher salt Pinch crushed red pepper 4 ounces mushrooms, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves 2 large all-purpose potatoes (about 14 ounces) 1/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F) 2 teaspoons agave syrup or honey One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast 1 cup white rice flour 1/2 cup tapioca starch Kosher salt 1 large egg white 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Set a pizza stone or baking sheet on an oven rack in the bottom-third position and preheat to 500 degrees F. Divide the pizza dough into 2 balls. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and press each ball out into a thin 10-inch round. Put the baking sheet on the preheated stone and parbake until the dough just starts to brown on the bottom and edges, about 10 minutes for a softer crust or about 15 minutes for a crisper crust. Remove and let cool slightly. Combine the mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and crushed red pepper in a small bowl. Toss the mushrooms, olive oil, thyme and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in another small bowl. Dollop the cheese mixture evenly on the 2 pizza crusts and spread out, then divide the mushrooms between them. Bake the pizzas until the crust is golden brown and the cheese browns in some spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Cut each into 4 pieces and serve. Cover the potatoes with water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, about 25 minutes; remove. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the skin and work the potatoes through a ricer set over a large bowl (should have about 2 cups). Set aside. Stir together the warm water, agave and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Add the potatoes, rice flour, tapioca starch and 3/4 teaspoon salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until the mixture is combined and forms a fine, crumbly meal. Continuing to mix on medium, add the egg white and oil, slowly drizzle in the yeast mixture and mix until the dough comes together (it will be slightly tacky). Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough increases by half, about 1 1/2 hours. Form the dough into 2 or 4 balls, for small or medium pizzas, then either cook them as desired or wrap them well and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw frozen dough at room temperature, then shape and cook. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 31766,&quot;Brookies Nonstick cooking spray Two 4-ounce bars bittersweet chocolate, chopped (about 1 3/4 cups) 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 3/4 cup lightly packed light brown sugar 3/4 cup granulated sugar 4 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook\u2019s Note) 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup lightly packed light brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 1 large whole egg plus 1 large egg yolk 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: For the brownie batter: Preheat the oven 350 degrees F.

Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and dust lightly with semolina. Place the dough balls on the baking sheet and drape loosely with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator and let rise a third time, until nearly doubled in volume, 1 hour more. For the special sauce Bolognese: Pour the canola oil into a large rondeau and bring to medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the ground beef, onions, garlic, salt and pepper. Saute, stirring occasionally and breaking up any clumps of ground beef, until the beef is starting to get a bit of color. Deglaze with the red wine, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce and simmer for 5 minutes. Cut the heat and stir in the mayonnaise. Make the pizza: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Dust a work surface with semolina. For each pizza, roll out a ball of pizza dough; you can either stretch it by hand or use a rolling pin. Pinch the edges all the way around the dough to form the crust. Once you have stretched the dough to about 12 inches, brush the edges with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Place in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes; the dough will rise like a balloon. Pull it out and spread evenly with Bolognese. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack and return to the oven for another 3 to 4 minutes. Pull the pizza from the oven, cover with shredded lettuce and top with sliced pickles and tomatoes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barbera, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 31771,&quot;Italian Salad with Parmesan Crisps 6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons green olives, pitted and roughly chopped<br> 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 medium head radicchio, leaves separated and torn 1 cup arugula<br> 2 blood oranges, peeled and thinly sliced<br> Instructions: For the Parmesan crisps: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Extra pesto, placed in an airtight container and topped with a layer of olive oil, will keep in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Barbera, Dolcetto, Garnacha]&quot; 31776,&quot;Little Lamb Pull-Apart Cupcakes 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter 2 pounds (2 boxes) confectioners&#39; sugar Pinch fine salt 24 devil&#39;s food cupcakes 2 tablespoons milk 2 to 3 teaspoons almond extract Green food coloring 5 licorice wheels, such as Haribo Instructions: Combine the butter, sugar and salt using an electric mixer on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the milk and almond extract, increase the speed to medium-high and mix until light and fluffy. Take 3/4 cup of the frosting and reserve. Take 1 cup of the frosting and add 8 to 10 drops of green food coloring to make a grassy color and reserve. Fill a pastry bag or resealable plastic baggie with the remaining frosting and snip a 1-inch corner off the bag. To make the body: Place 5 of the cupcakes in a line. Nestle 4 cupcakes above the line and 4 more cupcakes below the line, making them touch so you have a rough oval shape. Top each cupcake with a swirl of white frosting from the piping bag. Then pipe smaller peaks to fill all of the spaces between the cupcakes. To make the head: Put 3 cupcakes together in an upside-down triangle. Spread with 1/2 cup of the reserved white frosting so that all of the cupcakes are connected. To make the ears: Cut 1 cupcake in half, paper and all. Set each half, cut-side in, on either side of the bottom of the triangle. Spread 1/2 tablespoon of white frosting on top. Cut 1 licorice wheel in half and place, cut-side in, on each half cupcake. Now, pipe little swirls all over the top third of the head and around the outsides of the licorice ears. Nestle the head into the shoulder. To make the face: Peel off a 3-inch strip of licorice. Pull apart into 2 strands and cut into 1-inch lengths. Place 2 of them on the head for eyes. Make a Y shape with 3 pieces and place so the bottom point is centered at the bottom edge of the face. Discard (or eat) the fourth piece. To make the legs: Put 2 cupcakes into the first and third gaps on the bottom row of the body. Spread some frosting on each cupcake. Top each leg with a whole licorice wheel. Cut another wheel in half place one half under each wheel for the hooves. To make the grass: Line the remaining 5 cupcakes horizontally under the legs. Spread half of the green frosting in an even layer along the cupcakes, covering and connecting them. Next, fill the reservoir of a garlic press with some of the remaining the green frosting. The frosting is easiest to work with at cool room temperature. Press, attaching the frosting to each cupcake, while pulling upward to create grass. Repeat using the rest of the frosting until all of the cupcakes are covered. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31777,&quot;Pate Sucree 1 1/4 cups flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold 1 egg, lightly beaten plus ice water to equal 1/4 cup Instructions: Combine the flour, salt and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and process a few seconds to mix. Quarter the stick butter lengthwise and cut into 8 or 9 pieces. Scatter the cubes of butter evenly over the flour. Pulse the machine until the butter pieces are about the size of lentils. Place the lightly beaten egg in a 1/4 cup measure and fill to the top with ice water. Put half the liquid in the bottom of a bowl. Turn the flour/butter mixture onto it and pour the remaining liquid evenly over the top. Using a large rubber spatula, fold the mixture until it&#39;s evenly moistened. Squeeze it; it should hold together. If not, sprinkle in a little more water and gently mix. Turn the mixture out on the table and quickly frisage: (Using the palm of your hand, push sections of the dough away from you against the table. Gather the dough together and frisage any portions that were missed.) Form the mass into whatever shape you will be rolling out (i.e., disk for round, cylinder for rectangle), and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.

Add the chocolate and cream cheese and continue to pulse until crumbly but pasty. Using the filling portion (&#39;the bumpy side) of a 12-section ravioli mold, cover the indented side with plastic wrap. Pack some of the filling into each indentation, leveling each one so it&#39;s flush with the top of the mold. Remove and place on a plate. Repeat to make 24 fillings. Cover the filling with plastic wrap and refrigerate. (Eat the crumbs left behind.) To make the dough: Combine the butter and sugars in a large mixing bowl. Beat at medium speed, until fluffy and combined, about 2 minutes. Add the molasses and vanilla and beat until combined. In a separate bowl, whisk both flours, the baking soda, salt and cinnamon together. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in 3 parts, alternating with cream in 2 parts, beginning and ending with flour. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Divide into 2 disks, wrap in plastic warp and chill until very firm, about 1 hour. Lay out an 11 by 15-inch piece of foil on a clean workspace and sprinkle generously with flour. Place a disk of dough on top and cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap. Roll the dough between the two layers (Voila, no messy hands) until you have a rectangle measuring 10 by 13 inches, cutting and patching as needed. Repeat with the other disk of dough. Transfer each foil to a cookie sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. When chilled, remove plastic wrap from 1 flat of chilled and rolled dough. Spray the zigzag side of the ravioli mold with nonstick spray and sprinkle it with flour. Place the mold, zigzag side down, onto the lower half of the dough, making a slight indent in the dough. Take the chocolate filling from the refrigerator. Place a round of filling on the center of each square ravioli impression. Using the foil to lift the top of the dough, fold it over the mounds on the bottom half leaving plenty of give to tuck dough between each mound. Gently press out the air around the mounds with wet fingers to keep the dough from cracking. Spray the zigzag side of the mold again and sprinkle the top of the ravioli with flour. Invert the press on the cookies, making another impression in the dough, and press very firmly to seal the 2 layers together and cut off excess dough. To remove the mold, gently lift by pressing downward on the 2 mounds on the end. Lift up on the mold working your way across the dough slab. Use a dry pastry brush to brush off excess flour. Cut ravioli into individual portions, trimming away excess dough with a knife or fluted pastry cutter. Arrange on a baking sheet. Chill the molded ravioli in the refrigerator until firm to the touch, 30 more minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the ravioli for 25 to 30 Minutes. Remove from oven and let sit on cookie sheet 5 more minutes, using a pastry cutter to cut in between the ravioli while warm, if desired. Then slide the slab onto a cookie sheet to cool.

Rinse strip loin to remove residue and season with salt. Combine horseradish and black pepper in a small bowl to make a paste. Place loin in roasting pan and coat entirely with paste. Roast until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 140 to 142 degrees F as measured with an instant-read thermometer, about 30 to 40 minutes, then remove from oven and let rest to carryover cook to about 150 degrees for medium-rare, or cook for whatever length of time is needed (usually specified on your meat thermometer) for your desired level of doneness. For the sauce, heat grapeseed oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. When it begins to shimmer, add the beef trimmings and cook for about 10 minutes until you see that the fat is rendered from the meat. You should pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat or, if necessary, supplement with grapeseed oil if you do not have 2 tablespoons in the pan. Add garlic and onion and gently saute until the onion turns translucent. Pour beer into the pan and cook over medium heat until most of the alcohol has evaporated, then stir in the beef base (which has been diluted in water) and tomato paste. Return to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low and allow to reduce by half. Strain into a bowl and gradually whisk in cubed butter. Nest bowl in another bowl filled with hot water and cover to keep warm. For the vegetable medley, blanch carrots and haricots verts for 2 minutes in salted water and drain well. Heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in a large saute pan. When it begins to shimmer, add shallot, peppers, carrots and green beans and season with salt and pepper. Saute until the shallot turns translucent and the peppers begin to soften. Remove to a bowl and cover until needed. Reserve the saute pan. For the rissole, boil the potatoes until soft, and drain well. For the onion rings, heat oil in the reserved saute pan over medium-high heat. Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt in a small bowl and pour the beer in a stream while whisking constantly. Dip the onion slices into the batter and fry until golden. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Discard oil and reserve the saute pan. Return to the rissole. In the same pan saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil over medium high heat in a large skillet, reserving the other tablespoon. When it begins to shimmer, saute the white onion until tender. Transfer the onion to the potatoes which have been boiled for the rissole, reserving the saute pan. Season potatoes, to taste, with salt and pepper, and mash together. Fold in the scallions and crab trying to avoid breaking up the crab. Allow to sit until cool enough to handle, then use 3-inch circle cutters as molds and form the potato/crab mixture into circles. In the same pan, heat additional grapeseed oil for the rissole over medium-high heat and sear the potato cakes leaving undisturbed for the first 2 to 3 minutes on each side to let the caramelization process begin and to prevent the cake from breaking apart. When you see the edges of the cake beginning to turn golden brown, flip and sear the other side. Then cook further until the cake is firm. Remove from heat and keep warm. Slice roast sirloin. Place a rissole circle on serving plate. Place sliced beef on top and spoon demi-glace over. Top with onion rings.

Add the water and work it in with your fingers to moisten the crumbs lightly. In another small, shallow bowl, beat the egg just until blended. Dip one flat surface of each goat cheese round in the egg, and then in breadcrumbs, patting the crumbs in place. Repeat on the other flat surface, leaving the sides of the rounds uncoated. Refrigerate the coated cheese rounds for about 15 minutes. Center the tomato slices on 4 salad plates. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat. Add the 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the oil is almost smoking, add the cheese rounds, one coated side down. Cook until lightly browned, about 45 seconds, then turn and cook on the second side until the cheese just feels quivery, about 45 seconds longer, depending on the thickness of the rounds. Place a cheese round on each tomato slice. In a bowl, toss the herbs with a splash of red wine vinegar, a light drizzle of olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Mound the herbs on top of the cheese, dividing them evenly.

With a pastry blender, incorporate the butter until crumbs have formed. Add the water a few tablespoons at a time, until you can form a ball. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. Let it rest for about 15 minutes more. You can prepare the dough in advance and refrigerate it. To make the filling: Boil the potatoes until tender. Drain and set aside. If using fresh carrots, chop and simmer in water, to cover, in a small pot. Add the corn and peas to barely cook. Set aside to cool. Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion until golden. Add the garlic, ginger, and cl and cook for 2 minutes. Add the garam masala, turmeric, cl powder, and salt and cook 2 minutes more. In a bowl combine the mashed potatoes, the onion and spice mixture, carrots, peas, corn, lemon juice, and chopped coriander. Mix well. To assemble the samosas: Divide the dough into 9 equal size balls. On a floured surface, roll each ball into a 5-inch circle. Cut each circle in half. Brush the straightedge side with a little water, fold it in half, and align the two straight sides so they overlap to form a cone shape. Squeeze the edges together to make a tight seal. Place approximately 1 generous tablespoon of filling inside each cone, leaving the top edge clean. Moisten the inside top rim of the cone and press the edges together to make another tight seal. Place the samosas on a tray until ready to fry. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Heat approximately 3 inches of vegetable oil in a deep saucepan. Fry several samosas at a time, being careful not to crowd them. When 1 side turns golden brown, flip it over to brown on the other side. Drain on paper towels.

Garnish with a strawberry, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Vodka, Cranberry Juice]&quot; 31835,&quot;Braised Pork and Veggie Pockets 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground mustard<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground sage<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet smoked paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder<br> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 1 red onion, cut into sixths<br> 1 navel orange, quartered<br> 3 cups sweet tea<br> 5 ounces frozen spinach, thawed Half of a 15.5-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed<br> 5 ounces frozen corn, thawed<br> 1 cup shredded pepper jack cheese<br> 1 cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar 1/2 cup pickled jalapenos, chopped<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1 scallion, chopped<br> 1/2 red bell pepper, cut into small dice (about 1 cup)<br> Four 15-ounce boxes refrigerated rolled pie crusts<br> All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 large egg, beaten<br> Instructions: For the pork: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small mixing bowl, combine the salt, chili powder, cumin, mustard, sage, paprika, cinnamon and cracked black pepper. Massage the pork shoulder all over with the dry rub. Place a large Dutch oven over high heat. Add the oil and heat until shimmering. Put the pork shoulder in the pot and sear on all sides until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Set the pork aside. Reduce the heat to medium and add the red onion and orange to the pot. Cook, stirring, until the orange edges are caramelized, about 6 minutes. Put the pork back in and pour in the sweet tea. The tea should cover about two-thirds of the pork; it should not be fully submerged. Cover the pot with a lid. Oven-braise the pork, turning it over halfway through the cooking time, until fork-tender, about 2 hours. For the pockets: Meanwhile, assemble the vegetable filling. Squeeze the spinach to remove all of the moisture. Use your fingers to break up the spinach as you sprinkle it into a large mixing bowl. Add the black beans, corn, pepper jack, Cheddar, pickled jalapenos, cilantro, salt, black pepper, scallion and bell pepper. Stir thoroughly to combine. Remove the pork from the pot and discard the cooking liquid. Using 2 forks, shred the pork into bite-size chunks, making sure to discard any fatty pieces. Add the pork to the vegetable filling and toss to combine. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Spread 2 rounds of pie crust dough onto a surface lightly dusted with flour. Place six 1/4-cup mounds of filling onto the first round of pie dough, leaving space in between each mound. Lay the second round of dough directly on top of the mounds. Using a pizza cutter, make slices in the dough to separate each mound and form a triangular pocket. Working with one triangle at a time, press the tip of a fork along the edges to seal the pocket on all 3 sides. Place the sealed pocket on one of the parchment-lined baking sheets. Continue with the remaining dough and filling. Brush the triangles with the beaten egg to ensure even browning. Bake until golden brown and crispy, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 31836,&quot;Warm Lobster Rolls 1 pound cooked lobster meat 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 1/2 cup small-diced celery Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh dill, plus extra for garnish 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh parsley Juice of 1 lemon 6 top-sliced hot dog buns, such as Pepperidge Farm Instructions: Cut the lobster meat in large (3/4-inch) dice. Heat 3 tablespoons of the butter in a medium (10-inch) saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the lobster, celery, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes, until just heated through. Off the heat, sprinkle the lobster with the dill, parsley, and half of the lemon juice. Stir well. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a large (12-inch) saute pan, until the butter sizzles. Place the rolls in the pan on their sides (you are toasting the outsides, not the insides) and cook over medium-high heat for 2 minutes on each side, until nicely browned. Place the rolls, cut side up, on a platter. Divide the lobster mixture among the 6 rolls and sprinkle with extra dill, salt, and the remaining lemon juice. Serve hot while the rolls are crisp on the outside and the lobster filling is hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31837,&quot;Manicotti with Marinara Sauce 1 pound ricotta 1 whole egg 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons minced parsley leaves Salt and pepper Salt and pepper<br> Marinara Sauce, recipe follows 8 squares fresh manicotti noodles<br> 1/3 cup olive oil 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 (28-ounce) cans crushed plum tomatoes 10 basil leaves, chopped (or 1 tablespoon dried) 1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried) Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and set a large pot of water on the stovetop to boil. In a bowl, combine the ricotta, egg, Parmesan, parsley, and salt and pepper. Set this filling aside. Cook the manicotti in boiling water for minute. After they&#39;ve cooked for one minute, remove the pot from the heat but do not drain the manicotti squares in a colander as the noodles often stick together. Instead, run cold water into the pot until you can fish the manicotti squares out safely with your fingers. Shake off the excess water as you remove each square. It is usually best to place the squares on a clean cloth to further blot them. Lay the squares flat on a cloth, placing the filling across the center of the dough, leaving a little room at the edges on each side. Turn up the edge nearest you so that it lies on top of the filling. Now turn the edge farthest from you towards you so that it lies on top of the first edge. You now have a cannoli-like tube. Spread 1 ladleful of the sauce onto the bottom of a 9 by 12-inch baking pan. Turn the manicotti over and place seam-side down in the baking pan on top of the sauce. Continue until the pan has a layer of manicotti. Spoon 2 more ladlefuls of sauce over the top and bake for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit 10 minutes before serving. Serve with additional sauce for individual servings. Everyone has his own variation of marinara sauce. Borgatti&#39;s is basic and can be used throughout this book whenever marinara is called for. The seasonings and herbs can be adjusted, to taste. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, heat the oil. Saute the garlic, salt, and pepper for 5 minutes or until the garlic is softened. Add the remaining ingredients, then raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer, stirring often. Simmer for 30 minutes. The sauce can be stored for up to 5 days in the refrigerator and several months in the freezer.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 31838,&quot;Weeknight Buttermilk Fried Chicken 1 chicken, cut up into 10 pieces 2 cups buttermilk 1 tablespoon red hot pepper sauce 2 teaspoons salt, divided 1 cup flour 1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs 2 teaspoons granulated garlic 2 teaspoons paprika 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Marinate the chicken in a mixture of the buttermilk, pepper sauce, and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a large glass bowl. Let sit for 8 hours or overnight in the refrigerator, turning the chicken pieces over at least once. Once ready to cook, remove the chicken from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk and blot the excess liquid with paper towels. Mix the flour, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, breadcrumbs, granulated garlic, paprika, and black pepper in a large bowl. In a large frying pan, heat 1-inch of oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, toss the chicken in the flour, making sure the chicken is fully coated and dry. Fry the chicken 3 minutes on each side. Then transfer each piece of chicken to a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack and bake until the internal temperature is 170 degrees F, about 15 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 31839,&quot;No-Boil Mac and Cheese 2 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature, plus 2 tablespoons melted 2 cups dry, plain bread crumbs (I like Panko)<br> 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (preferably freshly grated)<br> 1 1/2 cups whole milk<br> 1 can (15 ounces) evaporated milk<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy (whipping) cream<br> 2 tablespoons dehydrated onion<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 8 ounces (about 2 cups) freshly shredded sharp Cheddar cheese (preferably orange)<br> 8 ounces (about 2 cups) freshly shredded fontina cheese<br> 1 box (16 ounces) elbow macaroni, uncooked<br> Instructions: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a rimmed sheet pan with the room-temperature butter and set aside. Combine the breadcrumbs and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese in a medium-size bowl. Stir in the melted butter and set aside. Whisk the whole milk, evaporated milk, cream, onion, garlic powder, salt, and the Cheddar and fontina cheeses in a large bowl. Add the uncooked macaroni and stir until well coated. Pour the mixture into the prepared sheet pan, spreading it in an even later. Cover the sheet pan with aluminum foil (you may need 2 sheets), crimping it tightly around the edges to seal (make sure to get a good seal on the foil, otherwise the pasta won&#39;t cook). Bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and stir the macaroni. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the top and continue to bake for 25 minutes more. Turn the broiler to high and broil the macaroni and cheese until it is golden brown on top and bubbling, about 10 minutes (watch the macaroni and cheese closely, as broiler intensities vary). Remove from the oven and let the pasta stand, covered, 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 31840,&quot;Deep Dish Cheese Pizza 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 3/4 cup warm water<br> 1 teaspoon honey<br> 2 tablespoons cornmeal, such as Arrowhead Mills, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 to 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for the bowl 6 ounces sliced provolone 1 cup jarred marinara sauce<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Dried oregano and red pepper flakes, optional<br> Instructions: Combine the yeast, water and honey in a small bowl. Set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes. Combine the cornmeal, salt and 2 cups flour in a bowl. Add the water mixture and 1/4 cup olive oil. Using your hands, stir together to form a rough dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough, adding more flour as needed, until it forms a slightly tacky but smooth dough that doesn&#39;t stick to your hands or the counter, 5 to 10 minutes. Place the dough in an olive oil-coated bowl, turning to coat the dough in the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Position an oven rack in the top third of the oven and another in the bottom third. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan with the remaining tablespoon olive oil. Wrap the bottom of the pan in aluminum foil and set aside. Gently place the dough in the pan and spread it out to the edges using your fingers. Work the dough about 2 inches up the side of the pan. Shingle the provolone on the bottom of the crust and part of the way up the sides. Spoon the marinara over the cheese and smooth with the back of a spoon. Bake for 30 minutes on the lower rack. Rotate the pizza and move it to the top rack and continue to bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the sauce is slightly darker, another 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and seasonings, if using, and allow the pizza to rest for 10 minutes before unmolding, slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 31841,&quot;Carnival Pork Stew 1 (2 lb.) boneless pork top loin roast, cut into 1-inch cubes OR 1 (2 lb.) boneless pork sirloin roast, cut into 1-inch cubes 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons Crisco?

Once melted and bubbling, add a large handful of the onions and cook until translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat until all the onions have been added. Season with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn medium brown, about 30 minutes. If the onions start to get too dark, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of beef stock as necessary. Add the sherry to deglaze the pan. Add the mustard and stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside. For the potato gratin: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Using a mandoline or a sharp knife, cut the potatoes into thin slices. Do your best to keep the potatoes in a stack--this will make it easier to layer them in the pan. Set the potatoes aside. Use the reserved butter wrapper to lightly grease the bottom and sides of a large (12-inch) cast-iron skillet. Discard the wrapper. Arrange a thin shingled layer of potatoes in concentric circles around the skillet. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper, then arrange an even layer of caramelized onions on top of the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, combine the Gruyere and mozzarella and reserve half for later use. Sprinkle on a layer of the remaining cheese mixture over the onions. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients (not including the reserved cheese) have been used. Press down firmly on the layers to flatten. In a large bowl or measuring cup, combine the heavy cream and beef stock and pour over the gratin. Cover the skillet with foil and place on a sheet pan. Bake the potatoes, covered, until the top and edges have begun to brown and the potatoes are tender, 1 hour 15 to 1 hour 30 minutes. You can test by inserting a knife into the potatoes; if it goes in and comes out without resistance, then the potatoes are done. Remove the skillet from the oven, remove the foil and turn the broiler on high. Combine the croutons and French fried onions. Cover the gratin with a layer of the crouton mixture followed by the remaining cheese. Broil until golden brown and bubbly, 5 to 8 minutes.

Freeze the meat until very firm and starting to harden around the edges, but still pliable, 15 to 25 minutes. Place half of the meat in a food processor and pulse until coarsely ground, ten to fifteen 1-second pulses, stopping and redistributing the meat around the bowl as necessary to ensure it is evenly ground. Transfer the meat to a baking sheet, overturning the bowl and without directly touching the meat. Repeat the grinding process with the remaining meat cubes. Spread the meat over the baking sheet and inspect carefully, discarding any long strands of gristle or large chunks of hard meat or fat. Evenly divide the meat into 12 balls and season aggressively with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Working in batches, cook the patties. As soon as you put the balls in the skillet, press each one down once with a strong metal spatula into a 1/2-inch patty or until just larger than your bun (size up your bun-to-meat ratios people!). Do not smoosh them again. Cook until the patties are crusty brown on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes, then flip once and finish the other side while a piece of cheese melts on top, 4 to 5 minutes more. Stack into 3 patties and set aside to rest. Repeat with the remaining patties. On a nonstick flat-bottomed pan (preferably square), butter and toast the buns until golden brown, keeping an eye on them so they don&#39;t burn, about 5 minutes.

Check for seasoning, adding more if needed, and serve with extra Parmesan and basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 31877,&quot;Classic Buffalo Wings 30 chicken wings, small wing joint removed 2 cups hot sauce 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Vegetable oil, for frying 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Kosher salt Cayenne pepper 2 large eggs 1/4 cup whole milk Oil, for deep-frying 1 cup sour cream 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon white vinegar 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves 1 teaspoon minced shallots 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1/4 pound blue cheese, crumbled Celery sticks, for serving Instructions: To make the wings: Place the wings in a glass or other non-reactive bowl and add 1 cup of the hot sauce and Worcestershire. Mix thoroughly, being sure all the wings are coated, cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes. Pour the oil for frying in a large pot to a depth of 2 inches and heat over medium heat to 375 degrees F. Place the flour in a separate mixing bowl and season with kosher salt and cayenne pepper to taste. In a separate bowl, prepare an egg wash by whisking together the eggs and milk until well blended. Working with all 3 bowls (wings, flour mixture and egg wash): first dredge each wing in the flour mixture, then dip the wing in the egg wash; and finally dredge the wing completely in the flour mixture, coating it evenly. Deep-fry the wings for 12 to 15 minutes or until the batter achieves a crisp, uniform texture. When cooked through, set aside to drain on paper towels or the nonprinted side of a paper grocery bag. To make the dressing: in a mixing bowl and using a wire whisk, combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, vinegar, parsley, shallots, and garlic, blending until smooth. Gently stir in the crumbled cheese until completely mixed in. To serve, place the fried wings in a large bowl and drench with the remaining 1 cup hot sauce (or less, to taste). Serve with the blue cheese dipping sauce and celery sticks on the side -- and plenty of napkins! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 31878,&quot;Free-Range Chicken Wellington Stack with Crisp Potatoes 1 whole free-range chicken, divided into 2 boneless breasts, 2 wings, 2 legs and 2 thighs, Reserve carcass for sauce 2 cups chicken stock<br> 2 large russet potatoes, thinly sliced lengthwise 8 ounces white truffle pate 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems reserved and caps thinly sliced<br> Vegetable oil, for frying Whole, unsalted butter Salt and pepper<br> Salt and pepper Duxelle, recipe follows 1 shallot, finely chopped Whole, unsalted butter, for sauteing 1 portobello mushroom, chopped Salt and pepper 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons parsley leaves, chopped 1 teaspoon thyme leaves, chopped Instructions: In a large bowl, combine cold water (enough to cover the chicken breasts) and 2 tablespoons salt. Place the divided chicken pieces in the salted water (brine) and let stand for approximately 45 minutes. Remove the chicken pieces from the brine and rinse thoroughly under cold water. Slice each breast on the bias into 4 thin slices. Heat oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. Pan sear the chicken about 1 minute on each side until golden. Remove from heat. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a medium skillet on medium heat. Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms and saute until crispy. Remove the mushrooms with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel to remove excess oil. Season the mushrooms with salt and freshly ground pepper. Cut a small hole in the middle of each raw potato slice for the rosemary \pick.\ Pour at least 2 inches of oil in a medium pot and heat until the oil begins to smoke. Carefully place the potato slices in the oil 2 or 3 at a time. Turn potatoes occasionally so they brown evenly. Remove the potatoes when they are tender/crisp and allow the excess oil to drain on a paper towel. Season, to taste, with salt. Pour 2 cups of chicken stock into a medium pot. Add the chicken carcass, shiitake mushroom stems, marjoram and sage. Let simmer until reduced by 1/2. Strain the reduced stock with cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer into a small saucepan and place on low heat. Add the gelatin from the pate to the pan and stir until it dissolves. Gently stir in 2 tablespoons of butter. Do not boil. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Place a crispy potato slice on each plate. Top each potato with 1 slice of chicken. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of duxelle onto the chicken. Using a sharp knife, slice a thin piece of pate and place on top of the duxelles. Place a second potato slice on top of the duxelle and repeat the process for each plate. Top each stack with the third slice of potato. Secure the stack with a \pick\ of rosemary (take a 4-inch piece of rosemary and gently remove the bottom 2 to 3 inches of leaves, leaving 1 to 2 inches of rosemary leaves on each pick). Cook the shallots in butter in a medium sized pan, on low heat. Add the chopped mushroom to the shallots and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the mushrooms render liquid. Remove from the pan and puree the mixture in a food processor. Return the pureed mushroom mixture to the pan. Add heavy cream. Reduce the cream until the mixture is pasty. Remove from heat and add parsley and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31879,&quot;Dad&#39;s Mashed Potato Salad 6 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch large chunks 3 /4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Pinch freshly ground nutmeg<br> 1/4 cup warm half-and-half<br> 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Miracle Whip<br> 1/4 cup yellow mustard<br> 3/4 cup finely chopped celery<br> 3/4 cup finely chopped onion<br> 2 cups finely chopped sweet pickles<br> 1/4 cup sweet pickle juice<br> 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 5 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and finely chopped<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Cover the potato chunks with cold water in a large saucepot. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender. Drain and return the potatoes to the pot. Add the butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mash with a potato masher or electric hand mixer (essentially you are making mashed potatoes), adding warm half-and-half as needed until the potatoes are smooth and creamy. You should have a little over 6 cups of mashed potatoes. Add the Miracle Whip, mustard, celery, onion, pickles, pickle juice, and sugar, mixing after each addition. Stir in the eggs until combined. Chill at least 1 hour or make the night before and refrigerate.

Add egg yolk and orange peel. Add flour, don&#39;t over mix. If the dough is too crumbly, add a little water. Chill the dough until firm enough to roll out. Make almond paste, or mix prepared almond paste (such as Odense brand) with egg white. If the paste is too hard to mix, grate it into the egg white and add enough water to achieve a spreadable consistency. After the dough is chilled, roll out dough nice and thin. Cut the dough into 3-inch strips. Gather extra dough, repeat until dough is used up. Spread almond paste mixture on dough, leaving 1/4-inch free at the top edge. Gently roll up the dough, and place on a cookie sheet, refrigerating until firm. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Remove chilled dough from the refrigerator. Slice roll into 2-inch pieces, and arrange these on the cookie sheet, leaving a little room for spreading. Slice each 2-inch roll every 1/4-inch or so from the top down leaving about a 1/4-inch uncut at the bottom. Gently pull down the ends to form a crown shape. Brush each cookie with an egg wash, and sprinkle with almonds. If you prefer, use parl suukar, or edible pearl sugar, for a glittering effect. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, until pale golden in color, remove and cool.

Set aside. Place a layer of cake, jam side up, in the bottom of a 2 1/2 to 3-quart glass serving bowl, cutting the pieces to fit. Top with a layer of raspberries and orange cream. Repeat the layers of cake, raspberries, and orange cream, ending with a third layer of cake, jam side down, and raspberries. Whip the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When it starts to thicken, add the sugar and vanilla and continue to whip until it forms stiff peaks. Decorate the trifle with whipped cream. The trifle can sit for awhile at room temperature. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour 2 (8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 1/2-inch loaf pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper. Cream the butter and 2 cups of the granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. With the mixer on medium speed, beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, and the orange zest. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the orange juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean. While the cakes bake, cook the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar with remaining 1/2 cup orange juice in a small saucepan over low heat until the sugar dissolves. When the cakes are done, let them cool for 10 minutes. Take them out of the pans and place them on a baking rack set over a tray. Spoon the orange syrup over the cakes and allow the cakes to cool completely.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/tablespoon toasted sesame oil.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/tablespoon%20onion%20powders%20powders.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>tablespoon onion powders powders</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/tablespoons%20butter,%20softened.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>tablespoons butter, softened</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
