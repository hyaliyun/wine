Turn off the heat and add the remaining 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) of olive oil and the balsamic vinegar. In a large bowl, combine the warm wheatberries, sauteed onions, scallions, red bell pepper, carrot, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the pepper. Allow the salad to sit for at least 30 minutes for the wheatberries to absorb the sauce. Season, to taste, and serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 33731,&quot;Creme Brulee 4 cups heavy cream 6 large egg yolks<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1/2 cup turbinado sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bring the cream to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat. Whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar in a medium bowl until they are pale yellow and thickened. Whisk the warm cream into the egg mixture, a small amount at a time. Add the vanilla extract and whisk until mixed in. Pour the custard into six 8-ounce custard dishes. Put the custard dishes in a deep baking dish lined with a tea towel. Pour in boiling water so that it comes halfway up the sides of the custard dishes.

With your hands, squeeze out the excess milk. Discard the milk and add the soaked bread to a large mixing bowl with the meat, parsley, sage, garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Bring a pot of water to a boil and prepare a large bowl full of ice water. Add the cabbage leaves to the pot and blanch them in the boiling water just until they are slightly wilted, about 1 minute; drain them and immediately transfer the leaves to the ice water. When the leaves are cold, remove them from the water and pat them dry. With a small, sharp knife, cut the thick part of the stem from each cabbage leaf. Place a heaping 1/2 cup of the filling in the center of each cabbage leaf. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, overlapping them slightly, and then, starting at the stem end, roll up the leaf into a compact bundle. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat a large heatproof saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, onion, and garlic and saute until the vegetables are translucent.

Break down the turkey by removing the breasts while keeping the skin on. Remove the turkey legs and thighs and set aside. Sprinkle the turkey breasts on both sides with the salt and pepper. Heat a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, and add the butter. Melt the butter and cook, stirring frequently to it butter does not burn, until it starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Once the butter stops bubbling, add the turkey breasts skin-side down and turn the pan down to medium. Sear for about 5 minutes, then flip the breasts over and cook until golden brown. Add the whole garlic cloves and sage to the pan and baste a few times. Transfer the pan to the oven for 8 minutes. Flip the breasts back over to skin-side down and cook, basting, on the stovetop, about 4 minutes. Finish in the oven skin-side down until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 160 degrees F, another 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and baste, then remove from the pan. Let rest 4 to 5 minutes. (Leave the oven on.) For the turkey legs: Sprinkle the legs and thighs with the salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil to coat the bottom of the skillet. Add the legs and thighs and sear until golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side, then remove the legs and thighs and place in a pressure cooker. Remove half of the oil from the skillet and turn the heat down to medium. Add the garlic and onions to the skillet and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the garlic and onions to the pressure cooker. Add the wine to the skillet and deglaze, using a spatula or wooden spoon to get all the brown bits off the bottom of the skillet. Then, add the pan sauce to the pressure cooker along with the stock, sage and bay leaves. Seal the pressure cooker and cook according to the pressure cooker instructions on medium for 25 minutes. Remove the legs and thighs to a bowl. Remove the meat from the bones and shred. Set aside. Strain out the juice and set aside to make gravy. For the hash: Mix together the oil, salt, pepper, garlic, parsnips, carrots, onions and celery root in a bowl. Spread out on a sheet tray and bake until tender and starting to brown, 10 to 14 minutes. Meanwhile, brown the butter in a small pot over low heat. Toss the veggies and shredded turkey leg meat in the brown butter along with cider vinegar and sage. For the gravy: Bring your strained stock to a simmer in a medium saucepot. Melt the butter in a small pot and whisk in the flour and vinegar. Cook until deep brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk the roux into the stock and bring to a rolling boil, then boil for about 5 minutes.

Remove the chicken from the oil and drain on a paper towel lined plate.<br> Just before serving, turn the broiler to low. Scatter the remaining 1 cup grated cheese over the waffles and broil just until the cheese has melted, about 1 minute. Let cool slightly, then place a piece of chicken on top of a waffle square and secure with a toothpick.<br> Serve immediately with hot sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 33790,&quot;Citrus and Honey Cake 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature One 8-ounce block cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 4 to 6 cups confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/3 cup honey<br> 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1 cup buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup honey<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups white sugar<br> Zest from 1 1/2 oranges<br> 4 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 3 cups yellow coating chocolate disks 1 cup heavy cream<br> Pale yellow melting chocolate disks Nonstick cooking spray 2 oranges, sliced thin<br> 1/4 cup honey<br> Yellow and orange chocolate candy balls<br> Instructions: For the frosting: Beat the butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until combined. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and continue to mix, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the honey and mix until smooth. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and lightly flour three 8-inch round cake pans. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Mix together the buttermilk, honey and vanilla in a second medium bowl. Beat the butter and white sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the orange zest and then the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Gradually add the dry and wet ingredients, alternating, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to over mix. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 to 15 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to finish cooling. Place one cake onto a serving plate or cake stand and top with about 1 cup of honey cream cheese frosting. Repeat with the second cake, 1 cup more frosting and then the last cake. Crumb coat and frost the cake with the remaining frosting. Refrigerate until the frosting is set, about 20 minutes. For the chocolate ganache drip: Place the disks into a heat-resistant bowl (glass or metal). Warm the heavy cream in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it just starts to boil. (I always look for small bubbles forming around the edge and a soft boil starting in the middle.) When you see that it&#39;s just starting to boil, pour it into your bowl of disks and let sit for 1 minute. Whisk the ganache until it&#39;s uniform in consistency and there are no bits of the disks left on your whisk. Cool the ganache at room temperature for about 30 minutes (or until the ganache itself is room temperature). To decorate: Melt the pale yellow melting chocolate disks over a double boiler. Lightly grease a small sheet of bubble wrap with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the melted chocolate over the greased bubble wrap with an offset spatula to spread into an even and thin layer. Place into the refrigerator just to set, about 15 minutes. Gently pull the bubble wrap to remove the chocolate, then break it into large shards. Put the ganache in a squeeze bottle and drip it down the edge of the cake. Squeeze a small amount on top of the cake and spread to cover (or leave the top uncovered). Decorate the cake with orange slices that&#39;ve been brushed with honey, along with shards of \chocolate honey comb\ and yellow and orange candy balls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33791,&quot;Black Tie Pasta 1 tablespoon basil-infused olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/4 pound pancetta chunk, cut into 1/3-inch dice 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 small jar artichokes hearts in marinade, drained, coarsely chopped, marinade liquid reserved Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 pound black fettuccine pasta Instructions: Pour the oil in a medium skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking.

Mix the buttermilk and barbecue rub in a baking dish, add the pork, cover and let marinate overnight or up to 2 days. In a large deep saucepan, heat the peanut oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Take the pork out of the marinade and season with salt and pepper. Make a three-stage breading station with the flour, eggs and crouton crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Place the pork pieces first in the flour, turning to coat; shake off the excess. Dip the pork in the beaten egg and let the excess drip off, then dredge in the crouton crumbs, pressing until total coverage is achieved. Fry the pork in batches until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Let drain on a paper towel?lined baking sheet. Set aside. Make the aioli: Mix the mayonnaise, habanero sauce and granulated garlic in a small bowl. Season with salt. Build the sandwiches: Place the crispy pork on the toasted buns with some pickle slices, shredded lettuce and then a nice schmear of the aioli. Serve with extra aioli on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 33795,&quot;Broccoli and Green Beans 8 cups broccoli florets (about 1 1/2 pounds) 1/2 pound green beans 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, sliced thin 1/2 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes, plus more if desired Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil. Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Place broccoli into pot and cook for two minutes. You just want to parboil the broccoli at this point since you will saute it later on. Using a spider strainer, remove broccoli from pot and shock it in a bowl of ice water. When broccoli is completely cool, place it in a colander and allow to drain. Refresh the bowl of ice water. Bring the water back to a boil. Add green beans and cook for 4 minutes. Like the broccoli, you just want to parboil the green beans. Remove green beans from pot with spider strainer and add to ice water. When green beans are completely cool, add them to the colander and allow to drain. In a large saute pan, heat olive oil. When almost smoking, add the garlic and saute for about 45 seconds. When the garlic starts to brown, remove immediately and discard. Overcooking the garlic will impart a very bitter taste to the dish. Add the red pepper flakes, broccoli and green beans to the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 33796,&quot;Roasted Chicken with Grapefruit and Pink Peppercorns 2 (3-pound) chickens 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 1 carrot 1 onion 2 bunches celery 1 Bouquet Garni 3 yellow grapefruits 3 pink grapefruits 1/2 cup pan juices 1 tablespoon pink peppercorns Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Put raisins for creme anglaise recipe in brandy to soak. Spray nonstick 8-mini Bundt cake pan (Wilton mini Bundt 14 3/4 by 9 7/8-inches) with nonstick baking spray. In a medium bowl add oatmeal, and butter. Pour boiling water over, stir and allow to stand for 1 minute. In a stand mixer bowl beat eggs, sugar and brown sugar on high speed until creamy and light about 2 minutes. Add oatmeal mixture, flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla and mix on medium-high until creamy about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Lower speed to medium and mix in sour cream until blended. Turn off mixer and stir in berries by hand. Next using a ladle and a soup spoon to get all the batter, scoop batter into pans about 1/2 to almost 3/4 the way full making sure to have berries in each (this cake rises well so careful not to over fill). Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Make creme anglaise while cakes are baking. When done baking turn cakes out onto a large cooling rack that has been sprayed with nonstick spray. If you do not have a rack just turn out on the counter and use a spatula to pick up the cake when ready to plate. Spray a heavy bottom saucepan with nonstick spray and place over medium heat. Add half-and-half; watch closely and whisk. In a mixing bowl whisk together egg yolks, sugar and vanilla until it has a creamy texture, about 1 minute. Turn the heat up to medium-high and whisk the half-and-half constantly until it just starts to show steam coming off the top. Remove from heat and slowly temper the hot half-and-half to the egg mixture. Whisk well, return the mixture to the saucepan and place pan back on medium-high heat. While whisking constantly add cloves and cinnamon. Continue whisking until the anglaise just begins to boil then whisk even faster for about 30 to 40 seconds. You will know it is done if you place a wooden spoon in and the mixture sticks to it. Total cooking time is only about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and add brandy and drained soaked raisins and whisk well. Watch the pot keeping in mind the pot is still hot from the heat. Give it a little whisk so it does not burn if you have a few minutes before plating. (Cook&#39;s Note: for some reason if you overcook the anglaise and it begins to look like curdled milk, remove from heat immediately and pour into a heat temperature safe blender and slowly temper in, (add more) half-and-half and pulse or whip until it looks creamy. It will happen quickly, less than a minute.) In a 1 shot, shot glass place raisins and brandy and top float with Ever Clear alcohol for fire. You want to have at least 1/2-inch clear space from the top of the mixture to the rim of the glass. Eating of the raisins is optional. Assembly: Using a standard dessert plate take a squeeze bottle of premade raspberry or blackberry sauce and draw 3 to 4 lines on the plate. Place the hot or warm mini Bundt cake in the middle of a dessert plate. Spoon creme anglasie sauce over cake allowing some to get into the middle and running over the sides. Now carefully place the finished fire glass in the hole in the middle of the cake. Place a sprig of fresh mint, a few fresh berries (and disk or spoon on the side for putting out the flame) to garnish and repeat process to finish all 8 of the mini cakes. Carry cakes to the table and light the fire glass in front of your guests. This is a very easy and quick recipe sure to impress your guests. Even the novice of cooks will have no problem. The wild berry cake is packed with succulent berries and the spiced anglaise just complements it so well. This is also very good cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 33813,&quot;Grilled Red Curry Lamb Chops 3 tablespoons red curry paste 1/2 cup coconut milk<br> Juice and zest of 1 lime, plus lime wedges for serving<br> 12 lamb loin chops<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Flaky sea salt, for serving<br> Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling<br> Arugula, Fennel and Citrus Salad, recipe follows 4 cups loosely packed arugula 3 tablespoons chopped, toasted walnuts<br> 1 orange, peel cut away from the flesh and the segments cut free from their membranes, plus the juice squeezed from the hull Seeds from 1 pomegranate<br> 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced<br> 1 fennel bulb, thinly sliced, plus 1 tablespoon chopped fronds for garnish<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk the curry paste, coconut milk, lime juice and zest.

Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes. Since butter softens rapidly with handling, return the cubes to the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes while you set up the food processor and gather the dry ingredients. Place the flour, sugar, and kosher salt, in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse on/off a few times to combine. Add the butter, tossing quickly with a spatula to coat each cube with flour. This prevents the butter cubes from adhering together and helps them to break apart and combine more evenly with the flour. Pulse on and off 15 times until the butter particles are the size of small peas. With the motor running, add the ice water all at once through the feed tube. Process for about 10 seconds, stopping the machine before the dough becomes a solid mass. Turn the contents of the bowl onto a sheet of aluminum foil, pressing any loose particles into the mass of dough. Roughly form the dough into a 7-inch disk. Cover the dough completely with aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until ready to use. The dough may be refrigerated up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 weeks. Let dough rest in refrigerator until needed. For the Tart: Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll out each portion of dough on a floured surface into 9-inch free form circles, about 3/8-inch thick, and transfer to baking sheets. Cover and chill the dough while you prepare the filling. Mix the ricotta, egg yolks, tangerine peel, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Stir with a rubber spatula until well combined. Scatter the chopped dates over the surface of the tart shell leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around the outside edge. Spoon the filling over the dates and raise the dough border to enclose the sides of the tart. Press down on the dough where if forms pleats to secure. Bake the tart for 15 to 18 minutes, in preheated 450 degrees, until the crust is golden and the filling is just set. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 33835,&quot;Chicken-and-Cheese Enchiladas 1 small red onion, halved 1 1/2 pounds tomatillos, husked and rinsed 1 to 2 serrano cl peppers, stemmed and seeded 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth Kosher salt Pinch of sugar 8 corn tortillas 3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken 2 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella and/or Monterey Jack cheese 1/3 cup fresh cilantro 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing 3/4 cup crumbled queso fresco or feta cheese Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Slice half of the onion into thin rings and set aside. Place the other onion half, tomatillos and serranos on a foil-lined baking sheet and broil until the vegetables are soft and slightly brown, 7 to 10 minutes, turning as needed. Transfer the vegetables and any liquid to a blender, add the broth and puree. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and the sugar. Meanwhile, stack the tortillas, wrap in a damp paper towel and microwave just until warm and soft, 1 minute; keep covered. Toss the chicken with 2 cups shredded cheese in a bowl. Spoon a portion of the chicken mixture down the middle of each tortilla. Add a few cilantro leaves and roll up. Place the enchiladas side by side in a lightly oiled 9-by-13-inch baking dish and brush with the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Broil until crisp and golden, 3 minutes. Pour the tomatillo sauce over the enchiladas and top with the remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Return to the oven and broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Garnish with the onion rings, queso fresco and any remaining cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Barbera, GSM Blend]&quot; 33836,&quot;Apple-Cranberry Potato Chip Crisps 3 cups potato chips 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup chopped smoked almonds Pinch of kosher salt 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 5 Golden Delicious apples (about 21/4 pounds), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 1/2 cups cranberries, thawed if frozen 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch of kosher salt Instructions: Make the topping: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and steep on medium until the apples are mushy, about 25 minutes. Strain the contents of the pot using a fine-mesh sieve and a moist paper towel or cheesecloth. Do not press anything through the sieve. Allow to drip to about 2 cups of liquid. Discard the solids. Wipe the pot clean or rinse with water. Pour all but 1/4 cup of the liquid back into the pot and add the sugar. Cook on medium high until the sugar dissolves. Add the gelatin to the reserved 1/4 cup liquid and stir. Stir this into the pot and remove from the heat. Let cool until just warm. Coat the inside of four 8-ounce ridged party cups (or several shot glass-size party cups) with cooking spray (you may want to double the cups so you don&#39;t warp them). Once the liquid has cooled a bit, divide among the cups. Place on a tray and refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours. To unmold, dunk the sides of the cups in warm water and wiggle out the jelly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 33858,&quot;Pappardelle with Pulled Pork Kosher salt 1 pound pappardelle, or other wide ribbon pasta 1 to 1 1/2 pounds pulled braised pork 2 cups braising liquids 3 tablespoons butter, cut into pats Juice of 1 lemon Large bundle arugula, watercress, or spinach, washed and trimmed Freshly ground black pepper Grated nutmeg Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for garnish Instructions: A handful fresh flat-leaf parsley or celery greens, chopped, for garnish Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves together and set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk the brown sugar and oil together until combined. Add the pumpkin puree and whisk to combine thoroughly. Add the eggs and vanilla and whisk until combined. Sprinkle the flour mixture over the pumpkin mixture and whisk until completely combined. Use a medium ice cream scoop with a release mechanism to drop the dough onto prepared baking sheets, about one inch apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the cookies are just starting to crack on top and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool completely on the pan while you make the filling. For the Cream Cheese Filling: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a medium bowl and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat the butter until it&#39;s completely smooth, with no visible lumps. Add the cream cheese and beat until combined. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla and beat until smooth. Be careful not to overbeat the filling, or it will lose structure. (The filling can be made one day ahead. Cover the bowl tightly and put it in the refrigerator. Let the filling soften at room temperature before using.) Assembling the Whoopie Pies: Turn half of the cooled cookies upside down (flat side facing up). Use an ice cream scoop or a tablespoon to drop a large dollop of filling onto the flat side of the cookie. Place another cookie, flat side down, on top of the filling. Press down slightly so that the filling spreads to the edges of the cookie. Repeat until all the cookies are used. Put the whoopie pies in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to firm up before serving. The whoopie pies will keep for up to 3 days, on a parchment-lined baking sheet covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 33861,&quot;Chocolate Olive Oil Cake 2/3 cup regular olive oil, plus more for greasing 6 tablespoons good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted 1/2 cup boiling water 2 teaspoons best vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups almond meal (flour) or 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda pinch salt 1 cup superfine sugar 3 eggs 1 X 9-inch springform cake pan Instructions: Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. Grease your springform pan with a little oil and line the base with parchment paper. Measure and sift the cocoa powder into a bowl or pitcher and whisk in the boiling water until you have a smooth, chocolatey, still runny (but only just) paste. Whisk in the vanilla extract, then set aside to cool a little. In another smallish bowl, combine the almond meal (or all-purpose flour) with the baking soda and pinch of salt. Put the sugar, olive oil, and eggs into the bowl of a freestanding mixer with the paddle attachment (or other bowl and whisk arrangement of your choice) and beat together vigorously for about 3 minutes, until you have a pale-primrose, aerated, and thickened cream. Turn the speed down a little and pour in the cocoa mixture, beating as you go, and when all is scraped in, you can slowly tip in the almond meal (or all-purpose flour) mixture. Scrape down, and stir a little with a spatula, then pour this dark, liquid batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the sides are set and the very center, on top, still looks slightly damp. A cake tester should come up mainly clean but with a few sticky chocolate crumbs clinging to it. Let it cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack, still in its pan, and then ease the sides of the cake with a small metal spatula and spring it out of the pan. Leave to cool completely or eat while still warm with some ice cream, as a dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 33862,&quot;Keto Poached Salmon with Green Goddess Sauce 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 scallions, white and light green parts, chopped (about 1/4 cup) 1 clove garlic, minced (about 1 teaspoon) 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves 1/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill 1 oil-packed anchovy fillet Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Four 4-ounce wild salmon fillets, skins removed and reserved Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 sprigs fresh dill 1 lemon, thinly sliced 1 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: For the sauce: Combine the oil, scallions and garlic in a small unheated skillet. Turn the heat to low and cook undisturbed until the mixture begins to sizzle, about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat. Transfer the mixture to a small food processor. Add the parsley, sour cream, lemon juice, mayonnaise, tarragon, dill and anchovy and pulse to mix, then blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. For the salmon: Sprinkle the fish all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add the dill and lemon slices to a large skillet with high sides. Pour in the wine and 1 cup water, then bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and place the fish on top of the lemon and dill. Cover and poach until the fish is just cooked through and flakes easily when lightly pressed with a fork at its thickest part, depending on the thickness of the fish, 8 to 12 minutes.<br> Just before serving, warm the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pat the salmon skins dry with a clean towel, then add to the skillet and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Cook, turning with tongs, until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, 4 to 6 minutes.

In another bowl, combine the butter, parsley, rosemary, thyme and lemon zest. Set aside.<br> Lay the chicken breast-side down. Slice through the skin along the backbone of the chicken, cutting through the skin. Using your boning knife and fingers, release the skin from the chicken, angling the knife towards the meat of the chicken. Once you have loosened the skin from the back side, turn the chicken over so it is breast-side up and slice down the center of the breast. Using your boning knife and fingers, pull back the skin from each side. Once you get to the legs and wings, cut around each piece to release the skin from the joint. Take your time, this takes practice, and it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect, we just want as much skin as possible. Once you have removed the skin from each side of the chicken, set them aside.<br> Remove each breast from the chickens by taking your boning knife and following the breast bone down each side. Use the bones as your natural guide, follow it all the way down to remove the breast.<br> Once the breasts are removed, butterfly each breast by cutting into the thickest part of the breast horizontally, creating a pocket, like opening up a book. Once butterflied, place each breast in between 2 layers of plastic wrap and, using a meat mallet, pound until it is 1/4-inch thick.<br> Lay the chicken breasts flat and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Divide the herbed goat cheese stuffing between the 4 breasts, placing the stuffing mixture towards the bottom third of the breast, closest to its narrowest point.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage to the skillet and break into small pieces using a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sausage is browned, about 5 minutes. Drain the fat from the sausage and set aside to cool slightly. Put the shredded mozzarella in a large mixing bowl. Pour the green food coloring over the cheese and stir thoroughly to combine. Sprinkle a work surface with all-purpose flour. Stretch the pizza dough out into 2 long rectangles, each 18 inches long and 2 1/2 inches wide. Divide the pesto down the center of the dough rectangles lengthwise, leaving 2 inches of border on each end. Sprinkle the sausage on top of the pesto. Mound the green cheese over the sausage. Working from the long side of the rectangles, tuck both ends in. Wrap the long side of the dough over and around the cheese. Roll the logs like burritos and press the dough together to create a neat seam. Lay the dough logs onto the parchment-lined baking sheet seam-side down. Twist the logs to give the tentacles movement. Squeeze both ends of the logs to make them narrower and tapered. Whisk the egg whites with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Pour half of this mixture into a second small bowl. Add 3 drops of the violet food coloring and 5 drops of the super red food coloring to the first bowl to make dark maroon; stir to combine. Add 1 drop violet food coloring and 1 drop super red food coloring to the second bowl to make light maroon; stir to combine. Using the dark red egg wash, paint both sides of the tentacles, coming only halfway up the log with a pastry brush. Using the light red egg wash, paint the remainder of the tentacles with a second pastry brush. Dot the light red portion of the tentacles with the mini pepperoni slices to create suction cups along the top. Bake until the pepperoni slices and pizza dough are crisp, 18 to 20 minutes.

Slowly add the oil, drop by drop at first, until thickened. Season with salt and white pepper, to taste. Refrigerate until ready to use. For the paella: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the tomatoes in a small baking dish and drizzle with the honey, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and salt and pepper, and roast until soft. Set aside. Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan and add a large pinch of saffron. Put about 1/2 cup of the stock in another saucepan, add the clams, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook just until the clams open; remove the clams from the liquid and set aside, reserving the liquid. Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a very large skillet or paella pan over medium-high heat. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and add to the heated pan. Cook until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken pieces to a plate. Add the chorizo, onion and garlic and saute until chorizo has browned and the onions are translucent. Add the rice, about 7 1/2 cups of the chicken stock, the reserved clam liquid, and any juices from the chicken and bring to a simmer. Nestle the chicken in the rice and let cook, uncovered, until the rice is quite al dente, about 15 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer-the rice on the bottom of the pan should form a dark brown crispy crust by the end of the cooking time. If the stock is disappearing too quickly, just add a bit more of the remaining 2 cups. Add the mussels, shrimp, octopus, squid, and/or cuttlefish, and peas. Cook until the shrimp are pink and the mussels open. Add the lobster, clams and roasted tomatoes and heat briefly. At this point, you should still be able to see liquid bubbling gently; it will settle when you turn off the heat. Fold in the parsley and lemon aioli and mix until combined, season with salt and pepper, to taste. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs.

Add the butter and cream cheese and pulse until the mixture is very crumbly with pea-size pieces of butter. Add the egg and continue to pulse just until the dough begins to come together in a shaggy mass. Dump the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap, hold onto the edges and use the plastic to knead the dough gently into a mass. Pat it into a disc and wrap it tightly in the plastic. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Spray a 9-inch pie dish lightly with nonstick cooking spray.<br> Dust a sheet of parchment lightly with coconut flour. Place the chilled dough disc in the center of the parchment, dust the top lightly with more coconut flour and place a second sheet of parchment on top. Use a rolling pin to gently roll the dough into a round big enough to fit in the prepared pie dish. This is a very delicate dough that might crack or break; if this happens, press the cracks together. If the dough becomes too warm and unmanageable, place the entire piece of parchment on a baking sheet and refrigerate to chill before continuing to roll out.<br> Use the parchment to help you transfer the dough to the prepared pie dish. Again, the dough may crack and break at points. It&#39;s ok to press it back together with your fingers. Trim the edges and crimp as desired. Place the pie crust in the freezer for 30 minutes to 1 hour.\u202f\u202f<br> For the filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Beat together the pumpkin, cream, sweetener, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, salt and eggs in a large bowl with a hand mixer until well incorporated. \u202f<br> Transfer the frozen pie shell to a baking sheet and cover the edges of the crust loosely with foil. Pour the filling into the center and bake for 50 minutes. Gently remove the foil from the edges and continue to bake until the edges are a very deep golden brown and the filling is set a couple inches from the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center, 5 to 10 more minutes.\u202f Let cool completely (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> For the whipped cream: Just before serving, add the cream to a large bowl and beat with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form.

Remove the porcini and squeeze out excess water. Using scissors, cut them into pieces about the size of your thumbnail. Set aside. Strain the mushroom liquor through a paper towel or a fine sieve; reserve. Lightly oil an 8-by-11-inch baking pan and set it aside. Lightly oil two large pastry boards or baking sheets, or a very large scratchproof counter surface. Make the polenta and when it is cooked, turn it directly out onto the boards, counter, or baking sheets. Use a large knife or rubber spatula, first dipped in cold water, to spread out the polenta to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Allow it to cool and harden, about 20 minutes. Cut it into approximate 3-inch squares. Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 400 degrees F. Continue to make the sauce. Using a soft brush or clean kitchen towel, remove any dirt from the fresh mushrooms. Don&#39;t wash them because water will alter their texture. Separate the stems from the caps, discarding the stems if they are tough. Slice the mushroom caps and tender stems thinly. In a skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter with the oil. Add the onion and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the porcini and saute for another 5 or 6 minutes to marry the flavors. Add the cultivated mushrooms and continue to saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mushroom soaking liquid, salt, and pepper. Allow to simmer gently for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then stir in the cream, and allow the mixture barely to reach a simmer. Immediately remove the skillet from the heat. Place half of the polenta squares in a layer on the bottom of the prepared dish. Spread half of the sauce in a layer over them, then sprinkle with half of the cheeses. Place another layer of polenta squares over the cheeses. Spoon the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the remaining cheeses. Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and golden and the pasticcio is bubbling, about 20 minutes.

(Smash each for about 10 seconds.) Repeat until all the burgers are smashed. Cook for 2 minutes, then turn. Sprinkle the patties with a little more salt and pepper and smash again with the press. Cook until the patties are caramelized and browned, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add the cheese and let stand until melted. Remove the patties from the griddle. To assemble, spread the sauces on the tops and bottoms of the buns. Top with shredded lettuce, 2 meat patties, red onions, pickles and bacon, if using, and more sauce if you like it saucy.

Reduce the heat to medium. Cook, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife, 25 to 35 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Cool completely. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours and preferably overnight. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. In a very large (12-inch) nonstick skillet (if the skillet handle isn&#39;t heatproof, wrap it in a double thickness of aluminum foil), heat the butter over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook until tender, stirring often, about 4 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the salt and pepper. Season the leeks with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt-and-pepper mixture. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside. (The leeks can be prepared up to 1 day ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated.) Peel the potatoes and shred on the largest holds of a box grater. In the skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the goose fat over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking. Spread half of the potatoes in the skillet in a layer. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt-and-pepper mixture. Spread with the leeks, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Top with the remaining potatoes, and season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cook until the edges of the pancake are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Hold a flat round skillet top, plate, or pizza pan on top of the skillet. Inver the skillet and the skillet top together so the pancake falls, upside down, onto the skillet top. (If this seems too heavy to handle, slide the pancake carefully out of the skillet onto a plate. Place a second plate on top and invert.) Return the skillet to the stove and heat the remaining tablespoons goose fat until very hot. Slide the pancake back into the skillet, browned side up. Cook until the underside is browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn the pancake as before, and bake it until crisp, about 10 more minutes.

Remove from the heat and steep for 10 to 15 minutes. Bring the mixture back to a boil. Meanwhile, whisk the yolks and remaining sugar until light and pale. Gradually add the hot dairy mixture to the yolks, whisking constantly. Continue tempering until the dairy mixture (including the solids) is fully incorporated.<br> Dump the mixture back into the saucepan and cook, stirring constantly over medium heat, until thick and the mixture can coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl set over an ice bath and discard the solids. Stir frequently until mixture cools completely, about 1 hour. Cover and chill the ice cream base in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours. Process the chilled ice cream base in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Freeze the ice cream in the freezer until firm, at least 2 hours or up to overnight. For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a small baking sheet with plastic wrap. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter at medium speed until light and smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and continue to mix until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs and salt, and mix until incorporated. In a measuring cup, mix together the molasses and vinegar, then add to the mixer and mix at medium speed until incorporated. Add the candied ginger and fresh ginger and mix until fully incorporated, about 2 minutes. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, ground ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and allspice. With the mixer running on the lowest speed, add the dry ingredients, and mix until combined. Place the dough on the plastic-lined baking sheet, and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Chill the dough until firm, about 30 minutes. Scoop the cookie dough with a 2-tablespoon scoop. Roll half of the dough balls in granulated sugar and roll the other half in turbinado sugar. Place the dough balls on the parchment-lined baking sheet (about 48 cookies in total) and bake until the cookies are just set, 8 to 12 minutes. The cookies will crackle on top. Pull the cookies from the oven and firmly tap the baking sheet on a solid surface to deflate the cookies. Cool completely on the sheet tray. Scoop some ice cream and sandwich between a granulated-sugar-coated cookie and a turbinado-sugar-coated cookie. Repeat for the remaining cookies and ice cream.

Lightly oil and flour three 9 by 1 1/2-inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder. In another large bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla. Using a standing mixer, mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined and a smooth batter is formed. Divide the cake batter evenly among the prepared cake pans. Place the pans in the oven evenly spaced apart. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through the cooking, until the cake pulls away from the side of the pans, and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans. One at a time, invert the cakes onto a plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up. Let cool completely. Frost the cake. Place 1 layer, rounded-side down, in the middle of a rotating cake stand. Using a palette knife or offset spatula spread some of the Cream Cheese Frosting over the top of the cake. (Spread enough frosting to make a 1/4 to 1/2-inch layer.) Carefully set another layer on top, rounded-side down, and repeat. Top with the remaining layer and cover the entire cake with the remaining frosting. Sprinkle the top with the pecans. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-held electric mixer in a large bowl, mix the cream cheese, sugar, and butter on low speed until incorporated. Increase the speed to high, and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.) Reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Add the vanilla, raise the speed to high and mix briefly until fluffy (scrape down the bowl occasionally).

If it&#39;s not, add some or all of the sour cream. Stir most of the raisins and pistachios into the shrikhand; sprinkle the remainder on top. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour. Make the pooris: Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Rub 1 tablespoon vegetable oil into the flour; make a well in the center and gradually pour in 2/3 cup water. Mix with your hands until the dough forms a ball, then knead on a clean surface until smooth but still slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest, 30 minutes. Divide the dough in half; roll each portion into a 1/16-inch-thick round. Cut out about 20 circles using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Heat 2 inches vegetable oil in a large saucepan until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Line a colander with paper towels. Fry the pooris in batches until golden brown, 1 minute per side. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain in the colander. Serve the hot pooris with the cold shrikhand. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33984,&quot;Strawberry Daiquiri 5 ounces frozen strawberries 1/2 banana 1 (6-ounce) can frozen lemonade Coconut, banana or pineapple rum, optional 2 tablespoons powdered sugar About 12 (3 1/2 cups) ice cubes, or as needed Up to 1/2 cup fresh orange juice Fresh strawberries, for garnish, optional Instructions: In a blender, place the strawberries, banana, and frozen lemonade.

Heat the stock in a medium saucepan over low heat to simmering. Heat the olive oil in a medium straight-sided skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until it begins to soften but does not color, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and toss to coat in the oil. Add the white wine and cook until completely absorbed, about 2 minutes.<br> Ladle in enough stock to just cover the rice. Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering evenly. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is almost absorbed. Add the stock twice more in this manner (you may not use all of the stock) until the risotto is creamy and al dente, 16 to 18 minutes from the first addition of liquid. Off the heat, stir in the Parmesan and butter until smooth. Spread the mixture on the prepared baking sheet and let cool completely.<br> Once the risotto is cooled, scrape it into a large mixing bowl. Beat 1 egg and add to the bowl along with the fontina and prosciutto (separating any clumps of prosciutto with your fingers). Stir to combine. Line the baking sheet with a clean sheet of parchment. Scoop about 1/4 cup of the risotto into your hands and roll into a ball. Place on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining risotto, to get about 18 balls. Refrigerate until just firm, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat about 2 inches vegetable oil in a medium Dutch oven to 350 degrees F. Break the remaining 2 eggs into a shallow bowl and beat with a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of water. Spread the flour and breadcrumbs in 2 separate shallow bowls.<br> Dredge the balls in the flour, then the egg and finally the breadcrumbs, taking care to coat them completely. Return them to the baking sheet.<br> Fry the balls in 2 or 3 batches until deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per batch, letting the oil return to temperature before adding another batch. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Serve warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with Parmesan and chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 33986,&quot;Marmalade-Glazed Carrots With Candied Pecans 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons orange marmalade 2 pounds baby carrots (preferably rainbow), tops trimmed 3/4 cup fresh orange juice 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/3 cup chopped candied pecans Instructions: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Lightly score the skin side of the fillets several times to form a cross hatch pattern without cutting into the flesh of the fish. Season the portions of the blackfish with salt and a touch of lemon juice. Dredge the seasoned fish into the Parmesan/flour mixture. In a large heavy skillet over medium heat, add olive oil. Add fillets, skin side down. Cook until skin is crisp, about 4 minutes. Flip fish and cook until fish is just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the pan and place on absorbent towels to rest in a warm place for a moment, while the plate is being composed. To serve, remove the Silver Queen Corn Pudding from molds and place into large, shallow bowls. Over the warm pudding, place a portion of fish. Over the fish, spoon on the Saute of Crab and Baby Corn. Carefully pour a small ladle of Silver Queen Foam around the fish. With 2 demitasse spoons, form the caviar into quenelle or egg shapes and place over the fish next to the bed of corn and crab. Lightly garnish the fish with chives, chive blossoms, dill and chervil. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. In a 4 quart saucepan, bring cream and corn to a boil.

Chill for 1/2 hour or up to 3 days. Heat the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet. Season with salt, pepper and thyme and cook the onions over medium low heat until caramelized. Remove the onions from skillet and set aside in a bowl to cool. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the skillet and saute the potatoes, seasoned with salt and pepper, until about 3/4 cooked. Combine the potatoes with the onions, mix in 1/4 cup Parmesan and set aside to cool completely. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut the cylinder of dough in half and refrigerate one half. Press the piece of dough into a rectangle and then roll it, on a lightly floured surface, into a rectangle measuring about 17 x 8 inches. Brush off any excess flour and transfer the dough to an ungreased cookie sheet. Position it so that there is room for the second piece. Refrigerate the tray while you roll out the second piece of dough in the same way and place it on the cookie sheet. Using a serrated pastry wheel, trim the edges of the rectangles to even them. Cut a \v\ out of each corner to prevent the dough from bunching when it&#39;s folded. Spread half the potato/onion mixture on each, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border all around. Fold up the edges. Brush the dough with egg wash and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over the dough and filling. Bake about 40 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned.

Turn off the burner and allow liquid to cool to below 40 degrees F, either by waiting or by adding some ice to melt and cool it down. Once the liquid is cool, pour it over the brisket in a large container, cover with lid and place it in the fridge for at least 3 days and up to 1 week. Preheat a smoker for cooking over 225 degrees F. Remove the brisket from the brining liquid and rinse off any excess brine from the exterior. Pat the brisket dry and place it on a smoking rack. Mix together the fresh ground coriander seeds, black pepper, white sugar and granulated garlic, then liberally sprinkle both sides of the brisket with the spice mix. Let rest 1 hour. Place brisket fat-side up on a smoking tray and place in smoker. Add soaked and drained hickory wood chips and smoke until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 190 degrees F, about 12 hours. Allow the meat to cool completely, preferably overnight. Thinly slice against the grain. Preheat a convection oven to 450 degrees F. Layer slices of Swiss cheese on the rye bread and layer on a good portion of thinly sliced pastrami brisket. Toast the sandwich in the oven to heat the meat and melt the cheese, then finish with sauerkraut and Russian dressing. (Save remaining meat for another use.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34124,&quot;Battered Shrimp 1 (8-ounce) bottle beer (recommended: Heineken) 1 (2-ounce) \shot\ vodka (the cheaper the better) 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus a little extra, if needed 1 tablespoon paprika 1 clove garlic, peeled 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound \16/20\ size shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails attached Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 4 cups vegetable oil About 20 basil leaves, stemmed, washed and dried 1 lemon, thinly sliced Instructions: Pour the beer into a medium-size bowl and stir in the vodka. Slowly whisk in the flour and the paprika. The batter should be fairly thick, but also easy to stir. Set aside in a warm place. \Press\ the garlic clove into another bowl and stir in the olive oil and shrimp. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Set aside. Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot (or, alternatively, a deep-fryer). Heat the oil slowly to 370 F. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. Line a baking sheet with a kitchen towel or paper towels to drain the shrimp once they are cooked.<br> Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.<br> Arrange the basil leaves on a sheet pan. Put the pan in the oven for 2 minutes, just to wilt the basil a bit, if the basil is young and tender this step is not necessary. Wrap a basil leaf around the middle of each shrimp like a belt. When ready to serve, dip the shrimp into the batter and drop, in small batches, into the oil. Fry until crispy, turning on both sides with a slotted metal spoon. Add the lemons into the oil and fry until crispy. Drain them on the lined baking sheet and season immediately with salt. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 34125,&quot;Roasted Thanksgiving Turkey 1 whole fresh or frozen turkey that has not been injected with sodium solution (I use a 20-pound turkey) My Favorite Turkey Brine, recipe follows 2 sticks butter, at room temperature 3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary<br> 2 tablespoons orange zest, julienned<br> 2 gallons cold water 3 cups apple cider 2 cups packed brown sugar 3/4 cup kosher salt 3 tablespoons tricolor peppercorns 5 whole bay leaves 5 cloves garlic, minced 4 fresh rosemary sprigs, leaves stripped off Peel of 3 large oranges, cut into large strips Instructions: Remove the turkey from its packaging and remove the bags inside that hold the neck and giblets. Rinse them and put them in a plastic bag in the fridge; you&#39;ll need them for the gravy. Rinse the turkey thoroughly with cold water. Place the turkey into a large brining bag or pot. Pour in chilled My Favorite Turkey Brine and place in the fridge for 16 to 18 hours so the brine can work its magic. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. After the turkey has brined, remove it from the brining bag and rinse the turkey thoroughly again inside and out. Soak the turkey in cold water for 15 minutes, and then rinse again and pat dry. Truss the bird or tuck the legs and wings however you like. Then place the bird, breast-side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan. Cover the whole pan, tenting the bird, with heavy-duty foil so that it&#39;s well sealed. Place in the oven and roast the turkey for about 10 minutes per pound. (So for a 20-pound turkey, roast it for about 3 1/2 hours. For a 15-pound turkey, roast it for 2 1/2 hours.)* When it&#39;s time to remove the turkey from the oven, mix together the butter, rosemary and orange peel strips. Remove the turkey from the oven and increase the temperature to 375 degrees F. Remove the foil and set aside. (Put stuffing in the bird if you wish at this point.) Rub the butter mixture all over the skin of the turkey, getting in the crevices. Insert a meat thermometer into the thigh, near the hip joint. Place the turkey, uncovered, back into the oven. Continue roasting the turkey, basting/brushing with the juices from the pan every 30 minutes until the juices are no longer pink and the thermometer registers 165 degrees F. This could take another 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, depending on the size of the bird. Remove the turkey from the oven and cover lightly with foil until you are ready to carve. Combine water with the apple cider, brown sugar, salt, peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic, rosemary and orange peels in a large pot. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolve. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and cover. Allow the brine to cool completely, then place into the fridge to chill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 34126,&quot;Lumpia 2 cloves garlic, crushed or pressed 2 stalks green onion, finely chopped<br> 1/4 large yellow onion, finely chopped<br> 3 ounces shiitake mushroom caps, finely chopped (about 4 caps, stems removed)<br> 4 ounces sliced water chestnuts, finely chopped<br> 1 pound (26- to 30-count) shrimp, peeled and deveined<br> 1/2 pound ground pork<br> 2 teaspoons soy sauce<br> 1 teaspoon Thai fish sauce or patis<br> 1 teaspoon brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper (white or black)<br> 2 quarts neutral frying oil<br> 30 lumpia or spring roll pastry wrappers, thawed<br> 1 large egg, beaten<br> 1/4 cup sweet cl sauce<br> 1 tablespoon cane or distilled white vinegar, or more to taste<br> Instructions: In a food processor, chop the garlic as small as possible. Add the green onion and yellow onion and pulse to a similar size as the garlic. Add and pulse the shiitake mushroom caps and water chestnuts until all are a similar size. Add the shrimp and pulse until the shrimp are a coarse hamburger grind. Add the ground pork, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar and pepper and mix all thoroughly. Transfer to a bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat 1 inch frying oil to 350 to 360 degrees F in a heavy-bottomed pot. Carefully peel one wrapper off the stack. Orient the wrapper square to the edge of the counter, not diagonal. Scoop about a heaping tablespoon (approximately 1 ounce) of the filling and spread it about an inch from the edge closest to you and about 1/2 inch from each side. Brush all of the edges with the egg wash. Fold the edges in on the sides and begin rolling the bottom of the wrapper to the top, making a tight rope. Make sure when you finish rolling that the egg wash has sealed the roll. Place the lumpia seam-side down on a plate while you make the remaining lumpia. (This amount of filling should make approximately 30 rolls. (These could be made smaller for appetizers.) Fry in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove to drain on a rack or paper towels. Serve hot with sweet cl sauce mixed with vinegar to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 34127,&quot;Caprese Tartlets 8 slices white bread 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon dried basil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced 4 ounces fresh mozzarella (approximately 2-inch ball), thinly sliced Balsamic vinegar, for drizzling, optional 8 fresh basil leaves, chiffonade Special Equipment: Muffin tin Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the crusts from the bread and using a large spoon or rolling pin, gently press the slices of bread down flat until they are thin and almost doughy. Brush both sides of the bread with olive oil. Press the slices in the muffin tin, to form tartlet shells. Set aside. In a small bowl, using a fork to combine, mix together the cream cheese, garlic powder, dried basil, salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy. Drop about a teaspoon of the cream cheese into the bottom of each muffin tin. Bake the tartlets until golden and crusty, 12 to 13 minutes. Meanwhile, liberally salt the tomato slices. Once the tartlet shells are golden, remove them from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Place a slice of mozzarella on top of the cream cheese, then layer on a tomato slice or two. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste and a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, if using. Garnish with basil chiffonade. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 34128,&quot;Umekes Luau Oysters 2 pounds taro leaves, sliced 2 sticks salted butter<br> 6 cloves garlic, chopped fine<br> 1 cup coconut milk<br> Half dozen raw oysters, shucked on the half shell 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> Instructions: Boil taro leaves in a saucepan with 4 quarts water for about an hour. Taste to check if the leaves make your mouth itchy. If it does, you need to cook down the leaves down longer. If not, put the leaves in a strainer and press out the water. Set aside. In a pot, add butter, garlic and taro leaves and cook down, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add coconut milk and mix well. Preheat a salamander or broiler to 375 degrees F.

Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray or butter. In a small bowl, mix together 4 tablespoons wheat bran and 2 tablespoons soy flour and sprinkle it evenly over each of the 12 cups of the muffin pan. In a larger bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients until completely blended. Fill each muffin cup only 2/3 of the way with the mix, leaving room for them to rise, and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until tops start to brown. The muffins are done when lightly browned and a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Remove and let cool before taking out of the pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 34135,&quot;Thai Beef with Peppers 1 package pad Thai rice noodles or linguine 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce<br> 3 tablespoons sherry<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger<br> 1 teaspoon red chili paste or a few dashes red chili oil 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 lime, halved 1 pound flank steak, sliced very thin against the grain<br> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 1 medium yellow onion, sliced<br> 1 red bell pepper, cored and sliced into rings<br> 1 tablespoon diced fresh jalapeno or 1 teaspoon diced hot pepper Fresh basil leaves, for garnish Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: Cook the noodles according to the package directions. In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, sherry, cornstarch, brown sugar, ginger, chili paste, garlic and the juice of half the lime. Pour a third of the marinade into a bowl with the sliced beef and toss to coat. Reserve the rest of the marinade for later. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high to high heat. When it is very hot, throw in the onions and cook for a minute or so. Add the bell peppers and jalapenos. Cook for a minute, tossing until the peppers have brown/black bits but are still firm. Remove the vegetables to a plate. Into the hot skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the meat mixture, evenly distributing it over the surface of the skillet. Allow to sit for 45 seconds, then turn with tongs. Cook for another 30 seconds, then add the onions and peppers back into the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Pour in the remaining marinade and stir. Allow to simmer on low for a few minutes; the sauce will slowly thicken. Turn off the heat. Drain the noodles, then add half of them to the stir-fry. Toss and add more noodles as desired. Stir in some very hot water if needed to thin the sauce. Top with basil and cilantro leaves and serve immediately with a squeeze of the remaining lime half. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 34136,&quot;French Onion Soup With Braised Short Ribs 2 pounds bone-in beef short ribs 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 carrot, chopped 1 medium yellow onion, chopped 1 leek, chopped 4 sprigs thyme, plus 1 tablespoon thyme leaves 1 bay leaf 1 head garlic, halved crosswise 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 cup dry red wine 6 cups low-sodium beef stock 1 stick unsalted butter 6 Spanish onions, thinly sliced 3/4 cup dry sherry 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 12 slices sourdough bread, toasted 12 slices high-quality gruyere cheese (about 6 ounces) Chopped fresh chives, for topping Instructions: Braise the short ribs: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Toss the short ribs with the flour and season liberally with salt and pepper. Heat the canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the short ribs and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate.<br> Add the carrot, chopped onion and leek to the pot and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Return the short ribs to the pot and stir in the thyme sprigs, bay leaf, garlic and tomato paste. Add the wine and bring to a simmer, then cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and return to a simmer. Cover, transfer to the oven and braise until the short ribs are falling off the bone, 2 hours, 30 minutes to 3 hours.<br> Meanwhile, caramelize the onions: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sliced onions, reduce the heat to low and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until deep golden brown, about 2 hours, 30 minutes. (Add a splash of water and scrape up any browned bits from the pot, if necessary.)<br> When the short ribs are done, remove from the broth with a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate and let cool slightly. Strain the broth, discarding the solids. Shred the meat, discarding the bones, and toss with 1 cup of the broth. Reserve the remaining broth.<br> Add the thyme leaves and sherry to the caramelized onions. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes; add the reserved broth and cook 30 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Skim the fat from the top of the soup. Stir in the vinegar.<br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Divide the soup among 6 ovenproof bowls; spoon about 1/3 cup shredded meat into the center of each, then top each with 2 slices toast, trimming the bread if necessary. Top each with 2 slices cheese, letting the cheese hang over the side of the bowl. Transfer to the oven and bake until golden and bubbly, about 10 minutes. Top with chives.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 34137,&quot;Strawberry Tart 1 1/2 sticks cold butter, cut into pea-size pieces 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting 3/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted Pinch kosher salt 1 egg yolk 3 to 4 tablespoons ice water 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup sugar 1 vanilla bean, scraped 4 eggs 1/3 cup cornstarch 1/2 cup milk 1 quart fresh strawberries, topped and sliced Powdered sugar, for garnish Instructions: Special Equipment: 1 pound dried beans, 10-inch tart pan For the crust: In the food processor combine the butter flour, almonds and salt and pulse, pulse, pulse until it looks like grated cheese, as I like to call the Parmigiano stage. Add the egg yolk and half the water and pulse; the dough should start to come together. If it does not, add the remaining water and pulse until the dough forms into a ball. Dump the \doughball\ onto a floured work surface and using the heel of your hand, \schmear\ it across the work surface. Repeat this process 1 to 2 more times, then form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 to 45 minutes. *TIP- this can be done up to a week in advance or frozen for a longer time. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. To roll the crust: Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 10 minutes before rolling to let it soften. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough to 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Lay the dough in the tart pan. Make a small \doughball\ with a little of the dough that is hanging over the edge of the tart pan. Dip the dough ball in flour and use is to carefully push the dough into the corners of the tart pan. Once the dough has been pushed into the corners of the tart pan, use the rolling pin to roll over the top edge of the tart pan to cut a clean crisp edge. Line the tart with aluminum foil, be sure to push it into the corners. This will keep the sides of the tart tall and straight and able to hold the filling. Fill the tart with the dried beans. Place in the preheated oven for 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the beans and foil and bake for another 4 to 5 minutes. The dough should be cooked through and lightly browned. Remove from the oven and cool. For the pastry cream: Place the heavy cream, 1/2 cup of the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds and pod in a saucepan. Whisk to combine and bring to a boil over low heat. While the cream is coming to a boil, combine the eggs and remaining 1/2 cup of sugar in a bowl and the cornstarch and milk in another bowl. Beat with a whisk to a homogeneous mixture, no big lumps of egg white! When the cream comes to a boil, remove it from the heat and discard the vanilla bean pod. *Whisk half of the cream into the egg/sugar mixture and then IMMEDIATELY whisk it back into the pan with the hot cream. *This is called tempering and will allow you to combine boiling cream and eggs without making scrambled eggs. Return the pan to a medium heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch/milk mixture. Bring this to a boil to thicken the pastry cream. Stir frequently to prevent scorching. It is necessary to bring this mixture to a boil to cook the starch. If the mixture is not brought to a boil the mixture will feel starchy and gritty. The desired outcome is the consistency of vanilla pudding. YUM! Transfer the mixture to a bowl and chill. This can be done really quickly over an ice bath. To assemble the tart: Fill the tart shell with the chilled pastry cream. Top with the sliced strawberries. You can arrange the strawberries in circles or in lines; it&#39;s up to you! Just make it look pretty. Sprinkle with powdered sugar just before serving. Berry delicious! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34138,&quot;Corn Masa Pockets with Classic Shredded Beef: Gorditas con Carne Deshebrada 1 1/4 pounds boneless beef chuck steak, cut into 4 pieces 3 small white onions, diced 4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus oil to a depth of 1/2-inch for frying 1 (28-ounce) can good-quality whole tomatoes in juice, drained and chopped or 2 cups chopped ripe tomatoes 2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalapenos, stemmed, seeded and very finely chopped Salt 1 pound (2 cups) fresh, smooth-ground corn masa for tortillas or 1 3/4 cups powdered masa harina mixed with 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 scant teaspoon baking power About 1/3 cup grated Mexican queso anejo or other dry grating cheese, such as Romano or Parmesan About 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish Instructions: The Shredded beef filling: In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, combine the meat with 2 quarts salted water, about 1/3 of the onions, and half of the garlic and simmer until the meat is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Strain, reserving the broth for another use. When the meat is cool enough to handle, shred it into coarse strands with your fingers or 2 forks--don&#39;t worry that there are bits of onion and garlic mixed with the meat. Wash and dry the saucepan, set it over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil is hot, add half of the remaining onions and cook until golden, about 6 minutes, then stir in the remaining garlic and cook for another minute. Add the tomatoes and chiles and cook until most of the juice has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in the shredded meat and simmer for a few more minutes, then taste and season with about 1/2 teaspoon salt. Remove from the heat and set aside. Forming, filling, and griddle-baking the gorditas: Heat a well-seasoned or nonstick griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat. Knead the masa (fresh or reconstituted) to make it pliable, adding a little water if necessary to achieve a soft-cookie-dough consistency. Knead in the flour, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll into balls; cover with plastic to keep from drying out. Line a tortilla press with 2 pieces of plastic cut to fit the plates (to be on the safe side, cut them from a food storage bag; the thicker plastic usually works better for beginners). Gently press out a ball of dough between the sheets of plastic to about 4 inches in diameter (it&#39;ll be about 1/4 inch thick). You&#39;ve now made a gordita, which is what you call a fat tortilla. Peel off the top sheet of plastic, flip the gordita, uncovered side down, onto the fingers of 1 hand, and gently peel off the second piece of plastic. In one flowing movement, roll the gordita off your hand and onto the heated griddle or skillet. Bake for about 1 1/2 minutes, then flip and bake for another 1 1/2 minutes on the other side. The gordita will be lightly browned and crusty on the top and bottom, but still a little uncooked on the sides. Remove to a plate. Continue pressing and griddle-baking the remaining gorditas in the same manner. Finishing the gorditas: When you&#39;re ready to serve, warm the shredded beef. Rinse the remaining onions in a small strainer under cold water and shake to remove the excess moisture. Have the cheese and cilantro at the ready. In a deep heavy medium skillet or saucepan, heat 1/2-inch of oil over medium to medium-high until the oil is hot enough to make the edge of a gordita sizzle sharply, about 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. One by one, fry the gorditas, turning them after they&#39;ve been in the oil for about 15 seconds, until they&#39;re nicely crisp but not hard, about 45 seconds total. When they&#39;re ready, most will have puffed up a little, like pita bread. Drain on paper towels. Once they all are fried, use a small knife to cut a slit in the thin edge of each one about halfway around its circumference, opening a pocket. As you cut them, fill each gordita with about 1/4-cup shredded meat and a sprinkling of the onions, grated cheese, and cilantro. Line up the filled gorditas on a serving platter and pass them around (with plenty of napkins) for your guest to enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 34139,&quot;Gina&#39;s Crusty Cornbread 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups finely ground yellow cornmeal 2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons salt 2 1/4 cups milk 2 large eggs 6 tablespoons butter, melted and slightly cooled 2 tablespoons rendered bacon fat, butter, shortening or vegetable oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Remove the meat and set aside.<br> Add the tomatoes along with the juices from the cans. Lower the heat and slowly cook the tomatoes, breaking up into small pieces using a large spoon. Continue to cut the large pieces as the tomatoes cook; cutting them will become easier. Peel the garlic and remove the ends. Crush with the blade of a large chef&#39;s knife and drop into the sauce. Don&#39;t worry about the garlic pieces being too large; they, too, will break down as they cook. Return the meat to the sauce and continue cooking until the sauce has a chunky, but uniform consistency, 2 to 3 hours.<br> Add the tomato paste, 1/2 can at a time, to somewhat thicken the sauce. Simmer until desired consistency, and then stir in the basil and cook for another few minutes before serving over hot pasta (any shape will do!). This is a fresh, but hearty sauce, and every serving should have a small piece of meat served on the plate. Garnish with your favorite grated cheese and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 34141,&quot;Chocolate Doughnuts 1/2-ounce dry yeast (2 (1/4-ounce) packages) 1/3 cup warm water 1/4 cup sugar 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cake flour 1/4 cup cocoa powder 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 cup hot water 3 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted 1/4 cup powdered sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 6 ounce baking potato, like russets, cooked, peeled and riced Chocolate glaze, recipe follows Canola oil, for frying 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1/2 cup cream Instructions: In a bowl, combine yeast, warm water and sugar to dissolve.

Add the potatoes to a large pot of heavily salted water (about 1/4 cup salt) and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until a fork slides easily into a potato, about 15 minutes. Drain. Generously oil a baking sheet with about 1/4 cup oil, making sure to cover the whole sheet. Arrange the potatoes on the baking sheet and gently smoosh them with a potato masher or cup -- not so much that it breaks the bottom skin or crumbles the potatoes, just enough to break open the top. Drizzle each potato with olive oil or a tablespoon of melted butter, if you prefer. Season generously with salt and pepper. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve with roasted garlic aioli or a bit of sour cream and fresh herbs. Combine the egg yolks, roasted garlic, lemon juice, mustard, paprika and salt in a blender. Blend on high to emulsify. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil; the mixture will lighten and become thick and smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.

Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and allow the liquid to cool for a few minutes (dropping shrimp in hot, but not boiling, water yields more tender shrimp). Prepare and clean the shrimp by running a small, sharp knife down the length of the shrimps and removing the dark vein. Add the shrimp to the poaching liquid and allow them to sit and steep in the liquid, off the heat. (Cooking the shrimp in the shell yields more flavor.) Leave for about 5 minutes until they are cooked through and completely pink. Use a slotted spoon, or spider, and remove the shrimp and drain well. Refrigerate until cool, and then peel and discard the shells before serving with the salad. For the dressing: Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, basil, parsley, green onions, lemon juice, anchovy paste and garlic in a food processor and puree. Thin with water as required, using only 2 tablespoons at a time. Taste and season with salt and pepper. For the salad: Wash the lettuces and roughly chop the romaine hearts. Tear the Bibb lettuce leaves into bite-size pieces. Cut the cucumber lengthwise down the middle, and then slice in 1/4-inch slices on the bias. Toss the salad ingredients together with the shaved red onion, pepperoncinis, green onions, bell peppers and cucumber. Top with the shrimp. Dress lightly with the dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 34173,&quot;Pie Crust 3 ounces (6 tablespoons) butter, chilled 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) lard, chilled 6 ounces (approximately 1 cup) all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling dough 1/2 teaspoon table salt 1/4 cup ice water, in spritz bottle Approximately 32 ounces of dried beans, for blind baking Instructions: Place butter and lard in freezer for 15 minutes.

(Alternately, you can use 1 large 9-inch round by 2 1/2-inch tall metal dessert ring). Cut 12 circles from the Chocolate Butter Sheet Cake and put 1 in the bottom of each metal ring. Using a pastry brush, moisten each cake with Raspberry Simple Syrup. Arrange 3 or 4 fresh raspberries inside the rings on top of the cake circles. Melt the chocolate and 7-ounces of the butter in the top of a double boiler, over gently boiling water; upper pan should not touch water. Remove from the double boiler but keep the mixture warm and liquid. Whip the cream until it comes to soft peaks that hold their shape. Refrigerate until needed. Whisk the remaining 2 ounces of butter with the eggs, sugar, and raspberry liqueur in a medium bowl. Place over gently boiling water; the bowl should not touch water. Cook, whisking constantly, for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture reaches 160 degrees on a thermometer. Immediately remove from the heat and with an electric mixer, whip at high speed for about 5 minutes, until cool to touch. Whisk the egg mixture into the melted chocolate and butter. Fold in the whipped cream, mixing until no streaks of white remain. Using a pastry bag or a large spoon, fill the prepared metal rings with the chocolate mousse, covering the raspberries. With a flat knife, scrape the mousse to make it level with tops of the rings. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours, until firm. To remove from mold, warm the sides of the rings by wrapping briefly with a hot towel, or use propane torch to heat sides so they release. Wrap a chocolate band around each torte, if desired. You can also decorate by arranging fresh raspberries, chocolate truffles, chocolate shards or chocolate leaves on top. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Brush the sides of a 12 by 16-inch sheet pan with melted butter or cooking spray, and dust lightly with flour with cooking spray. Line the bottom with a rectangle of parchment or waxed paper. Cream the butter in a bowl, using an electric mixer until it is very light and aerated. Add the egg yolks, a few at a time, stopping to scrape the bowl in between additions. Add the melted chocolate, scraping the bowl again, beating until the chocolate is incorporated. Whip the egg whites and cream of tartar in a clean bowl, using an electric mixer. When they are frothy, gradually add the sugar, whipping until soft peaks form. Fold the whites into the yolk mixture. Sift the flour onto the batter and gently fold it in. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is just set and a light crust has formed on the top. Cool. Heat the sugar and water in a small saucepan, gently swirling the pan until the sugar dissolves. Cook just until the syrup is clear: do not boil. Stir in raspberry sauce and the liqueur, if using. In a blender or a food processor, puree the raspberries with the sugar, lemon juice, and liqueur. Strain through a fine sieve to remove the seeds.

For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. If using gas, add soaked wood chips for additional smoky flavor (be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results). If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling. Put the apples, vanilla, 1/3 cup of the sugar, 2 tablespoons of the butter and a pinch of salt in a large bowl and toss to combine. Transfer to a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Set aside. Combine the flour, baking powder, the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, and a pinch of salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter and pulse until the butter pieces are no larger than peas. Add the buttermilk and pulse until the dough just starts to come together in a ball.<br> Drop rounded tablespoons of the dough all over the apples. Sprinkle generously with sugar. Transfer the skillet to the direct heat side of the grill, cover the grill and cook, rotating the skillet halfway through, until the apples on the sides of the pan are bubbling and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Move the skillet to the indirect side of the grill, cover the grill and cook until the dough is cooked through and golden on top, about 15 minutes more.<br> Remove the skillet from the grill and let cool for 10 minutes. Serve the cobbler topped with ice cream and caramel sauce.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34181,&quot;Quick Chocolate Chip Cookies 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup light brown sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 large egg 2 1/2 cups baking mix One 12-ounce bag dark chocolate chips 1/2 cup chopped pecans Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Remove from the heat and allow to cool to lukewarm. (You can also do this in a measuring cup in the microwave.) Combine the flour, granulated sugar, instant yeast, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook and whisk to combine. Add the milk mixture and eggs, then mix with the dough hook until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky, 7 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, this can be mixed in a large bowl and turned onto a work surface to knead by hand.) Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the brown sugar filling and caramel. For the brown sugar filling: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and orange zest and rub together with your fingers until everything is evenly combined. Set aside. For the tahini caramel: In a 3 1/2-quart enameled braiser over low heat, add the brown sugar, milk, tahini, butter and salt. Whisk to combine. Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil. Allow the caramel to boil until it begins to darken in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the vanilla. Allow to cool until it is just warm to the touch. (Alternatively, the caramel can be prepared in a small saucepan and transferred to a greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish.) For the assembly: Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll out into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Schmear the softened butter evenly over the entire surface of the dough with a 1/2-inch border at the top only, then sprinkle over an even layer of the brown sugar filling mixture. Roll up the dough (the long way) into a tight roll and pinch to seal. Slice into 12 even pieces and space evenly in the pan with the cooled caramel. At this point you can cover and refrigerate overnight or cover with plastic and proof at room temperature until puffed up and doubled, about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. (If refrigerated overnight, remove from the refrigerator and allow to proof at room temperature until puffed up and almost doubled in volume, about 2 hours.) Place an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake until rolls are golden (begin checking at 38 minutes). Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes, but not completely. Carefully invert the rolls onto a serving dish and garnish with sesame seeds and flaky salt. Eat while warm. The caramel rolls will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 34199,&quot;Linguine with Peas, Shiitake Mushrooms and Sage with Mixed Sauteed Vegetables 1-ounce dried porcini mushrooms 1 pound linguine 4 teaspoons olive oil, divided 2 leeks, chopped 2 cups sliced shiitake mushrooms 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves or 1 teaspoon dried 1 cup frozen green peas 1 cup reduced-sodium vegetable broth 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces Asiago or Romano Instructions: Soak porcini mushrooms in 1 cup hot water for 15 minutes.

Make a small hole in the extra skin on the legs and poke the end of the drumstick through to form a perfect package. Toss the chicken generously with olive oil and salt, to taste. Arrange the chicken on a sheet tray or baking dish lined with parchment or silpat. Roast the chicken until it is about 3/4 of the way done, about 20 to 25 minutes. The skin should start to brown and crisp. While the chicken is roasting, combine the maple syrup and cayenne in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the syrup is reduced by about 1/2 to 3/4 or until the syrup is very thick and syrupy. After the chicken has roasted for 20 to 25 minutes, brush each piece of chicken generously with the reduced syrup. Continue to roast for another 10 to 12 minutes, brushing the skin with the syrup 1 or 2 more times while cooking. The skin should start to become very dark and sticky. If the skin starts to get too dark, cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and let rest about 10 minutes before serving.

Pour about half a cup of the boiling water into the plunger pot and a splash into each of the coffee mugs to heat them. This step is essential to avoid lukewarm coffee. Grind beans. Conventional plunger wisdom calls for a coarse grind in order to keep the beans from escaping through the mesh screen. However, if you like your coffee thick and velvety, use a fine (i.e., espresso) grind. If you are using pre-ground beans, buy them in quantities that will be consumed within a week. Spoon ground coffee into plunger pot. (If you are half-asleep, double-check that you have dumped out the warming water.) Add 4 cups of hot water and insert the plunger just far enough so that it acts as a lid. Let the coffee steep for 3 to 4 minutes, then press plunger down very slowly and steadily. Allow another minute for the coffee sediment to settle to the bottom. Hold the French press up to the sun before serving and pay homage to the coffee gods. If any hint of sunlight shines through the coffee, pour it out and start all over again. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 34218,&quot;Grilled Flatbread with Zatar and Yogurt Sauce 2/3 ounces wet yeast 5 cups warm water 3 pounds 6 ounces flour 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup minced shallots 1/4 cup sumac 3/4 cup toasted sesame seeds 1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley leaves 1/2 bunch chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 quart goat yogurt, drained in cheesecloth for at least 4 hours or overnight, refrigerated 1 tablespoon toasted, ground cumin seeds 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic 1/4 cup chopped mint leaves 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves 1/6 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper Instructions: Mix yeast with water.

Cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Put the cranberries in a large bowl and pour the sugar syrup over them; let sit 1 hour. Whisk the remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar with the cardamom in a large bowl. Drain the cranberries, add to the spiced sugar and toss to coat. Spread the cranberries and sugar on a rimmed baking sheet. Let sit, rerolling the cranberries in the sugar occasionally until dry, 2 to 3 hours. Meanwhile, make the cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Coat the parchment with cooking spray. Whisk the all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, allspice and cardamom in a large bowl; set aside. Put the cocoa powder in a separate large bowl. Heat 1 cup water in a small saucepan until almost simmering; pour over the cocoa powder and whisk until smooth. Set aside until slightly cooled, about 10 minutes. Add the eggs to the cocoa mixture and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until just combined. Add the granulated sugar, buttermilk, vegetable oil and vanilla; beat until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low; gradually add the flour mixture, then increase the speed to medium and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Divide the batter evenly between the cake pans; lightly tap on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then invert the cakes onto the rack to cool completely. Remove the parchment. (The cake layers can be made 1 day ahead; let cool, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap.) Make the frosting: Beat the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until just combined. Add the vanilla and almond extracts; increase the mixer speed to high and beat, scraping down the side of the bowl, until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the milk and almond liqueur; beat until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 more minutes. Halve 1/2 cup of the sugared cranberries. Place one cake layer on a plate or cake stand. Spread with 1 cup frosting, then sprinkle with the halved cranberries. Top with the second cake layer. Cover the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Top with the remaining sugared cranberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 34224,&quot;Mint Julep Jelly Shots One 1/4-ounce packet unflavored gelatin 1/2 cup packed fresh mint leaves, plus 16 pretty medium-sized leaves for garnish 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup bourbon 1/2 cup very cold heavy cream 1 1/2 teaspoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon mint-flavored liqueur, such as creme de menthe Instructions: Put a medium bowl in the freezer to chill. Sprinkle the gelatin evenly over 1 cup cold water in a medium saucepan. Let sit until the gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Stir the mixture, and add the mint leaves and granulated sugar. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring gently, until the sugar and gelatin are dissolved completely, about 5 minutes (don&#39;t let the mixture come to a boil). Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl placed over an ice bath, pressing the mint with the back of a spoon to extract all the juices. Stir in the bourbon, and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until the gelatin begins to thicken, about 15 minutes. Place sixteen 1-ounce disposable plastic or paper cups on a small rimmed sheet pan. Put 1 medium mint leaf into each glass. Divide the gelatin mixture evenly among the glasses, totally submerging the mint leaves (they will float to the top). Refrigerate the shots until completely set, about 3 hours. (These can be done a day ahead.) Pour the cream and confectioners&#39; sugar into the chilled bowl. Beat the mixture with a large whisk until medium peaks form. Gently fold in the liqueur with a rubber spatula. (This step can be done a day ahead; refrigerate the whipped cream in an airtight container.) Serve the shots cold, topped with whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Bourbon, Brandy, Port, Sherry]&quot; 34225,&quot;Thompson&#39;s Turkey 18 to 22 pound turkey, giblets and fat removed and reserved, rinsed and patted dry Oil to taste Salt Freshly ground black pepper to taste Giblets (neck, liver and heart) 4 cups water 1 bay leaf 1 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 1 clove garlic Salt to taste 1 apple, peeled, cored and diced 1 orange, peeled and diced 20-ounce can crushed pineapple Grated rind of 1/2 lemon 10-ounce can water chestnuts, drained 3 tablespoons chopped preserved ginger 2 teaspoons Colman&#39;s mustard 2 teaspoons caraway seed 1 tablespoon celery seed 2 teaspoons poppy seed 2 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano leaves 1 large bay leaf, crushed 1 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 teaspoon mace 1/4 cup minced parsley 4 cloves garlic, minced 4 cloves, minus the heads, well chopped 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 4 large onions, medium chopped 6 celery stalks, medium chopped 1 tablespoon minced fresh marjoram leaves 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh savory, preferably summer 1 tablespoon each minced fresh thyme and sage leaves 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 pounds fresh bread crumbs 3/4 pound ground veal 1/4 pound ground fresh pork 1/4 pound butter Instructions: Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. or as high as it will go -- for at least 1 hour.

Cut the chocolate into small pieces. Bring the water and 4 ounces of sugar to a boil. Remove from heat and add the chocolate. Slowly mix in pieces of the butter until fully incorporated. Set aside. In a mixer, whip the eggs and 2 ounces of sugar on high speed until light and airy but not to full volume. When the chocolate is warm fold it gently into the egg mixture. Pour batter over a half sheet pan that is lined with a silpat or with parchment paper. Bake until the cake is firm and slightly spongy in the center. Remove from oven and let cool at room temperature then transfer to the refrigerator. Cut around the edges of the cake. Carefully turn it out onto an inverted half sheet pan and peel back the silpat. With a small ring mold (roughly 2 inches in diameter) cut disks out of the cake. Return disks to the refrigerator. . For the Macadamia Nut Ice Cream: Toast the macadamia nuts on a sheet pan in a 300 degree F oven until deep golden brown. Grind the nuts in a food processor adding a 1/3 cup of milk to make a paste. Add the vanilla bean to the remaining milk and bring to a simmer. Add the nut paste, cover, and let steep for 1 hour. Whip the yolks and sugar until they form a ribbon when pulled with the whip. Bring the milk mixture back to simmering. Strain through cheesecloth. Squeeze the lump of ground nuts through the cheesecloth to extract as much milk as possible. Cut the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the milk mixture. Slowly stir the hot milk mixture into the eggs. Cook the mixture in a bain-maire until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the cream. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour, cover and cool in the refrigerator overnight. Turn the mix in an ice cream freezer. Spoon into a quart container, cover, and freeze overnight. For the Italian Meringue: Put the egg whites in a very clean mixer bowl with a whip attachment. Boil the light corn syrup, sugar and water in a small saucepot with a candy thermometer attached. When the mixture reaches 230 degrees F start the mixer at high speed. See that the whites do not pass medium peaks before the syrup mixture reaches 240 degrees. When the syrup reaches 240 degrees F remove it from the stove. Turn the mixer down to medium and slowly drizzle the syrup into the egg whites towards the edge of the bowl. Try to get it between the whip and the bowl to avoid splattering. When all of the syrup has been added turn the mixer back up to high speed and whip until the mixture cools. Placing a bowl of ice under the mixer bowl will speed this process up. Transfer to container and refrigerate. For this dish the meringue is best served cool but not cold. For the Amaretto Sauce: Combine the Amaretto and sugar in a saucepot and bring to a boil. Use caution, as the mixture will become very flammable when hot. Continue to boil the mixture for 10 or 15 minutes (up to 45 depending on heat of the stove) until the mixture reaches syrup consistency. It will have a very tight bubble and will be thick. Remove from heat. Add the mascarpone a spoonful at a time stirring constantly with a spoon. Transfer to a squeeze bottle or a container with a lid. Let cool to room temperature and store in the refrigerator. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving. If consistency is too thick warm the sauce slightly or cool if too thin.<br> For the Chambord Sauce: Put raspberries, blackberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepot. Bring to a low boil. Cook mixture, stirring often, until it gets thick and syrup-like. The liquid portion of the mixture should coat the back of a spoon when ready. Let cool for about 5 minutes before mixing in the Chambord. Force the mixture through a fine sieve. Transfer to a squeeze bottle or small container. Let cool to room temperature and then refrigerate. It&#39;s best served cold. If mixture is too thick add a little water or more Chambord. To assemble: Spoon some of the meringue into a large pastry bag. Place a chocolate cake disk in the center of each plate. Top with a 2-ounce scoop of ice cream. Pipe the meringue around the cake and ice cream. Pipe the meringue on the plate just touching the outer rim of the cake. Work your way up around the ice cream and then to a tip on top. Once all plates have meringue, use a blowtorch to carefully brown the meringue. Spoon or pipe the sauce onto the plate around the Baked Alaska. Serve quickly as the ice cream will be starting to melt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 34233,&quot;Shark Bite Ice Cream Sundaes 1/4 cup marshmallow creme, such as Fluff 4 sugar ice cream cones Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting One 1-ounce piece red fruit leather 8 semisweet chocolate chips 1 stroopwafel sandwich cookie 1 pint vanilla ice cream 1/2 cup blue sprinkles Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment. For the shark body: Microwave the marshmallow creme in a medium microwave-safe bowl, stopping to stir halfway through, until soft and spreadable, about 30 seconds.<br> Starting at the open end of a cone, use a pastry brush to paint the marshmallow creme in an arch-shape about halfway up the cone and a third of the way around (this will be the white part of the shark&#39;s body). Let the marshmallow creme dry until slightly less sticky, about 5 minutes. Generously dust the arch with confectioners&#39; sugar to coat, tapping off any excess. Repeat with the remaining cones. Set the cones open-ends down on the prepared baking sheet and let dry until that marshmallow creme has set, about 5 minutes.<br> For the shark mouth and teeth: Unroll the fruit leather and use kitchen shears to cut out four 1-by-1 1/4-inch arch-shaped pieces; cut jagged teeth around the top and bottom of each piece.<br> Stick a fruit leather mouth, arch-up, onto the marshmallow creme part of the shark&#39;s body; the flat side of the mouth should hit just above the rim of the cone. Use a toothpick to push the leather into the creme, creating the effect of puffy white teeth around the red mouth. (Make sure any excess sugar has been wiped from the fluff to help the mouth adhere.) For the shark eyes: Dip the flat ends of the chocolate chips in the remaining fluff. Stick 1 chip on either side of the marshmallow creme part of the shark&#39;s body for the eyes. Repeat with the remaining chips and cones.<br> For the shark fins: Make side fins by cutting 8 thin 1 1/2-inch-long triangles from the cookie. Cut four 1-inch-wide-by-1 1/4-inch-tall triangular back fins from the remaining cookie; make one side of each triangle rounded with a pointed tip, like a shark fin.<br> Place a heaping scoop of ice cream in a bowl. Top with an upside-down ice cream cone. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the sprinkles around the ice cream for water. Stick the back fin into the ice cream so it touches the back of the shark cone. Stick a side fin on either side of the cone below the shark&#39;s eyes.

Continue to whip until the mixture becomes very thick and is lukewarm, approximately 12 to 15 minutes. Add the vanilla during the last minute of whipping. While the mixture is whipping prepare the pans as follows. For regular marshmallows: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl. Lightly spray a 13 by 9-inch metal baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Add the sugar and cornstarch mixture and move around to completely coat the bottom and sides of the pan. Return the remaining mixture to the bowl for later use. When ready, pour the mixture into the prepared pan, using a lightly oiled spatula for spreading evenly into the pan. Dust the top with enough of the remaining sugar and cornstarch mixture to lightly cover. Reserve the rest for later. Allow the marshmallows to sit uncovered for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Turn the marshmallows out onto a cutting board and cut into 1-inch squares using a pizza wheel dusted with the confectioners&#39; sugar mixture. Once cut, lightly dust all sides of each marshmallow with the remaining mixture, using additional if necessary. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks. For miniature marshmallows: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl. Line 4 half sheet pans with parchment paper, spray the paper with nonstick cooking spray and dust with the confectioners&#39; sugar mixture. Scoop the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round piping tip. Pipe the mixture onto the prepared sheet pans lengthwise, leaving about 1-inch between each strip. Sprinkle the tops with enough of the remaining cornstarch and sugar mixture to lightly cover. Let the strips set for 4 hours or up to overnight. Cut into 1/2 inch pieces using a pizza wheel or scissors dusted with the confectioners&#39; sugar mixture. Once cut, lightly dust all sides of each marshmallow with the remaining sugar mixture and store in an airtight container for up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 34236,&quot;Crawfish Bisque 6 pounds fresh or frozen cooked crawfish, thawed 1 carrot, cut into large pieces<br> 1 stalk celery, cut into large pieces<br> 1 yellow onion, cut into large pieces<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 6 thyme sprigs<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 small green bell pepper, chopped<br> 1 stalk celery, chopped<br> 1 yellow onion, chopped<br> 1 medium tomato, chopped<br> 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 tablespoons tomato paste<br> 3 cups Crawfish Stock<br> 1/4 cup dry sherry<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> Reserved crawfish meat<br> Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish, optional Instructions: For the crawfish stock: Remove the meat from the crawfish tails and set aside. Place the shells and heads in a large stockpot. Add water to cover. Add the carrot, celery, onion, bay leaves, and thyme sprigs, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain, reserving the stock. For the bisque: Melt the butter in the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the bell pepper, celery, onion, tomato, and Cajun seasoning and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour and tomato paste and cook until bubbly and beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the crawfish stock and sherry and cook until it evaporates, about 1 minute. Stir in the cream and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the soup begins to thicken. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Alternatively, use a standard blender and puree in batches. (Be sure to remove the lid cap to allow steam to escape.) Stir in the reserved crawfish meat and cook until heat through, 5 to 10 minutes. Divide the bisque between serving bowls and garnish with parsley, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 34237,&quot;Roast Loin of Pork with Baked Apples and Cider Gravy 2 (5 pound) pork loin roasts, rib bones attached, back bone (chine) removed Small bunch sage, leaves chopped Small bunch thyme, leaves chopped 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 (12-ounce) bottle hard cider 1 cup chicken broth 1 lemon, juiced optional 8 Gala or Golden Delicious apples 1 lemon, juiced 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 or 2 large corn muffins crumbled (1/2 cup), reserve some for sprinkling on apples 1/2 cup golden raisins 6 sage leaves, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/4 cup dark brown sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup hard cider 1 tablespoon lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pork roast in a roasting pan with the ribs facing up, braced against each other. Add sage and thyme to olive oil. Brush the pork roasts with oil mixture and season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Roast the pork loin for 2 1/2 hours, until the skin is crackled. (Put the apples in the oven along with the pork roast in the last half hour of cooking.) Remove the pork roast to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving. Pour out some of the excess fat from the roasting pan and put it on the stove over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the flour into the hot pan juices, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps. Cook and stir the roux until its light brown. Add the cider and continue to stir to incorporate. Pour in the chicken broth; boil and stir for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick. Check for seasoning - add lemon juice if necessary. Serve the cider gravy with the pork roast and baked apples. To make the buttered apples: Core the apples with an apple corer, making a good size cavity to hold the stuffing. Douse the cut sides of the apples with some of the lemon juice to prevent them from browning while you make the stuffing. In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, muffin crumbs, raisins, sage, garlic, brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Spoon the stuffing into the cavities of the cored apples; stand them up, side by side, in a baking dish and sprinkle the tops with the reserved muffin crumbs. Pour the cider around the apples and bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees F, until soft when pierced with a knife. Place the warm apples in the center of a round serving dish. Spoon the cider sauce around the apples and serve with the pork loin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34238,&quot;Marinated Calamari Salad with Ligurian Olives, Celery Leaves, and Chiles 2 pounds cleaned small squid 2 tablespoons pure olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 serrano chiles, seeded and minced 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons roughly chopped celery leaves 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh flat-parsley leaves 12 oil-cured Ligurian olives, pitted and halved Instructions: Thinly slice the squid bodies and halve the tentacles.

Generously coat a 12-slot muffin tin with nonstick vegetable spray. Into a large bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt together three times. In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together at high speed for 15 seconds, until combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until each is incorporated. Continue beating until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes more. With the mixer on its lowest setting, beat in a third of the flour mixture. Beat in the buttermilk and vanilla, then another third of the flour. Beat in the coffee and then the remaining flour. Fill the cups of the muffin tin two-thirds full and bake for 15 minutes, or until the centers spring back when lightly pressed and a cake tester comes out clean. Set the pan on a rack to cool. With a small knife, carefully carve a 1-inch-round by 1-inch-deep plug out of the bottoms of the cupcakes-you&#39;re going to need the plug to refill the hole, so don&#39;t chuck it out. Fill with vanilla cream. Cut a 1/4-inch disk off the cake plug and cover the exposed cream. Dunk the cupcakes into the frosting to coat, then place on a rack, frosted side up. Transfer to the refrigerator for 20 minutes to set before serving. With an electric mixer, beat together the vegetable shortening and butter until blended. Turn the mixer down to its lowest setting and gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar. Turn the mixer back up and beat a high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.

Add the spices. Score ham in a diamond pattern through the skin and fat, taking care not to cut into the meat. Add ham to brine, weight it with a plate to keep it submerged, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours but no more than 8 hours. Drain, rinse, pat the ham dry, and refrigerate. One hour before roasting, remove ham from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. For the rub: Pulse the olive oil, mustard, parsley, sage, garlic, red pepper, salt, and black pepper in a food processor to make a paste. Rub it all over ham. In a large roasting pan, toss the onion wedges with 1 cup of the apple cider and set the ham on top. Roast the ham for 30 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F, and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165 degrees F, about 4 hours. After the first hour, loosely wrap aluminum foil around the bone to keep it from burning. Meanwhile, for the glaze: Boil, then simmer, the remaining apple cider in a saucepan, skimming as needed, until syrupy and reduced to about 2 cups, about 1 1/2 hours.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. You will need to repeat the following steps for each color. Try to do this somewhat simultaneously to keep the sugar from melting under the lamp. Pull the sugar to incorporate air. Cut pieces of sugar and form into shapes. Make 2 arms. Use a sugar pump to blow sugar inside. Put sugar around the pump. Anchor by heating the metal and wrapping the sugar around the hot tube. Fold the sugar onto itself to be sure it is the same temperature and same consistency everywhere. Add the larger sugar to the pump. Carefully fill with air while shaping. You need to work slowly and consistently, always holding the sugar piece in your hand to continually give it shape. Use a blow torch to melt the edges slightly and stick them together. You?ve made the shoes, pants, body, arms, head. If necessary, make a belt to hide the seam where the shirt and pants meet. Position the arms in different ways to give him some action. Make a base. Stick the shoes to the base. Stick the pants into the shoes. Adhere the body to the pants. Add the arms. Make his head. You can paint his facial features or make them from sugar. Add a hat. Put a candy cane in 1 hand and a lollipop in the other hand. Use the base of the presentation to display the other candies you have made. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 34248,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Apple-Bourbon Ham Glaze 1 cup apple cider 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup bourbon<br> 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice<br> Teeny tiny pinch of ground cloves<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> One 7- to 10-pound precooked spiral ham<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. To make the glaze, add the apple cider, brown sugar, bourbon, pumpkin pie spice and cloves to a large pot. Turn the heat to medium high and cook, while stirring, until the liquid reduces and becomes slightly thickened like a glaze, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the butter and stir to melt. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Lay out plenty of aluminum foil to wrap the ham in and create a bed for it. Place the ham in the center of the aluminum foil and pull the sides up around it, leaving the top exposed. Pour over half the glaze, getting it into the spirals. Finish tightly wrapping the ham and place it on a rack in a roasting pan. Fill the pan with water, but do not let it touch the bottom of the ham. Cook until the internal temperature reaches about 140 degrees F (gauge 15 to 20 minutes per pound). Remember, it is already cooked, so you just need to bring it to temperature without drying it out. Remove the ham and raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Pull back the aluminum foil (watch out--it&#39;s steamy and hot!!). With a brush and the remaining glaze, slather the top of the ham, allowing the glaze to get into any creases of the spiral you see. Place back in the oven uncovered but still sitting in the foil and roasting pan, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and rest 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 34249,&quot;Gingerbread Cupcakes with Zinfandel Buttercream Frosting 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 cups loosely packed brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger Pinch ground cloves 1/2 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 eggs 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons molasses 3 tablespoons applesauce 1 tablespoon pureed ginger Zinfandel Buttercream Frosting, recipe follows 1/2 cup zinfandel wine 1 pound unsalted butter, room temperature 6 1/2 cups powdered sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Deep-fry the yucca chips in several batches until golden, then drain on paper towels. Increase the heat under the fryer so that the oil comes to 390 degrees and, again in several batches, deep-fry the chips until they are deep golden and slightly puffed. Drain again briefly on paper towels and sprinkle with the sea salt. Mound the chips around the edges of a large platter and place the bowl of lime pepper mayonnaise in the center. Scatter a few lime wedges among the chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 34252,&quot;Oyster and Caramelized Onion Pan Roast 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 Spanish onions, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon sugar 3 cloves garlic, finely diced 2 Yukon gold potatoes, skin on and cut into 1/2-inch dice Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cups clam broth 1 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup creme fraiche 20 oysters, shucked 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh tarragon, plus a few sprigs for garnish Instructions: Heat olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Add 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts or 8 boneless skinless thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds), squeeze out the air, seal tightly and massage gently to coat the chicken with marinade. Refrigerate for 2 hours or freeze up to 1 month; defrost in the refrigerator overnight before cooking. To cook: Remove the chicken from the bag, letting any excess marinade drip off, and transfer to a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil, turning halfway through, until lightly charred, cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F, about 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Chianti]&quot; 34257,&quot;Potato and Apple Gratin 1 tablespoon cooking oil 3 Idaho potatoes, sliced 3 Granny Smith apples, sliced 1/2 cup grated cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees and lightly oil a 9 by 9-inch glass or ceramic casserole dish. Shingle one layer of potatoes to cover the bottom of the casserole dish. Sprinkle over with some of the sliced onions, then layer with some of the sliced apples. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat the layering process until the entire product is used, making sure you finish with a layer of potatoes. When using a microwave, be sure to wrap the casserole in plastic and poke 2 holes in the plastic. Cook at high heat for 15 minutes. Remove the plastic and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook until well browned, approximately 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the grated cheese and bake until melted and lightly browned. When using the oven, cover the casserole or wrap with aluminum foil bake 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until well browned.

Gently bring the cream to a boil in medium-size heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring it often. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar, and then add the passion fruit puree to the egg mixture. Pour 1/2 of the boiling cream into the egg mixture to temper it. Remove the pan of cream from the heat. Then return the tempered egg mixture back to the cream, and whisk to combine. Return the pan to the heat, and continue to heat it until it reaches 180 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Strain custard through a sieve into a pitcher-like container that you can easily pour from. Place 4 ramekins on a sheet tray. Divide the custard evenly among the ramekins, and place in the oven. Fill the pan half-way up the sides of ramekins with hot water. Bake for 10 minutes, and then turn the pan around, and bake for 15 minutes more, or until set. Remove from the oven, and let cool to room temperature in a water bath. Chill for at least 2 hours. Generously sprinkle the tops of the crme brulee with sugar, and then caramelize with a kitchen torch. If you do not have a kitchen torch, then place ramekins under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes until sugar caramelizes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 34259,&quot;Savory Pumpkin Dip with Cranberry Reduction 1 cup 100 percent pure cranberry juice 2 sprigs fresh sage 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons honey Kosher salt One 15.5-ounce can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained 3/4 cup pumpkin puree 1 teaspoon orange zest plus the juice of 1 medium orange 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, plus additional for sprinkling Pinch of cayenne pepper Kosher salt 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Toasted pepitas, for sprinkling Fresh parsley leaves, for sprinkling Crunchmaster? Multi-Grain Sea Salt Crackers or Crunchmaster?

Add the mushrooms. Do not move the mushrooms until they have caramelized on the bottom. If you toss them too soon, they will release their liquid and begin to steam. When the bottoms are caramelized, toss them and continue to cook for about 5 minutes. Add the butter. Cook and toss for 5 minutes, until beautifully browned. Season with salt and add the garlic. Saute another 2 minutes, and add the thyme, lemon juice, and white wine. Cook to evaporate the liquid. Toss in the parsley and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 34261,&quot;Barbecue Championship Ribs 2 slabs St. Louis cut pork ribs (about 2 1/2 pounds each) Ray&#39;s Supersweet Rib Rub, recipe follows 1 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 cup honey 1/4 cup butter, melted<br> 1/4 cup Tiger Sauce or other pepper sauce that&#39;s not too vinegary<br> Thick and Rich Barbecue Sauce, recipe follows 1/2 cup Sugar in the Raw 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup kosher salt 3 tablespoons chili powder 1 tablespoon ground cumin 2 teaspoons black pepper 2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon dried grated orange peel 1/4 teaspoon ground thyme 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle (or cayenne pepper) 1/4 cup butter 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced (leave the seeds in if you like it hot) 1/2 teaspoon celery seed 2 cups ketchup 1/2 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup honey 1/3 cup yellow mustard 1/4 cup apple juice 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon Louisiana hot sauce 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional) 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper Instructions: Prepare your cooker to cook indirectly at 235 degrees F using medium pecan wood for smoke flavor. Peel the membrane off the back of the ribs and trim any excess fat. Season the ribs liberally on both sides with the barbecue rub. Place the ribs in the smoker, meat-side up, and cook for 2 hours. Flip the ribs and cook for 45 minutes.<br> Lay out two double-thick sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Lay one slab on each piece of foil, meat-side up. Top each slab with half of the brown sugar. Drizzle each slab with half of the honey, butter, and Tiger Sauce. Close up the rib packages, pressing out as much air as possible. Do not seal the packages tightly; they need to breathe a little.<br> Return to the cooker for 30 minutes. Open the packages and check for doneness by pushing a toothpick into the meat. It should go in and out very easily. If you want the ribs more tender, just wrap them back up and cook a little longer. When they&#39;re as you like them, transfer to a sheet pan. Remove the foil and return the ribs to the cooker meat-side down. Brush the bone side liberally with barbecue sauce and cook for 10 minutes. Flip the ribs and brush the meat side liberally with barbecue sauce. Cook for 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 5 minutes. Slice each rib individually and transfer to a platter to serve. This rub is extra-sweet and goes really well with ribs and other cuts of pork. It is a good choice if you like to serve your ribs dry. The sweetness will have the guests thinking you used barbecue sauce. This one isn&#39;t recommended for hot grilling because all that sugar makes it burn pretty easily. I like to mix it in the food processor for a finer grind, but if you like it coarse just mix it in a bowl. Combine all the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor with a metal blade. Process for 5 seconds, until the lumps are gone. The rub may be stored in an airtight container in a cool place for up to 6 months.<br> This is a big, thick, red barbecue sauce made with fresh ingredients and a lot of love in your kitchen. Every barbecue cook I have ever known has a mother sauce they&#39;ve been working on for years and this would be a great place to start on yours. You can skip the liquid smoke if you like, but I think it adds a nice layer to barbecue sauce. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion, garlic, and jalapeno and cook for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft. Add the celery seed and mix well. Cook for 1 minute. Add the ketchup, vinegar, honey, mustard, apple juice, soy sauce, Worcestershire, hot sauce, tomato paste, liquid smoke (if using), salt, and pepper. Mix well and bring to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes, mixing often, until thickened. Remove from the heat and serve or cool and store the sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 34262,&quot;Chicken Fajitas 1 teaspoon chili powder 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 bell peppers (any color), sliced 1 red onion, sliced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest, plus wedges for serving 8 corn tortillas 1/2 cup prepared pico de gallo or fresh salsa 1/3 cup crumbled cotija cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Mix the chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and rub on the chicken breasts. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning, until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet, reserving the skillet, and bake until just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to rest, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the reserved skillet over medium heat. Add the bell peppers, onion, garlic and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon cumin and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are lightly browned, 8 minutes. Stir in the lime zest and 2 tablespoons water. Season with salt. Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil and warm in the oven, 5 minutes, then divide among plates. Slice the chicken. Top the tortillas with the chicken, bell pepper mixture, pico de gallo and cheese. Serve with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 34263,&quot;Stuffed French Onion Soup Burger 3 large red onions, cut into 1/2-inch rounds 2 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br> 6 tablespoons canola oil<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons dry Marsala<br> 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br> 1 1/2 pounds hamburger meat (85/15) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons dry Marsala<br> 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 3 cups grated Gruyere 2 cups hearty beef stock<br> 4 seeded potato hamburger rolls<br> 8 to 12 thick sour pickle rounds<br> Instructions: For the onion jam: Heat a large saute pan, then toss in the onion and garlic slices with 2 tablespoons oil and a generous pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the Marsala, brown sugar and mustard and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized and tender, 20 to 25 minutes. (Do not rush this step, because properly caramelized onions make this burger top-notch!) Stir in the vinegar and cook to blend in, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside. For the burgers: In a medium bowl, break up the meat and spread it up on the sides of the bowl so that the seasoning really permeates. Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper. Gently mix in the Marsala, soy sauce and Worcestershire. Do not overmix. (The more you work the meat, the tougher the burger.) Form the meat into 4 even patties that are about 3/4-inch thick and transfer to a baking sheet. Use a spoon to gently scoop out a little meat and make a hole or pocket in the center of each patty that does not go all the way through to the bottom. Place about 1/4 cup Gruyere in the hole of each patty. Flatten the piece of meat you scooped out and press it over the cheese so that it&#39;s hidden in the middle of the patty. Turn the patty on the other side that it is weighing down on the seam. Repeat with the remaining patties. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the remaining 4 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle the patties lightly with salt. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, arrange the patties in a single layer, cheese-pocket-side down, at a distance from one another. Cook the patties, undisturbed, until the bottom browns, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the patties on their other sides and let the bottoms brown again, 3 to 5 minutes. Lower the heat and add the stock to the skillet and cover. Cook on low heat until the patties are cooked through, 8 to 10 additional minutes. Remove the cover, shut off the heat under the skillet and let the patties rest with the heat off. Arrange the bun halves in a single layer on a baking sheet and sprinkle each bun half with about 1/4 cup Gruyere. Place the baking sheet in the center of the oven and toast until the buns are golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and melted, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange the bun bottoms on a flat surface. Mix the onion jam and remaining cup Gruyere into the liquid in the skillet. Taste for seasoning. Spoon some of the onions and liquid on each bun bottom and top with the patties and more onions. Top with a few slices of pickle and season the bun tops with a pinch of salt. Close the burgers and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34264,&quot;Porcini Mushrooms Bordeaux-style: Cepes a la Bordelaise 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 pound fresh porcini mushrooms, stems removed and wiped clean 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: In a large skillet, melt the butter with the lemon juice over medium heat.

Line the bottom of a 9-inch square baking pan with a foil strip long enough to overhang on 2 opposite sides. Spray the foil lightly with cooking spray; set aside. Whisk together the flour, oats, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk the butter, egg, brown sugar and applesauce in a large bowl until combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until barely mixed. Stir in the chocolate chips. Spread the batter in the prepared baking pan. Bake until the cake is light brown around the edges and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Use the foil overhang to lift the cake out of the pan and let cool completely on the rack. Invert onto a plate and peel the foil off.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In a separate small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the buttermilk, egg and 2 tablespoons oil. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Transfer the batter to a tall skinny glass or measuring cup (this step isn&#39;t completely necessary, but it will make coating the sausages easier). Working in batches of 3 or 4 sausages at a time, insert a lollipop or ice-pop stick into each sausage, pat off any excess moisture with a paper towel and dip into the pancake batter to fully coat, scraping off excess; it doesn&#39;t need to be a very thick coating, as the batter will puff up when frying. Carefully lower the entire thing (stick included) into the hot oil and fry until golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Use tongs to transfer to a paper towel or wire rack. Repeat with the remaining sausages. Cool slightly, then serve with maple syrup, if desired. To freeze, cool completely and then store in a ziptop bag in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, wrap loosely in a paper towel and microwave until heated through, about 40 seconds.

Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, 1 hour to infuse the flavor. Whisk 3 cups buttermilk, the hot sauce and mustard in a large bowl. Stir in the garlic and onion slices, then the chicken. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours. Whisk the flour, baking powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper in a large bowl. Drizzle in the remaining 1/3 cup buttermilk and whisk to form small shaggy clumps. One piece at a time, remove the chicken from the buttermilk, letting any excess drip off, and coat in the flour mixture, pressing with your hands to coat well. Transfer to a rack set on a baking sheet. Fill a large cast-iron skillet with 1 inch vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Carefully add 4 to 5 pieces chicken to the hot oil. The oil temperature will drop; adjust the heat as needed to maintain a temperature of 325 degrees F. Fry the chicken, without turning, until the crust starts browning, about 2 minutes. Flip the chicken and fry, turning occasionally, until browned and crisp all over and a thermometer inserted into the breasts registers 160 degrees F and the thighs 170 degrees F, 12 to 16 minutes. Remove with tongs to a clean rack set on a baking sheet; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let the oil temperature return to 350 degrees F before frying the remaining chicken. After all the chicken is cooked, fry the onions, if desired: Drain the onions, separate the rings, then coat with the flour mixture. Fry, turning once, until crisp and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. We used a big spoonful of baking powder in the coating for this Nashville-style chicken. It draws out moisture, so the skin gets extra crisp before it?s dipped in fiery cayenne-spiced butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, GSM]</p><p>&quot; 34280,&quot;Bruschetta with White Bean Puree 3/4 cup white marrow beans (or other white beans), cooked and cooled, 1 cup cooking liquid reserved 2 tablespoons olive paste 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves, plus 6 sprigs fresh thyme, for garnish, optional 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/4 teaspoon gray salt Fresh ground black pepper 1 loaf thick Italian bread 2 cloves garlic, peeled Instructions: Puree the beans in a food processor until smooth, adding the reserved liquid, as necessary, for a finished consistency that is spread-able but not too thin.

Add the onion, garlic, carrots, celery, thyme and bay leaf. Cook and stir for about 6 minutes, until the vegetables are softened but not browned. Pour in the chicken stock and bring the liquid to a boil. Add the noodles and simmer for 5 minutes until tender. Fold in the chicken, and continue to simmer for another couple of minutes to heat through; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with chopped parsley before serving. Place the chicken and vegetables in a large stockpot over medium heat. Pour in only enough cold water to cover (about 3 quarts); too much will make the broth taste weak. Toss in the thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns, and allow it to slowly come to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, partially covered, until the chicken is done. As it cooks, skim any impurities that rise to the surface; add a little more water if necessary to keep the chicken covered while simmering. Carefully remove the chicken to a cutting board. When its cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones; hand-shred the meat into a storage container. Carefully strain the stock through a fine sieve into another pot to remove the vegetable solids. Use the stock immediately or if you plan on storing it, place the pot in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool down the stock.

Stir in the melted butter, egg yolks and warm water, then knead the dough until smooth, 15 to 20 minutes. Lightly oil the inside of a large bowl, add the dough and brush the top of the dough with some more olive oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then put in a warm spot, such as the top of the fridge, until the dough has doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes. When the dough is almost ready, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray. Place 6 cups water in a wide, shallow saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Meanwhile, punch down the dough and lightly dust your work surface with flour. Flatten and stretch the dough into a rectangle about 8 inches wide and 12 inches long. Line up 4 pieces of the cheese lengthwise on one half of the dough, spacing them out evenly. Cut the dough in half crosswise and set aside the 8-by-6-inch half without the cheese. Place a scant tablespoon of the chiles along the top of each piece of cheese. Cut the dough evenly between the pieces of cheese so you end up with 4 rectangles of dough with the cheese in the middle of each. Dab the edges of the dough with a little water. Fold in the ends, then stretch the bottom edge over the center, roll over and seal shut, like a burrito. Repeat with the remaining dough half, cheese and chiles. When the water is simmering, stir in the baking soda. Working in batches, add the pretzels to the water and cook for 30 seconds, flipping once. Remove using a spider or slotted spoon and shake off any excess liquid, then place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the top of the pretzels with the melted butter and sprinkle with the pretzel salt. Using a sharp paring knife, lightly score the top of each pretzel 4 times on the diagonal and bake until browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside until cool to the touch, 5 to 10 minutes. Slice each pretzel crosswise into bite-size pieces. For serving, place the tortilla strips on a platter, top with the pretzel pieces, then layer on the cl salt, pickled jalape?os, Cheddar and scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 34285,&quot;Bow Tie Pasta in Parmigiano-Reggiano Butter 1 pound dried farfalle or bow tie pasta 6 quarts water 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1 1/2 cups grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste Instructions: In a large pot, bring salted water to a rolling boil.

Add the vodka, seal and shake to combine. Set aside in a cool, dark place for at least 2 weeks. Strain the infused vodka through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. You may need to line the sieve with a coffee filter to catch all of the zest. Discard the zest (or dehydrate it and add to the salt for rimming the Spicy Italian Margarita).<br> If making your own simple syrup, combine the sugar with 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until the sugar is fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool completely.<br> Combine 3/4 cup of the simple syrup (or more, if desired) with the infused vodka. Store in an airtight bottle in the freezer for up to 6 months. Makes about 3 cups. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 34319,&quot;Jalapeno Popper Tacos 8 slices bacon, chopped 2 jalapenos, sliced into rounds (seeded if preferred) 1 small onion, chopped<br> 1 1/2 pounds chicken breast, thinly sliced 2 teaspoons taco seasoning<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> Zest and juice of 2 limes 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> Jalapeno hot sauce, to taste<br> 12 crispy taco shells, warmed 1 cup shredded Cheddar<br> 2 large jalapenos, minced<br> Instructions: For the filling and cream cheese topping: In a large skillet over medium heat, add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes.

Heat a deep saute pan over medium heat. Add the oil and allow to heat. Add the beef and pork to the oil, stirring to cook until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Then add the tomato, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper, and reduce the heat to low and cook for additional 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. Carefully strain into a bowl. Transfer the meat mixture to a clean bowl. Allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes. (Mixture must be cool before adding to the pastry.) While the mixture cools, roll out the puff pastry. For the roulade: Sprinkle some flour on your counter or cutting board. Lay the sheet of pastry over the flour. With a rolling pin, roll the pastry out from the center, from the top to the bottom, and then out to the sides to make it a large rectangle, about 1 1/2 times the original size. Stir the egg yolks and breadcrumbs into the cooled meat mixture, stirring in well. Place half the cooled meat mixture onto the bottom third of the pastry sheet, keeping the bottom 2 inches empty. Top with half the Cheddar and goat cheeses and roll tightly. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the pastry with a light coating of whisked egg whites. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and half the Parmesan. Repeat with the second piece of pastry. Place the roulades on a sheet pan covered with parchment. Bake in the oven until golden brown, 16 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. For the sauce: In a small bowl, stir the chopped onion and ketchup together. To serve: Slice the roulades into thin rounds and serve warm with a dollop of sauce on each slice. Chef&#39;s Notes Keep the puff pastry in the fridge until you&#39;re ready to use it. If the pastry gets too warm and soft while you&#39;re rolling it out, just chill it for a minute before proceeding. Make sure that the meat mixture is cooled before adding to the pastry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 34325,&quot;Creamless Fresh Pea Soup with Truffled Snow Pea Salad 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 medium yellow onions, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon minced garlic 3 cups chicken stock or low-sodium, canned 3 cups shucked English peas 1 cup spinach leaves 4 tablespoons butter, cold and in pieces Salt and black pepper to taste 1 lime, juiced 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon truffle oil 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 cup blanched, stringed snow peas, sliced lengthwise 1/8-inch Salt and black pepper taste Instructions: In a hot saucepan, coat with oil and brown onions and garlic, about 5 minutes.

Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the gelatin; continue to whisk until dissolved. Pour the gelatin mixture into a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish. Refrigerate, stirring every 10 minutes, until the gelatin just begins to thicken, 30 to 45 minutes. (It should be thick, but still liquid and pourable.) Meanwhile, slice the pound cake into eight 1/4-inch-thick slices. Remove the push parts of eight 7 1/4-inch-tall pushable pop molds from the tubes. Push the circle side of each mold into a cake slice to make a circle that fits snugly in the mold. Return the push part to each tube. Add the blue candy melting wafers and coconut oil to a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth, about 1 minute. Using a silicone brush, paint a 1/2-inch-thick strip on the exterior of the top of each tube with the melted candy. Coat with the white nonpareils (do not completely cover the melted candy). Let set, about 5 minutes. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the tiny crunchy candy into each mold. Freeze the molds while the gelatin sets.<br> Place 1 gummy shark into each of the molds, then fill with the gelatin mixture. Tap each mold to release any air bubbles. Refrigerate until completely set and very firm, at least 3 hours.

Make a well in the middle of the flour 3 to 4 inches wide. Crack the eggs into the well and add the yolks and salt. Using a fork, break the yolks and begin to beat the eggs as if you were making scrambled eggs. Continue stirring the eggs in large circles with the fork, slowly incorporating the flour from the inner edges of the well until the mixture becomes a thick mass and is difficult to stir, about 3 minutes. Using a bench scraper or rubber spatula, fold the loose flour from the edges into the thick mass, then knead until a smooth dough forms. Discard any excess flour.<br> Shape the dough into a flat disk, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. (The dough can be made 1 day ahead. Store it in the refrigerator tightly wrapped and let it come to room temperature before rolling.)<br> Secure the pasta attachment to a stand mixer or, if using a hand-crank machine, attach it to the counter. Set the machine to the widest setting. Unwrap the dough and cut it into 4 equal pieces. Wrap 3 of the pieces and set aside while you work with the remaining piece of dough.<br> Flatten the dough into a rectangle and lightly dust it with flour. Roll it through the pasta machine at the widest setting. Fold the dough in thirds like a letter and feed it through the pasta machine. Repeat the folding and feeding of the dough through the machine 2 more times. (Folding and rolling it in this manner helps strengthen and smooth the dough.)<br> Set the pasta machine to the next setting (one setting thinner than the widest). Flour the dough as needed and feed it through the machine. Repeat one more time.<br> Adjust the machine to the next thinnest setting and feed the dough through 2 times. Continue changing the setting and feeding the dough through 2 times for each setting until you have fed the dough through the second-to-last setting. The sheet of pasta should be thin enough so that you can see your hand through it.<br> To make pappardelle, cut the sheet crosswise into 10- to 12-inch-long pieces, then cut each piece with a chef\u2019s knife into 1-inch-wide noodles. Lightly toss the noodles with a little flour on a baking sheet to prevent sticking. Cover with a dry kitchen towel while you repeat the process with the remaining dough. To make hand-shaped fusilli, cut the sheet crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Wrap them around a thin dowel, skewer or chopstick, forming a corkscrew-like shape, then gently slide each one onto a baking sheet. Lightly toss the fusilli with a little flour to prevent sticking. Cover with a dry kitchen towel while you repeat the process with the remaining dough. (Making fusilli is great to do with kids as a group.) Cook the noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, 3 to 4 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 34328,&quot;Candied Orange Peel 1 large navel orange 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Using a vegetable peeler, cut the orange part of the peel from the stem end of the orange down to the navel end, forming long 3/4 to 1-inch-wide strips. Bring a heavy small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the peels and cook for 1 minute. Drain and then rinse the peels under cold water. Repeat cooking the peels in the saucepan with fresh boiling water and rinsing under cold water. Stir the sugar and 1/2 cup of fresh water in a heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil. Add the orange peels and simmer over medium-low heat until tender, about 15 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the peels to a sheet of parchment paper to dry slightly, about 1 hour. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir the chocolate in a small bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Dip 1 1/2-inches of each candied orange peel into the chocolate then place them on the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate until the chocolate is set, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Brachetto, Cava]&quot; 34329,&quot;Dry Roasted Edamame with Black Sesame Seeds 2 cups frozen shelled edamame, thawed 2 teaspoons olive oil Salt 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, or regular sesame seeds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Put the celery shavings in ice water with half a lemon and its juice and let sit for at least 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator. The celery will get very crunchy, curly and cute. Bring a pot of well salted water to a boil, over medium heat and set up a bowl of well salted ice water. Toss the haricots verts in the boiling water and cook until the beans are tender but still firm. Remove the beans from the boiling water and plunge immediately into the ice water and let them cool. When they are cold and still vibrantly green, remove them from the ice water and reserve. Fish: Season the fish fillets with salt. Combine the herbs and the potato flakes in a shallow dish. Dip the flesh side of each fillet into the egg wash and then press them into the herb/potato flake mixture. Put on a sheet tray with the crusted side up. To cook and assemble everything: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and heat it over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the fish, crusted side down. When the crust has become golden and crispy, flip them over, then transfer the fish to a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack and put in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the oil in the saute pan and add new oil. Toss in the garlic and crushed red pepper. When the garlic becomes golden and aromatic remove it and discard. Toss in the reserved haricots verts, season with salt, to taste, and roll them around in the oil to heat through. When they are hot, turn off the heat and reserve them in the pan. Remove the celery from the ice water and dry in a salad spinner to remove the excess water. Add the celery to the pan with the beans. Squeeze in the juice from the remaining lemon half and season with salt, if needed.

Place the colander in the sink. Heat the milk in a large non-reactive saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently to make sure the milk doesn&#39;t scorch on the bottom, until the milk comes to a simmer. Turn off the heat and gently stir in 3 tablespoons lemon juice. The milk should start separating into solid curds and a yellowish watery whey. If it doesn&#39;t, add a little more lemon juice. Let sit for about 5 minutes in the pot to continue separating, then gently pour into the cheesecloth-lined colander. (If the curds are still very small after 5 minutes then reheat the milk mixture over medium heat and simmer to increase the curd separation). Rinse briefly with cold water to remove any lemon flavor. Gather up the sides of the cheesecloth, twist into a ball, and squeeze to wring out as much liquid as possible. Open up the cheesecloth, and mix 1/4 teaspoon salt evenly into the cheese curds. Squeeze into a ball again and wring out any remaining moisture. Flatten the cheesecloth ball into a 3/4-inch thick disc and place on a plate. Weigh down with another plate topped with a heavy item such as a large can. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight, then carefully cut the paneer into 3/4-inch cubes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Have a large bowl of ice water nearby. In batches, blanch the spinach for about 1 minute in the boiling water and quickly transfer with a spider or slotted spoon to the ice water. Drain the cooked spinach. Place all of it in a blender and puree until mostly but not completely smooth. Reserve. Rinse the blender carafe and puree the tomatoes; reserve. Rinse the carafe again and puree the garlic and ginger with 1/4 cup water; reserve. Line a plate with paper towels. Heat 2 tablespoons ghee in a large nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add the paneer cubes and brown well on 2 to 3 sides, about 5 minutes total. Remove to the lined plate and reserve. Add another 2 tablespoons ghee to the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds and stir until the seeds start to darken and smell toasted, 10 to 30 seconds. Add the serrano cl, onion, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook until the onion is dark brown and soft, about 10 minutes. Turn down the heat if the onion starts to burn. Add the ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, cayenne, and half the garam masala. Stir for about 2 minutes, then add the tomato puree, stirring continuously, until the mixture starts to look dry, about 6 minutes. Add the spinach puree, sugar, 1/4 cup water, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the remaining garam masala. (The mixture will be quite thick.) Simmer for 8 minutes, then stir in the heavy cream and remaining 2 tablespoons ghee. Fold in the browned paneer cubes and simmer to warm the paneer through and to thicken the heavy cream, an additional 4 minutes. Serve with steamed basmati rice or Indian flatbread and lemon wedges on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 34345,&quot;Gluten-Free Pasta with Squash, Parsley and Lemon Kosher salt 8 ounces gluten-free pasta, such as Tinkyada 1 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 pounds) 1 medium delicata squash, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1 1/4 pounds) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 1/2 teaspoons garam masala 3 cups parsley leaves (1/2 bunch), roughly chopped 1/2 teaspoon cl paste, such as sambal oelek Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon Instructions: Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large pot and add 1/4 cup salt.

Reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, cornstarch, flour, confectioners&#39; sugar, custard powder, powdered milk, salt and eggs in a medium bowl until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium heatproof metal bowl. Place the bowl over the simmering water and cook, stirring constantly with a spatula and occasionally removing the bowl from the water if the custard starts to stick to the sides and whisking until mostly smooth, until the custard is thick but pourable and smooth, about 7 minutes. There may be a few curds, but they will smooth out when whisked. Whisk in the butter. Transfer to a clean medium bowl. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard and let cool in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. For the dough: Whisk together the yeast and 1/4 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees F) in the bowl of the stand mixer until the yeast has slightly dissolved. Set aside to proof until the surface of the water is bubbly, about 10 minutes (see Cook\u2019s Note). Add the flour, milk, confectioners&#39; sugar, baking powder and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed using the dough hook attachment until the dough starts to come together. If the dough looks dry, add an additional tablespoon of whole milk at a time until a dough forms and doesn\u2019t stick to the sides of the bowl. Knead the dough on medium-low speed until smooth, about 8 minutes. Add the butter and knead until combined and smooth again. Cover the bowl with a dry kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until the dough is 2 to 3 times its original size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours (see Cook\u2019s Note). Meanwhile, cut twelve 4-inch parchment paper squares and set aside. Scoop a leveled tablespoon of the chilled custard and gently roll into a ball. Continue with the remaining custard (you should have 12 pieces). Cover with the same plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. Pace the stand mixer bowl back onto the machine with the dough hook attachment and knead until the dough deflates, about 1 minute. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide into 12 pieces (about 1 ounce each). Cover the dough with a damp towel. Working with one dough piece at a time, roll out to a 4-inch circle with the edges thinner than the center. Place a custard ball in the center of the dough circle and bring the edges together to seal in the custard. Place on a parchment square and set aside. Repeat with the remaining dough and custard. Set up a steamer and steamer basket and fill with enough hot water to come almost up to but not touching the steamer basket. Place as many bao as you can (on the parchment squares) into the steamer basket, leaving 1 inch of space between each. Cover with a lid and let proof over the hot water until they have a puffed and glossy appearance, about 30 minutes. Let the remaining bao proof, uncovered, on the counter. When ready to steam, turn the heat under the steamer to medium and steam for exactly 12 minutes; start your timer when you turn on the heat. Turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Uncover the steamer and enjoy the bao hot. Immediately steam the remaining bao over medium heat for 12 minutes, then turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Freeze the cooled bao on a baking sheet in a single layer, then transfer to a freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months. Steam from frozen for about 8 minutes, then let sit for 5 minutes.

Scatter the butter and lard over the top of the flour and pulse until the mixture forms large crumbs. Add the water, a few tablespoons at a time, and pulse until the dough just comes together. Divide into 2 equal pieces, flatten each half into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until chilled through, at least 1 hour. On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 of the disks into a 16-inch round. (Reserve the other disk for another purpose. It will keep in the freezer, double wrapped in plastic wrap then single wrapped in foil for up to 4 months.) Fit the dough into a 2-inch deep-dish tart pan with a removable bottom, gently pressing it into the sides. Using a sharp knife, trim the dough evenly with the edge of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap; and chill until firm, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the tart pan on a baking sheet, line the dough with parchment and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove the weights and paper and continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Let cool slightly (not all the way) on a baking rack. Put the jalapenos, cilantro, garlic, pine nuts and oil in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse until the mixture has a pesto-like consistency; you want a bit of texture. Add the cheese and salt and pepper, to taste, and pulse a few times to distribute the cheese. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the chorizo and cook until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Let cool slightly. Scatter the fontina, Cotija, green onions, chorizo and thyme over the warm tart shell. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl. Add the milk and cream and whisk until smooth. Pour into the shell and evenly distribute the goat cheese over the top. Bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the center is almost set (still slightly jiggles) but the sides are set, about 40 to 50 minutes. Let sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before serving.
