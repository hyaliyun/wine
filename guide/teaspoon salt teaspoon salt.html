marshmallows Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Fill a large, microwave-safe dish with 1/2 inch of water. Place squash into the dish and cover. Microwave for about 8 minutes and then drain (the squash should be tender enough to mash, but not overcooked).<br> With a potato masher, food processor, or fork, mash the squash thoroughly, but do not puree (the squash should be pulpy). Add soy milk, syrup, sweetener, salt, egg substitute, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Mix the ingredients thoroughly, but do not over-stir.<br> Transfer to an 8-inch by 10-inch baking pan sprayed with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven until mostly firm, 45 to 50 minutes.<br> Top with mini marshmallows. Return to the oven until the marshmallows begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool before serving!<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 44345,&quot;Szechwan Pepper-Crusted Steak Smothered with Onions 1 1/2 pounds Vidalia or Bermuda onions, peeled 2 teaspoons unsalted butter 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1 to 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar Fresh ground black pepper 1 teaspoon Szechwan peppercorns 1/2 teaspoon white peppercorns 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns 1/4 teaspoon allspice berries 1 1/4 pounds beef skirt, hanger, or strip steak or buffalo sirloin or shell steak, trimmed of all fat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil Kosher salt Scant 1 teaspoon finely grated ginger Instructions: To make the onions, slice the onions in half through the stem. With a mandoline or vegetable slicer or a thin sharp knife, cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch slices. (You should have about 6 cups.) In a large nonstick skillet, melt the butter over moderately low heat. Add the onions, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and toss to coat. Cover and cook until the onions have released their liquid, about 13 minutes. Uncover the pan, increase the heat to moderate, and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the onions with the sugar and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until they are golden brown and caramelized, about 10 minutes longer. Sprinkle with the balsamic vinegar and toss until the vinegar has evaporated. Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and season generously with pepper. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Meanwhile, prepare the pepper rub: In a small heavy skillet, toast the peppercorns and allspice over moderate heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a blender or spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. Strain the spices into a small bowl and return the coarse bits to the blender. Blend again and strain. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels; rub lightly with a little of the oil. Sprinkle lightly with salt and massage the ginger into the steak; then rub the pepper rub over them. Heat a grill pan or heavy nonstick skillet over high heat. Lightly oil the grill pan, if using, or swirl the remaining oil in a nonstick skillet. Add the steaks to the pan and cook until little droplets of blood form on the surface, about 4 minutes. Turn the steaks over and continue cooking until a droplet or so of blood forms on the top again, another 3 to 4 minutes, for rare. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. With a thin sharp knife, slice the steaks on a slight angle against the grain. Sprinkle the meat with a little salt and arrange the slices warm diner plates. Nestle a mound of onions next to the steak. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 44346,&quot;Pinata Cupcakes 1 box chocolate cake mix 3 cups sweetened shredded coconut<br> Yellow, red and blue food coloring 1/2 cup mini candy-coated chocolates, such as mini M and M&#39;s<br> 1/2 cup mixed small fruit-flavored candies, such as Nerds 1/2 cup rainbow nonpareil sprinkles 1/2 cup jumbo rainbow nonpareil sprinkles 2 to 3 cups your favorite vanilla frosting or two 16-ounce containers store-bought vanilla frosting Instructions: Bake 24 cupcakes according to the box instructions. Let cool completely. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add 1 cup of the shredded coconut. Turn the mixer on low, add 8 drops of yellow food coloring and mix until the coconut is a uniform bright yellow. Transfer to a bowl. Add another cup of the coconut to the bowl and turn the mixer on low. Add 6 drops of yellow food coloring and 4 drops of red food coloring and mix until the coconut is a uniform reddish orange (add a few more drops of each if the color is not vibrate enough). Transfer the coconut to a separate bowl. Wash and dry out the standing mixer bowl and add the remaining 1 cup coconut. Turn the mixer on low and add 6 to 8 drops of blue food coloring. Mix until the coconut is a uniform bright blue. Transfer to a third bowl. In a medium bowl, mix together the chocolate candies, fruit candies and nonpareils. Set aside. Using a 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out a well in each cupcake (reserve the cut-out top pieces of each cupcake). Use a small spoon to scoop out the wells, being careful not to go all the way through the bottom of the cupcakes. Fill each cupcake well about two-thirds full with the mixed candy, about a heaping tablespoon. Cover the holes with the reserved cut-out tops. Frost the cupcakes with the vanilla frosting. Press some of the blue coconut onto the outer third of the top of each cupcake to form a stripe, then press some of the yellow coconut in the center third and finally the orange coconut in the final third. You should have 3 equal stripes on the top of each cupcake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 44347,&quot;Baked Alaska 1 quart chocolate ice cream 1 quart coffee ice cream Sponge cake, recipe follows 1 pint strawberries, tops removed and sliced Meringue, recipe follows Warm glossy chocolate sauce, recipe follows 10 eggs 2 cups vegetable oil 4 cups sugar Vanilla extract, to taste 6 cups flour 2 tablespoons baking powder 2 cups milk 1 cup egg whites, room temperature 1 cup sugar 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate 7 ounces semisweet chocolate 3/8 cup light corn syrup 1/2 cup hot water Instructions: Sponge: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the eggs, vegetable oil and sugar until light. Add the vanilla. Sift together the flour and baking powder. In 3 additions, alternately add the flour and baking powder with the milk. Pour the batter into a greased, parchment-lined jellyroll pan. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until it springs back to the touch. When the cake is cool, invert from the pan onto a piece of parchment paper. Halve the cake lengthwise. Place a 2 quart bowl on top of 1/2 the cake and cut around the bottom of the bowl. Reserve the rest of the cake. Set the cake round on a parchment lined sheet pan. Remove ice cream from freezer. Using a large spoon mound the chocolate ice cream on top of the cake round. Layer the strawberries on top of the chocolate ice cream. Top and continue to mound the coffee ice cream. You can make as many layers as you like. If the ice cream begins to soften too much, return to the freezer until firm and continue. Cut the remaining cake into triangles and cover the mound of ice cream with cake. Return cake to the freezer for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. Meringue: Whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the sugar and beat until stiff and glossy. As soon as the meringue is ready, remove the ice cream cake from the freezer. Spread the meringue evenly over the dessert in a swirling motion or pipe decoratively. Return to the freezer for at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. Warm Glossy Chocolate Sauce: In the top half of a double boiler, combine the 2 chocolates over simmering water. Stir constantly until melted, then whisk in the corn syrup and water. Whisk until smooth and shiny. When ready to serve, heat the oven to 500 degrees. Remove the dessert from the freezer and place it in the oven. Bake 3 to 4 minutes or until browned. You can also use a blow torch to brown the meringue. After it is browned it&#39;s possible to freeze dessert again overnight before serving. Serve in slices with warm glossy chocolate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 44348,&quot;Mini Grilled Gruyere and Ham Sammies with Cornichons 2 cups cornichon pickles, plus 24, halved lengthwise 12 slices Pullman loaf, or other tight crumb white bread 1 1/2 cups Dijon mustard 12 thick slices Gruyere 6 slices ham 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature Instructions: In a food processor, finely chop 2 cups cornichons until they are a coarse paste. Spread one side of each piece of bread with Dijon. Top each piece of bread with a slice of Gruyere. Place the ham on half of the pieces of the bread and cheese. Spread the cornichon paste on the other half of the pieces of bread and cheese. Preheat a griddle or saute pan. Close the sandwiches and press to secure. Butter the outsides of all the pieces of bread. Place the sandwiches on the griddle or pan and cook until the bread is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Turnover and repeat this process. When the sammies are golden brown and crisp on each side, remove them from the griddle and neatly cut the crusts off the bread. Cut each crustless sandwich into 8 neat mini sammies.

Add red onion, garlic and ginger, stirring continuously so as not to burn. After 2 minutes add the curry paste, habanero and bay leaves until well incorporated. Add peppers and stir again cooking for 2 minutes. Add zucchini and squash and cook for another 2 minutes. The mixture should be well coated at this point. If it starts to burn, lower the heat and add a little water to stop the burning on the bottom of the pan. Add the coconut milk and cilantro. Salt and pepper to taste. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, for at least a 1/2 hour, stirring occasionally. During the cooking process you can adjust the balance of moisture by adding water or coconut milk so the consistency stays stew like. Adjust the salt and pepper to taste. Serve over rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44352,&quot;Grilled Fennel, Tomato and Baby Greens Salad with Bacon 1 large fennel bulb, trimmed, cut through core into 1/3-inch-thick slices Olive oil Salt and ground black pepper, to taste 1 pkg. (7.75 oz.) DOLE? Extra Veggie? with Grape Tomatoes 3 to 4 slices bacon, cooked, drained and crumbled Red Wine Vinaigrette, recipe follows Red Wine Vinaigrette: 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 garlic clove 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1/3 cup olive oil 1/2 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano crushed Instructions: Heat grill to medium-high heat.

Combine both beans in the bowl of a food processor, along with the onion, parsley, cilantro, garlic, cumin, baking soda, salt, ground coriander, and cayenne, and pulse, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until a coarse paste is formed. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water, if needed to make the paste hold together - you will have to remove the lid of the processor and check this by pressing some of the mixture together between your fingers. Add a bit more water, if necessary. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to rest for about 30 minutes. Preheat at least 3-inches of oil in a saucepan or a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. Scoop the fava-chick pea mixture into 1 1/2 to 2-tablespoon increments and, using your hands, shape into balls or patties about 1 1/2 to 2-inches in diameter. Gently lower the falafel balls into the hot oil (these are fragile - do not drop them or they will fall apart.) Fry the falafel in batches until crisp and brown, turning to promote even browning, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer to paper-lined plates to drain briefly before serving with the Tahini Sauce and pita bread, if using. Make the sauce by combining the tahini paste, lemon juice, and garlic in a bowl and stirring to combine. Add the water a little at a time as needed to form a smooth, creamy sauce approximately the thickness of heavy cream. (Note that the sauce might appear to separate for a bit before enough water has been added; just keep adding more water bit by bit and stirring until the sauce comes together.) Season to taste with salt and more lemon juice, if necessary. Transfer to a nonreactive container and refrigerate until ready to serve the falafel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 44354,&quot;Rotten Apple Punch Apple cider (adjust the amount for the number of people you plan to serve; we suggest at least 1 gallon) 5 (1/2-cup) containers Red and green food coloring 10 to 15 gummy worms Instructions: Pour apple cider into all 5 (1/2-cup) containers, stopping about 1/2-inch from the top. Add 2 drops of red and 1 drop of green food coloring to each container and stir until the colors have blended. Hang 2 or 3 gummy worms around the edge of each dish and place the dishes in the freezer. If you use more than 3 worms, the rotten apples won&#39;t float as well. Freeze until the rotten apples are solid. Just before serving, slip the frozen wormy apples out of the dishes by setting them briefly in a few inches of warm water in your sink. Float the rotten apples in a large punch bowl filled with apple cider. For added creepiness, drape the gummy worms over the edges of your serving bowl as shown. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Lambrusco]&quot; 44355,&quot;Sage and Squash Pizza with Bacon 3 slices thick-cut bacon, diced 1 cup diced butternut squash (about 6 ounces) 1 12-ounce ball pizza dough, at room temperature All-purpose flour, for dusting 1/2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese 3/4 cup shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage, plus 1/4 cup leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 cups baby arugula 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500? F. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel\u2013lined plate, leaving the fat in the pan. Add the squash to the skillet and cook until soft and browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Cover an inverted large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Stretch the pizza dough into a 12-inch oval on a lightly floured surface. Transfer to the baking sheet, prick the top with a fork and bake until the dough just begins to turn golden and looks dry, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven. Mix together the ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella, the Parmesan, chopped sage and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Spread on the crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with the bacon, squash and sage leaves. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella. Return to the oven and bake until the crust is golden, about 10 minutes. Slide the pizza onto a cutting board, sprinkle with more Parmesan and let stand 5 minutes. Toss the arugula in a bowl with the olive oil and vinegar; season with salt and pepper.

To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 44360,&quot;Bacon and Kimchi Noodle Stir-Fry Kosher salt 2 bunches broccolini (about 12 ounces), trimmed and halved lengthwise 1 cup kimchi, drained and roughly chopped, plus 2 tablespoons brine, plus finely chopped kimchi for topping 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar 1 clove garlic, grated 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 6 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped 1 red onion, halved and sliced 8 ounces thin dried Chinese egg noodles 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.

Cover the fish pieces with the juice of 1/2 lime and leave them in the refrigerator to marinate for around 30 minutes. Cut the tips off of the bananas, and quarter (lengthwise, then crosswise), or cut through their skins down to the edges, north, south, east, and west, and then steep them in a bowl covered with just-boiled water for 15 to 20 minutes. Set the mackerel in a medium saucepan, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, and cook, covered, until completely tender, about 6 to 8 minutes. Lift the fish out from the cooking liquid with a slotted spoon. Remove, and discard the bones and skin, if desired, and break the flesh into good meaty flakes. Sprinkle the chunks with the allspice, the remaining lime juice, and season with salt, and pepper, to taste. Remove the skin from the bananas. It isn&#39;t easy, and you&#39;ll need a small, sharp knife to help you at times, but try to pry it off with your hands. Now put the bananas into a pan with enough water to cover. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the water, and bring to a boil. Cook the bananas, covered, on a rolling boil until tender, around 15 minutes. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons oil into a large skillet over medium heat. Gently fry the onions until softened, then add the tomatoes, garlic, cl, thyme, and season with salt, and pepper, and cook until everything has softened. Add the mackerel, gently stir, and heat through. Lift the bananas out of their water with a slotted spoon. You&#39;ll notice brown pieces on them. Though most will be in the water, which will also be brown. Brush off any brown bits and cut the banana into diagonal slices. Stir the banana into the mackerel and serve sprinkled with the cilantro and accompanied by lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 44373,&quot;Classic Swiss Three-Cheese Fondue 1 garlic clove, peeled 1 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 8 ounces Gruyere cheese, rind trimmed and discarded, and shredded (about 2 1/2 cups) 8 ounces Emmentaler cheese, rind trimmed and discarded, and shredded (about 2 1/2 cups) 3 ounces Appenzeller cheese, cut into cubes (about 1/2 cup) 4 teaspoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon kirsch A few gratings of fresh nutmeg Freshly ground pepper, to taste Instructions: What to dip: crusty mixed grain bread, French or Italian bread, cut into bite-sized cubes (leave a piece of crust on each cube); Cooked chicken breast, skin and bone removed, cut into bite-sized cubes; cooked garlic sausage or knockwurst, cut into bite-sized wedges; boiled new potatoes; asparagus spears, broccoli florets or cauliflower florets prepared for dipping.

Place the gingersnap crumbs in a large bowl and drizzle half of the melted butter all over. Using your hand or a silicone spatula, mix thoroughly. Add more butter a little at a time until you can make a fist with the crumbs that retains its shape but is easily broken (not too dry, and not too wet). Press the crumbs tightly into a 9-inch pie plate. A deep pie plate is much more suited to this task. Bake until the crust feels quite firm to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside and let cool. For the pumpkin filling: Whisk together the milk, brown sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil for 3 minutes, whisking constantly. In a large bowl, beat the eggs. Gradually add half of the hot milk mixture to the eggs, whisking constantly. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until thick, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the pumpkin puree and salt. Pour into the pie shell and chill until set, 2 to 3 hours. For the rum cheesecake topping: Cream together the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the cream, rum extract, egg, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla bean seeds. Mix until well combined. Use a silicone spatula to fill a pastry piping bag with the filling. Cut off the tip. Pipe the cheesecake over the pumpkin filling, minding not to get too close to the crumb crust. Use a spatula to smooth out the topping to just meet the crust edge, being careful not to drag crumbs over the surface. Bake until the top is glossy and the center still wiggles, about 45 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 44387,&quot;Celery, Grapefruit and Olive Salad 4 stalks celery and their leaves, chopped 1 red grapefruit, supremed, sections halved 1 green onion, finely chopped (greens only) 1/4 cup chopped black olives 2 tablespoons grapefruit juice 1/2 teaspoon sugar 2 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place the celery, celery leaves, grapefruit, green onions and olives in a medium bowl.

Taste for seasoning. Cook the green beans: Fill a medium saucepot with water and bring to a boil. Fill a large bowl halfway with ice cubes and add some cold water. Place a colander squarely inside the bowl to make an ice bath. (The colander will keep you from having to pick the beans out from among the ice cubes.) Add salt to the boiling water until it tastes like seawater. Plunge the beans into the boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the green beans from the water and transfer to the colander inside the ice bath. Move them around gently so the ice water penetrates the beans and accelerates the cooling process. When fully cooled, drain and arrange in a single layer on a kitchen towel to drain any excess moisture. Make the salad: If the green beans are long, cut in half. Toss the green beans in the dressing and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.

Fry the bacon until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove to a plate and drain all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the Dutch oven. Reserve the bacon. Add the yams, garlic, thyme, onion, oregano, cumin, coriander and then a good pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the onions have started to soften and the yams are coated in the bacon grease, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 5 cups of the broth and bring to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are soft, about 15 minutes. For the pistachio crumble: While the soup cooks, crumble the bacon and toss with the pistachios, parsley, oregano and turmeric until well combined. Set aside. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. Thin with the remaining stock as needed. Serve the soup into bowls and swirl in a spoonful of sour cream to each serving. Top with the crumble and some parsley leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 44396,&quot;Peach Baklava Icebox Cake 2 ripe medium peaches, cut into 1/4-inch slices (about 1 1/2 cups) 6 tablespoons honey, plus more for drizzling<br> 1 1/2 cups plain 2 percent Greek yogurt 1/2 cup heavy cream 6 graham crackers (full sheets) 1/4 cup toasted pistachios, chopped Instructions: Add the peach slices to a medium bowl. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the honey over the peaches and toss until coated. Set aside for at least 30 minutes. Beat the yogurt, heavy cream and remaining 4 tablespoons honey in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.

In a large, wide-necked measuring cup, measure out the flour and add the baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir to combine. In another cup, measure the milk, beat in the eggs and then the slightly cooled butter, and pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients, whisking as you do so. Or just put everything in a blender and blitz. In the vegetable oil, fry the bacon (cut into half crosswise) or the pancetta strips until crisp, remove to paper towels and cover with more paper towels (not because I&#39;m fat-phobic - as if! - but because this will help them keep their requisite crispness). Now, heat either a griddle or nonstick frying pan, smear with a small bit of butter and then start frying. I just pour small amounts straight from the cup (but you could use a 1/4-cup measure if you prefer) so that you have wiggly circumferenced disks. When you see bubbles erupting on the surface, turn the pancakes over and cook for a couple of minutes, if that, on the other side. Or use a blini pan and, as just described, turn when the bubbles break through to the uncooked surface. There is a Russian saying to the effect that the first pancake is always botched, so be prepared to sacrifice the initial offering to unceremonious stoveside gobbling. Pile the pancakes onto plate, wigwam with pieces of crispy bacon or pancetta and dribble or pour over, depending on greed and capacity, that clear, brown, woodily fragrant syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 44400,&quot;Sonoma County Mojito 1 lime, cut into 6 wedges 3 black grapes 3 green grapes 3 red grapes Several fresh mint leaves Ice 2 ounces simple syrup Sonoma County white wine (any varietal) Silver rum Soda water Instructions: Add the limes, grapes and mint leaves to a pint glass.

Beer Pairing Blue Moon® Spring Blonde Wheat Ale, with its subtle flavors of orange and lemon peel, pairs nicely with seafood dishes. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees F. To make the tomatillo dressing, peel and wash the tomatillos. Roast them in the oven for approximately 20 minutes or until soft and blistering. Put in a food processor or blender; puree with cilantro and sugar, add orange juice and then add mayo. Season with salt and pepper and refrigerate. To make the paprika-braised peppers and onions, saute onions in a large saute pan in oil until soft. Add peppers and beans and saute one minute more. Add paprika and orange juice. Cook an additional 30 seconds. Remove from heat and let cool. To make the crab mix, mix orange juice, lemon juice, diced paprika-braised peppers and onions, mayo, crumbled Ritz crackers, and crab.

The friends and family you make it for will be green with envy to be able to make something so delicious! Place sausages in a skillet and add wine and 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to the pan. Place pan over medium-high heat and let the wine reduce and evaporate, 15 to 18 minutes. Eventually, the casings will crisp up and the wine and oil will glaze the casings. Place a pot of water on to boil for the pasta. Salt water and cook to al dente. Heads up: you will need 1 1/2 cups, a couple of ladles, starchy cooking water just before you drain the orecchiette. Toast hazelnuts 5 minutes over medium-low heat in a small skillet. Cool a few minutes. Place the chives, garlic, tarragon, salt and pepper and nuts into food processor and turn it on. Stream in about 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and process the ingredients into a smooth but thick sauce. Transfer the sauce to a bowl and stir in the cheese. The color is stronger if you stir rather than process the cheese into the sauce. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium high to high heat. Add greens, minced garlic and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Sear greens, tossing them as they wilt down, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cooking liquids to pesto in bowl then add pasta and greens and toss to coat the pasta and let the flavors absorb, 1 minute. Serve 2 braised sausages with lots of greens alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 44404,&quot;Preserved Lemons 10 lemons (enough to fill a jar 3/4 full) Rock salt Large glass jar or plastic container with tops (no metal lids) Instructions: Soak the lemons for 2 days before preparing this recipe. Change the water twice. Remove the nut end of the lemon (the end that attaches the lemon to the tree). Slice a cross two-thirds of the way up the lemon. Fill with rock salt, don&#39;t be shy. Place into glass jar. Repeat this process until there are enough lemons compacted into the glass jar. Make sure there is enough room (about 1/4 of the jar) left at the top to accommodate any excess juices from the lemons. Secure tightly with the lid and place in a cool dark place for at least a month. Some people add 1/2 cup of fresh water to encourage the process of preservation, with the addition of olive oil to act as a sealant on top of the lemons. These last two processes are not necessary. Some people also add cinnamon sticks and cloves or black peppercorns, it entirely depends on your individual taste. Simple is best. The lemons will then be preserved and ready to use. They last for about 4 years. Remember not to use a jar with a metal lid as this will affect the preserving process and the metal may erode. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 44405,&quot;Steak Bites with Bloody Mary Dipping Sauce 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1 small onion, finely chopped 1/2 cup vodka 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce 1 cup tomato sauce 1 rounded tablespoon prepared horseradish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/3 pounds beef sirloin cut into large bite-sized pieces, about 1-inch squares Steak seasoning blend or coarse salt and black pepper 6 to 8-inch bamboo skewers Instructions: Heat a small saucepan over medium heat.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the butter in a large (12-inch) saut pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, and bell pepper and cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Place the fish on top of the vegetables and add the cream, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 6 to 12 minutes (depending on the thickness of the cod), until the fish is just cooked. Set aside in the pan for 10 minutes, then flake the fish in large pieces with a fork. Put 2 cups of the panko in a large bowl. Add the cod mixture, including the cooking liquid, the dill, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon zest, eggs, lobster, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper and mix gently. Using a 2 1/4-inch ice cream scoop as a measure, shape the mixture into 14 (3-inch) fish cakes. Place the remaining 2 cups of panko on a plate and coat the cakes all over, patting the coating to adhere. Wipe the saut pan clean with a paper towel and heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in the pan over medium heat. Place 5 cakes in the pan and cook for 5 minutes on each side, until nicely browned on both sides. Transfer the cakes to a sheet pan and keep them warm in the oven for up to 15 minutes. Repeat, adding more butter and oil, until the entire mixture is cooked. Serve hot with the Rmoulade Sauce. Place the mayonnaise, cornichons, mustard, vinegar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse a few times until the cornichons are finely chopped (not pureed). Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 44409,&quot;Sin City Dirty Chips 8 ounces kettle cooked potato chips 8 ounces leftover or store-bought barbeque pulled pork 8 ounces Jalapeno Hollandaise Sauce, recipe follows 4 ounces Mexican Cotija cheese 1 ounce fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 2 sticks butter 4 egg yolks 2 tablespoons champagne vinegar 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice 1 small fire-roasted jalapeno, chopped Pinch cumin Pinch kosher salt Instructions: Arrange the potato chips on a medium serving dish, allowing them to overlap slightly. Top the chips with the pulled pork, then top with the Jalapeno Hollandaise Sauce. Sprinkle the Cotija cheese and cilantro over the top of the dish and serve immediately. In a small saucepan over low heat, bring the butter to a boil, being careful not to scorch the butter. In a blender, mix the egg yolks and champagne vinegar on high speed. With the blender running, add the melted butter in a slow, steady stream. The sauce should be somewhat thick and custard-like; if it is too thick, add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to thin. Stir in the lime juice, roasted jalapeno, cumin and salt. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Malbec]&quot; 44410,&quot;Eggs Benny with Smoked Paprika Hollandaise and Potato Hash Extra-virgin olive oil 2 russet potatoes, scrubbed and diced into 1/2-inch cubes 1/2 onion, thinly sliced 1/2 red bell pepper, julienned 1 garlic clove, minced Kosher salt 8 ounces nduja 4 egg yolks Juice of 1 lemon 1/2 cup clarified butter, warmed 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika Kosher salt 2 tablespoons white vinegar 4 large eggs 2 English muffins, toasted Instructions: For the potato hash: Coat a large cast-iron skillet with olive oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and cook, turning occasionally on all sides, until they begin to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the onions and bell peppers and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until they begin to brown and the potatoes start to get crispy. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Season to taste with kosher salt. For the eggs benny with smoked paprika: Cook the nduja in a small saute pan over medium-high heat until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks and lemon juice in a heatproof glass bowl over a double boiler until pale, foamy and thickened. Very gradually stream the clarified butter into the egg yolks while whisking. If the sauce gets too thick, you can add some hot water a little at a time until it reaches the right consistency. The sauce should be thick but still flow. Season with the smoked paprika and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Fill a large stockpot halfway with water and bring to a rolling boil, then lower the heat until there are no bubbles. Place the vinegar into a small bowl and crack the eggs into the vinegar; the vinegar will help the egg whites set. Swirl a slotted spoon in the water to create a vortex and pour the bowl of vinegar and eggs into the center of the vortex. Poach for about 2 minutes. Using the slotted spoon, remove the eggs and place the spoon on a towel to catch the excess liquid. To assemble, spread the nduja on each of the toasted English muffins, place a poached egg on each muffin and smother with the smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. Serve alongside the potato hash. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 44411,&quot;Shish Hold-The-Kabob: Spiced Lamb Chops on Sauteed Peppers and Onions with Garlic and Mint Couscous 8 rib lamb chops Coarse salt and coarse black pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/3 palm full 1 teaspoon ground coriander, 1/3 palm full 1 teaspoon sweet paprika, 1/3 palm full 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 green bell peppers, seeded and cut into 1 inch pieces 1 large yellow onion, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 cup grape tomatoes 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 1 1/2 cups couscous Handful golden raisins 5 or 6 sprigs fresh mint, finely chopped, about 3 tablespoons 3 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted Instructions: Cover the chops with wax paper or plastic and whack each chop with the heel of your palm to flatten it out.

Add the flour and dump the dough on a nice rolling table, then knead the dough just until it is all mixed and there are no lumps, making sure the dough can hold shapes. Pinch off a piece about the size of a fist, then roll it out into a nice long snake that is the diameter of a quarter. Cut on the bias making about 1-inch cuts, and place on a parchment-lined sheet pan dusted with flour. Freeze for at least 6 hours and up to 8 hours. For the butter bacon onions: Cook the bacon in a saut pan over medium heat until cooked and all the fat is rendered down. Transfer the bacon to a plate and cook the onions in the rendered bacon fat over medium heat until nice and caramelized. Add the bacon back to the pan along with the butter. Stir until the butter is melted and blended. (This can be made ahead of time, then cooled and used as needed.) To finish, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add about 25 frozen gnocchi and cook until they float to the top, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate pan, heat up 5 ounces butter bacon onion sauce. Strain the gnocchi and add to the sauce. Cook until the gnocchi are coated all over, about 1 minute, then garnish with the Parmesan and chiffonade of basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 44416,&quot;Green Goddess Shrimp Dip in a Sourdough Bowl 1 pound cooked shrimp, tails removed 1 8-ounce package cream cheese 1/4 cup fresh dill, plus more for topping 1/4 cup fresh tarragon 1/4 cup fresh parsley 3 scallions (white and light green parts), roughly chopped 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sour cream Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Hot sauce 1 round or oval loaf sourdough bread (about 8 inches) Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Crackers and/or crudites, for serving Instructions: Pulse the shrimp in a food processor until finely chopped but not pureed.

In a saute pan, saute the onions in the bourbon until soft. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. While the water heats, fill a large bowl with ice water and put a strainer in it. Drop the green beans into the boiling water and cook until crisp tender. Remove from the pot and immediately plunge the green beans into the ice bath to stop the cooking. Drain well. Toss the shiitakes with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and spread across a baking sheet. Roast for 8 minutes and remove. Reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees F. Toss the halved tomatoes with oil, salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet cut-side up and bake for 30 to 40 minutes. Reserve for garnish. Coat the kale with oil, salt and pepper. Bake in the oven with the tomatoes until crispy, about 20 minutes. Reserve for garnish. In a small pot, heat the mushroom broth over medium heat until just under a simmer. While it heats, melt the butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook until golden brown, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes. Slowly add the heated mushroom broth to the butter and flour mixture, whisking constantly. Cook until it starts to boil. Add the goat cheese, cream, thyme and some salt and pepper. Toss the green beans and mushrooms in the warm sauce. Grease a 9- by 13-inch flameproof casserole dish. Layer the dish with cooked rice and top with the green bean mixture. Cover with the breadcrumbs and bake for 15 minutes. If additional browning is desired after baking, place under the broiler. Top with the roasted tomatoes and crispy kale. Eat.

Return a list of the wine types only. recipe: Creamy Tomato Soup 1 tablespoon butter 1 medium onion, chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 can (14 ounces) d&quot; 44421,&quot;Build Me Up, Peanut Butter Cup 12 paper muffin cups 1 (9.7 ounce) bar bittersweet chocolate, chopped (recommended: Scharfenberger) 1 cup your favorite peanut butter 1/2 cup powdered sugar Pinch grey salt 12 to 15 dried banana chips Instructions: Cut the top half off of the muffin cups so that they are shallower. Reserve 1/4 cup of the chopped chocolate. Pour the rest into a glass bowl and melt them in the microwave: Microwave at 50 percent power for 1 minute. Stir the chips gently, and let them sit for a minute or so. If the chocolate needs more melting, microwave those chippies again at half power for 30 seconds. Stir gently. Continue the process, stirring gently as you go. But be very careful not to overcook the chocolate. Temper the melted chocolate by stirring in the reserved 1/4 cup of chopped chocolate chips as it cools. This will &#39;re-emulsify&#39; the chocolate and enable it to harden at room temperature. Using a teaspoon, spoon a portion of the chocolate into the middle of a muffin cup. Draw the chocolate up the edges of the cup with the back of the spoon (or you can paint the chocolate on with a small paintbrush). Coat the entire inside of the muffin cup with chocolate and place it into a muffin tin. Repeat with the remaining muffin cups and then put the whole muffin tin in the refrigerator so that the chocolate hardens. Combine the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and salt in a mixer. Pour the mixture into a resealable plastic bag and seal. When the chocolate in the muffin cups has hardened, pop the sweetened peanut butter into the microwave on full power for 1 minute. This will soften up the peanut butter so that it easily flows into the cups. Cut a corner off the edge of the plastic bag. You can use this to pipe the peanut butter into each of the chocolate-coated cups. Put a banana chip on top of each cup. Put the candy in the refrigerator to harden the peanut butter. This should take 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 44422,&quot;Sugar Crusted Breton Butter Cake 1/2-ounce fresh yeast 1/4 cup warm water 2 1/4 cups flour Pinch salt About 10 tablespoons lukewarm water 8 tablespoons (1 stick) best-quality unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup strawberries 1 egg white* 1 teaspoon water 1/2 cup superfine sugar Instructions: In a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. When dissolved, mix in 1/2 cup of the flour with your fingers, rubbing them together to break up any lumps. Cover with a barely dampened towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the remaining 1 3/4 cups of flour and the salt. Add the yeast mixture and mix together with the tips of your fingers. Gradually sprinkle in the lukewarm water, mixing with your fingers to make a pliable dough. If the water is all mixed in and the dough still seems dry, add another tablespoon of water. Knead until smooth, about 4 minutes. Return the dough to the large bowl, cover with the damp towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and dust the top with flour. Roll into a rectangle about the same size as a sheet of paper (8 1/2 by 11-inches). Turn the rectangle so that it is vertical to your body. Dot the lower 2/3 of the dough with the pieces of butter and sprinkle with sugar. Working as though you are folding a letter, and folding the top down first, fold the dough in thirds. Roll out the folded dough into a rectangle, 8 1/2 by 11 inches. Fold in 3 again in the same way, cover with the damp towel, and let rest 15 minutes. Roll into a rectangle again, fold in 3, cover with the damp towel, and let rest 15 minutes. One last time, roll into a rectangle, fold in 3, cover with the damp towel, and let rest 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400-degrees F. Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan. Roll the dough into a circle about 9 inches in diameter. Transfer to the prepared pan. Using a sharp knife or razor blade, make a cross-hatch pattern across the top of the cake (like a tic-tac-toe board). Bake for 20 minutes, brushing the top every 5 minutes with the melted butter that oozes out from the cake. Sprinkle with the confectioners&#39; sugar and continue baking (do not baste) until golden brown on the top but still moist inside, about 10 minutes more. Let cool on a rack until the crust is caramelized and slightly crispy. Wash strawberries in cold water, allow the berries to drain. Combine the egg white and water and foam up mixture with a whisk. Dip the strawberries in the foam and then dip in superfine sugar. Arrange the frosted strawberries in the center of the cake. Serve at room temperature or slightly warm, cut into wedges. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.

Prepare the springform pan by coating it in a thin layer with 2 tablespoons of the softened butter. Add the cocoa powder to the pan and tap the sides to coat the bottom and sides evenly. Discard any excess cocoa powder. Put the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven on the center rack until just fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer immediately to a kitchen towel to stop them from cooking. Use the towel to rub off the skins. Set aside to cool. Lower the oven to 350 degrees F. Fill a 1- to 2-quart pot with about 1 inch of water and bring it to a bare simmer over medium heat. Place the dark chocolate pieces into a heatproof bowl and set it over the pot and simmering water (this is a bain-marie). The water should not touch the bottom of the bowl. Let the chocolate melt, and then stir gently. Remove from the heat when melted. Chop the hazelnuts into small pieces using a chef&#39;s knife or a food processor. Make sure you don&#39;t turn them into powder. Whip the egg whites with an electric mixer with the salt until they are almost at stiff peaks. Try not to over-whip. Mix together the remaining 5 tablespoons butter with the chocolate hazelnut spread in a large bowl with a wooden spoon. Stir in the espresso. Add the yolks and stir briskly to combine. Stir in the chopped hazelnuts and melted chocolate. Add one-fourth of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate hazelnut mixture and stir to lighten the batter. Then gently fold the rest of the egg whites into the batter in 3 additions. Don&#39;t over-fold. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake on the center rack of the oven until the sides of the cake start releasing from edges of the pan, 40 minutes. This cake is almost a hazelnut fudge, so no need to poke with a toothpick to check if the inside is ready or not. The cake will come out of the oven nice and fluffy and souffled, but it will deflate to half the size during its cool-off period. Serve garnished with some powdered sugar and whipped or cream or gelato, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 44453,&quot;Buffalo Burgers 1 1/2 pounds ground buffalo 1/2 pound ground chuck 1 medium onion, finely chopped, about 1 cup 3 tablespoons sun-dried tomato paste 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 4 hamburger buns, for serving Instructions: Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high.

Heat the cream, half-and-half, vanilla bean, and 5 spice powder in a medium saucepan over medium heat just to a boil. Immediately turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar in a large bowl just until combined. Whisking constantly, gradually pour in the hot cream mixture. Strain the mixture into an 8 by 8-inch ovenproof baking pan and smooth over. Place the pan in a hot water bath. Bake in the center of the oven until set but not too firm (it will cook a little more as it cools), 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the water bath and let cool 15 minutes. Tightly cover with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic does not touch the surface of the custard. (The recipe can be made up to this point and kept refrigerated up to 3 days in advance.) Up to 4 hours before serving, fill Asian soupspoons with the chilled cooked custard by scooping each spoon into the pan of custard. Round the tops with a small spatula, or a butter knife. Keep cold. Right before serving, sprinkle the entire surface with a layer of coarse sugar and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining spoons. Torch or broil the spoons until the sugar is melted and well browned. Let cool 1 minute before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44459,&quot;Red Velvet-Cherry Cake Roll Unsalted butter, for the baking sheet 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 cups cherry-flavored cola 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1/3 cup buttermilk 3 large eggs 1 tablespoon red food coloring 2 teaspoons almond extract Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting 4 ounces cream cheese, softened 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream 2 teaspoons almond extract 1/3 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Beat in the egg yolks and almond extract until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to medium low and gradually beat in the flour mixture until the dough just comes together. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces and place each in a separate small bowl. With gloved hands or a rubber spatula, use the food coloring to tint one piece red, one yellow and one green. Starting with the green dough on a piece of parchment, shape it into a rectangle that&#39;s about 10 inches long and 2 1/2 inches wide, using the parchment and a bench scraper to make the dough as rectangular and even as possible. Repeat with the yellow and red dough on separate sheets of parchment. Using the parchment to help lift the dough, carefully invert the yellow rectangle on top of the green, pressing gently to adhere. Remove and discard the parchment. Finally, use the parchment to carefully lift and invert the red rectangle on top of the yellow, pressing gently to adhere; remove and discard the parchment. Use the bench scraper to even out all the sides. Wrap the entire log of dough in plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 1 hour, or refrigerate overnight.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment.<br> Trim the ends of the dough log with a sharp knife, then slice crosswise into 3/8-inch-thick rectangles. Arrange about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets and refrigerate until ready to bake, at least 15 minutes.<br> Bake one baking sheet at a time until the cookies are just set around the edges and golden on the bottom, about 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the chocolate icing: Once the cookies have cooled, combine the chocolate, cream and butter in a medium heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Stir with a small silicone spatula until melted and smooth, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan and stir in the raspberry extract; let cool 5 minutes.<br> Dip each cookie at an angle into the chocolate icing and coat about one-third of the way up, letting any excess drip back into the bowl. Once all the cookies are dipped, wiggle a small offset spatula through the chocolate coating on each to create ripples. Let set, about 35 minutes. The cookies will keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44461,&quot;Southern Biscuits 2 cups flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons shortening 1 cup buttermilk, chilled Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using your fingertips, rub butter and shortening into dry ingredients until mixture looks like crumbs. (The faster the better, you don&#39;t want the fats to melt.) Make a well in the center and pour in the chilled buttermilk. Stir just until the dough comes together. The dough will be very sticky. Turn dough onto floured surface, dust top with flour and gently fold dough over on itself 5 or 6 times. Press into a 1-inch thick round. Cut out biscuits with a 2-inch cutter, being sure to push straight down through the dough. Place biscuits on baking sheet so that they just touch. Reform scrap dough, working it as little as possible and continue cutting. (Biscuits from the second pass will not be quite as light as those from the first, but hey, that&#39;s life.) Bake until biscuits are tall and light gold on top, 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 44462,&quot;Cookie Bouquet Cookies: 1 (1-pound) bag sugar cookie dough mix 1 stick butter or margarine 1 egg 1 (1-pound) box confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons meringue powder 1/2 cup water Instructions: Cookies: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Using a whisk, add the milk in a steady stream and cook, whisking constantly, until thick and smooth, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the salt, pepper, cayenne, and 2 cups of the cheese, and stir well. Add the noodles, cooked sausage and vegetables, and stir well to combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish. In a mixing bowl, combine the remaining 1 cup of cheese with the breadcrumbs and remaining 2 teaspoons of Essence. Sprinkle over the macaroni and bake until golden brown and bubbly, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container.

Line a large baking sheet or pizza pan with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil. Place a 4.5-inch diameter bowl upside down in the center of the baking dish and use it as a guide (it will be the center, empty area of your wreath). Arrange triangular sections of the crescent dough on the parchment in a circle around the bowl with the long points facing outward as the \rays\ and the wide bases in the center with the edges overlapping. Brush the jalape?o jelly on the dough. Remove the bowl. In a small bowl, mix the ham, Gruyere and pepper jack, then layer the mixture on the dough, creating a ring around the center of the circle. Pull the points of dough from the outer edge over the filling and tuck under the center rim of the dough circle. The filling will show and that&#39;s ok! Top with jalape?o slices all around. Bake, rotating halfway through, until golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before slicing to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gouda, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 44480,&quot;Roasted Garlic 2 plump heads garlic 1/2 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon salt Several grinds of fresh pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Slice off 3/4-inch from the pointy end of the garlic to expose a bit of each clove. Place garlic heads in center of a square of aluminum foil, cut side up. Sprinkle on a few drops of water, drizzle on the olive oil, and sprinkle on the salt and pepper. Pull corners of foil up to enclose and fold over to seal. Place package in oven and roast 50 to 60 minutes, until garlic cloves are soft and golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Squeeze out garlic pulp by squeezing head in half over a bowl. Spread on bread, use as base for dip or dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44481,&quot;Minestrone with Sauteed Croutons and Parmigiano-Reggiano 1/4 cup olive oil 2 cloves garlic, smashed 6 slices Italian bread, crusts removed and cut into 1/4-inch dice Salt 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 large red onion, chopped 2 large stalk celery, chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 large carrot, diced 1/4 pound pancetta, thinly sliced 1/2 head Savoy cabbage, finely sliced, blanched and drained 1/2 bunch Swiss chard, finely sliced 1 large waxy potato, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 4 cups water 2 cups chicken stock 3 medium tomatoes, seeded and diced 1 bouquet garni (rosemary sprig, 4 thyme sprigs, 1 bay leaf, bunch parsley) 3 cups cooked cannellini beans 1 cup spinach leaves, coarsely chopped Salt and pepper Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Instructions: Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the garlic and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, to flavor the oil. Remove the garlic, add the bread cubes and toss to coat. Saute until golden brown on all sides, season lightly with salt. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels. Heat oil in a 4 quart pot, add the onion, celery, garlic, carrot and pancetta and cook until soft. Add the cabbage, chard, potato, water, broth, tomatoes and bouquet garni. Bring the soup to a gentle simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Place half of the beans (1 1/2 cups) in a food processor and process until smooth. Add the puree and the whole beans to the simmering soup. Simmer the soup for about 5 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with sauteed croutons and cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 44482,&quot;Bourbon Peach Punch 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1 pinch ground cloves<br> 1 pound frozen peaches, thawed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 1 cup bourbon<br> Instructions: Fill a medium saucepan with 3 cups of water and add the sugar, cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the peaches and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer the peaches and about 1 cup of the liquid to a blender and blend until smooth (be careful when blending hot liquids). Transfer the blended liquid to a pitcher to cool slightly, then add the bourbon. Refrigerate until very cold. When ready to serve, add ice cubes to the pitcher and serve in rocks glasses with more ice. &quot;,&quot;[Bourbon, Muscadine, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 44483,&quot;Saag Paneer 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper Kosher salt 4 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil 12 ounces paneer (Indian cheese), cut into 1-inch cubes 1 16-ounce package frozen chopped spinach 1 medium white onion, finely chopped 1 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and minced (about 1 tablespoon) 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 large green serrano cl pepper (seeds removed if you don?t like it spicy!), finely chopped 2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon garam masala 1/2 cup plain yogurt, stirred until smooth Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk together the turmeric, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil. Drop in the cubes of paneer and gently toss. Let the cubes marinate while you get the rest of your ingredients together and prepped. Thaw the spinach in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish, 5 minutes, then transfer to a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out the excess liquid. Puree in a food processor until smooth. (Alternatively, you can chop it up very finely with your knife.) Set aside. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the paneer as the pan warms. In a couple of minutes, flip the paneer; each piece should be browned on one side. Fry another minute or so and then remove the paneer from the pan to a plate. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil to the pan. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, cl and a pinch of salt. Now here?s the important part: Saut the mixture until it?s evenly toffee-colored, which should take about 15 minutes. Don?t skip this step?this is the foundation of the dish! If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning, add a couple of tablespoons of water. Add the coriander, cumin and garam masala. If you haven?t already, sprinkle in a little water to keep the spices from burning. Cook, stirring often, until the raw scent of the spices cooks out and it all smells a bit more melodious, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the spinach and stir well, incorporating the spiced onion mixture into the spinach. Stir in a little salt and 1/2 cup water. Cook 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Stir in the yogurt a little at a time to keep it from curdling. Once the yogurt is well mixed into the spinach, add the paneer. Turn the heat back on, cover and cook until everything is warmed through, about 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44484,&quot;Asparagus with Hollandaise 1 bunch asparagus (about 1 pound) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg yolk 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice Pinch cayenne pepper plus more for sprinkling (optional) 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter Instructions: Hold both ends of a stalk of asparagus and bend it until it snaps. Then use a knife to trim the remainder of the bunch to match. Discard the trimmed stems. Bring a pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and cook, uncovered, until tender, 4 to 6 minutes depending on the thickness. Drain in a colander. Meanwhile, put the egg yolk, lemon juice and cayenne in a blender. Pulse a couple times to combine. Put the butter in a small microwave proof bowl and heat in a microwave until just melted. With the blender running, gradually add the melted butter into the egg to make a smooth frothy sauce. If the sauce is really thick blend in a teaspoon of lukewarm water to loosen it up. Transfer the asparagus to a plate. Pour the sauce over the top of the asparagus, sprinkle with more cayenne if desired and serve right away. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44485,&quot;Moussaka 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, diced 2 pounds ground lamb (leftover lamb can be ground and used) 2 tablespoons pureed garlic 4 tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced 1/2 cup brandy 1/2 cup tarragon vinegar 2 tablespoons ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon white pepper 3 large eggplants, with skins Coarse salt 2 cups olive oil 3 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced 1 cup (4 ounces) Chinese snow peas 2 leeks, white and light green parts, cut in half 3 celery stalks, peeled and cut into 1 inch lengths 2 cups mushroom caps 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon salt 9 eggs 2 1/4 cups heavy cream 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 recipe Pimento Sauce (recipe below) Instructions: For the meat filling: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over moderate heat. Cook onions until soft. Add lamb and garlic, and cook until browned, stirring occasionally. When meat is well browned, stir in remaining ingredients. Transfer to oven and bake until quite dry, about 45 minutes. Set aside to cool. For the eggplant: Cut eggplant into 1/4 inch slices, lengthwise. Sprinkle with salt on both sides, and let rest on a rack until moisture rises to surface, about 30 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry eggplant briefly, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Set aside to drain on paper towels. For the vegetable filling: Wash and dry all vegetables, then cut into fine julienne. Blanch carrots and peas in a small saucepan of boiling water just until water returns to a boil. Refresh in cold water, drain, and reserve. Melt butter in a medium skillet over moderate heat. Cook leeks along with salt 1 minute, add celery and cook 1 minute, then mushrooms and cook and additional minute. Set aside to cool. Toss all vegetables together in a large bowl and reserve. For the custard: Combine eggs, cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a bowl. Whisk until smooth. Pass through a strainer to remove any stray eggshells. Whisk in Parmesan cheese and set aside.<br> To assemble: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Stir one third of custard into meat filling. Combine remaining custard with vegetable filling.<br> In a 9 by 13 inch roasting pan or casserole, arrange one third eggplant slices to completely cover bottom. (The slices may overlap. That&#39;s fine.) Spread half meat filling on top, then cover with another third eggplant slices. Pour all vegetables in custard on top. Cover with remaining eggplant, then spread remaining meat mixture evenly over top.<br> Place the moussaka pan inside a larger roasting pan and pour boiling water into roasting pan until it rises halfway up the sides of the moussaka pan. Bake, uncovered, until custard is set in center, about 1 1/2 hours. You can test for doneness by sticking a knife in the center. If custard oozes out, cook longer.<br> Cut into individual portions and lift out with a spatula. Serve immediately, topped with Pimento Sauce. Moussaka can be made 1 or 2 days in advance and reheated in a 325 degree oven for 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 44486,&quot;Maple Mousse 2 cups heavy cream, whipped 1/2 vanilla bean, split 1/2 cup maple syrup 1/2 teaspoon powdered gelatin 1 tablespoon cold water 3/4 cup egg whites (about 5 to 6) Instructions: Whip the cream with the scrapings from the vanilla bean until stiff and chill. In a small saucepan, boil the maple syrup to soft ball stage or 238 degrees on a candy thermometer. (Because there is such a small amount of maple syrup, measuring the temperature with a thermometer may be difficult. In this case, a good way to tell if the syrup is ready is to dip a spoon into the boiling maple syrup then put a drop into a cup of ice water. If the syrup dissolves it?s not ready. If it holds its shape and is slightly pliable between your thumb and finger, it&#39;s ready.) Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and let it sponge. Place the whites in a clean dry bowl and, using a whip attachment, whip until almost stiff. Hold them with the whip turning on low until the maple syrup is up to temperature. When the syrup is ready, take it off the stove and, with the mixer on high, drizzle it down the wall of the mixing bowl into the whites. Warm the sponged gelatin in the microwave and drizzle it into the whites as well. Continue whipping until the meringue is cooled. Fold in the whipped cream and pipe or spoon the mousse into dessert glasses and chill for 1 hour or until set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44487,&quot;Risotto with Winter Vegetables 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 medium onion, chopped 4 cloves garlic, smashed 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus additional for seasoning Freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice 3 carrots, cut into large chunks 2 sprigs fresh thyme 1 small celery root (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into chunks 1 butternut squash, halved, peeled, seeded, and cut into large chunks, optional 3 cups chicken broth, low-sodium canned or homemade 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 large bunch mustard greens, washed and torn (4 to 5 cups) 1 cup freshly grated pecorino, plus additional for serving Instructions: Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a 7-liter pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, the 1 teaspoon salt, and the pepper to taste and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften a bit, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat. Stir in the carrots, thyme sprigs, celery root, squash, if desired, chicken broth, and wine. Close the pressure cooker lid and bring the pressure up to high (which can take up to 10 minutes), then reduce the heat to maintain an even pressure for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and press the cooker&#39;s pressure indicator stem until no more steam comes out. Carefully remove the lid--the risotto will look a bit soupy at this point. Stir the mustard greens into the risotto, then let the mixture sit until the greens wilt, about 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the 1 cup cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper, if you like. Pass additional grated cheese at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 44488,&quot;Berry Dump Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking dish 4 cups mixed berries (See Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> One 15.25-ounce box vanilla cake mix<br> 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes<br> Vanilla ice cream, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the mushrooms, red pepper and onion and cook stirring, until the vegetables are softened, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and the salt and stir to coat the rice with oil. When the rice starts to look \chalky,\ pour enough water into the pan to cover the rice by 1-inch. Raise the heat to high, bring the water to a boil, and boil until the level of the water meets the level of the rice. Reduce the heat to very low, give the rice a very thorough stir, and cover the pot. Cook until the rice is tender but with a little bite, about 20 minutes. Do not uncover the pot or stir the rice while it cooks. Fluff with a fork before serving. Stir in the scallions and transfer to a serving bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 44492,&quot;Cobb Salad in a Jar 8 strips thick-cut bacon Two 8-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Neutral cooking oil, for greasing<br> 4 large eggs<br> 6 ounces ranch dressing<br> 1 1/2 ounces sherry vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives<br> 1 head iceberg lettuce, cored and cut into bite-size pieces<br> 1 English cucumber, seeded and small diced<br> 2 large tomatoes, small diced<br> 1 avocado, sliced<br> 1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Combine the broth, salt, sugar, peppercorns, allspice and ginger in a large stockpot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolve. Remove from the heat. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate the brine. The night before you&#39;d like to eat: Truss the legs of the turkey with kitchen twine if desired. Combine the brine, water and ice in a 5-gallon bucket. Place the thawed turkey, with innards removed, breast-side down in the brine. If necessary, weigh down the bird to ensure it is fully immersed, cover and refrigerate or place everything in a cooler. Turn the bird once halfway through brining. Day of roasting: Heat the oven to 500 degrees F. Remove the bird from the brine and rinse inside and out with cold water. Discard the brine. Place the bird on a roasting rack inside a half sheet pan and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the bird with canola oil. Roast the bird on the lowest rack of the oven for 30 minutes. While the bird is cooking, fold and shape a double thickness of aluminum foil into a closely fitting breastplate. After 30 minutes, decrease the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the breast and cook until the temperature reaches 155 degrees F. Use the breastplate at any point during cooking should the bird become too brown. Rest the bird, covered lightly with aluminum foil, for 15 to 30 minutes.

Serve warm or at room temperature. Cook&#39;s Note: To prepare your loaf pan for baking, you can also use a nonstick spray with flour already in it. Flouring the pan helps the bread rise well and prevents any collapse after it comes out of the oven.

Reduce to low speed and mix in the cornstarch. With the mixer still on low, slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture (I use a liquid measuring cup for pouring). Pour the mixture into a clean, small, deep saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it reaches 180 degrees F on a candy thermometer and thickens to the consistency of heavy cream. The mixture will coat the spoon. Don&#39;t cook it above 180 degrees F or the eggs will scramble! Immediately (it will keep cooking in the saucepan), pour the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and stir in the vanilla, Cognac, Grand Marnier and orange zest. Cover and chill. Serve with Dark Chocolate Terrine. Lightly oil an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-by-2-inch loaf pan and line it as neatly as possible with plastic wrap, allowing the ends to drape over the sides. (I lay two pieces of plastic wrap crosswise in the pan, overlapping in the center.) Place the pan in the freezer. Place a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Place the butter in the bowl, then the chocolate and coffee powder and heat until just melted, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula. As soon as the chocolate and butter are melted, take the bowl off the heat and whisk in, one at a time, and in order, first the confectioners&#39; sugar, then the cocoa powder, egg yolks, Cognac and salt. Set the bowl aside for 15 minutes to cool. Place the egg whites and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on high speed until the whites form firm but not dry peaks. Fold the whites into the cooled chocolate mixture with a rubber spatula. Without cleaning the bowl or whisk attachment, pour the cream and vanilla into the bowl and beat on high speed until it forms firm peaks. Fold the cream carefully but thoroughly into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the prepared loaf pan, smooth the top, fold the plastic wrap over the top and chill for 4 hours or overnight. To serve, turn the terrine out of the mold and unwrap it. Spoon a puddle of Orange Sauce in the middle of each dessert plate and place a slice of the terrine in the middle.

Place the flour, salt and butter in a food processor and blend until it comes to a pea-size crumble. Dump that mixture out into a bowl and pour 5 tablespoons cold water in. Mix to bind it with your hands just until it comes together, then wrap and let rest for 15 minutes. (Be careful not to overmix your dough to form gluten.) Roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick on a floured surface, then press into a 10-inch fluted tart pan, being careful to get all the edges pressed into the corners. Using a fork, poke holes in the dough so it doesn&#39;t bubble while baking. Gently lay cheesecloth over the top of the tart and pour in 1 cup of pie weights to blind bake the shell. Bake until blond (light golden brown), 18 to 20 minutes. For the filling: Melt the butter in a saucepan and whisk in the brown sugar, corn syrup and vanilla until smooth. Combine the cream cheese, orange zest, salt and eggs together in a stand mixer and beat with the whisk attachment on high speed, stopping to scrape down the sides of the mixer once, until smooth and not lumpy, about 3 minutes. On low speed add your hot sugar and butter mixture to your egg and cream cheese mixture. Fold the pecans into the mixture and fill the tart shell. Bake until set, 12 to 15 minutes. Place the Hot Chocolate on the bottom of a plate in a circular puddle. Dust the top of the tart with powdered sugar, then place over the hot chocolate. Quenelle the Creme Fraiche Ice Cream (form into football shapes) and place it on top of the tart. Garnish with the Candied Orange Zest and potato leaves. Place the chocolate in a large bowl and set aside. Combine the cream, granulated sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, coriander, salt, allspice, cloves and cl in a saucepot and bring to 180 degrees F. Remove from the heat, strain all of the solids out of the cream mixture and pour over the chocolate. Let sit 1 minute, then whisk until it all comes together. Mix together the egg yolks, whole eggs, granulated sugar and salt in a bowl and whisk well. Combine the cream, crme fraiche and milk in a pot over medium heat and bring to 180 degrees F. Temper the hot cream into your egg mixture by adding a small amount of the hot cream to the egg mixture, whisking constantly, then whisking the egg mixture into the hot cream, whisking constantly. Let cool to room temperature, then strain. Pour the custard into the ice cream machine. Run the machine according to its instructions until thick and creamy, about 20 minutes. Remove from the machine and let it set up the rest of the way in the freezer, about 4 hours. Peel zests from the orange with a peeler. Roll the zests up and cut them into chiffonade strips. Mix the raw sugar together with 1/2 cup granulated sugar on a tray and set aside. Stir together the remaining cup granulated sugar with 1/3 cup water in a pot and wipe the sides of the pot down with a wet hand. Bring this solution up to 242 degrees F. Throw the orange zests into the pot and swirl the pot a few times. Take off the heat. Strain through a sieve to retrieve the orange zests. Immediately throw the orange zests into the sugar mixture and toss quickly so that they separate and crystalize in the sugar. Transfer zests to parchment paper and let harden, about 1 hour.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 44529,&quot;Thai Chicken Stew 1 1/2 pounds chicken legs, separated into drumsticks and thighs, skin removed Salt to taste 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 cup minced onion 5 cloves garlic, peeled 1 tablespoon grated gingerroot 1 cup sliced carrots 1 cup 1-inch pieces red bell pepper 1 cup sliced mushrooms 1 to 2 teaspoons red curry paste, or to taste 2 (14-ounce) cans &#39;light&#39; unsweetened coconut milk 1/2 teaspoon galanga root powder 1/2 teaspoon dried lemongrass flakes 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 bay leaf 1 cup broccoli florets 1/2 cup canned bamboo shoots, drained 1/2 cup canned water chestnuts, drained 8 ears canned baby corn, drained Fresh lemon juice, to taste 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro 1/4 cup minced fresh mint Instructions: Pat the chicken dry and season with salt.

Using a serrated knife, cut ice cream package in half lengthwise through the cardboard. Wrap one half in plastic wrap and freeze for another use. Halve the remaining piece lengthwise. Flip the ice cream, with the 2 pieces still together, so the cut side is up, and cut it crosswise into 4 equal sections \u2013 you&#39;ll have 8 pieces of ice cream. Place a crepe on the work surface and place a piece of ice cream in the center. Fold the crepe over the ice cream to enclose completely. Place the filled crepes on the prepared baking sheet. Continue with the remaining ice cream and crepes and freeze until just firm. (This recipe can be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance. Wrap carefully in plastic wrap before freezing. Allow to soften slightly before proceeding.)<br> Peel and slice the bananas on a sharp angle into 2-inch pieces. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon juice and cook, stirring, until smooth and just at a simmer, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and add orange liqueur. Return skillet to high heat and stir until smooth. Carefully fold in bananas. Remove the skillet from heat and add the rum. Return the skillet to the heat, and shake the pan back and forth to warm the rum and coat the bananas. (If working over a gas flame the sauce may ignite; continue to cook until the flames subsides.) To serve, place 2 filled crepes on a plate crisscrossing each other and spoon banana mixture over the top. Garnish with sifted confectioners&#39; sugar and a sprig of mint, if desired. Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually whisk in the milk, water, eggs and vanilla extract, and continue whisking until smooth. (The batter can be made to this point a day ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before adding the butter.) Stir in the butter. Set aside for at least 30 minutes to rest. (The crepe batter may be made in a food processor blender: Pulse the dry ingredients, then add the wet, process until smooth, and then stir in the butter.) Pour the batter into measuring cup with a spout. Have a plate near the stove to stack the cooked crepes, or 4 plates, if you plan to serve the crepes immediately. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat until a drop of water bounces and sizzles briefly around the pan before evaporating. Pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet and quickly swirl it to coat the pan evenly. Cook until the batter sets, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The crepe will blister in the middle, and the edges will look dry and slightly crispy. Using your fingers or a spatula, carefully pick the crepe up by its edges and flip it over to cook the other side, about 15 to 30 seconds. Repeat with the rest of the batter, stacking the crepes on the plate as you go.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44547,&quot;Pork-Stuffed Collard Greens 1 large bunch collard greens 1 pound ground pork 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons red chili flakes 2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 1/2 cups chicken stock Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Place the gingersnap crumbs in a large bowl and drizzle half of the melted butter all over. Using your hand or a silicone spatula, mix thoroughly. Add more butter a little at a time until you can make a fist with the crumbs that retains its shape but is easily broken (not too dry, and not too wet). Press the crumbs tightly into a 9-inch pie plate. A deep pie plate is much more suited to this task. Bake until the crust feels quite firm to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside and let cool. For the pumpkin filling: Whisk together the milk, brown sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil for 3 minutes, whisking constantly. In a large bowl, beat the eggs. Gradually add half of the hot milk mixture to the eggs, whisking constantly. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until thick, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the pumpkin puree and salt. Pour into the pie shell and chill until set, 2 to 3 hours. For the rum cheesecake topping: Cream together the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the cream, rum extract, egg, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla bean seeds. Mix until well combined. Use a silicone spatula to fill a pastry piping bag with the filling. Cut off the tip. Pipe the cheesecake over the pumpkin filling, minding not to get too close to the crumb crust. Use a spatula to smooth out the topping to just meet the crust edge, being careful not to drag crumbs over the surface. Bake until the top is glossy and the center still wiggles, about 45 minutes. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.

Coat a 10-inch cake pan with vegetable cooking spray. Line the bottom of the pan with a 10-inch parchment paper circle. Coat the top of the parchment paper circle with vegetable cooking spray. Place both chopped chocolates in a bowl and melt over a double boiler. Combine the sugar and water in a 1-quart saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil until all of the sugar is dissolved. Pour the hot syrup into the bowl of melted chocolate. Whisk until the mixture is homogenous. Add the butter and whisk until well mixed. Using an electric mixer, beat the eggs and sugar until well blended. Using a rubber spatula, fold this mixture into the chocolate mixture. Be careful to mix gently. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Place a baking sheet with 1-inch sides in the oven. Place the filled cake pan on the baking sheet. Fill the baking sheet with water so the water covers the bottom inch of the cake pan. Bake until the cake surface appears dull and taut when pressed in the middle, about 40 minutes. Remove the cake pan from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack. Turn off the oven and let the baking sheet and water cool before you attempt to remove them. Decoration: If you would like to decorate this cake, you can make chocolate fans or shave a block of chocolate with an apple peeler. To make chocolate fans, stir the vegetable oil into the melted chocolate. Spread a thick layer of the chocolate mixture onto a marble or granite surface (or use the back of a cold baking sheet). Using a triangle, push across the chocolate surface in a curving motion. Place your thumb on one corner of the triangle as you push to catch the chocolate. The result should resemble a chocolate fan. This takes a little practice and not every fan you make will be usable.

On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out each of the balls of dough into an 8-inch circle. Brush each of the circles with the chili oil and start to layer, dividing the ingredients among the 4 pizzas. Start with the tomatoes, then the mozzarella and Fontina cheeses, the herbs, chicken, and Parmesan. Bake until the pizza crusts are nicely browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Toss the lettuce with the vinaigrette and season lightly with salt and pepper. Remove the pizzas from the oven, arrange the lettuce on each of the pizzas, and top with some of the shaved Parmesan. Cut into slices and serve immediately. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Add the honey and let sit for 5 minutes, until foamy. Put the flour in a food processor. Mix the 1 cup cool water with the olive oil and salt. With the motor running, pour the olive oil mixture and the yeast slowly in through the feed tube. Process until the dough forms a ball on the blade. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover and let rise until double in bulk. Punch down the dough and knead it on a lightly floured surface for 1 minute. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and roll them into tight balls. Place on a tray, cover with a damp towel and let rest for several hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Roll or stretch each bowl of dough into a 7 to 8-inch circle. Place the circles, 1 at a time, on a wooden peel or on a baking sheet and build the pizza as desired. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. In a pot of boiling water, blanch tomatoes. Drain and refresh in ice water. Drain. Peel, core, cut into quarters, and remove seeds. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and arrange the tomato quarters on the tray, cut side down. Drizzle generously with olive oil. Sprinkle with thyme and garlic. In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper and sugar, and sprinkle evenly over the tomatoes. Bake until the tomatoes begin to shrivel, about 1 hour. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, transfer to a container. Pour olive oil over and cover the container. Refrigerate and use as needed. Arrange the cubed chicken in a shallow medium bowl and toss with 1/2 cup olive oil, lime juice, jalapenos, garlic, and cilantro. Season with salt and let marinate for 1 hour, refrigerated. In a skillet or saute pan large enough to hold the chicken in 1 layer, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil. Remove the chicken from the marinade with a slotted spoon. Saute the chicken just to brown on all sides. Do not overcook. Remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, lemon juice, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, mustard, and anchovies. Slowly whisk in the oils to emulsify. Stir in the cheese and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate, in a covered container. When ready to use, whisk again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 44579,&quot;Lure&#39;s Fish Soup 4 fresh whole lobsters (save meat to garnish soup) 1 carrot stalk 1 rib celery 1/2 bulb fennel 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 cup vermouth 2 quarts water 1 carrot stalk 1 rib celery 1 head fennel 2 parsnips 4 cloves garlic 1 white onion 1 orange, zested and juiced 1 small pinch saffron 1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes 1 cup chopped fresh tomatoes 6 cups lobster stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper 18 littleneck clams 4 ounces cod, halibut, monkfish, or swordfish (or any combination of fresh fish) 18 mussels 6 shrimp, cut into 4 Meat from 4 lobsters, reserved from stock Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving Sea salt, for serving Crusty bread, for serving Instructions: For the Lobster Stock: Steam lobsters for 5 to 6 minutes in a large pot with a few inches of boiling water until bright pink and meat is just cooked. Split lobster bodies in half. Chop vegetables into 1 to 2-inch pieces. In a deep pot, heat olive oil until very hot and add the halved lobster bodies. Saute until the lobster is caramelized to a golden brown, then and add the chopped vegetables. Cook and stir vegetables and lobster continuously for 5 to 6 minutes until the vegetables are soft. Remove meat from the lobster and set aside. Return the lobster shells to the pot, if desired, add the tomato paste and stir until combined. Add the vermouth carefully and cook until almost all the liquid is gone. Add 2 quarts of water to the pot and simmer for about 45 minutes. Strain solids and reserve the lobster stock. For the Fish Soup: Dice all vegetables into small uniform pieces and chop the garlic. In a large pot, lightly heat a small amount of olive oil. Place all vegetables and garlic into pot. Cook slowly for 10 to 15 minutes until all the vegetables are soft. Keep the heat low to avoid getting and color on the vegetables. Add the juice and orange zest, saffron and crushed red pepper (a small amount helps balance the soup, if a more spicy soup is desired, add more crushed pepper). Cook until the orange juice is almost gone. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until 1/2 the tomato liquid is gone. Pour the lobster stock over the vegetables and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and check for a good balance between sweet, salty and heat. Keep in mind the shellfish will add more salinity in the final steps. About 7 minutes before serving, place clams into soup. Simmer for 2 minutes. Add small chunks of whichever fish you have chosen to use. Simmer 2 minutes. Add shrimp and mussels and simmer until all the shellfish has opened (about 3 more minutes). At the last moment, add the cooked lobster and heat gently. Divide into 6 bowls, or serve family style at the table. The soup taste great with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and sea salt. The soup can easily be served as an appetizer or increased in quantity and served as an entree with warm crusty bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 44580,&quot;Tony&#39;s Hot Toddy 3 whole cloves 3 cinnamon sticks 1 cup brandy 3 tablespoons honey 2 lemons, wedged 8 cups cider Instructions: In a large saucepan add all the ingredients.

Add the shortening and 1 stick butter; pulse until the flour looks like coarse meal. Add the remaining butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Add the egg yolk and 6 tablespoons ice water; pulse until the dough just begins to clump, adding up to 2 more tablespoons water if needed. Transfer the dough to a large sheet of plastic wrap and gather into a 2-by-12-inch log. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight. Put a baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 400 degrees F. Make the filling: Combine the cherries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest and juice, and almond extract in a large bowl; toss until the sugar is dissolved and the cherries are coated. Set the filling aside. Cut the dough in half; cut one half into 6 pieces (keep the other half refrigerated). Roll each piece into a 6-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease each round into a 5-inch pie plate, letting the excess dough hang over the edge. Evenly divide the filling among the bottom crusts (the pies will be full). Remove the remaining dough from the refrigerator and use to make the top crusts (see options below); assemble the pies. Brush the top crusts with the beaten egg and sprinkle generously with coarse sugar. Refrigerate the pies until firm, about 30 minutes. Put the pies on the hot baking sheet in the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake until the crusts are golden and the fruit is bubbling, 55 to 60 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44590,&quot;The Four Straight 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/4 cup olive oil, divided 24 sea scallops Field greens Warm Bacon Vinaigrette, recipe follows 2 cups diced bacon, about 12 slices or a standard package 2 1/2 ounces shallot, minced 1/2-ounce garlic, minced 1 cup brown sugar 3/4 cup cider vinegar 1 1/2 cups olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a shallow dish combine the flour, seafood seasoning, sea salt and cracked black pepper, to taste.

If you have heat control, set it to whatever position will give you moderate heat: 180 to 200 degrees F. Allow the wood to smoke for approximately 30 minutes before adding food. While the smoker is heating, position an oven rack 5-inches below the broiler and set the broiler to high. Halve the peppers lengthwise, discard the seeds, place cut side-down on a sheet pan, then broil, rotating the pan halfway through, until the skins are charred, about 10 minutes. (Or you can char them over your gas cooktop burners if you have them. It&#39;s a little messy but darned efficient and fun in a medieval kind of way.) Transfer the peppers to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes, then slip the charred skins off the peppers with your hands. (Doing this under running water helps.) Spread the tomato paste into a thin layer on piece of parchment paper and place on a baking rack along with the peppers and garlic. Smoke for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a toaster oven to 400 degrees F and toast the almonds until light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Set up a food processor with an S-blade (the normal processing blade) and load in the bread cubes, smoked peppers, garlic and tomato paste, the toasted almonds, sherry vinegar and salt. Pulse until uniform but still chunky, then leave the motor running while you add the oil in a constant stream. (Do this fairly quickly so that the sauce doesn&#39;t puree completely.) For full flavor, wait a couple of hours to serve at room temp. To store, cover tightly and refrigerate for up 10 days or freeze in ice cube trays for easy dosing.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 44594,&quot;Spaghetti Squash, Second Time Around 15 ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed 1/4 cup slivered roasted red peppers (from jar is o.k.) 1/2 cup bottled chili sauce Water to thin Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cups cooked spaghetti squash 2 cups cooked rice Sour cream and chopped cilantro for garnish, optional Instructions: Heat the black beans with the peppers, chili sauce and some water just to make a stew like consistency.

If using gelatin sheets, soak them in 2/3 cup (80ml) cold water in a shallow pan for 10 minutes. If using powdered gelatin, let bloom powdered gelatin in the 2/3 cup cold water. Then add the bloomed gelatin to the warmed up espresso and sugar mixture. Warm up the espresso with the granulated sugar and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the gelatin sheets and the soaking water and heat until the gelatin and sugar dissolve, about 2 minutes, stirring often. Using a hand mixer, beat the gelatin mixture until it resembles a soft meringue, about 5 minutes. Pour into the lined pan and let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and cornstarch, and sprinkle some onto a large cutting board. Invert the marshmallow onto the board. Peel off the plastic wrap and dust the top of the marshmallow with the cornstarch mixture. Cut the marshmallow into squares using a sharp knife. Dip the cut sides of the marshmallows in the cornstarch mixture and shake off the excess. (Serve immediately or store the marshmallows in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.) For the hot chocolate: Heat the milk, cream, espresso and confectioners&#39; sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat, whisking to dissolve the sugar. Add the chocolate and whisk until smooth.

Store at room temperature in an airtight jar for up to 3 months. Make the chicken pot pies: Preheat the oven to 425? F. Heat the canola oil in a large ovenproof skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the chicken thighs generously on both sides with kosher salt and pepper and place skin-side down in the skillet. Cook until the skin is golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Then turn the thighs over, transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the internal temperature reaches 165? F, 10 to 15 more minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan. Heat the pan over medium heat and add the onion, carrots, celery and a pinch of kosher salt. Cook, stirring, until softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the ginger and 1 tablespoon of the spice blend to the vegetables and cook for another minute. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for another minute. Meanwhile, bring the stock to a simmer in a small saucepan. Gradually add the stock to the vegetable mixture, a ladleful at a time, allowing it to thicken before adding more. Stir in the dill, parsley and peas and then reduce the heat to low. Pull the chicken off the bones, discard or snack on the skin, chop the chicken into bite-size pieces and add it to the vegetable mixture. Stir in the heavy cream. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. Ladle into four 1/2-quart ovenproof bowls or cocottes and place them on a rimmed baking sheet, which will make them easier to transfer and will also catch any of the mixture that overflows in the oven. On a work surface, roll out the puff pastry sheet so that it\u2019s big enough to cut into 4 squares that are about an inch larger than the bowls. Cut into 4 equal squares and cut a few slits in the center of each (it\u2019s easiest to do this while the puff pastry is on the counter versus on top of the pies). Lay the puff pastry on top of the pot pies so that it sits comfortably. Brush the tops with the egg wash, sprinkle with a pinch of flaky salt and cover liberally with sesame seeds. Bake until the pastry is golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 44600,&quot;Almond and Sugar Powder 6 ounces, or 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons, blanched or raw almonds 6 ounces, or 1 1/4 cups plus 3 tablespoons, confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Grind the almonds with half of the confectioners&#39; sugar in your food processor, stopping to break up any caking as needed, until finely ground but not at all oily.

Whisk half of the lemon juice in a bowl with the oregano and half of the olive oil. Salt each fish liberally and put in a nonreactive container. Put the fish in a dish and pour the lemon mixture over them. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour, turning the fish after 30 minutes to take in the marinade. Lay out five grape leaves on the counter, making sure to overlap them to create a sheet that is as wide as the fish is long, and long enough to wrap around the snapper 1 1/2 times. Wrap one of the fish in the leaves. Repeat with the remaining grape leaves and snapper. Brush with the remaining olive oil and set aside. Heat a grill to medium-high. In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the stock, garlic, and remaining lemon juice. Bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and whisk in the egg. Return the pan to the stovetop over low heat and, stirring constantly, cook until the sauce thickens (make sure it does not get too hot or the eggs will scramble). Set it in a warm spot on the stove. Grill the fish for 4 minutes per side, making sure not to burn the grape leaves. To serve, set one whole wrapped fish on a serving plate and top with the sauce.

Loosely form the meat into 4 equal 4-ounce patties about 1/2-inch thick. I like to shape my patties into either squares or circles depending on the shape of my bread. That way every bite will have burger in it! Create a small well in the center of each beef patty, using your thumb (this will help your burger cook evenly). Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Cook the onions, sprinkling with salt and stirring occasionally, until caramelized, brown and soft, 25 to30 minutes. Season beef patties generously with salt and pepper. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle pan over high heat and add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the oil. Cook the burgers well-side up (the burger well collects the juices while cooking, letting your burger marinate) until browned on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Spread the Homemade Pimiento Cheese on the non-buttered side of each slice of bread. Top half of the bread slices with a pile of onions, then add the burger patties and top with the remaining bread slices. Place the sandwiches back on the griddle and toast until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is beginning to melt, 2 minutes per side.

Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in 3 tablespoons of the oil and 1 1/2 cups water. Mix together until fully incorporated and you can form a dough ball. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.<br> Divide the dough into 5 equal pieces, each weighing about 120 grams. Form each piece into a ball. Lightly oil a rolling pin and a work surface. Roll each ball out into a circle about 6 to 7 inches in diameter. Combine the melted butter and the remaining 1/4 cup oil in a small bowl. Brush the rounds with the mixture.<br> One at a time, make a cut from the center of a round out. Roll the round up like a cone. Take the tip of the cone and push down towards center. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Refrigerate the dough for 10 minutes or up to 12 hours.<br> Place a piece of dough on a lightly oiled cutting board and press down on it with your palm until it&#39;s an even circle 6 to 7 inches in diameter. Heat a 9- or 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough oil to cover the bottom. When the skillet is very hot but not smoking, add a roti. Cook until the bottom is golden brown and air pockets start to form, about 3 minutes. Flip and brown the other side. After each roti is cooked, place it in a bowl, cover with a lid and shake the bowl up and down. This creates texture in the roti. Repeat with the remaining roti, adding more oil to the skillet as necessary.

Add the neck, giblets, onion, and cook stirring occasionally until browned, about 15 minutes. Add the broth, herbs, and bay leaf; cover and simmer over medium-low heat, about 2 hours. (This can be done while your turkey roasts.) Discard the giblets or reserve for chopping and adding to the gravy. Pour all the turkey pan drippings into a liquid measuring cup or a degreasing cup. Set aside to let the fat separate from the darker pan juices. (Put the measuring cup in the freezer to helps them separate.) Ladle off 1/2 cup of the fat from the top of the drippings, and transfer to a saucepan (or do it the old fashioned way in the turkey roasting pan.) Heat the fat over medium heat. Scatter the flour evenly on top and cook, stirring constantly, with a wooden spoon until the flour browns slightly and smells toasty, about 4 minutes. Switch to a whisk; then gradually and carefully ladle the hot broth into the flour mixture while whisking constantly. Bring the gravy to a boil; adjust the heat so it simmers gently. Skim and discard any excess fat from the remaining drippings, and add the pan juices to the gravy. Continue to simmer, whisking occasionally, until the gravy is thickened, about 10 minutes.

Fudgy, brownielike and decadent, these fantastic cookies will satisfy any chocolate lover. Managing Editor Wendy Ruopp shares her friend&#39;s recipe for these fantastic cookies with us: Place chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave on Medium in 30-second bursts, stirring after each burst to ensure even melting, until completely melted. (Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot water, stirring constantly.) Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, whisk whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla; beat until creamy. Add the melted chocolate; beat to combine. Stir in the dry ingredients with a spoon until just combined. Refrigerate the dough until barely chilled, 15 minutes. Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350degreesF. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Roll tablespoonfuls of dough into 1-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies, one batch at a time, until puffed and slightly dried on top, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and gently press an almond into the center of each cookie. Let cool for 5 minutes on the pan before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Allow the pan to cool slightly between batches. Recipe Tips &amp; Notes:</p><ol><li>Chocolate drizzle anyone?</li><li>Melted dark and white chocolate drizzled on top of cookies is a special treat.

The crust is partially baked before filling.<br> The vegetables: Blanche the turnips and then the carrot chunks in rapidly boiling salted water until just tender, removing the vegetables from the water and immediately cooling them under running water to stop the cooking. Microwave the peas in a 1/2 cup of water for 20 seconds or pour some of the hot blanching water over them and then drain. Mix the vegetables together. This can also be done ahead, the same day as the pie will be served or even the night before, but don&#39;t freeze the vegetables.<br> The stew: Cut beef into 1-inch chunks and dry thoroughly with a paper towel. Cut the bacon into 1-inch pieces and brown slowly in the casserole. Remove the bacon and set aside, and turn the heat to high. Brown the beef quickly in the bacon fat. Add olive oil if necessary. Remove the beef from the casserole and set aside with the bacon. Add the minced carrots, onions and celery and brown on medium high heat in the remaining fat. Remove the vegetables from the pot and add to the reserved beef and bacon. Add the clarified butter to the pot and sprinkle in the flour. Stirring constantly, brown the flour on medium high heat until it is a dark, nut brown. Return the bacon, beef and vegetables to the pot. Stir to coat them with the browned flour and cook for 1 minute on medium-high heat. Lower the heat, add the cayenne, wine, bouillon or stock, the tomato paste, the garlic and the herb bouquet tied in a cheesecloth. Stir to mix well and simmer for at least 3, preferably 4, hours, stirring occasionally. When done the meat should be very tender. Skim fat if necessary. Check for seasoning. Remove the meat from the gravy with a slotted spoon and set aside. Remove and discard the herb bouquet. Reserve the gravy in a separate container. The stew may be prepared to this point a 1 or 2 days ahead and kept refrigerated. It can also be frozen after preparation to be kept longer. The crust: Preheat oven to 400 degrees Process the flour, butter, shortening, and salt until mixture is like coarse cornmeal. Add the ice water and pulse processor a few times until dough begins to clump. Do not overprocess. Scrape dough onto a board, divide in half and put each half in a plastic bag. Working through the bag, quickly press the dough into a ball. Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour. (May be frozen at this point for future use.) Roll 1 of the balls out to about 1/8-inch thick. Butter the tart pans and line with the dough. Roll the other ball of dough out and cut circular pieces about 1/8-inch larger than the individual tart pans (or 3/8-inch if using the single 9 or 10-inch pan). The circles for the top crust of the pot pie are cut larger because there will be shrinkage when it is baked. The edges can be crimped with a fork if desired. Leftover dough can be cut into decorative shapes for the top crust.<br> Butter pieces of aluminum foil and line the crust in the tart pans with them. Fill the foil with dried beans or rice to a depth of about 1-inch -- this will keep the crust from puffing when it is baked empty. Place the top crust circles on a cookie sheet and prick with a fork. Bake for about 10 minutes. Crust should just start to brown. The top pieces will likely take a little less time. Remove the aluminum foil and return the beans or rice to their container. Leave the tart pan rings in place. The crust can be made up to 4 hours before the dish is assembled and served.<br> Assembly: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. If you have made the stew and gravy ahead of time, warm them separately on the stove until they just begin to simmer. Add gravy back to the stew a little at a time until it is liquid enough but not too soupy. Stir well to mix. The proportion will vary according to the cut of meat used and the actual cooking time. Once you&#39;ve made it a couple of times you&#39;ll know how you like it. If there is leftover gravy, keep it warm on the stove while you bake the pie. Mix the vegetables into the stew just before you assemble the pie. Spoon the filling mixture into the partially baked pie shell. It should fill it right to the top. There may be some filling mixture left over. This is not a bad thing. Bake for about 8 to10 minutes, until the crust starts to look quite brown at the edges and the filling is bubbling. Allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Carefully remove rings from the pans and slide the pies onto warmed plates. If there is remaining gravy, serve on the side with the pie. Garnish with chopped parsley.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 44625,&quot;Marshmallow Cereal Bowls 1 1/2 cups marshmallows 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 cups fruit cereal<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the bowl 3/4 cup chopped white chocolate or candy melting wafers<br> Instructions: Melt the marshmallows and butter in a medium pot over low heat, stirring constantly.

Then stir in the remaining warm water and brown sugar. Place bowl on a mixer and using a dough hook, gradually add the flour and continue mixing until it forms a ball. Turn it out onto a work surface and knead the dough to make it smooth. Use enough flour on your work surface so the dough is not sticky. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Butter 2 sheet pans. Bring 2 quarts of water and the baking soda to boil in a large saucepan. Cut dough up into golf ball size pieces. Then roll them into 1/2-inch thick worms. Form a U then cross the ends, twisting at the middle. Fold the ends back down to meet the U (which is now an O) and press to secure the dough. Drop it into the boiling water for 30 seconds then fish it out and place it on the greased sheet pan. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Bake for 8 minutes or until golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44655,&quot;Rice Pilaf 2 tablespoons butter 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 1/2 cups rice Salt Pepper 3 cups chicken stock, warmed 1/4 cup chopped parsley 1/4 cup toasted pinenuts Instructions: Melt butter in saucepan and cook onion over medium heat until golden.

Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook the bacon until crisp golden brown. Leave the bacon pieces and the fat in the pan. Add the butter, onion, thyme and bay leaf. Saute them for about 8 minutes over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, but not browned. Add the potatoes and fish stock. The stock should just barely cover the potatoes. If it doesn&#39;t add enough water to cover them. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and cook the potatoes vigorously for about 8 minutes. Add the diced cabbage, reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper. The potatoes should be firm in the center and soft on the outside. If the broth hasn&#39;t thickened, lightly smash a few potatoes against the side of the pot and simmer 1 or 2 minutes longer to release their starches. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the scallops and let sit for 5 minutes. Add the cream and let sit 10 more minutes while the scallops finish their slow cooking. Retaste the chowder and adjust the salt and pepper. If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit then refrigerate. Cover the chowder after it has completely chilled. Otherwise, let it sit for up to an hour, allowing the flavors to meld. When ready to serve, reheat over a low heat and don&#39;t let the chowder boil. Use a slotted spoon to mound the pieces of scallop, potato, cabbage and bacon in the center of large soup plates or shallow bowls and ladle the creamy broth around. Sprinkle generously with sliced scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 44657,&quot;Full Monty Breakfast 1 bunch tomatoes on the vine, stalks removed and the base of each scored 4 field mushrooms, peeled and the base of each trimmed 2 black puddings, sliced 8 sausages Olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 large organic eggs A splash milk 3 1/2 ounces (110 grams) butter 10 rashers dry cured, smoked back bacon Good white uncut bread, for toast HP sauce and tomato ketchup, for serving Instructions: Line up tomatoes in a large roasting tray, scored sides up, with the mushrooms, the black pudding and the sausages. Let everything overlap so that the flavours really get in there. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with some salt and pepper, then place under a preheated medium grill. Prepare the scrambled eggs by whisking with the milk. Melt some butter in a non-stick pan and pour in the eggs. Keep the heat low and gently stir to scramble.

When the eggs are just about done, season them and serve on some thick slices of toasted bread with a bit of everything else on your plate too! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 44658,&quot;Butternut Squash Tart with cl Honey 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, at room temperature, plus more for the pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1 butternut squash (1 3/4 pounds), peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thick half-moons 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage 3 tablespoons honey Kosher salt 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs 1 1/2 cups gruyere cheese, cut into small cubes 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> Instructions: For the crust: Butter a 9-inch springform pan. Put the flour, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and process until thoroughly combined with no visible chunks of butter. Add the egg and pulse until the dough just starts to clump. Transfer the dough to the springform pan and press it evenly on the bottom and 1 inch up the sides. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. For the filling: Adjust an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Toss the butternut squash slices with the melted butter, sage, 1 tablespoon honey and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Sprinkle the Parmesan and breadcrumbs evenly on the bottom of the crust, then scatter over 1/2 cup of the gruyere cubes. Lay out a single layer of butternut squash slices, breaking off pieces of squash to fill any gaps. Scatter another 1/2 cup of gruyere over the squash. Top with the rest of the butternut squash slices and then the remaining 1/2 cup gruyere. Put the springform pan on a baking sheet and bake, until the squash can be pierced easily with a knife, about 1 hour and 40 minutes to 1 hour 50 minutes. (If the crust gets too dark, cover loosely with foil.) Meanwhile, combine the vinegar, crushed red pepper and the remaining 2 tablespoons honey in a microwave-safe bowl large enough to contain it (the honey may boil over in the microwave). Microwave for 30 seconds to heat up the honey and infuse the cl flavor. Reserve.

Season the meat with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Sear the meat all over, about 2 minutes per each side. Move the meat to the side (or remove it from the pot altogether if necessary), add the celery, carrot and onion and brown the vegetables, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a minute or 2 longer. Add the wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom. Add the tomatoes, water and bay leaves (and the meat if you removed it). Bring the liquid to a simmer and taste for seasoning. Add more salt if necessary. Cover the pot and bake, basting the meat occasionally, until tender, about 3 hours. About 20 minutes before the meat is tender, bring a pot of water to a boil and salt liberally. Add the shells, give it a stir and cook until al dente according to the package instructions. Drain the pasta. To serve, you can pull the meat apart with a couple of forks right in the pot at the table. Serve with the pasta, plenty of sauce and vegetables, tossing them all together. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barbera]&quot; 44678,&quot;Tassa&#39;s Turkey Cornucopia Burger with Paprika Aioli 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1/4 teaspoon Hungarian hot paprika 1/2 pound ground dark meat turkey 1/2 pound ground white meat turkey 1 small onion, finely chopped 2 carrots, shredded 1 green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped<br> 3 heaping tablespoons grated Parmesan 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon Hungarian hot paprika 1/2 teaspoon Hungarian sweet paprika 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon dried habanero powder 1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger 1/4 teaspoon curry powder Pinch salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> Pinch salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 large egg Olive oil, as needed 4 slices provolone 4 organic onion buns 1 avocado, halved, pitted, peeled and sliced<br> 1 tomato, sliced Alfalfa sprouts, as needed Instructions: Aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, mustard and paprika in a small bowl.

Lightly oil the grill grates. Cut 6 of the tomatoes in half and place them on the grill with the jalapenos. Char, turning regularly to promote even cooking, until the skins are blackened, about 20 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the grill and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the top off the bulb of garlic. Place the garlic bulb on a sheet pan and roast until the garlic is tender and can be squeezed out of the bulb, 30 to 45 minutes. While hot, turn the bulb upside down and squeeze the bulb from the root end to the top, pushing the roasted garlic cloves out of the bulb. Crush and chop 4 cloves of the roasted garlic and stir together with the red onions and cilantro in a bowl. (Save the remaining roasted garlic for another use.) Quarter and seed the remaining 6 tomatoes and dice the flesh. Add to the bowl with the garlic and onions. Remove some of the charred skin from the roasted tomatoes, then dice the tomatoes with the seeds. Put them into the bowl with the rest of the salsa ingredients.

Smoke the vegetables for 10 minutes, then remove from the smoker and transfer to a blender. Add the cilantro and honey and puree until slightly chunky. Season with salt and pepper. (If it is still tart, add more honey). Bring 2 1/4 cups water to a boil in a pot. Stir in the rice and cover. Reduce the heat to low and cook the rice until all of the liquid has been absorbed, 12 to 15 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork, then stir in 1 cup of the tomatillo salsa (save the remainder for another use). Cover again and hold warm for plating. For the guacamole: Combine the cilantro and yellow onion in a blender and blend until almost pureed but still a little chunky. Scoop the flesh out of the avocados and put them in a bowl. Add the onion-cilantro puree and mash the avocados with a fork. Add the tomato, red onion and lime juice and mix well. Season with the salt and cover with plastic wrap directly touching the guacamole. For the vinaigrette: Combine the lime juice, cilantro and honey in a bowl, then slowly whisk in the vegetable oil and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the skirt steak: Combine the vegetable oil, olive oil, cilantro and garlic. Pour over the steaks and marinate the steaks for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Prepare the grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates. Remove the steak from the marinade. Season with salt and pepper and cook until grill marks appear, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Heat a skillet or saute pan over medium heat on the stovetop. Transfer the marked steak to the skillet and finish cooking on the stovetop over medium heat, flipping once, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Allow the steak to rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing against the grain and on a bias. For plating: Divide the rice among 6 plates. Lay the sliced steak over the top of the rice. Top each plate with a large tablespoon of the guacamole. Combine the watercress and red onions in a bowl and dress them with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette.

With the motor running, add the egg and the oil, and then pour the water in a slow, steady stream until the dough forms a ball around the blade. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 2 minutes, until smooth. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 2 balls. On a floured surface, with a floured rolling pin, roll out one of the balls very thinly, to about 1/16th of an inch, making sure that it doesn&#39;t tear. With a cookie cutter, or a cup, cut out circles about 3 inches in diameter. Place a heaping teaspoon of the desired filling in the middle of a circle. Fold the dough over to form a semi-circle. Brush the edges with the egg and press firmly with the tines of the fork to seal. Place the vareniki as they are made on a large, lightly floured, platter, and cover with a damp cloth, while making the next batch. Repeat with the second ball of dough. Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate and carefully lower half of the vareniki into the water. Boil, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until they rise to the surface, about 6 to 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, carefully remove the vareniki into a colander and drain thoroughly. Transfer into a deep serving bowl and toss with half of the butter. In a small skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and saute the onion until deeply colored, about 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients. Add the Sauteed onion along with the cooking fat and mix well. Fill the vareniki and cook as directed. In a large skillet, saute the bacon over medium heat until it renders its fat. Remove the bacon and drain all but 2 tablespoons of fat. Add the onion and saute over medium heat until nicely browned. Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the sauerkraut and saute, stirring until limp and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Add the sugar and broth. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature before filling. Use the reserved bacon for topping.; Combine all the filling ingredients and mix thoroughly. Fill and cook as directed. This filling can be either sweet or savory, so add salt or sugar, accordingly.

All together you should have approximately 8 pounds of fish scraps. If you are a good client you may get all of these at no charge! Soak the fish scraps in cold water for approximately 30 minutes. Wash thoroughly, drip dry. Dice onion, celery and fennel. Cut tomatoes in quarters. Crush the garlic cloves. Place the olive oil in a hot pot and wilt the vegetables without letting them color. Add fish scraps and wilt for an additional 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, crushed garlic cloves, bouquet garni, star anise, saffron and 5 quarts of water. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Boil for 25 minutes. SEE \THE BOUILLABAISSE\ Remove the bouquet garni. Pass the entire contents, a little at a time, through a food mill. All should go through the food mill with the exception of the fish bones which you will discard. Place the soup in a clean pot and bring to a boil, seasoning according to taste. Flatten the puff pastry to 1/8-inch thick, cut 8-circles approximately 1-inch wider than the soup cup you will be using. Place in each cup, 8 ounces (1 cup) of fish soup, already cold, cover with puff pastry. With a brush, moisten the outer rim of the cup with egg yolk. Place the puff pastry over the cup and seal well. Brush the pastry with egg yolk. Peel the potato while still warm. In a mortar, muddle, garlic clove with cayenne, salt and pepper. Add the potato, muddle, add egg yolk and saffron, muddle. Slowly incorporate the olive oil and emulsify the \rouille\ with the muddler until all of the oil has been used. Rub the outside of the baguette with garlic. Cut 16 slices, approximately 1/3-inch each, to be toasted. The Bouillabaisse: Poach the lobsters for 10 minutes in the soup. Remove and set aside. Ensure the live lobsters have been washed before poaching. Shell the lobsters, slice the lobster tails and set aside. Blanch the leeks and carrots in salted water, \al dente. Peel and slice potatoes approximately 1/8-inch thick. Cook the potatoes covered by an equal part of fish soup and water, add saffron. Do not overcook, they must stay in one piece. Poach the fish fillets in remainder of fish soup: nohu, opakapaka, John Dory and moano, in that order. The firmest fish requires longer cooking time and should go in first. The moano is very delicate and will not need more than 30 seconds cooking time. Bake the soup in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes. In the bottom of each plate place the vegetable julienne and the sliced potato, distribute in each plate an equal portion of fish and lobster. Arrange as a fan. Sprinkle with diced tomato and fennel leaves. Place in front of each guest the fish plate, the fish soup in crust on the left of each plate. With a small ladle, break the crust and scoop a good helping of soup over your bouillabaisse.

Griddle Cooking Station and preheat for 10 minutes. Whisk the kimchi juice, butter, gochujang, sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic and 1 tablespoon salt in a medium bowl until well combined; set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil on the high-heat side of the griddle. Add the carrots and onion and spread out in a single layer. Cook, tossing frequently with a large metal spatula, until the carrots start to soften slightly and the onion is transparent, about 3 minutes. Add the kimchi, mushrooms and zucchini and continue cooking, tossing often then spreading into a single layer, until the vegetables and kimchi release most of their liquid and start to brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the rice to the griddle, break it up with the back of the spatula and toss to combine with the vegetables. Pour the gochujang-butter sauce over the top and toss well until all the rice is coated. Spread into a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the rice occasionally and continue cooking until it starts to crisp slightly, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the low-heat side of the griddle. Crack the eggs on top and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide the fried rice among 8 bowls, top each with a fried egg and some scallions, gim and sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 44712,&quot;Mussels with Pernod and Cream 2 cups white wine 2 cups (about 6 ounces) thinly sliced leeks, white parts only 4 pounds mussels, scrubbed and debearded 4 tablespoons Pernod 2/3 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup diced pimento or roasted red pepper 6 tablespoons chopped flat leaf parsley Instructions: Place the wine and leeks in a large, heavy saucepan.

Divide the chocolate chips equally into 2 bowls and evenly pour the hot cream between the 2 bowls. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted. Add cinnamon to 1 of the bowls of melted chocolate. Place a spoon or ice pop stick into the bowl with the cinnamon so that you can differentiate it when you scoop them out. Put the ganache into the refrigerator until it firms up, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. In the meantime, place the graham cracker boards in a food storage bag and crush with your hands to make crumbs. Put the crumbs and the toasted coconut on separate flat plates. Remove the ganache from the refrigerator. Using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon, scoop out the ganache into the toppings. The cinnamon flavored chocolate goes into the graham cracker crumbs and the plain chocolate goes into the coconut. Roll them around to coat and form small balls. Work quickly to prevent the chocolate from melting. Transfer to a sheet pan and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set.

Don&#39;t be lazy here. Big chunks will not melt. Traditional method: Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boiling means the cream will actually rise up in the pan and threaten to boil over. Immediately pour the boiling cream over the chopped chocolate. Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream, then let it sit for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir in a circular motion, starting from the center of the bowl, and working out to the sides. Be careful not to add too much air to the ganache. Stir until all the chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. It may look done after 1 minute of stirring, but keep going to be sure it&#39;s emulsified. Food processor method: Place the chopped chocolate in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat (or bring to a boil in the microwave.) Immediately pour the hot cream into the food processor, on top of the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then pulse the machine 3 times. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and pulse 3 more times, until all the chocolate is melted. This smooth, silky chocolate is now ganache. Transfer the ganache to a bowl. Let the ganache sit at room temperature until it cools to 70 degrees F. In a 65 degree F room, this will take approximately 4 hours or 2 hours in the refrigerator. You can speed up the process by pouring the ganache out onto a clean baking sheet (thinner layers cool faster.) Once the ganache reaches 70 degrees F, it is ready to be used. At this point it can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 44733,&quot;Lemon Chicken and Leek Rice Pilaf 2 tablespoons butter 1/3 to 1/2 cup broken linguini 2 leeks, trimmed and chopped into thin half moons<br> Salt and pepper Salt and pepper<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine, optional<br> 1 1/4 cups white rice<br> 3 cups chicken stock, reserved from Poached Chicken, recipe follows 1 lemon, juiced and zested<br> 3 cups cooked chicken, about half of meat from Poached Chicken, recipe follows 1/2 cup parsley, chopped<br> 1 whole chicken, 5 pounds 2 bay leaves<br> 2 carrots, coarsely chopped, with stems, if you have them<br> 2 large cloves garlic, crushed<br> 1 lemon, sliced<br> 1 onion, quartered<br> A few stalks celery with leafy tops, coarsely chopped<br> A small handful fresh parsley with stems<br> Salt<br> A few peppercorns<br> Instructions: Heat the butter over medium heat in a skillet that has a lid.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like sand. Add the egg yolk and 4 teaspoons cold water; pulse until the dough comes together and forms a ball, adding up to 2 more teaspoons water if necessary. Press the dough into a 9-inch fluted tart pan in an even layer. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350? F. Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the crust looks dry, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove the paper and weights and bake 5 more minutes. Transfer the crust to a rack to cool completely. Make the filling: Combine the sugar and water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; cover and bring to a boil. Cook, covered, until the sugar is dissolved, 4 to 5 minutes. Uncover and cook until the caramel is a dark amber color, 3 to 5 more minutes. Remove the caramel from the heat and add the heavy cream; whisk until the caramel stops bubbling. Stir in the vanilla and fine salt. Let cool to room temperature. Combine the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Let melt completely, about 10 minutes, then stir to combine.

Add the corn and cook until lightly golden brown, then add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the cl de arbol and season with salt and pepper. Remove 1/2 cup of the kernels to a bowl for the ravioli filling to let cool slightly. Transfer the rest of the corn to a small saucepan and cover with the stock. Cook over medium heat until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer the corn to a blender with a slotted spoon, add 1/4 cup of the stock and carefully blend until the corn is smooth. Add 1/2 cup more stock to thin it slightly, then transfer the puree to the saute pan. Add more stock, if needed, to bring the puree to a sauce consistency. Stir in the creme fraiche and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. For the ravioli: Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and line it with cheesecloth. Place the ricotta in the strainer and drain for 4 hours. Whisk together 3 of the eggs, the yolk and some salt and pepper in a small bowl. Put the flour in another bowl, make a well in the center, add the egg mixture in the center and mix the flour into the eggs with a fork until combined. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Combine the drained ricotta, Parmesan, the reserved sauteed corn and 1 egg in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Divide the dough into quarters and roll thinly in a pasta machine to 1/8-inch thickness. Whisk the remaining 2 eggs together with a tablespoon of water. Dust the counter and dough with flour and lay out 2 sheets of the pasta. Brush the top surface of dough with the egg wash. Distribute 1-tablespoon mounds of filling about 2 inches apart on the 2 sheets of dough. Top with the remaining 2 sheets of dough. Using your fingers, gently press out the air pockets around each mound of filling and form a seal. Use a crimper or cookie cutter to cut each ravioli into squares or circles. Check to make sure the crimped edges are well sealed before cooking. If making the ravioli in advance, dust with cornmeal to prevent them from sticking. For the sauteed cherry tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the tomatoes and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and salt and pepper and cook until the juices release and then thicken slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper and stir in the basil. For the anchovy breadcrumbs: Heat the oil in a small saute pan over low heat, add the anchovies and cook until they are melted into the oil, about 1 minute. Add the breadcrumbs and cook until lightly golden brown, then season with salt and pepper. To serve: Bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli, in batches, until they float, about 2 minutes. Lift the ravioli from the water with a large strainer or slotted spoon and toss in the cherry tomato sauce to coat. Ladle some of the corn puree into 4 large shallow bowls. Top with 3 large ravioli in sauce, grate fresh Parmesan over and sprinkle with anchovy breadcrumbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 44739,&quot;Oatmeal Cake 1/2 cup steel-cut oats 1 1/4 cups boiling water 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup oat bran 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup apple sauce 1 pound cream cheese 1 cup powdered sugar 1/4 cup honey 1/2 to 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, toasted Instructions: In a saucepan, place the oats and the water and simmer 15 minutes to soften slightly. Allow to cool to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter a 8-inch square cake pan. In a mixer fitted with a whip attachment, cream the butter until smooth. Add granulated sugar and mix until smooth and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix just until combined. Add the cooked oats and mix just until combined. In another bowl, mix the flour, oat bran, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Working in 3 batches, add the dry ingredients to the butter-oat mixture, alternating with the applesauce mixing just until combined after each addition. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out dry and almost clean (a few crumbs are fine), 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool completely. Turn cake out onto a square serving platter. Place strips of paper under the cake around all the edges. To make the frosting, in a mixing bowl with a whip attachment cream the cream cheese on medium to high speed until light and fluffy. Turn the mixer to low and mix in the powdered sugar and honey. Frost the cake on the sides with a thin layer of frosting then use the remaining to cover the top and swirl it decoratively. Using your hands, press the toasted chopped nuts onto the side of the cake to coat it. Remove the paper strips before serving. Cut into 2-inch square pieces. Notes about the recipe: This is a delicious hearty and healthful cake. The texture added by the cooked steel cut oats makes you thing there are nuts inside. I made it to help me use up ends of jars of oat bran in the freezer and steel cut outs in the cereal drawer after the hot cereal breakfast season was over for the year. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 44740,&quot;Wild Mushroom Rice 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps cut 1/4-inch thick 2 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed and caps cut 1/4-inch thick 1/2 pound oyster mushrooms, stems removed and caps cut 1/4-inch thick Salt and pepper, to taste 1 Spanish onion, finely chopped 3 cups converted rice 7 cups chicken stock 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup porcini mushroom powder Instructions: Heat 3 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons oil in a large saute pan over high heat.

Line a flan ring with the pastry and chill the ring for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the flan ring with parchment paper or coffee filters and fill the shell with pie weights. Bake the pastry shell for about 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Remove the shell from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Remove the pie weights. Distribute the fruit evenly over the bottom of the shell, then pour in the Creme Brulee. Smooth the top with a long-bladed spatula. Just before serving, heat a caramel iron on the burner of a stove. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the top and carefully caramelize the sugar with the hot iron. Alternately, place the tart under a hot broiler, near the heat, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the sugar caramelizes. Or use a small blow torch to caramelize the sugar. In a large metal bowl set over a bain marie, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until the mixture is light and thick enough to form a ribbon. This takes quite a long time; be strong and patient. Remove from the heat. Carefully whisk in the cream. Add the vanilla bean. Place the bowl back over the bain marie and cook slowly for about 45 minutes, stirring frequently. Take care that the water does not boil. The custard will be done when the mixture adheres to your fingers without dripping. When the custard is done, remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, a little at a time, until all of it has been incorporated. Strain through a fine strainer into a bowl. Chill at least 6 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 44759,&quot;Italian Wellington 2 tablespoons vegetable oil One 3- to 3 1/2-pound center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed<br> 1 teaspoon salt 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, such as Pepperidge Farm, thawed<br> All-purpose flour, for dusting Eight 1/6-inch-thick slices prosciutto di Parma 2/3 cup jarred sun-dried tomato pesto<br> 1 egg<br> 1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt<br> Instructions: Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Tie the tenderloin in 3 or 4 different spots using butcher&#39;s twine to keep it tight and together. Season all over with the salt. Add to the hot pan and sear until evenly dark brown on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes total. Remove to a plate and let cool to room. Temperature. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the puff pastry sheet horizontally on a lightly floured board and roll out to a 14-by-10-inch rectangle. Lay the prosciutto slices vertically on the puff pastry, overlapping slightly and leaving a rim exposed pastry around the edges. Spoon the tomato pesto down the center of the prosciutto and gently spread to cover the center of the pastry sheet. Lay the tenderloin in the center of the puff pastry. Brush the edges of the pastry with egg wash, then roll it up around the meat. Seal the edges and tuck them under the meat. Place the wrapped tenderloin on a nonstick baking sheet and brush all over with egg wash. Sprinkle with the flaky sea salt and poke a few small holes in the top of the pastry. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the tenderloin reads 125 degrees F. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes.

Lay the beef in a large roasting pan with the bone side down. (The ribs act as a natural roasting rack.) In a small bowl mash together the garlic, horseradish, salt, pepper, and olive oil to make a paste. Massage the paste generously over the entire roast. Scatter the vegetables and halved garlic around the meat and drizzle them with a 2-count of oil. Put the pan in the oven and roast the beef for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for medium-rare (or approximately 20 minutes per pound). Check the internal temperature of the roast in several places with an instant-read thermometer; it should register 125 degrees F. for medium-rare. Remove the beef to a carving board and let it rest for 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the meat will continue to rise by about 10 degrees. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Pour the pan juices into a fat separator or small bowl and set aside to allow the fat and beef juices to separate. Pour off and discard the fat. You will use the tasty beef juices for the mushrooms. Place a clean skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and a 2-count drizzle of oil. When the butter starts to foam. add the mushrooms and thyme; and season with salt and pepper. Stir everything together for a few minutes. Add the red wine, stirring to scrape up any stuck bits; then cook and stir to evaporate the alcohol.

Butter and flour a 9-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan and a quarter sheet pan (13 by 9 inches). Sift the flour and salt into a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk the whole eggs, yolks, milk and vanilla together in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually add the granulated sugar 1/4 cup at a time until well combined. Turn the machine off and scrape down the paddle and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Continue to beat the butter mixture on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.<br> Turn the machine off and scrape the sides of the bowl again. Turn the mixer to its lowest setting and gradually add in the flour mixture 1/4 cup at a time until just combined. Slowly add the egg mixture. Remove the bowl from the mixer, scrape any batter off the paddle and make sure the batter is well combined. (Take care not to overmix.) Divide the batter in half. Fold the red food coloring into one half and the green into the other half with a rubber spatula until no streaks remain. Pour the red batter into the prepared quarter sheet pan and bake until set, but slightly under-baked, about 18 minutes.<br> Turn the cake out onto a parchment-lined surface. Let cool slightly, then cut 12 hearts out of the sheet cake with a 2- or 3-inch heart cookie cutter. Pour enough green batter into the prepared loaf pan to just cover the bottom. Nestle the hearts point-end down in a row down the center of the batter, so that they snugly fit the length of the pan. Spoon the remaining batter on top and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the top springs back when lightly pressed, 50 minutes to 1 hour. For the glaze: Meanwhile, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk and vanilla in a medium bowl to make a thick but pourable glaze.<br> Cool the cake in the pan on a rack set into a rimmed baking sheet, 10 to 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a plate. Re-invert the cake and set it right-side up on the rack. Pour the glaze over the cake while still warm, allowing excess glaze to drip into the pan below. Allow the cake to cool completely. Slice into the cake to reveal the heart inside.<br> The cake will keep wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature for 4 to 5 days, and freezes well for up to 1 month. Combine the beet juice, beet powder and cocoa powder in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Combine the matcha powder with 3 tablespoons water in another small bowl and whisk until smooth.

There&#39;s no way getting around using your fingers to eat this, unless you can really be bothered to take the mussels out of their shells for your guests. If you can&#39;t get your hands on fresh whole Green-lip mussels, you may be able to find some that have been prepped already, whereby they come in the half shell, already partly cooked. If this is the case, make the recipe as follows, but don&#39;t add the mussels. Cook the tomato broth for 4 minutes, before adding them and cooking a further 2 minutes. Place the mussels in a large pot with a tight fitting lid and add the next 6 ingredients. Mix well, then pour on the wine and oil. Place over a high heat, bring to the boil and cook for 3 minutes. Take the lid off the pot and give the mussels a stir, put the lid back on and cook a further 2 minutes. They&#39;re cooked when they all open, however you occasionally get some that are stubborn and refuse to play ball, so when you serve them discard these. I like to scoop out the mussels into a large ceramic bowl and leave it covered and warm while I serve my guests the broth as a first course in flat soup bowls. Then I bring the mussels to the table and serve them with a huge spoon into the soup bowls, then use the ceramic bowl for the discarded shells. I serve the mussels with lots of fresh crusty bread. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 44829,&quot;Bacon Pecan Waffles 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup crushed pecans 2 slices cooked bacon, chopped 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Nonstick cooking spray 2 cups pancake mix, such as Krusteaz 1 1/3 cup milk 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions: For the bacon pecans: Add butter to a skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Then add the brown sugar, pecans, bacon and vanilla. Cook until a caramel texture, 2 to 3 minutes. For the waffles: Spray a waffle griddle with nonstick cooking spray. Heat the griddle on medium heat. Whisk together the pancake mix, milk, oil, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl. Ladle the waffle batter into the waffle griddle and close. Cook until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Lightly grease an 18-by-13-inch sheet pan with the butter. Bring the cream, thyme, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, then turn off the stove.<br> Thinly slice the potatoes on a mandoline or vegetable slicer into rounds about 1/8 inch thick. Arrange half the potato slices in a single, overlapping layer on the sheet pan and sprinkle evenly with salt, half the Cheddar and half the Parmesan. Top with the remaining potato slices and sprinkle with salt. Drizzle the hot cream mixture evenly over the potatoes. Use a small offset spatula or butter knife to spread the garlic and thyme evenly over the potatoes.<br> Cover the pan with foil and bake until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a paring knife, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and sprinkle the potatoes with the remaining Cheddar and Parmesan.

Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender but still firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid, then drain the pasta. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Remove the garlic and discard. Add the spinach and 2 teaspoons pepper, and cook until the spinach has wilted, about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the pasta. Add the Pecorino Romano cheese and 2 teaspoons each salt and pepper, and toss until coated. In a medium bowl, whisk together the reserved cooking liquid and the mascarpone cheese until smooth. Pour over the pasta and toss until coated. Season with salt.

Reserve 1/4 cup of the chopped chocolate. Pour the rest into a glass bowl and melt in the microwave at 50 percent power for 1 minute. Stir gently, and let sit for a minute or so. If the chocolate needs more melting, microwave again at half power for 30 seconds. Stir gently. Continue the process, stirring gently as you go. But be very careful not to overcook the chocolate. Temper the melted chocolate by stirring in the reserved 1/4 cup of chopped chocolate as it cools. This will &#39;re-emulsify&#39; the chocolate and enable it to harden at room temperature. Using a teaspoon, spoon a portion of the chocolate into the middle of a muffin cup. Draw the chocolate up the edges of the cup with the back of the spoon (or you can paint the chocolate on with a small paintbrush). Coat the entire inside of the muffin cup with chocolate and place it into a muffin tin. Repeat with the remaining muffin cups and then put the whole muffin tin in the refrigerator so that the chocolate hardens. Combine the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and salt in a mixer. Pour the mixture into a resealable plastic bag and seal. When the chocolate in the muffin cups has hardened, pop the sweetened peanut butter into the microwave on full power for 1 minute. This will soften up the peanut butter so that it easily flows into the cups. Cut a corner off the edge of the plastic bag. You can use this to pipe the peanut butter into each of the chocolate-coated cups. Put a banana chip on top of each cup. Put the candy in the refrigerator to harden the peanut butter. This should take 15 to 20 minutes. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 44833,&quot;Buttered Turnip Puree 3 large turnips, peeled and cut into even sized medium chunks 3 1/2 cups milk 1/2 bunch fresh thyme 2 clove garlic, peeled and gently crushed with the side of a knife 1 stick unsalted butter, cut into cubes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Add turnips, milk, thyme and garlic to a medium-sized sauce pot. Set over medium heat and place the lid over the pot so it is just covering. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 20 to 30 minutes until tender - the tip of a paring knife should go through without resistance. Remove the thyme and remove 2 cups of the liquid. Drain and place turnips back into the same pan and blend using an immersion blender or place to a food processor. Add butter and about 1 cup of the milk cooking liquid and blend.

Using a bench scraper or pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour until the butter is pea-sized. Slowly add the ice water, folding it into the flour until a dough comes together, being mindful not to overwork it. (If the dough is too dry, add another tablespoon of ice water at a time.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and form it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a 1/8-inch-thick circle. Then roll it up onto the rolling pin and gently lay it out on a parchment-lined baking sheet. For the filling: In the center of the rolled out dough, add the plums and sprinkle them with the brown sugar, ginger, vanilla, lemon juice, salt, flour and butter. Fold the edges of the dough over to create a rough border; it doesn?t have to be perfect, just good enough to form a wall. Brush the edges with milk and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Bake until the filling is bubbling and thickened, and the crust is golden brown, 45 minutes.

F. Toss the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter and sugar in a medium bowl until well combined. Firmly press into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of a 9-inch round springform pan. Bake until firm and a few shades darker, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Reduce the oven temperature to 300? F. Meanwhile, make the filling: Beat the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and slightly fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the heavy cream until combined. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla. Pour the filling into the cooled crust. Bake until the cheesecake is set around the edges but the center still jiggles slightly, 1 hour to 1 hour 25 minutes. Turn off the oven. Keep the cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar slightly, 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake to loosen. Transfer the pan to a rack and let the cheesecake cool completely, then refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove the springform ring, then slice the cheesecake.<br> Drain two 14.5-ounce cans tart cherries, reserving 1/3 cup liquid. Combine the drained cherries, 1 cup bottled tart cherry juice, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 vanilla bean (add the pod and the seeds) and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Simmer until syrupy, 20 minutes. Whisk 2 tablespoons cornstarch into the reserved cherry liquid, then pour into the saucepan. While stirring, bring to a boil and cook 1 more minute. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 teaspoon almond extract; let cool. Discard the vanilla bean. Refrigerate until chilled. Heat 2/3 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup malt powder in a saucepan over medium heat, whisking, until the powder is dissolved and the mixture is steaming. Pour over 6 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate in a bowl; let stand 3 to 5 minutes. Stir until smooth, then let stand until thickened, 20 to 40 minutes. Pour over the cheesecake and spread with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle with chopped malt balls. Let set about 20 minutes. Slice a 2-inch piece of ginger into thin rounds. Combine the ginger with 1/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook until syrupy, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then remove the ginger and stir in 1/2 teaspoon lime zest. Toss the ginger-lime syrup with 3/4 cup chopped pineapple, 2 chopped kiwis and 1/2 chopped mango. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 44876,&quot;Chocolate Cheesecake 1 1/3 cups graham cracker crumbs 1/2 stick butter 1 tablespoon cocoa 6 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped small 2 1/2 cups cream cheese 3/4 cup superfine sugar 1 tablespoon custard powder 3 large eggs 3 large egg yolks 2/3 cup sour cream 1/2 teaspoon cocoa, dissolved in 1 tablespoon hot water 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon dark corn syrup Special equipment: 9-inch springform pan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the base, process the graham crackers to make rough crumbs and then add the butter and cocoa. Process again until it makes damp, clumping crumbs and then tip them into the pan. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan to make an even base and put into the freezer while you make the filling. Put a kettle on to boil. Melt the chocolate either in a microwave or double boiler, and set aside to cool slightly. Beat the cream cheese to soften it, then add the sugar and custard power, beating again to combine. Beat in the whole eggs and then the yolks, and the sour cream. Finally add the cocoa dissolved in hot water and melted chocolate and mix to a smooth batter. Take the springform tin out of the freezer and line the outside of the tin with a good layer of cling wrap, and then another layer of strong foil over that. This will protect it from the water bath. Sit the springform tin in a roasting pan and pour in the cheesecake filling. Fill the roasting pan with just boiled water to come about half way up the cake tin and bake in the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The top of the cheesecake should be set, but the underneath should still have a wobble to it. Peel away the foil and cling film wrapping and sit the cheesecake in its tin on a rack to cool. Put in the refrigerator once it is no longer hot, and leave to set, covered with plastic overnight. Let it lose its chill before unspringing the cheesecake to serve. To make the chocolate sauce: very gently melt the chopped chocolate, cream and syrup. When the chocolate has nearly melted, take off the heat and whisk it to a smooth sauce. Let it cool a little, and pour it over the chocolate cheesecake on its serving plate. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 44877,&quot;Chopped Salad with Crumbled Feta 3 Roma tomatoes (seeded, if they&#39;re really juicy), chopped into 1/2-inch pieces Kosher salt 1/2 large or 1 small cucumber (I prefer Persian or English cucumbers), chopped into 1/2-inch pieces 1/2 red onion, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces Black pepper A light drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil A good squeeze of lemon 1/2 cup crumbled feta Instructions: Place the tomatoes in a strainer set over a bowl or the sink.

Roll into 3 ropes, 9- to 10-inches long and about 1/3-inch wide. Press one rope into a triangle shape by flattening the sides (a ruler is helpful for this). Wrap the orange pieces separately in plastic and freeze until hard, about 15 minutes. Slice through the uncolored cylinder lengthwise to make 2 long half-moons. Brush both halves on the cut side with the egg wash. Press the orange triangle rope down the center of the cut side of one of the halves. Cover with the other half and press together to seal and re-form into a cylinder.<br> Make the black part of the penguin&#39;s body: On a floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll the black dough into a 1/4-inch thick 9-by-4-inch rectangle, with the long side facing you. Use the rolling pin to flatten each of the long sides out 1 inch more so that the edges are thinner and the rectangle mounds in the center. The rectangle should be 9 by 6 inches. Brush the black rectangle with the egg wash then wrap it around the uncolored cylinder, pushing with your hands to adhere the doughs. There will be a thicker layer of black dough on top of the cylinder (the penguin&#39;s head) and a thinner layer on the bottom. Adhere the feet: Brush the thinner, bottom part of the black dough with egg wash and press the 2 thin orange ropes along the length of the dough about 1/4 inch apart (these will be the feet). Wrap in plastic and use the heels of your hands to form the log into an egg shape; the head should be the narrow end. Freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Rub the pork with 1 tablespoon hot mustard and season generously with salt and pepper; let marinate 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the rice as the label directs; set aside. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and swirl to coat. Add the pork, return to the oven and roast, flipping once, until a thermometer inserted into the middle registers 140 degrees F to 145 degrees F, 22 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest. Meanwhile, heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the cabbage and a big pinch of salt. Let sit, undisturbed, 1 minute, then toss and cook until crisp-tender and lightly charred, about 1 more minute. Remove to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium high and add the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil and the carrots. Cook until just tender, about 6 minutes. Whisk the garlic, soy sauce, brown sugar and remaining 1 teaspoon hot mustard in a small bowl, then add to the skillet with the carrots. Toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Add the bean sprouts and toss until warmed through, about 1 minute; remove from the heat. Thinly slice the pork. Divide the rice among bowls and top with the cabbage, carrot mixture, pork and wonton strips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 44911,&quot;Rib-Eye Steak with Black Olive Vinaigrette 1 2-inch rib-eye steak, boneless 1 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon herbes de Provence 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup black olives, pitted 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1 garlic clove 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: For the Rib-eye: Preheat your grill pan on medium high heat. Coat the beef with olive oil and sprinkle with the Herbs de Provence, salt, and pepper. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes a side until the meat is medium-rare, remove from heat, and allow to rest. For the Black Olive Vinaigrette: Combine the olives, red wine vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper in a blender and blend until mixed. In a small pitcher combine the olive oil and vegetable oil. Drizzle the oil into the blender with the machine running. Transfer the vinaigrette to a serving dish. Stir in the parsley and serve with the rib-eye. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 44912,&quot;Sweet Corn Risotto with Herbes de Provence 5 cups Rich Chicken Stock or store-bought low-sodium stock 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 scallions, thinly sliced 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice (or Carnaroli or Vialone Nano) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc) 3/4 cup fresh corn (see note, page 53) or frozen, thawed 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup freshly grated or shredded Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon Herbes de Provence (see note) Instructions: Heat the chicken stock in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until hot, reduce the heat to low, and keep the stock at a low simmer. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Cook the scallions, stirring, just until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the rice, stirring slowly and continuously with a wooden spoon until the grains are opaque and coated in the oil, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and pour in the wine. Cook and stir until all the liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Don&#39;t let the rice brown. Ladle in about 1 cup of the warm stock and stir with a wooden spoon until the rice has absorbed all the liquid, about 6 minutes. When almost all the liquid is gone, ladle in another 1/2 cup stock. Keep stirring and adding the stock, 1/2 cup at a time, allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. After the rice has absorbed 2 1/2 cups stock, taste it. The rice should be firm to the bite but creamy. If it is hard, continue to add stock, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the rice tastes perfect to you. (You may not need all of the stock.) Stir in the corn and reduce the heat to very low so the risotto stops simmering. Stir in the butter, cheese, and herbs. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 44913,&quot;The Watering Can and Easter Bunnies Modeling Chocolate (see previous recipe) Bittersweet chocolate, tempered, 48 ounces, 1350 grams White chocolate, melted, 2 ounces, 60 grams Milk chocolate, melted, 2 ounces, 60 grams Bittersweet chocolate, tempered, 2 ounces, 60 grams Instructions: You can recreate this centerpiece using any size or shape of molds. I used an egg mold to create the body of the watering can and the bodies of the bunnies. I used 2 of the sizes of the round molds to create the heads and the smallest dome on that mold to make the eyes. To make the watering can: It is very easy to mold an egg. Use a ladle to fill the plastic mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the egg should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the plastic mold clean on the side of the bowl or with a knife and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean again with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. If the chocolate is properly tempered, it will easily release from the mold. To unmold, gently push down on one side of the molded chocolate and the opposite side will lift from the mold. Use melted chocolate to glue together the two halves. In a professional kitchen, a chef often heats a baking sheet and gently presses each half against the warm metal to melt the edges a little bit. Then we press them together and set aside until the chocolate sets. Cut a circle from heavy cardboard that is large enough to serve as a base for your watering can. Use a pastry brush to cover one side with chocolate. Set aside until the chocolate is set. Use this as the base for your watering can. Apply more melted chocolate to the bottom of the egg and glue it to the base. Allow it to set. Use a hot serrated knife to cut the top third off of the egg. Be gentle and let the heat of the knife do the work. If you press too hard, the egg will break. If that happens, you may be able to use tempered chocolate to glue it back together. This cut creates the opening to the top of the watering can. You can adjust the size of the opening to accommodate the size of bunnies you are making. To make the spout: Roll a piece of acetate paper into a cone shape that is the correct proportion for the size of the body. Fill the cone with tempered chocolate. Set aside until it sets. When it is set, unwrap the acetate. Use a warm serrated knife to cut off the tip until it is an appropriate size for the size of your watering can. To make the handle, first draw the shape with a pencil onto a piece of parchment paper. Make one handle then make the mirror image of it. Put some melted chocolate into a bowl. Stir in about 2 teaspoons of water so the chocolate will seize. Place this chocolate in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip. Use the chocolate to trace over your handles. Set aside until the chocolate sets. When set, use a little melted chocolate to glue together the flat sides of the 2 handles. To attach the spout and handle: Use melted chocolate to attach the spout and handle to the watering can. You can prop the spout against something while the chocolate sets. Place the spout on one side and the handle on the opposite side. If you want to make the watering can appearance to be rusty or as if it is made of velvet, use the chocolate paint sprayer technique explained in the Easter bonnet recipe. Don\u2019t forget to place the watering can in the freezer first. Use the same molding technique used for the body of the watering can to make the bodies and heads of the bunnies. I used egg shapes for the bodies and round molds for the heads. You can also use the smallest dome on the round molds to make little cheeks. I made one bunny a little larger than the other. I made additional molds from the smallest dome and cut them in half to create eyelids for the smaller bunny. To hide all of the seams on the bunnies, you can use the paint sprayer to spray the bunnies before you attach the eyes, nose and tongue. Do not put the bunny in the refrigerator like you do with the watering can. That way, you\u2019ll get a different texture. To make the ears, nose and tongue: I made the ears by cutting out the ear shapes from parchment paper. Use a pastry brush to paint the tempered chocolate onto the parchment paper. When the chocolate sets, peel off the parchment paper. If you want to bend one ear, do that before the chocolate sets. To attach the ears, use the tip of a paring knife to create a small hole at the top of the head for each ear. It will help if you use a hot knife. Dip the end of the ears in melted chocolate and then slide them gently into the holes you made. Allow them to set. You can make the nose and tongue out of modeling chocolate (if you have it from the previous project) or marzipan. Make any shape that strikes your fancy. Adhere the pieces to the face using chocolate to \glue\ them in place. To make the eyes, use the smallest circle of the mold (or anything you can find at home). Make three cornets. Fill one with tempered dark chocolate, one with tempered milk chocolate and one with tempered white chocolate. Use the white chocolate to place a small drop in the center of the mold to create the pupil. Use the milk chocolate to make the pupil by piping a slightly larger amount on top of the pupil. Finish with a larger drop of white chocolate directly on top of the other two to create the white of the eye. If you\u2019ve used a mold with a rounded bottom, the eyes will have a 3-dimensional quality. Affix the eyes by \gluing\ them with a little dark chocolate. To make the butterflies: It is easy to reproduce any line drawing in chocolate. Place the drawing under a sheet of acetate. The chocolate against the acetate will take on a nice shine. For this reason, I like to make that side the front of the drawing. Make 2 cornets and fill one with tempered dark chocolate and the other with tempered white chocolate. Use the dark chocolate to trace the outline of the drawing onto the acetate. Use both white and dark chocolate to shade the drawing as appropriate. Be sure to completely fill the inside of the drawing so you end up with a solid re-creation of the drawing. It will also be easier to unmold and handle if there are no gaps in the drawing. Place the acetate in the refrigerator to help the drawing to set. To unmold, simply peel the acetate from the front of the chocolate drawing. Final assembly: Fill the bottom half of your watering can with crumpled plastic wrap or paper. This will create a seat for the bunnies. Set the bunnies inside the can so they rest on top of the filling. Use a little melted chocolate to attach the butterflies to the watering can. If you want to write \Happy Easter\ on the front of the watering can, do it with melted chocolate that you\u2019ve placed in a cornet. You can practice on an acetate sheet before you move to the final project. Enjoy! Tip: Never coat a mold with fat when you use chocolate. It does not help the chocolate to unmold. Chocolate is like plaster - it retracts when it cools. Chocolate cannot be molded onto any porous surface, like wood or a sponge. In order of preference, the best types of molds are plastic, stainless steel, and glass. Be careful with glass because it retains temperature, whether it is hot or cold. If the glass mold is slightly warm or cold, it will untemper the chocolate before it has time to set. When molding chocolate, always remember that the chocolate takes on the temperature of the mold.

Remove from the pan and drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 44950,&quot;Strozzapreti 1 pound/500 g all-purpose flour 3 plum tomatoes, peeled, finely chopped with juices 1 egg Salt Sauce 1/4 cup/50 ml extra-virgin olive oil 1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped 1/2 cup/125 ml finely grated Parmigiano cheese 1/4 cup reserved pasta water Instructions: Put the flour on a worktable. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the tomatoes, egg, and salt. Combine together and knead until the mixture becomes an even dough. If the mixture becomes too wet, add more flour, if it becomes too dry, add more tomato juice. Sprinkle the work surface with a little flour. Cut a quarter of the dough and roll the dough flat. Cut the dough into strips 1/2-inch wide and then each strip about 2 to 3-inches long. Using your thumb and index finger, gently pinch the width of the dough strip, and then roll out. Repeat the above process until all the dough is used up. Cover up any excess dough with a cloth to prevent it from drying, if you are not using it immediately. Put the dough-strips on a lightly floured board and then add to a pot of boiling salted water. Stir to prevent the pasta from sticking together and drain when the pasta floats to the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta water. To make the sauce: Add the olive oil, chopped rosemary, and Parmigiano cheese to a cold saucepan. Add the cooked strozzapreti to the saucepan with a 1/4 cup pasta water and mix well. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 44951,&quot;Fish Tacos with Chipotle Cream 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 pound white flaky fish fillet, like tilapia or halibut 1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 teaspoons chipotle pepper, in adobo sauce 8 (6-inch) corn tortillas 1 1/2 cups shredded green cabbage or lettuce 1/2 cup corn kernels (thawed if frozen) 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves Lime wedges Instructions: In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lime juice, salt and pepper. Pour over the fish fillets and let marinate for 20 minutes. Put the yogurt into a strainer lined with apaper towel and place over a bowl to drain and thicken for 20 minutes. Remove the fish from the marinade and grill on a preheated grill or nonstick grill pan over a medium-high heat until cooked thorough, about 3 minutes per side. Set the fish aside on a plate for 5 minutes. In a small bowl combine the thickened yogurt, mayonnaise, and chipotle pepper. Heat the tortillas on the grill or grill pan for 30 seconds on each side. Flake the fish with a fork. Top each tortilla with 1 tablespoon of the chipotle cream. Top with fish, cabbage, corn and cilantro and serve with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 44952,&quot;Salsiccia Pizza 4 1/2 cups bread flour, plus additional for dusting 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon instant dry yeast<br> 2 cups cool water (60 degrees F or so)<br> 2 teaspoons salt, preferably fine sea salt<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the bowl and sheet pan 1 red onion One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes<br> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for drizzling<br> 1 teaspoon sea salt<br> 1 pound Italian sausage, meat removed from casings 1 pound fresh mozzarella<br> Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling Instructions: For the pizza dough: Mix together the flours and yeast in a large bowl, then pour in the water and mix together, squeezing with your fingers to thoroughly hydrate all the flour, until it has formed a shaggy mass. Cover the bowl in plastic wrap and set aside until the dough looks relaxed and somewhat smooth and the flour is completely hydrated, about 1 hour. Add the salt and squeeze the dough with your hands to incorporate. Turn the dough out on a counter and knead until the gluten develops and the dough is beginning to show some resistance, about 10 minutes. Spray a bowl with cooking spray or lightly coat with oil, then add the dough and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise overnight in your refrigerator. Turn the dough out onto a counter and divide into 4 portions as evenly as possible. Take each portion and imagine them as a square; start by folding opposite corners into the middle until you&#39;ve done all four corners. Repeat the process, then fold the dough over itself in half, turn 90 degrees and fold again, tucking the seam side down. Grip the dough ball like a doorknob and pull it towards you while turning it clockwise to seal the bottom. Place on an oiled sheet pan and repeat with remaining dough portions. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to proof at room temperature for 2 hours. For the pizza sauce: Put a pizza stone in your oven and turn the heat as high as it will go. While the oven is preheating, place the red onion on the pizza stone and allow it to roast until the skin has turned black and the onion feels slightly soft to the touch, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven, allow to cool enough to handle and peel back the first couple layers to reveal the roasted onion inside. Cut into quarters, then separate into individual petals. Combine the canned tomatoes with the olive oil and sea salt in a small bowl and crush it all together with your hands. (Crush it as coarse or as smooth as you&#39;d like, it&#39;s your pizza.) Cook the Italian sausage off in a frying pan over medium-high heat, breaking up with a spoon, and cooking all the way through. Drain off the grease and allow to cool. When the oven and pizza stone are both well preheated, at least an hour or so, begin to stretch your pies. Carefully remove one dough ball from the sheet pan and toss it into a bowl of flour. Lightly press it down with your hand to flatten it, applying even pressure. Pick the dough up by your fingertips about 1/2 inch in from the edge, and with your fingertips turned inwards, slowly start to rotate the dough in a circle to form a crust. Once you&#39;ve completed a full circle, set the dough down on the counter. Using your fingertips, dimple the inside of the crust edge to flatten it down. Then pick it up, and resting the dough over the back of your hands, start to rotate the dough, allowing it to stretch with its own weight, moving your hands as if you were making a U-turn in a car. Once the dough is stretched to 10 to 12 inches, place it on a well-floured pizza peel. Spread some of your pizza sauce evenly around the dough with a spoon, keeping it inside the crust. Crumble a quarter of the cooked sausage over the top, then place 6 to 8 of the roasted onion petals over that. Tear the mozz into tablespoon-size chunks and place them on top of the pizza (each pie should get about 3 ounces). Large chunks around the outside, smaller in the middle, but none in the center, or it will make your slices hard to pick up. Place the pie in the oven on the pizza stone with a quick jerking motion, then quickly shut the door. Cook the pizza until the crust is almost a dark walnut color, 10 to 15 minutes. Don&#39;t be scared of some char; the closer you can get to being burnt, without actually burning the pizza, the better. Remove the pizza from the oven, sprinkle with the flaky sea salt, drizzle with olive oil, and cut into slices. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 3 more pizzas. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 44953,&quot;Gnocchi with Tomato, Basil and Olives 5 fresh basil leaves, washed, dried and shredded Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup pitted Gaeta olives or other large green olives 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce 6 quarts salted water 1 recipe gnocchi 1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese Instructions: In a large, deep skillet, heat the butter over medium-high heat until foaming.

In a small bowl, mix the mustard powder, paprika, salt, chili powder and pepper. Sprinkle the mixture all over the steaks. Let sit at room temperature for 2 hours. Make the charred peppers: Heat a large braiser or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until searing hot. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss the baby bell sweet and shishito peppers with the olive oil, habaneros, chili powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Add the pepper mixture to the braiser and lower the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until charred in spots and tender but still with some bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Make the vinaigrette: While the peppers are cooking, in a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, honey, pickled peppers, vinegar, red pepper flakes, garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Once the charred pepper mixture is cooked, add them to the vinaigrette along with the quartered pickled peppers. Toss to coat well and set aside. Make the aioli: In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise, pepper brine, cherry peppers, paprika, garlic and salt to taste. Place in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Cook the steaks: Preheat a grill pan or grill over medium-high heat.

Pulse the shortbread cookies in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer the crumbs to a medium bowl and set aside. Add the freeze-dried strawberries to the food processor and pulse until finely ground. Remove 1/4 cup of the ground strawberries to a separate bowl and set aside. Reserve 1 cup of the cookie crumbs for the topping. Add the rest of the cookie crumbs to the food processor along with 1/2 teaspoon salt and the brown sugar and pulse to combine. With the processor running, drizzle in the butter and continue to process until the crumbs are coated and the mixture resembles wet sand. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spoon the jam over the crust and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze while you make the ice cream. Whip the cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, about 2 minutes. Decrease the speed to low. Add the sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the vanilla, then increase the speed to medium and beat until combined and the mixture has soft peaks. Pour the cream mixture over the jam and spread evenly with an offset spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until solid, at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours. Meanwhile, cut six strips of parchment paper that are each 3/4 inch wide by at least 13 inches long. Cut a 4-by-5-inch rectangle from parchment paper as well. Using the foil overhang, lift the cake out of the pan and place onto a cutting board with a long side facing you. Sprinkle the reserved shortbread crumbs to cover the ice cream layer completely in an even layer. Using a fine-mesh sieve, sift the confectioners&#39; sugar over the shortbread crumbs in an even layer until the top is completely white. Place the 4-by-5-inch parchment rectangle on the top left-hand corner of the cake. Arrange the parchment strips in even intervals across the cake, starting 3/4 inch from the top and stopping 3/4 inch from the bottom. Using the fine-mesh sieve, dust the reserved ground strawberries in an even layer over top of the templates. Carefully remove all the parchment templates. Sprinkle the blue sprinkles over the blocked-off corner area in an even layer. Scatter the star candies on top of the blue sprinkles.

Remove from the heat and fold in the popcorn to coat. Sprinkle in the cheese powder and mustard powder. Fold together to evenly coat. Transfer to a large serving bowl. For the caramel popcorn: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and generously spray with nonstick spray. Wipe the large pot clean of any excess popcorn residue. Add the brown sugar, corn syrup and butter to the same pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to let it boil, without stirring, until it turns a deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the salt, vanilla and baking soda. Gently fold in the popcorn until well coated (spraying a rubber spatula works well, here!). Transfer the popcorn to the prepared baking sheet and bake until the caramel has melted around the popcorn and nicely coats the kernels all over, about 10 minutes.

Cut the tops and bottoms off the apples to give them flat surfaces to rest on. In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until the mixture begins to turn golden brown and caramelized. Add the brandy and lemon juice and stir to blend. Adjust the heat so the mixture remains at a simmer. Place the apples in the liquid and simmer until the submerged portion is tender, about 15 minutes. Turn the apples over and cook until tender all the way through, about 15 minutes more. Remove from the liquid and set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment or buttered waxed paper. Unroll the puff pastry on a work surface and brush the pastry with melted butter. In a small bowl, toss together the sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over the pastry. Working lengthwise, cut the pastry into 6 even strips, each 3/4-inch wide. Twist the strips, keeping the cinnamon sugar on the inside, to make long twisted \straws.\ Transfer to the prepared pan, run your fingers along the twists to straighten, and bake about 20 minutes, until puffed and golden brown. Pour the sugar into the center of a saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the sugar, trying not to splash any sugar onto the sides of the pan. Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar to moisten it. Over medium heat, bring to a boil without stirring. Cook until light caramel in color and immediately remove from the heat. Carefully (it will bubble up and may splatter) stir in the cream with a wooden spoon until smooth. To serve, place an apple on each serving plate. Drizzle with caramel sauce, sprinkle with peanuts, and place a pastry straw in the hole of each apple so that it sticks up like a wooden stick. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 44967,&quot;Cocoa-Coffee-Chili Seasoned Pork with Pear Apple Chutney 2 tablespoons cl blend seasoning 2 tablespoons bittersweet cocoa powder 2 tablespoons fine-ground coffee 1 center-cut pork loin, trimmed (about 6 ounces) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon butter 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled and small-diced 2 Anjou pears, peeled and small-diced 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons brown sugar Small head frisee, for serving Juice of 1/2 an orange Olive oil, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Discard the thyme and bay leaves, but keep the garlic for serving with the sprouts; the cloves will be very soft and tasty.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44970,&quot;Burgers 1/2 pound ground brisket 1/2 pound ground short rib<br> 1/2 pound ground sirloin<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 slices American cheese<br> 3 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 4 soft potato rolls, such as Martin&#39;s<br> 8 slices thick-cut bacon, cooked until crispy 1/4 cup shaved raw red onion<br> Pickle slices, such as Tony Packo&#39;s Sweet Hots or a crunchy dill pickle variety, for serving<br> Brown mustard, such as Bertman Ballpark Mustard or similar, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you&#39;re not using an outdoor grill, preheat a second grill pan over medium heat (for a side griddle). Gently mix together the brisket, short rib and sirloin in a large bowl. Divide the mixture into 4 equal pieces and gently form into burgers, being careful not to pack too tightly.<br> Season both sides of the burgers with a good amount of salt and freshly ground black pepper.<br> When the grill or first grill pan is at medium-high, place the burgers on the grill and cook to your desired temperature, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium rare. Add a piece of cheese to each burger and cook for another minute or so until it is melted.<br> In the meantime, spread the mayo on the cut side of the buns and place them over medium heat or on the secondary grill pan to toast.<br> Build the burgers by placing a burger on each bottom bun and top with 2 pieces of bacon, some red onion, pickles and mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 44971,&quot;Garlic Rosemary Mashed Potatoes 2 pounds russet or Idaho potatoes, peeled and quartered 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon McCormick? Garlic Powder 1/2 teaspoon McCormick? Rosemary Leaves, crushed 1/4 teaspoon McCormick? Black Pepper, Ground 1/2 cup milk 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, cut into chunks 1 teaspoon McCormick? Parsley Flakes Instructions:</p><ol><li>Place potatoes in medium saucepan. Cover with water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 10 to 15 minutes or until potatoes are fork tender.

Stir in parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44972,&quot;Fondue with Apple Brandy 1 3/4 cups dry white wine 1 tablespoon lemon juice 3/4 pound Gruyere, shredded 3/4 pound Emmentaler, shredded 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/3 cup apple brandy Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste A pinch or 2 cayenne pepper, to taste Instructions: Put the wine in a fondue pot and bring to a bubble over medium heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the lemon juice, then add the cheeses in handfuls, stirring in a figure-8 motion with wooden spoon. When the cheese is fully melted, stir the cornstarch into the brandy, in a small bowl until smooth, then add to cheese. Season with nutmeg and cayenne and serve over a warming station for your fondue pot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44973,&quot;Poached Halibut in Warm Herb Vinaigrette 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 cup Vinaigrette (see recipe above) 1 small shallot, peeled and finely diced 3 cups court bouillon 4 (8-ounce) halibut steaks, skin on Fine sea salt, to taste Freshly ground white pepper, to taste 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh Italian parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chervil 2 bunch cleaned leeks, sauteed 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 2 pinches freshly ground white pepper 3 tablespoons red wine vineagar 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon corn oil Instructions: Put the mustard in mixing bowl and slowly whisk in 1 cup of the Vinaigrette. Whisk in the shallot. Put in a small saucepan and set aside. Bring the court bouillon to a boil in a 10-inch pot. Season the halibut with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the halibut to the pot and adjust the heat so the liquid just simmers. Poach until a metal skewer inserted into the center of the halibut meets only a little resistance and the skewer, when left in the fish for 5 seconds, feels barely warm when touched to your lip, about 5 to 6 minutes. The halibut should be rare (thinner steaks will be ready sooner). Take the steaks out ot the liquid as soon as they are done (discard the court bouillon). In a small saute pan with 1 tablespoon butter, saute leeks until tender. Meanwhile, add the herbs to the Vinaigrette and warm over low heat. Pull the skin off the halibut and place in the center of 4 plates. Spoon the Vinaigrette over and around the fish. Serve immediately, with steamed asparagus. Whisk together the mustard, salt, pepper, and vinegars. Whisking constantly, very slowly drizzle in the olive oil and then the corn oil. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 44974,&quot;Southern Biscuits 12 ounces of White Lily flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon cream of tartar 3/4 teaspoon salt 3 ounces of chilled lard 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1/4 cup more if necessary Flour Instructions: Weigh out 12 ounces of flour and put it in a sifter. Add the baking soda, cream of tartar and salt. Sift all into a bowl. Weigh out 3 ounces of chilled lard and break it into 1- inch chunks. Cut the lard into the flour with 2 knives or a pastry cutter. Fold in the buttermilk in 3 parts. ( Use 1/4 cup more buttermilk if necessary.) Only fold in the buttermilk until it&#39;s just blended. Work lightly. Lightly dust the table with flour. (Use as little flour as possible) Work the dough with fingertips only until it just holds together. Roll out dough 1/2-inch thick. Dip biscuit cutter in flour and punch out 12 biscuits. Don&#39;t use a glass to punch out the biscuits and don&#39;t twist the cutter. You need a clean cut that doesn&#39;t compress the dough so the biscuits will rise easily. You can stack scraps and roll them out in order to cut more biscuits. Put biscuits on ungreased baking sheet. Put the biscuits close together but not touching. If they&#39;re too close, the edges won&#39;t cook and the biscuits will have a cakey texture - too far apart and they&#39;ll brown too soon and be raw in the middle. Bake at 450 degrees. Until tops are golden brown, about 15 to 17 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 44975,&quot;Sweet Potato Chips Dusted with Chili Powder 2 large sweet potatoes 2 teaspoons chili powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for deep-frying Blue Cheese and Chive Dip, recipe follows 1 cup sour cream 1 cup mayonnaise, store-bought 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1 cup crumbled blue cheese 1 1/2 tablespoons honey 1/2 bunch finely chopped chives, plus extra for garnish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Peel sweet potatoes and discard skin.
