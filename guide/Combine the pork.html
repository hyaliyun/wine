Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rendered bacon fat from the skillet. Mix well, handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compacting. Divide the mixture into 6 equal portions and form the portions into patties to fit the size of the rolls. Brush the grill rack with oil. Arrange the patties on the rack, cover, and cook, turning once just until done, about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. During the last few minutes of cooking, top the burgers with equal amounts of smoked Gouda and put the rolls, cut side down, on the outer edges of the rack to toast lightly. To assemble the burgers, spread a generous amount of Alabama White Barbecue Sauce on the cut sides of the rolls. On each roll bottom, put some shredded cabbage, a cheese-topped patty, and 2 slices of bacon. Cover with the roll tops and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 24361,&quot;Roasted Lemon-Herb Chicken One 4 1/2-pound whole chicken, rinsed and patted dry Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 6 sprigs fresh rosemary 1/2 bunch fresh thyme 1 head garlic, cut in 1/2 horizontally 1 lemon, halved Olive oil, for brushing Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Generously salt and pepper the inside cavity of the chicken, and add 4 rosemary sprigs, thyme, garlic, and half of the lemon. Slice the remaining lemon half into thin slices and slide them under the exterior skin of the chicken breasts. Take the remaining 2 rosemary sprigs and slide them down along each side of the breast bone under the skin. Tuck the wings back and under the chicken and tie the legs together for even cooking.<br> Place the chicken, breast side up, on a rack in a roasting pan and brush the top and sides with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.<br> Roast chicken in the oven, basting with drippings at least once, until juices run clear and leg bone easily pulls away from the meat, about 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes.<br> Remove chicken from oven and cover with foil. Allow to rest for juices to redistribute, at least 15 minutes.<br> Carve the chicken and place on serving platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 24362,&quot;Chocolate Souffle 4 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 8 large egg whites 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice Powdered sugar, for dusting Heavy cream, whipped to stiff peaks, optional Creme Anglaise, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to evenly coat the inside of a 1 1/2-quart souffle mold with softened butter. Fill the mold with granulated sugar, then pour out the excess. If you have properly buttered the mold, the sugar will stick to the side and bottom of it. The butter and sugar keeps the souffle from sticking to the side of the mold and allows it to rise evenly. The sugar also gives the souffle a crunchy crust. Place a double boiler 1/2 filled with water over high heat and bring to a boil. Place the chopped chocolate in the top of the double boiler and melt until quite hot. Stir occasionally. Place the eggs, sugar and lemon in another double boiler placed over boiling water. Whisk the egg mixture until lukewarm. Remove the egg mixture from the heat and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer. Whip to stiff peaks. While the egg mixture is whipping, check the chocolate. It should be hot to the touch. Stop the mixer. Use a rubber spatula to fold the hot chocolate into the whipped egg whites. Use a rubber spatula to gently place the souffle mixture in the buttered and sugared mold. Fill to about 1 inch above the rim of the mold. Place the souffle in the center of the oven and allow enough room for it to rise. If the souffle is too close to the top of the oven or under a rack, it will stick when it rises. If the souffle is too close to the bottom of the oven, the bottom of the souffle will burn before the inside is properly baked. Bake until the souffle has risen 1 1/2 times in height and starts to brown on top, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and dust the top with the powdered sugar. Serve immediately with a side of whipped cream or Creme Anglaise. Note: This souffle can also be baked in buttered and sugared individual size molds. Use a pastry bag with a large opening (no tip) to pipe the souffle mixture into the molds about 1 inch above the rim. Bake until risen in height and lightly browned on top, 6 to 8 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24363,&quot;Grilled Bluefish Paillards 2 (3-pound) bluefish 1 teaspoon minced garlic Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil Extra-virgin olive oil Lemon juice Instructions: Fillet bluefish, removing skin, to make 4 10-to 12-ounce fillets. Holding your knife almost parallel to work surface, slice each fillet into 4 broad, thin slices. In a glass baking dish, season bluefish paillards with garlic, salt and pepper. Pour olive oil over and turn several times to coat completely. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Prepare a hot charcoal fire. Oil grill well. Brush garlic from paillards and grill about 1 minute per side, or until just done. Serve 4 paillards per person, drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil a &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24364,&quot;Roasted Venison Loin with Braised Red Cabbage, Sweet German Potato Noodles, and Juniper Berry Sauce 2 tablespoons sunflower oil 1 pound venison loin Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 bay leaf 1 tablespoon chopped rosemary I tablespoon juniper berries 2 tablespoons butter 3 ounces chopped shallots Sunflower oil 1/4 cup Calvados 1/4 cup cognac 1 cup venison demiglace 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons double cream 1 tablespoon crushed juniper berries Creme de cassis, for finishing Banyuls vinegar, for finishing 3 ounces sugar 2 cups red wine 1/4 bottle port wine 7 white peppercorns 3 cloves 1 bay leaf 1/2 (3-inch) stick cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Salt Grated zest and juice from 3 oranges 1 1/2 heads red cabbage, sliced 8 ounces Yukon gold potatoes Rock salt, for roasting Scant 1/2 cup cornstarch 1 egg yolk Butter, for searing Walnuts, roasted and crushed, for garnish 2 ounces fresh cranberries 2 tablespoons sugar Port wine Instructions: To make the venison: Preheat the oven to 220 degrees F. Heat the sunflower oil in a roasting pan. Season the venison with salt and pepper, and sear it until it&#39;s nicely colored and caramelized. Roast until it&#39;s medium rare; an instant read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees. Transfer the meat to a board and let rest so the juices can settle. Spoon off the fat from the pan drippings. Add the bay leaf, rosemary, juniper berries, and butter. Return the meat to the pan and begin spooning the butter and meat juices over the meat to bring to medium. To make the sauce: Cook the shallots in a small amount of oil until they&#39;re softened but haven&#39;t taken on any color. Deglaze the pan with the Calvados and cognac. Add the venison glace and double cream and cook to reduce somewhat. Add juniper berries. Finish with cassis and vinegar to taste. Strain through a fine sieve. To make the cabbage: In a saucepan, heat the sugar on medium heat until it caramelizes. Add red wine and port and stir to dissolve into the caramel. Add the peppercorns, cloves, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, ground cinnamon, and a little salt, orange juice and zest. Put the cabbage in a bowl, pour the marinade on top, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. To make the potato noodles: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the potatoes on a bed of rock salt and roast until soft. Peel the potatoes, break them open, and let the moisture steam out. Pass the potatoes through a potato ricer. Mix in the cornstarch and egg yolk to make a dough. Form the dough into little noodles by rolling it between the palms of your hands. Blanch the noodles in boiling salted water until done. Drain. Sear the potato noodles in a hot skillet with a little butter until they&#39;re golden brown. Sprinkle with walnuts. To make the cranberries: In a large bowl, toss the cranberries with the sugar and a dash of port wine to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Barolo]&quot; 24365,&quot;Halibut and Cioppino with San Francisco Sourdough 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 stick unsalted butter, room temperature 2 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 loaf sourdough bread, cut in slices but still connected at the base 1 pound chorizo (dry aged chorizo), ground in a food processor Extra-virgin olive oil 2 garlic cloves 2 ribs of celery 1 large onion 1 (28oz) can San Marzano tomatoes, drained, hand-crushed with juice reserved 1/4 bunch fresh thyme 1 bay leaf 1/4 cup flour 1 cup dry red wine 2 cups low-sodium chicken stock Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 fresh Dungeness crabs (2 pounds each), cut into 6 pieces 16 littleneck clams, scrubbed 16 large uncooked shrimp, peeled and deveined 4 Halibut fillets (get one whole big piece of halibut, boned and skinned) 1/4 bunch Italian parsley, chopped for garnish 1 lemon, cut in half, to serve with Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine, garlic, butter, parsley, salt and pepper in a bowl and stir to combine. Smear the insides of the slices with garlic butter and toast the whole loaf in the oven for 10 minutes until crispy and fragrant. Reserve left over garlic butter to top the cioppino with. Place the chorizo in a food processor and process until the pieces are small and well ground up. Heat a dutch oven over medium heat and add the ground chorizo to cook until well colored and fat is rendered. Meanwhile add the garlic, celery, onion and drained tomatoes to the food processor and process until you have a smooth consistency of small vegetable pieces. Once the ground chorizo is cooked, pour a two-count of extra-virgin olive oil and add the vegetable puree, thyme and bay leaf and saute for a further 5 to 7 minutes. When the liquid has cooked off a little, dust with the flour and stir well - this forms the base of a roux. Add the red wine, reserved tomato juice, and chicken stock.

Sprinkle evenly all over both sides of the ribs. Wrap each rack of ribs in a separate piece of aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake for 1 1/2 hours.<br> For the blueberry-cherry BBQ sauce: Meanwhile, add the olive oil to a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Add the garlic and shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the coriander and cinnamon and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the cherries, blueberries, chicken broth, cider vinegar, brown sugar, chipotle cl and adobo sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat and simmer, mashing the cherries and blueberries with a potato masher halfway through to release their juices, until the fruit is softened and the mixture is saucelike, about 15 minutes.<br> Let the sauce cool briefly. Then transfer to a blender and blend until smooth (see Cook&#39;s Note). Return to the saucepan and stir in the Dijon. The sauce should nicely coat the back of a spoon. If the sauce is too thin, bring it back to a simmer and continue to reduce until the correct consistency. Reserve 1 cup in a bowl for glazing. Set aside the remainder in the saucepan and cover to keep warm.\u202f\u202f<br> Once the ribs have baked 1 1/2 hours, carefully place each rack on its own baking sheet. Unwrap the ribs from the foil, keeping the foil on the baking sheet as a liner of sorts. Brush the ribs with the reserved 1 cup BBQ sauce and bake until nicely browned and tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, basting once more with sauce halfway through, about 30 minutes.<br> Preheat the broiler. Brush another layer of sauce on each rack of ribs and place one of the racks under the broiler until the sauce is caramelized and lightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes (be sure to watch as all broilers vary!). Repeat with the second rack of ribs.<br> Transfer the reserved sauce from the saucepan to small bowls. Slice into individual ribs and serve with the sauce for dipping.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 24387,&quot;Eight-Layer Dip 8 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces One 16-ounce can refried beans<br> One 4-ounce can diced green chiles<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin, plus more if needed Favorite hot sauce, as needed 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped<br> 3 Roma tomatoes, finely diced 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced 1 small yellow onion, finely diced<br> 4 limes, juiced<br> Kosher salt<br> 3 avocados, halved and pitted 1 1/2 cups grated sharp Cheddar cheese<br> 2 cups sour cream<br> One 3.8-ounce can sliced black olives<br> 8 ounces cotija cheese, crumbled<br> Instructions: For the refried beans, in a medium skillet over medium heat, add the chopped bacon and render until crisp, 7 to 9 minutes.

Cut each lobster into 8 pieces: 2 chest halves (with legs attached), 2 lobster tail halves, 2 large claws and 2 knuckles that connect the claws and body. Save any juice that exudes from the lobster. Refrigerate tails, claws and knuckles. Turn on oven broiler. Brush a large roasting pan with a little oil, and place the four lobster chest halves on it. When oven is hot, place the pan directly under the broiler unit. Cook the lobster chests, turning frequently, for about 10 minutes, or until they are slightly charred. While chests are cooking, place olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Peel and mince 6 garlic cloves, and add to the oil. Saute, stirring, until the garlic turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove chests from the oven and place in the Dutch oven with the garlic and oil. Add the white wine to the roasting pan, and deglaze pan for 30 seconds over a medium-high heat. Pour the wine into the Dutch oven. Remove the tomatoes from the cans, and, one by one, squeeze then over the contents of the Dutch oven, finally dropping the crushed tomatoes in. Reserve tomato juice in cans for possible use later. Add any reserved juices from the lobsters. Add the dried chilies, oregano, and basil; boil ten minutes. Cover the Dutch oven, remove from heat, and let it rest for at least 1 hour. When almost ready to serve, pick the shells out of the tomato sauce and discard them. Remember to push all bits of tomato and lobster into the tomato sauce before discarding the shells. Add crushed red pepper flakes to taste. In a large heavy skillet, place the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil over a high heat. Gently peel the remaining 4 cloves of garlic and cut into broad, thin slices. Add the garlic to the oil, and cook until the garlic just starts to burn (about 5 minutes). Add the 4 lobster claws, 4 knuckles, and 4 tail halves (shell side down), and cook covered for 4 minutes. Turn the lobster pieces over and cook until done, covered, another 3 to 4 minutes. Lower heat to medium, add tomato sauce and stir well. Taste for seasoning and red pepper. If the sauce seems too thick, thin with a little reserved tomato juice. Cook for 1 minute.

In large deep mixing bowl (the dough will double or triple in volume), whisk the egg yolks with 1/2 cup of the remaining milk and the melted butter and margarine. Add the yeast mixture, sugar and salt. Gradually add the flour to the batter by sifting it in. Alternate additions of flour with the remaining 4 1/2 cups milk. Stir with a wooden spoon after each addition. Fold in the beaten egg whites. Cover with a clean towel and put in a warm place. Let rise for 1 hour. The batter should double or even triple in volume. Check the batter from time to time to make sure it isn&#39;t about to erupt. Stir it down once or twice. Bake the waffles in a hot waffle iron. The easiest way to get the batter onto the waffle iron is to transfer the batter into a water pitcher and pour the batter from the pitcher.

Bring the water, milk, and olive oil to a boil in a large pot. Add salt and pepper, and then sprinkle in the cornmeal, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or heavy whisk to avoid lumps. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes, or until the polenta pulls away cleanly from the sides of the pot. Season, to taste, again with salt and pepper. Fold in the butter and Parmesan. Turn the polenta onto the prepared sheet pan and smooth it out. Cover it with plastic wrap, and put it in the refrigerator until it is quite cold, preferably overnight. Using a 4-inch round pastry cutter, cut the cold polenta into 4-inch round cakes. Place the cakes on parchment paper, leaving them covered with plastic wrap until ready to serve. Close to serving time, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the skillet, and let the oil heat. Dust the polenta cakes with flour, add them to the pan in batches, and saute until crispy and golden brown. Top each cake with 1 tablespoon Taleggio, and place under the broiler until cheese is melted and a little browned on top. Serve the polenta cakes with basil oil, smoked tomato sauce, and grilled vegetables, layering like free-form lasagna as desired. Blanch the basil for 3 to 5 seconds in a large pot of boiling salted water. Using a spider or a slotted spoon, immediately plunge the basil into a bowl of ice water to retain its bright green color. Gently squeeze the basil to remove as much excess water as possible.<br> Put the basil in a food processor or blender. Add both oils, and puree until smooth. Put the pesto in an airtight container, and refrigerate it overnight. Then pour off the excess oil that has settled on top. Pour pesto into squirt bottles for easier service. Smoke the onions and fresh tomatoes in a smoker under mesquite chips. Remove from smoker, and set the tomatoes aside. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the smoked onions and garlic to the pan, and saute until tender and very fragrant. Add the oregano and bay leaves and cook for 1 more minute, or until fragrant. Add the smoked tomatoes and the canned tomatoes, and bring mixture to a boil. Add the white wine and basil, reduce the heat, and simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes. Using an immersion blender, puree the sauce until smooth. Then add the sugar, and simmer for another 10 to 12 minutes. Strain sauce through a medium-sized mesh sieve. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Preheat a grill, or heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. In a large bowl, toss all of the sliced vegetables with the olive oil. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Add the garlic and fresh herbs, if using, and toss all together. Grill the vegetables until they are tender yet still slightly crisp. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 24409,&quot;Meaty Ziti with Pesto Dollop 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 2 tablespoons (26 grams) extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 pound (453 grams) sweet Italian sausage, removed from casings<br> 1 medium onion, sliced<br> 1 medium bulb fennel, quartered, cored and thinly sliced (reserve 1/2 cup tender fronds for the pesto) 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 1/2 cup dry red wine<br> One 28-ounce/794-gram can whole tomatoes, crushed by hand<br> One 8-ounce/227-gram can tomato sauce (reserve the can)<br> 1 pound (453 grams) ziti<br> 2 cups (224 grams) low-moisture whole milk shredded mozzarella<br> 1/2 cup (40 grams) grated Parmesan One 8-ounce/226-gram ball fresh mozzarella, halved<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cups loosely packed fresh basil 1 cup loosely packed fresh Italian parsley leaves<br> 1/2 cup fresh fennel fronds<br> 1/4 cup (30 grams) blanched almonds, toasted<br> 1 lemon, zested and juiced<br> 1 clove garlic, crushed 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons (10 grams) grated Parmesan, plus more for finishing<br> 1/3 cup (71 grams) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br> Instructions: For the meaty ziti: Place an oven rack in the middle position.

Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil into the same pan used for bread. Place smoked burger patties into pan and sear each side, 2 minutes per side. (You may also use this same pan to warm up cooled smoked tomatoes, if needed.) Build burgers: Place patties on the buns and top with smoked tomatoes and caramelized onions. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 24430,&quot;Smokey Dogs 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium red onion, finely chopped 1 medium red bell pepper, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 3 tablespoons finely chopped mixed fresh herbs, such as sage and rosemary 3 tablespoons finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes 2 tablespoons brown rice miso 1 tablespoon smoked paprika One 14-ounce can kidney beans, drained and rinsed 1/4 cup buckwheat or all-purpose flour\u202f 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed, optional (otherwise add 1 extra tablespoon flour) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 medium red onions, halved and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar Vegan mayonnaise, for serving 4 hot dog buns Small handful of arugula Ketchup, for serving Yellow mustard, for serving Instructions: For the sausages: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium-large saute pan over medium heat and saute the onions and peppers gently, about 1 minute. Stir in the garlic and cook until tender, about 3 minutes more. Stir in the herbs, tomatoes, miso and paprika and cook until the mixture is golden and caramelized, about 2 minutes. Add the beans and heat through, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat, then mix in the flour and flaxseed if using. Using a potato masher, press the mixture together (you want to retain some of the texture as it adds bite when eating, so be mindful not to over-mash). Using clean hands, bring all the ingredients together firmly and shape into a large ball, then cut into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long sausage shape. I like to measure each sausage piece up against a hot dog bun to shape them to the perfect length to fit. Chill in the fridge to allow the sausage to firm up before frying, at least 30 minutes. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium-large saute pan over medium heat, then fry the sausages, turning occasionally until crispy and browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside. For the caramelized onions: Heat the oil in a medium-large saute pan over medium heat, then add the onions and stir in the vinegar. Cook on a gently sizzling heat, stirring occasionally, until soft and caramelized, 8 to 10 minutes. For assembly: Spread a layer of mayonnaise on the inside of each hot dog bun, then scatter some arugula over the mayonnaise. Add a sausage and spoon some of the caramelized onions over the top. Finish with a squeeze of ketchup and mustard to taste. Now your Smokey Dogs are ready to devour.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 24431,&quot;Marinated Beef Grilled with Chorizo and Jalape?os Served with Grilled Quesadillas 1/3 cup fresh lime juice (about 3 limes), plus more for grilling 1/3 cup fresh orange juice (about 2 oranges) 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for grilling 2 teaspoons dried oregano, preferably Mexican 1 3/4 teaspoons Morton kosher salt (0.42 oz/12 g), plus more for grilling 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 medium white onion (12.6 oz/358 g), thinly sliced 4 garlic cloves, finely grated 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg) mixed cuts of beef, such as flanken-cut short ribs, rib-eye, New York strip, skirt and/or flank (see Cook\u2019s Note) 1 pound (453 g) fresh chorizo links (about 4) or your favorite sausage 8 large chiles jalape?os (8.8 oz/266 g), left whole 8 large scallions 8 tortillas de maz* 1 pound (453 g) quesillo, Chihuahua or Monterey jack cheese, shredded Grilled tortillas de maz or tortillas de harina con mantequilla (wheat-flour flatbread made with butter)* Guacamole* Salsa tatemada (charred tomato, onion and serrano)* Chopped cilantro Frijoles refritos* Lime wedges *recipe available in cookbook Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, orange juice, oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Add the onion and garlic and toss with your hands to combine. Add the beef and toss to coat. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. Prepare a gas grill for two-zone heat: Set one burner at medium-high and one or two burners at high. (Alternatively, prepare a charcoal grill for high heat.) Remove the steaks from the marinade, shaking off any excess and brushing off and reserving any onions that are stuck to the meat. Drain the onions in a fine-mesh sieve set over the sink \u2014 discard the marinade and save the onions. Grill the beef over high heat, turning once, for 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. If the onions have fallen apart, they will be easier to saut rather than grill, unless you have a vegetable grill basket\u2014and if you do, I recommend using it (even if the onions didn\u2019t fall apart, a grill basket will help prevent them from slipping through the grill grates). Grill or saut the onions until they are charred on all sides, for 4 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Grill the chorizo, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides and cooked through, for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Grill the whole jalape?os and scallions over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until charred and tender, for 4 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with a squeeze of lime juice, a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt. To make the quesadillas, toast one side of the tortillas over the medium-high side of the grill until lightly charred, for about 1 minute. Flip and place a small mound of cheese on the charred side, then fold in half like a taco and continue to grill until the cheese begins to melt and the tortilla is lightly charred, for about 1 minute. Flip again to char the other side. Serve the quesadillas along with grilled tortillas and you can make tacos or stuff the quesadillas with carne asada, chorizo, chiles jalape?os, scallions, guacamole, salsa tatemada and cilantro. Serve with the refried beans and lime wedges for squeezing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 24432,&quot;Country-Style Meat Loaf 1/2 cup onions (small diced) 1/2 cup celery (small diced) 1/2 cup red bell peppers (small diced) 1 pound ground pork 2 pounds ground sirloin 3/4 cup tomato ketchup 3 eggs (whole) 3/4 cup half and half 1-1/4 cups oatmeal 20 slices smoked bacon 1 1/2 teaspoons salt (kosher, coarse) 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seed 1/2 teaspoon celery seed 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin seed Instructions: Lightly steam onions, celery, and bell peppers and let cool. Place the cooled vegetables into a mixing bowl and add the pork, sirloin, ketchup, eggs, half and half and mix well. Mix in the oatmeal and spice mix.

Cut each lobster into 8 pieces: two chest halves (with legs attached), two lobster tail halves, two large claws and two knuckles that connect the claws and body. Save any juice that exude from the lobster. Refrigerate tails, claws and knuckles. Turn on oven broiler. Brush a large roasting pan with a little oil, and place the four lobster chest halves on it. When oven is hot, place the pan directly under the broiler unit. Cook the lobster chests, turning frequently, for about 10 minutes, or until they are slightly charred. While chests are cooking, place a tablespoon of olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Peel and mince 6 garlic cloves, and add to the oil. Saute, stirring, until the garlic turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove chests from the oven and place in the Dutch oven with the garlic and oil. Add the white wine to the roasting pan, and deglaze pan for 30 seconds over a medium-high heat. Pour the wine into the Dutch oven. Remove the tomatoes from the cans, and, one by one, squeeze then over the contents of the Dutch oven, finally dropping the crushed tomatoes in. Reserve tomato juice in cans for possible use later. Add any reserved juices from the lobsters. Add the dried chillies, oregano, and basil. Boil ten minutes. Cover the Dutch oven, remove from heat, and let it rest for at least one hour. When almost ready to serve, pick the shells out of the tomato sauce and discard them. Remember to push all bits of tomato and lobster into the tomato sauce before discarding the shells. Add crushed red pepper flakes to taste. In a large heavy skillet, place the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil over a high heat. Gently peel the remaining 4 cloves of garlic and cut into broad, thin slices. Add the garlic to the oil, and cook until the garlic just starts to burn (about 5 minutes). Add the 4 lobster claws, 4 knuckles, and 4 tail halves (shell side down), and cook covered for 4 minutes. Turn the lobster pieces over and cook until done, covered, another 3 to 4 minutes. Lower heat to medium, add tomato sauce and stir well. Taste for seasoning and red pepper. If the sauce seems too thick, thin with a little reserved tomato juice. Cook for one minute.

Make sure to whisk the starch slurry frequently to keep it combined. Stir in 1/4 of the basil. Heat a small wok or 6-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until it begins to smoke and add about 1 teaspoon of the peanut oil. Place 1 mu shu pancake into the wok and cook until hot and beginning to brown, about 30 seconds, and then flip and toast the other side. Transfer the pancake to a plate. Pour the egg mixture into the bottom of the wok and swirl to coat the base of the pan. Cook, releasing the edges of the omelet with a spatula, until the bottom is set and beginning to brown and the egg on the surface is just set, 30 to 45 seconds. Do not overcook. Slide the omelet directly onto the toasted warm pancake and drizzle some of the sauce over the top. Repeat with the remaining egg mixture and pancakes to make 3 more omelets. Cut each omelet into quarters and serve face-up, or fold in half and serve with more sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 24453,&quot;Beef Stew Scented with Horseradish 2 1/2 pounds stew beef, cubed 2 inches Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Flour, for dredging 4 to5 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil 2 onions, chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 bay leaf 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 bottle warm lager beer 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 3 to 4 cups beef stock 3 tablespoons prepared horseradish 2 pounds baby Yukon gold potatoes 2 tablespoons butter A handful parsley, chopped 1 bundle watercress or Upland cress, for garnish Pumpernickel or sourdough bread, for serving Instructions: Pat the meat dry, sprinkle with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and dredge in flour.

Add the cabbage and cook, stirring, until tender. Add the sugar and salt and stir to dissolve. Add the raisins and cook, stirring, to reduce the juices and let them soak into the raisins, about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the walnuts and spread on a baking sheet to cool. Make the Strudel: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange a parchment-lined baking sheet on the counter, so it&#39;s horizontal to your body. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on the pan. Using a pastry brush, spatter the phyllo with some of the melted butter; then brush to cover with the butter. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the sugar and 1/3 of the chopped walnuts. Repeat with the 2 remaining sheets of phyllo. Reserve the remaining melted butter and sugar. Spoon the cooled cabbage filling 2 inches in from the bottom edge of the phyllo, working from left to right, leaving 2 inches bare at the left and right. Roll up the pastry, lifting the parchment paper, to encase the filling, forming a log. Move the log to the center of the sheet pan and tuck the ends under to keep the filling from oozing out. Brush the surface with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool 10 to 15 minutes on the pan.

Add the potatoes, smashed garlic and 2 of the thyme sprigs into a pot of cold water. Season the water generously with kosher salt. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and lightly smash (I used a bench scraper). Transfer the potatoes into a bowl and toss with the red pepper flakes, a drizzle of olive oil and kosher salt to taste. Place onto a sheet tray in a single layer and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until crispy. Garnish with the grated Parmesan and chives. Toss the sliced tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil and kosher salt to taste in a large bowl. Lay the sliced tomatoes onto one half of a sheet tray lined with a rack. Lay 8 bacon strips onto the other half of the sheet tray. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then remove the tomatoes and continue cooking the bacon for 10 minutes more. Slice the remaining 4 bacon strips into lardons and place into a saute pan. Turn on the heat to medium-low and cook until the bacon is crispy and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Strain the bacon fat through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and set aside. Fill a large, high-sided pan with water about halfway up. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer until there are almost no bubbles. Add 1/4 cup of the vinegar to the water. Crack the 4 eggs into the water and poach the eggs for about 3 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and gently place the eggs into a bowl of room temperature water to hold until ready to serve. Preheat a large saute pan with a drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the pullman rounds and toast on both sides until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside. Combine the clarified butter and the reserved bacon fat and set aside. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the shallots, bay leaf, black peppercorns, 2 tablespoons water, the remaining 2 tablespoons of vinegar and the remaining 2 thyme sprigs into a small saute pan and turn on the heat to medium. Cook for 5 minutes or until the liquid has mostly reduced. Turn off the heat, then add 3 to 4 ice cubes and swirl the pan to fully melt and cool down the mixture. Strain the mixture into a large, heat-resistant bowl. Add the egg yolks and lemon juice into the bowl and whisk until the yolks are pale yellow and foamy. Set the bowl over the pot of boiling water to create a double boiler, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Reduce the heat to low. Whisk the eggs vigorously until frothy and fluffy and it starts to thicken slightly. Very slowly, a drop at a time, add the clarified butter and bacon fat mixture while continuing to whisk. Continue to add gradually until the sauce is thickened but still flows\u2014it should coat the back of a spoon. If the bowl gets too hot or the eggs look like they\u2019re in danger of scrambling, immediately pull off the bowl from the heat and add an ice cube to cool it down, then return to the heat. Season to taste with kosher salt. If the sauce gets too thick, you can add a little water to thin it out. To assemble, lay down a toasted piece of bread and top with two bacon slices, some iceberg lettuce, roasted tomato, a poached egg and a spoonful of the bacon fat hollandaise. Serve alongside the roasted potato hash. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 24461,&quot;Crostini with Cannellini, Chard, and Bread Crumbs 1 loaf Italian or French bread (about 1 pound) Good quality olive oil 2 cloves garlic, finely minced Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds Swiss chard, finely chopped 2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans 1 large lemon 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme Instructions: Slice the bread 1/2-inch thick; set aside 1/4 of the slices. Brush the remaining slices on both sides with olive oil and toast until golden brown on both sides in a broiler or on a grill. Set aside. (If bread slices are large, you may want to cut in half crosswise for easier serving.) Tear the remaining bread slices into small pieces and whirl in a blender or food processor until you have fine bread crumbs. Pour 3 tablespoons olive oil into a wide frying pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add half of the minced garlic and stir for a few seconds until the garlic is fragrant. Add the bread crumbs to the pan with salt, to taste, and cook, stirring often, until toasted and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Set bread crumbs aside. Wipe out the pan and in it, heat 2 more tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Add the remaining garlic. Cook, stirring for a few seconds, until the garlic is fragrant, then add the Swiss chard to the pan. Season the chard with salt to taste, stir a few seconds until wilted, then reduce heat, cover pan, and sweat chard until tender, about 10 minutes. If after cooking chard is very moist, squeeze out and discard excess water. Meanwhile, drain the canned beans in a sieve set over a bowl. Measure out and reserve 1/2 cup of the bean liquid. Rinse the beans under cold water, then put in the blender or food processor with the zest and juice of the lemon, thyme, the reserved bean liquid, 1/4 cup olive oil, and salt to taste. Whirl until pureed, taste, and add more salt or lemon juice, if desired. If made ahead, cover and refrigerate the bean puree and Swiss chard in separate containers; cover and store toasted bread slices and bread crumbs at room temperature. To serve, spread the bean puree thickly on bread slices, top with a spoonful of greens, then sprinkle with bread crumbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 24462,&quot;Pickled Herring 3 to 4 whole salted herrings 2 cups milk 1 1/2 cups water 1 cup white sugar 1 cup white vinegar 2 teaspoons ground allspice 2 teaspoons yellow mustard seeds 1 teaspoon caraway seeds 2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns 2 teaspoons whole white peppercorns 1 small red onion, sliced in rings 2 carrots, cut in thin slices 2 handfuls fresh dill 2 bay leaves 2-inch piece fresh horseradish, cut in big slices Instructions: Soak the herring in the milk for at least 12 hours or up to 24 to draw out a lot of the excess salt.

Steam cleaned pieces of squash for 10 to 15 minutes until tender. Remove skin and mash smooth. Place stock in a saucepan and heat until simmering. In a large heavy saucepan over medium heat, fry bacon piece until crisp. Remove bacon, leaving grease in the pan. Crumble bacon for use as a garnish and set aside. Add oil and shallots and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook for 5 minutes over moderately high heat. Stir slowly but constantly. This will \toast\ the rice and start to turn it slightly golden and feel loose and dry. You should start to hear the rice \click.\ Add the wine all at once to the rice and cook over fairly high heat to boil it down. When the rice is almost dry, stir in 1 cup of stock and mashed squash. Simmer until the sock is absorbed. Continue adding stock 1 cup at a time and stirring until rice becomes creamy while the grains remain separate and firm, but not hard in the center of the grain. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes. Add the nutmeg, salt, pepper and rosemary and stir. Stir in the butter and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Place in individual serving bowls and sprinkle with remaining cheese, crumbled bacon and a sprig of rosemary. Enjoy! Yield: 4 to 6 main course servings Hints for success: The pot must be heavy on the bottom to keep the temperature even during the cooking process. Arborio is a short grained rice. It is very starchy, which is necessary to produce the desired result of a creamy risotto. Look for a fat opaque center in the rice, known as \LaPerla,\ this indicates a good starch content. Wine is the first liquid to be added to the rice. The first liquid will be absorbed totally and the acid in the wine balances the starch and adds flavor. Toasting the rice seals in the flavor. There should be about 3 times the amount of stock as rice. Make sure the stock is very hot. The stock is added slowly to the rice and releases the starch gradually, creating a creamy texture. Constant stirring is needed to produce the best results &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 24470,&quot;Chicken and Spinach Mac and Cheese Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 cup elbow macaroni<br> 3 cups pulled rotisserie chicken, skin reserved<br> 4 tablespoons butter<br> 4 cups fresh baby spinach<br> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 cups milk<br> 1 1/4 cups freshly grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese<br> 1/4 cup chicken stock<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice (from about 1/2 lemon)<br> 1 teaspoon yellow mustard<br> 4 dashes hot sauce<br> Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.

Add the cheese, whisking to combine, and cook until it is melted and the sauce is smooth. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the chicken stock, lemon juice, yellow mustard and hot sauce. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. Add the drained pasta, wilted spinach and pulled chicken to the sauce. Stir to combine. Crumble the crispy chicken skin on top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 24471,&quot;Creamed Spinach Tartlets 30 ounces baby spinach 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1/2 cup) 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 cup heavy cream<br> Kosher salt 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/4 cup feta 1/2 teaspoon white pepper<br> 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg<br> 1/2 package (1 sleeve) frozen phyllo dough, thawed 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted<br> Instructions: For the filling: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl one-third full with ice. Add cold water to cover the ice. Set a colander into the bowl. In batches, cook the spinach in the boiling water just until bright green, about 1 minute. With tongs, immediately plunge the spinach into the colander to stop cooking and set the color. When all of the spinach is cooked and cooled, lift the colander from the water and squeeze out the excess water from the spinach. Chop the spinach and set aside. Melt the butter in a deep skillet or broad saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic; cook an additional minute, until toasted and fragrant. Add the cream, the blanched spinach and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and cook until the cream has cooked down and thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan, feta, white pepper, nutmeg and more salt to taste. Stir to blend, then remove from the heat. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Unroll the phyllo and cover it with a damp kitchen towel; keep the pastry covered while working to keep in the moisture. Cut the phyllo in half crosswise. Using a pastry brush, coat six 4 1/2-inch tart pans with melted butter. Gently lay a \square\ of phyllo in one of the pans, letting it fall loosely into place. Brush with butter, covering the pastry sheet completely. Repeat with five additional sheets. Using kitchen shears, trim the excess dough, leaving a good 1 inch of overhang. Shape the phyllo around the perimeter of the tart pan to create an attractive, rustic edge. Repeat for the remaining five pastry tarts. Fill each tart with the creamed spinach mixture. Place the filled tart pans on a baking sheet. Bake on the center oven rack until the crust is golden brown, 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 24472,&quot;Bchamel 2 cups whole milk 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, optional Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the milk in a glass measuring cup and microwave until just warm, about 1 minute. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk until combined. Continue to whisk until the mixture bubbles a bit, but does not brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually pour in the warm milk while whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, whisking often and occasionally running a rubber spatula around the edges of the saucepan to prevent burning. When the sauce is boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook until thickened to a nice coating consistency, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan, if using, and stir until the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24473,&quot;Nutella Banana Brioche Bread Pudding Cooking spray or butter, for the pan 1 (13-ounce) container Nutella 12 (3/4-inch) thick slices brioche or egg bread 8 large eggs 2 cups cream 2 cups whole milk 2 cups sugar 1/4 cup hazelnut liqueur (recommended: Frangelico) or amaretto 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 3 ripe bananas Instructions: Spray or butter a 13 by 9 by 2-inch baking dish. Spread the Nutella on all your bread slices, then put 2 slices together to make 6 sandwiches. Cut each sandwich into 8 pieces and toss them into a large bowl. Crack your eggs in another large bowl and whisk in the cream, milk, sugar, hazelnut liqueur, vanilla and almond extracts. Pour this mixture over the sandwich cubes. Now, mash your bananas and stir that into the bread cube mixture. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Let stand at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours, occasionally pressing the bread into the custard mixture. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake until the pudding is set in the center, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Vin Santo]&quot; 24474,&quot;Rose Jam Doughnuts with Vanilla Glaze and Pistachios 2 1/4 teaspoons (one 1/4-ounce packet) active dry yeast 1/2 cup warm milk (105 degrees to 110 degrees)<br> 1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 110 degrees) 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Grated zest of 1/2 orange 1 large egg plus 2 egg yolks, lightly beaten together 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature Vegetable oil, for the bowl and for frying 1 cup raspberry jam 1 tablespoon pure rose water 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more if needed 2 tablespoons whole milk, plus more if needed 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch of kosher salt<br> Crushed roasted pistachios and crushed dried rose petals, for topping Instructions: Make the dough: In a medium bowl, combine the yeast, milk, water and 1 teaspoon granulated sugar and give it a little stir with a wooden spoon. Let it sit about 5 minutes, until it becomes foamy on top. In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix the flour, salt, cardamom, cinnamon, orange zest and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Add the beaten egg and yolks, vanilla and yeast mixture and mix to form a very stiff dough. (It may be hard to incorporate at first, but keep mixing.) With the mixer on, gradually add the butter, piece by piece. This, too, will seem like it isn\u2019t going to incorporate, but keep on mixing for about 8 to 10 more minutes, scraping down the dough hook occasionally, until your dough is smooth and slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours. (Or refrigerate the dough for up to 2 days; bring to room temperature before rolling out.) Cut out the doughnuts: Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin, roll it out until about 1/2 inch thick. Cut out rounds of dough using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Press the scraps of dough together and let sit 10 minutes, then reroll the scraps and cut out more rounds. (At this point, you can refrigerate the rounds up to 3 hours before frying.) Transfer the rounds to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rise for another hour, or until doubled in size. Fry the doughnuts: In a large cast-iron pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer, heat 3 to 4 inches of vegetable oil to 350?. Fry the doughnuts in batches of 3 or 4 for 1 1/2 minutes on each side until deep golden brown. Using tongs, remove the doughnuts from the hot oil and transfer to a rack set on a baking sheet to drain and cool. Make the filling: In a small bowl, combine the jam and rose water. Taste and adjust the proportions as desired. Spoon the jam into a squeeze bottle or piping bag fitted with a 1/4-inch tip. Make the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, vanilla and salt until smooth. It should be the consistency of a slightly thick glue \u2014 if it\u2019s too thick, add a little more milk; if it\u2019s too thin, add a little more confectioners\u2019 sugar. Dip the cooled doughnuts in the glaze and let any excess drip off. If the glaze has a hard time sticking to the doughnuts, that means it\u2019s too thick and that you should add more milk. Fill the doughnuts: Stick the squeeze bottle or pastry bag into the center of a doughnut, going as far down as you can without puncturing the other side. Wiggle it around, then fill up the hole with jam, leaving a circle of jam on top of the glaze. Sprinkle with pistachios and rose petals. Serve any remaining jam on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24475,&quot;Bacon and Chive Green Bean Coins 4 strips center-cut bacon, finely chopped 1 pound green and/or wax beans, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch-thick small coins Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons snipped chives 1 lemon Instructions: Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, until browned and the fat has rendered, about 4 minutes. Add the green beans and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the beans are just bright green.

Lower to a simmer and reduce the sauce by half. Chill. For the pork belly: Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a medium pot. Carefully lower the Pork Belly into the oil using a fry basket. (Make sure there is no excess moisture on the pork. This can cause splattering.) Fry the pork until the skin and flesh are very crispy and have darkened significantly. Place on a plate lined with paper towels and quickly build the salad. In a small bowl, toss together the green papaya, carrot, tomato, onion, half of each of the herbs and the Nam Pla. Mix with tongs to incorporate. Place the mixed green papaya salad on a decorative plate. Form a bed for the pork. Place the pork, slightly fanned out, on the green papaya salad. Drizzle the pork generously with 1 ounce cl gastrique (save the remainder for another use). Sprinkle the dish with diced macadamia nuts and the remaining herbs. Mix together the honey, lime juice, fish sauce, vinegar, garlic and sambal in a bowl. Best made a couple days in advance to allow flavors to marry. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Lightly spray the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle over the ginger, garlic and scallion. Rinse the pork belly under running cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Place the pork over the aromatics in the pan, skin-side up. Mix the mirin, sake, teriyaki and sambal in a small bowl. Pour the sauce over the top of the pork belly. Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake until fork-tender, about 3 hours. Remove the pork and place another similar dish on top as a weight. Use cans or other heavy items to create additional weight. Press the pork, refrigerated, overnight. This will make the pork even in thickness and allow for a better fry. Slice the following day, once the pork has chilled and set completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24478,&quot;Penne with Grilled Okra and Green Beans 8 ounces okra, trimmed and halved lengthwise 8 ounces green beans, trimmed 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs Finely grated zest of 1 lemon 12 ounces penne rigate 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup fresh basil Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high.

Combine the granulated sugar and butter in a small deep saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently. (Don&#39;t worry if the mixture looks curdled and then separated-it will come together.) Cook, stirring, until it looks like dark peanut butter, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the heavy cream to a simmer over medium heat in a small saucepan. When the butter mixture is the right color, remove from the heat and slowly and very carefully whisk in the hot cream-it will bubble up and steam, so be careful. Put the pot back over medium heat, bring the mixture back to a simmer and cook about 1 minute. Pour into the prepared measuring cup and cool to room temperature. (The caramel can be made the night before and kept, covered, at room temperature. You can warm it very briefly in a microwave so that it is pourable, but be careful not to overheat. It should not be too loose.) For the brownie: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut a piece of foil 9 by 20-inches. Butter the corners and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Line the pan with the foil so that the excess hangs over at each of the short sides of the pan. Put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl and set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, being careful that the bowl does not touch the water. Stir occasionally with a rubber spatula until smooth. Whisk the eggs, sugars and vanilla in a large bowl. Stir the chocolate into the egg mixture using a rubber spatula, and then stir in the flour until just combined. Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the peanuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Drizzle the caramel over the top, using a butter knife to swirl it into the batter. Coarsely chop the remaining 1/2 cup peanuts and scatter over the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Be sure to insert the toothpick in a spot that does not have too much caramel. Place on a cooling rack and, while still slightly warm, run a butter knife between the brownie and the long sides of the pan. Cool completely, about 1 hour. When the brownie has cooled completely, place a lightweight cutting board or a baking rack over the top of the pan. Flip and set on the counter. Gently pull the pan from the foil and the foil from the pan to remove. Gently peel the foil off the brownie. Place another lightweight cutting board on top, and flip the brownie right-side-up.

Butter the inside of an 8-inch souffle dish. Place in a roasting pan that fits the dish. Add the cream cheese, pumpkin puree and butter to a medium bowl. Using a rubber spatula, mix together until smooth and well combined. Switch to a whisk and add the egg yolks one at a time, making sure they are fully incorporated before adding the next yolk. Add the cake flour, vanilla and cinnamon and mix well until smooth. Slowly add the milk until fully incorporated. Set aside. Beat the egg whites in a large bowl using an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly sprinkle in the sugar until glossy and stiff peaks form. Fold one-third of the egg white into the cream cheese mixture using the whisk until incorporated. Repeat with another third. Now add the cream cheese mixture into the bowl with the remaining egg white and, using a spatula, gently fold in the remaining egg white until no streaks remain. Pour the mixture into the prepared dish. Drizzle with the melted chocolate and run a skewer through the top to make a design. Fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the souffle dish and place in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees F and continue to bake until the souffle is just set but still a little jiggly in the center, about 50 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature in the water bath. Remove from the water and refrigerate to cool completely, at least 2 hours.

Lay the sliced onions in the bottom of a roasting pan. Place the brisket on top of the onions and season with salt and pepper. Top with the garlic cloves and ale. Cover tightly with foil and roast until tender, 5 to 6 hours. Loosen the cover and let cool to room temperature. Heat the vegetable oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the jalapeno and diced onion and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the pureed chipotle peppers and cook until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Remove any excess fat from the cooled brisket with a spatula. Slice the brisket across the grain into 1 1/2-inch-thick pieces and gently pull the meat apart by hand. Place the meat in a large bowl and season with the granulated garlic, paprika, 1 teaspoon pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. Add the cooked onion and jalapeno mixture and toss gently to combine. For the biscuits: Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Cut in the 2 sticks of cold butter until the mixture is crumbly, being careful not to overmix. Add the Cheddar. Add the buttermilk a little at a time, just until the mixture is combined and moist. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently roll or press the dough into a 1-inch-thick rectangle. Cut the dough into 4-by-4-inch squares or use a large biscuit cutter, place on the baking sheet and brush with the melted butter. Bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Brush with additional melted butter while the biscuits are still warm. Set aside. For the chipotle sauce: Combine the guacamole, mayonnaise, chipotle peppers and lemon juice in a medium bowl and mix well. Season with salt, cover and refrigerate. To serve: Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Loosely wrap the biscuits in foil and place in the oven until warm. For each sandwich, place 6 to 8 ounces of the brisket mixture in a small saute pan. Heat until very warm, stirring so the brisket does not brown. Turn off the heat and top with 1 slice of Cheddar and some caramelized onions. Cover the pan until the cheese melts. Cut the warm biscuit in half lengthwise and fill with the brisket mixture. Top with the desired amount of chipotle sauce and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 24485,&quot;Soft Chocolate Caramels 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1 cup heavy cream, at room temperature 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: In a heavy-bottomed sauce pan, stir the sugar and corn syrup together until the sugar is completely moistened. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat and cook, without stirring, until it turns a very light caramel color, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and very slowly pour the cream into the hot sugar (be careful-it will bubble up) and stir to combine. Return the mixture to medium-low heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until a candy thermometer inserted in the pot reads 238 degrees F, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the chocolate and butter until smooth. Pour the mixture into a greased 8-by-8 inch square baking dish. Allow to cool completely (at least 2 hours) before cutting into 1-inch squares. Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.

Mix on low until combined. Add 4 cups flour on low speed, 1 cup at a time, and mix to form a smooth, wet dough. Switch to the dough hook and knead on medium-high, adding up to 1/2 cup more flour to make a slightly sticky dough that forms a ball around the hook, 4 to 5 minutes. Form the dough into a ball, place in a large bowl and lightly coat in olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. For the filling: Meanwhile, stir together the chocolate, butter, pecans, sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl to make a chunky paste.<br> Butter a 10-inch round cake pan and set aside. When the dough has risen, punch it down and roll with a lightly floured rolling pin on a well-floured work surface into a 24-by-16-inch rectangle (about 1/4-inch thick). Use a 3 1/2-inch round cutter to cut out as many circles as you can from the dough. Fill each circle to the edge with about 1 tablespoon filling and fold in half, then in half again, so it looks like a quarter of a circle. Pinch the tip of the dough so that the rounded edge opens slightly. Arrange pieces, pinched-side down, in a circle around the edge of the pan with some space between the pieces and the chocolate filling showing at the top. Arrange 2 more circles in the pan, ending with one piece in the center. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until almost doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Stop every couple of turns to cut the ribbons into 2 to3-inch pieces. Whisk together the flour, beer, lemon zest and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Heat about 2 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Attach the deep fat fry thermometer and bring the oil to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and keep it nearby. Working one small handful at a time, add the zucchini curls to the beer batter and use tongs to toss and coat (like tossing spaghetti in sauce!). Pick up the battered curls a few at a time with the tongs and let as much excess batter drip off as possible. Being careful of the hot oil, drop the battered zucchini into the hot oil. Use a second pair of tongs or a slotted spoon to turn and help move the zucchini around, separating the pieces as best you can while they fry. Fry until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes total. Transfer to the paper-towel lined baking sheet. Continue to fry in small batches. Serve hot (you can reheat in a 325 degrees F oven if needed). &quot;,&quot;[Lager, Helles, Hefeweizen, Gueuze]</p><p>Given the following recipe, provide the wine types that would pair well with the recipe.

All you have to do is set yourself up for success! First, line a baking sheet with paper towels or parchment paper. Set a cooling rack over it. This will be where you land your fried &#39;maters. Then, using your hands, rip the burrata into bite-size pieces (1 per slice of tomatillo), and line them up on a plate. Season them with a little salt and pepper. Slice your lime into wedges so that it&#39;s easy to squeeze over the top of the whole thing at the end; keep your basil handy too. Set them aside. To make the cumin oil: In a very small skillet (cast-iron if you have it), warm the olive oil until it&#39;s nearly smoking. Add the cumin seeds. (The seeds should sizzle once they hit that oil! If not, your oil is not hot enough.) Cook, swirling the pan every now and then, until the cumin seeds darken in colour (don&#39;t let them burn!). As soon as they&#39;ve darkened, pour the oil into a small bowl, and let it cool. Then, grab a large skillet (again cast-iron is awesome) and set it over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil. Keep an eye on it while you set up your dredging station (if it starts to smoke, take it off the heat to cool off). Pour the buttermilk into a flat-bottomed dish, and season with a little salt and pepper. In another similarly shaped bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, garam masala, and cayenne pepper. Season it also with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. To check that the oil is hot, drop a pinch of the flour-cornmeal mixture into the pan. If it sizzles enthusiastically at you, it&#39;s time to go! Dip both sides of a tomatillo slice in the buttermilk. Then, using your other hand (to avoid the \claw), dredge it in the cornmeal mixture. Shake off excess cornmeal, and drop it into the oil. Repeat with as many slices as you can fit into the pan without overcrowding. By the time you&#39;ve placed the last slice in the pan, it will probably be time to flip the first one. It should be lightly golden, but not soft. Cook another minute or so, and then remove to the parchment-lined baking sheet. To assemble: Place the tomatillos on a platter. Top each one with a piece of burrata. Drizzle those puppies with a little cumin-infused oil. Sprinkle some basil over the top and finish with a squeeze of lime juice. Serve your fancy-pants fried green beauties immediately! Combine the cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, green cardamom pods, and black cardamom pods into a spice/coffee grinder and grind until fine. Store the masala in an airtight container away from direct sunlight.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 24514,&quot;&#39;Shepherd&#39;s Pie&#39; with Asian Braised Duck 4 duck legs 1/2 tablespoon rinsed and minced fermented black beans 8 cloves garlic, chopped 1/2 tablespoon minced ginger 1 large onion, 1/4-inch dice 1 carrot, peeled and 1/4-inch dice 1 large rib celery, 1/4-inch dice 1 cup sliced shiitakes 1/2 cup shaoxing wine 1/4 cup naturally brewed soy sauce 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 tablespoon minced thyme Water, to cover duck 4 cups leftover mashed potatoes (3 large baking potatoes, cooked and mashed with 2 ounces butter, salt and pepper) Canola oil for cooking Salt and black pepper, to taste Instructions: Season the duck legs with salt and pepper. Heat a small stock pot to high. Sear the duck legs (no added oil) on both sides until brown. Remove legs and leave the rendered fat. Add the black beans, garlic and ginger and saute until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the onions and caramelize, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, shiitakes and season. Deglaze with shaoxing and reduce by 20 percent. Add the soy, sugar, thyme and duck legs and cover with water. Check for seasoning. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 1/2 hours until soft. Strain duck legs and liquid and set aside. Bring liquid back to a boil and reduce by 50 percent. Skim if necessary. When legs are cool enough to touch, remove the meat and fat. Roughly chop up this mixture and mix in the strained vegetables/aromatics. In 4 individual oval flameproof baking dishes, place duck mixture in each. Ladle a little of the reduced liquid on top and top that with the mashers. All this can be done in advance. Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 30 minutes until bubbling.

Install the dough hook attachment and mix on low until the dough comes together, forming a ball and pulling away from the sides of the bowl. Increase the mixer speed to medium and knead for 5 minutes. Lightly flour the countertops, then round the dough into a smooth ball by folding the edges of the round in toward the center several times and rolling between your hands on the counter. Lightly oil a bowl and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours. \Punch down\ the dough by turning it out onto a clean countertop and shaping it into a rough rectangle, using your knuckles to work out as many of the large gas bubbles as possible. Then tightly roll the dough into a log 12 to 15 inches long. Cut this into thirds. Shape each third into a disk, then shape the disks into smooth balls. You may want to moisten the counter with water to up the surface tension a bit so that the ball tightens up instead of sliding across the counter. Cover each ball with a clean kitchen towel and set aside for 30 minutes at room temperature. At this point, you can also transfer the dough to airtight plastic containers and refrigerate for up to 8 hours. Just make sure you bring the balls to room temperature 30 minutes before use. Pizza time: Set a pizza stone on the lower rack of the oven (or the floor, if using a gas oven) and crank the heat as high as it will go, hopefully 550 degrees F. Give the oven and the stone a good 30 minutes to heat up. For the toppings: Press a ball of dough into a 12-inch round. (Save the remaining dough balls for another use.) Smear with the jelly, then top with the fontina and bacon. Transfer to the pizza stone and bake until golden brown and melty, about 10 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 24519,&quot;Fresh Cranberry Relish 2 pounds fresh cranberries 1 cup sugar<br> 1/4 cup orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier Zest and juice of 1 orange Instructions: Place the cranberries, sugar, orange liqueur, and orange zest and juice in the bowl of a food processor.

Cut the pork butt in a spiral fashion so that the pork butt will be about 1-inch thick and flattens into a sheet. Pound out the sheet of meat with a mallet to an even thickness. Combine the salt, oregano and pepper in a small bowl and season both sides of the pork butt. Remove the sausage from the casing and spread over the pork butt in an even layer. Roll up the pork butt and sausage into a cylinder and truss with butcher&#39;s twine. Heat a large skillet over high heat until smoking hot. Add the grapeseed oil and then carefully place the porchetta roll in the pan fat-side down. Sear the porchetta on all sides until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the porchetta from the skillet and place in a braising pan. Add the onion, carrot and celery to the skillet and saute until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and saute for another 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Pour the braising liquid over the porchetta, cover with a layer of parchment paper and then a layer of aluminum foil and seal tightly. Bake in the oven, basting every 30 minutes with the braising liquid, until the porchetta reaches an internal temperature of 210 degrees F measured with an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the porchetta from the oven and allow it to cool in the braising liquid. For the ravioli: Shred the porchetta in a large bowl. Combine the meat with the ricotta and Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs in a small bowl and hold for sealing the ravioli. For making the ravioli with a ravioli mold: Cut the Pasta Dough sheets to the size of the molds. Lay one sheet over the mold. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling per indent, depending on size of the molds. Brush the dough not covered by the filling with the egg wash and then lay another piece of pasta over the top. Roll a rolling pin over the top of the mold to seal and cut the ravioli. You should have about 48 ravioli total. For making the ravioli by hand without a ravioli mold: Cut the Pasta Dough sheets into 3-inch squares. Dollop 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling just off the center of each square toward one of the corners, brush the perimeter of the dough with the egg wash, fold the sheet over the filling, corner to corner, and seal by pressing around the filling with your fingers. You should have about 48 ravioli total. For serving: Bring the Pasta Sauce to a simmer in a saucepan. Whisk in the butter. Bring 1 gallon water and 2 tablespoons kosher salt to a rapid boil in a large pot. Drop the ravioli in the water and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the ravioli from the water using a skimmer, transfer to the pan with the sauce and toss to coat. Plate 8 ravioli per serving with some sauce in pasta bowls. Garnish with some of the Parmesan cheese and chopped basil. Combine the flour and salt in a bowl and mix. Form a well in the center of the flour mixture. Place the eggs, extra-virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon water in the well. Mix the egg mixture with a fork and slowly incorporate the flour until it becomes a ball of dough. The dough should be tacky, but not wet. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and allow it to rest at room temperature for 1 hour. Roll out the dough into thin sheets using a pasta machine. Cut the pasta into desired shapes or cut into sheets for ravioli. Yield: 1 1/2 pounds. Combine the whole peeled tomatoes, extra-virgin olive oil, basil, carrot, oregano, onion and garlic in a large saucepan and pulse with an immersion blender.

Meanwhile, combine the skirt steak and 2 tablespoons soy sauce in a medium bowl and toss to combine. Chill for 10 minutes. In a large bowl, mix 1/2 cup cornstarch with salt and pepper to taste. Toss the skirt steak in the cornstarch mixture and coat well. Transfer the coated meat to a fine sieve and knock off any excess cornstarch. Heat 1 cup canola oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add half of the beef in a single layer and cook without stirring for 2 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes longer; transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining skirt steak. Carefully discard the hot oil and wipe the skillet clean. To a small bowl, add the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, mirin, red wine vinegar, ginger, crushed red pepper, garlic and remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Mix to combine. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the carrots and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the snow peas and cook for 2 minutes. Add the garlic-ginger sauce and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute until the liquid starts to thicken. Add the crispy skirt steak and toss until fully coated. If the sauce looks too thick, you can add 1/4 cup water to thin it out.

Add the oil and stir until combined. Add the water and stir to combine and create a dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead 4 to 5 times. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, cover with a tea towel and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. For a thin snacking cracker: On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 piece of dough to 1/16-inch and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. If there is room on the sheet pan, repeat with a second piece of dough. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 4 minutes then flip and bake for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack. When cool, break into desired size pieces. Repeat procedure with remaining dough. For a thicker dipping cracker: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough as above but to 1/8-inch thick. Bake for 6 minutes on the first side, then flip and bake another 4 to 6 minutes. For super even thickness and easy rolling: Roll out using a lightly floured pasta roller. Flatten the dough until it will pass through the first setting and go to the highest number that your pasta roller will allow without tearing the dough. Bake according to the thin cracker instructions. Note: Baking times will vary depending on exact thickness of dough and oven temperature, so watch them closely.

Position an oven rack in the lowest position; preheat to 350 degrees F. Trim off any skin from the ham, leaving a 1/2-inch layer of fat. Score the fat with a sharp knife in a 1-inch crosshatch pattern without cutting through to the meat. Place the ham, fat-side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan. Pour 2 cups water into the pan; tent the pan with foil. Bake until a thermometer inserted into the ham registers 110 degrees F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours, adding another 1 cup water to the pan if the liquid evaporates. Remove from the oven and uncover. While the ham is baking, prepare the glaze (see recipes, below). Whisk 1/4 cup of the pan juices into the glaze. Brush the ham with about half of the glaze. Return to the oven and continue baking, brushing with the glaze twice more, until the glaze is caramelized and the thermometer registers 140 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 more hours. Transfer the ham to a cutting board or platter; let rest 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the remaining pan juices into a saucepan and boil until slightly syrupy. Spoon the reduced pan juices over the ham. Serve with any remaining glaze. Glaze Recipes Mustard-Orange(pictured) Before baking, arrange halved orange slices all over the ham, securing with cloves. For the glaze, whisk 3/4 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup dijon mustard and the juice of 2 oranges. Pineapple-Rum Before baking, arrange thinly sliced pineapple all over the ham, securing with cloves. For the glaze, simmer 2 cups pineapple juice over medium heat until syrupy, 7 to 8 minutes. Whisk in 1 cup pineapple preserves, 1/4 cup dark rum, 1 teaspoon mustard powder and 1/2 teaspoon each ground cloves, allspice and coriander. Pomegranate-Jalapeno For the glaze, simmer 2 cups pomegranate juice over medium heat until syrupy, 7 to 8 minutes. Whisk in 1/4 cup spicy mustard, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon chili powder and 1 tablespoon jalapeno hot sauce. Brush on the ham as directed, sprinkling with 2 teaspoons chili powder before returning to the oven. Add 1 cup pomegranate seeds and 1 diced jalapeno to the reduced pan juices. Cranberry-Maple For the glaze, boil 2 cups cranberries, 1 cup cranberry juice and 3/4 cup pure maple syrup with 4 thyme sprigs and 1 cinnamon stick over medium heat until syrupy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon chopped thyme. Ginger-Juniper Before baking, add 2 teaspoons juniper berries and 1 teaspoon black peppercorns to the water in the roasting pan. For the glaze, simmer 1 cup ginger preserves, 1/2 cup dry vermouth and 3 tablespoons champagne vinegar over medium heat until syrupy, 4 to 5 minutes. Brush onto the ham as directed, sprinkling with 2 teaspoons crushed juniper berries and 1 teaspoon crushed peppercorns before returning to the oven. Rosemary-Honey Mustard Before baking, add 4 rosemary sprigs to the water in the roasting pan. For the glaze, boil 1/2 cup each whole-grain mustard, honey and dry white wine over medium heat until syrupy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in 1 tablespoon chopped rosemary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24554,&quot;5-Ingredient Cajun-Spiced Grilled Chicken 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed 1 1/8 teaspoons Cajun seasoning 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon canola, grapeseed or rice bran oil, plus more for grilling 1/3 cup Italian flat-leaf parsley, leaves separated Instructions: Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with the Cajun seasoning. Place the chicken in a baking dish and drizzle with the vinegar and oil. Shake the pan gently to coat the chicken underneath. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight for the best flavor.<br> When you are ready to grill, move the chicken to the counter to take off the chill.

Instructions: Put the egg yolk, seafood seasoning, mustard, lemon zest and juice, and vinegar in the bowl of a food processor or a blender and process until smooth. Gradually pour in the oil with the machine running until the mixture emulsifies and forms a mayonnaise. Season with the salt and pepper. (Note: this quantity of mayonnaise will not emulsify in the bowl of the largest size food processor. Use a medium size food processor, a mini processor, or a blender.) Transfer the mayonnaise to a bowl and, using a rubber spatula, fold in the scallions and the crabmeat until well combined. Combine the bread crumbs and the parsley in a shallow container. Form the crab mixture into 8 patties about 3-inches wide and 3/4-inch thick and drop them into the bread crumb-parsley mixture. Dredge the crab cakes on both sides. If you have time, leave the crab cakes in the container of bread crumbs, cover with plastic wrap, and chill for 1 hour or more. When you are ready to fry the crab cakes, put 2 large nonstick skillets over medium heat. Add about 2 tablespoons butter to each pan. When the butter is melted, add 4 crab cakes to each pan, patting off excess crumbs first. Slowly fry the crab cakes over medium heat until they are golden brown on both sides and hot through, turning once with a spatula, about 4 minutes per side. If the crab cakes are browning too quickly, reduce the heat. The internal temperature of a cooked crab cake should be 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer the crab cakes to plates, 2 per person, and serve with your choice of sauce and lemon wedges. 8 ounces tomatillos, husked and cut into quarters 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons green hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1 teaspoon mustard seeds, toasted 1 teaspoon peeled and grated fresh horseradish Put the tomatillos in the bowl of a food processor and process until coarsely pureed. Remove the tomatillo puree to a sieve, drain off the liquid and discard. Put the drained puree in a bowl and stir in the vinegar, sugar, hot sauce, garlic, mustard seeds, and horseradish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24556,&quot;Wonton Soup Wontons: 8 ounces ground chicken 1 packet dried onion soup mix 2 tablespoons sesame oil 2 tablespoons oyster sauce 1 tablespoon minced garlic 24 wonton wrappers 1 skinless chicken breast, sliced into 1/4-inch strips 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 4 (14-ounce) cans chicken stock 2 tablespoons light soy sauce 1 tablespoon sesame oil 2/3 cup Chinese barbecued pork, thinly sliced 1 (4-ounce) jar sliced water chestnuts 1 (4-ounce) jar bamboo shoots 1/2 (12-ounce) bag frozen vegetable stir-fry mix (snap peas, carrots, and mushrooms) Instructions: Wontons: Combine the first 5 ingredients in large bowl and mix together thoroughly.

Refrigerate until ready to use. For the broccoli tots: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Prepare a bowl of ice water. Add the broccoli florets and stems to the boiling water and cook until a very vibrant green and lightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain the broccoli and immediately submerge into the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. You want the broccoli to remain as green as possible. Squeeze the broccoli in clean dish towels to remove as much of the water as possible. Add the broccoli to the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times until finely chopped. Add the parsley, chives, lemon zest and juice, garlic and onion and pulse until the mixture is well combined and no large chunks of any ingredient remain (you should have about 3 1/2 cups of the broccoli mixture). Transfer to a large bowl and add the breadcrumbs, egg, red pepper flakes, 2 teaspoons salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper and mix to combine. You want the mixture to hold together when formed into a ball. Using a tablespoon as a guide, scoop the mixture from the bowl, roll into balls (each ball should weigh about 21 grams) and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining broccoli mixture (you should have about 28 tots). Place the baking sheet in the freezer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a pot with vegetable oil so it comes about 2 inches up the sides. Fit the pot with a deep-fry thermometer and heat the oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F. Fry the tots in 2 to 3 batches until the outsides are a deep golden brown, the insides are still very green and the tots are warmed throughout, 2 to 3 minutes (be sure not to overcrowd the pot or the oil will drop too dramatically in temperature and the outside of the tots will not be crispy). Use a slotted spoon to transfer the tots to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt. Be sure to bring your oil back to temperature between each batch. Serve immediately with the dip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 24575,&quot;Lemon Custard with Profiteroles 1 1/4 cup water 2 tablespoons butter Pinch salt 1 vanilla bean 3 cups flour, sifted 4 egg yolks 4 egg yolks 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 plain yogurt 1/2 cup milk 1 cup heavy cream 1 lemon, grated zest 1/2 cup flour 1 teaspoon beer 1 tablespoon cold water 1 teaspoon sugar 1 egg white 1 lemon, peeled and sliced Extra virgin olive oil 5 lemons 1/3 sugar 2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup lemon infused pastry cream 3 tablespoons milk 3 ounces candied lemon peels 4 lemon leaves Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. To make the profiteroles, heat the water with the butter, salt, and vanilla bean. As soon as the water begins to boil, remove vanilla bean and incorporate the flour all at once, stirring vigorously. Cook the mixture over low heat, continuously beating. Cook until ingredients are combined and batter cleanly comes off the sides of the pan. Transfer mixture to a bowl, let cool slightly, and add egg yolks one at a time beating well between each egg added. Transfer batter to a pastry bag and pipe small rounds onto parchment paper lined baking sheet. Bake for 10 to15 minutes. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Lemon infused pastry cream: Beat egg yolks with half the sugar, then add the yogurt, mixing well. Bring the milk, heavy cream, and remaining sugar to a boil. Slowly add the hot cream and milk to the beaten eggs. This step is called tempering. Add the grated zest, transfer to a mold, and bake for 45 minutes. Allow cream to cool and refrigerate. Lemon fritters: Place flour in a bowl and add the beer and water in a stream, whisking continuously. Add the sugar and incorporate the egg whites beaten to stiff peaks. Dip the lemon slices in the batter, and fry in olive oil. Drain on a paper towel. Lemon sauce: Cut the tops off of 4 lemons and hollow them out, reserving the pulp. Squeeze the pulp and filter the juice. Transfer to a saucepan and add 1/3 cup of sugar, and cook over low heat until a syrup consistency is achieved. To finish the sauce, add the milk and grated lemon peel to half of the infused pastry cream. To assemble: Fill the lemon shell with the lemon cream, and place one in the center of each plate. Fill the profiteroles with the remaining lemon infused pastry cream, and place next to filled lemon shells.

Spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray. Put 3 or 4 of the empanada wrappers on a flat work surface. Spoon 2 teaspoons of cream cheese on the bottom half of each, then spread to create a half-moon shape, leaving a 1/2-inch gap between the cream cheese and the edge. Divide the guava paste into 1-ounce sections; depending on how the paste is packaged, you can either cut it into planks or scoop out about 3 teaspoons per empanada (using 3 teaspoons rather than 1 tablespoon will make the empanadas easier to seal). Finally, top each empanada with about 2 tablespoons of grated cheese. Make an egg wash by whisking the egg in a small bowl with a splash of water. Brush the outer edge of each wrapper with the egg wash, then seal by folding each wrapper in half and pressing the edges together with your fingers. Arrange the empanadas on the prepared baking sheets, then crimp the edges of each with a fork, pushing down enough to seal but not enough to go through the dough. Assemble, seal and crimp the remaining empanadas. Brush the top side of each empanada with the egg wash, then bake until the outsides are dark golden brown and feel crispy to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for at least 5 minutes, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 24606,&quot;Cinnamon Pita Toasts 2 pocket pita rounds 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cinnamon Instructions: Cut pita rounds into 6 triangles.

It can be tinted, flavored, modeled, formed, twisted, imprinted, and shaped into numerous of decorative pieces. Tip: Before applying fondant, a \sticky\ surface should be applied to the cake which will help the fondant adhere to it. Many spread a thin layer of buttercream before laying out the fondant. Tip: When using rolled fondant to make decorations from, roll it to 1/4-inch thick. Either place them flat on greased (use shortening) wax paper or over forms to dry for 24 to 36 hours. Use royal icing to adhere fondant pieces to a rolled fondant iced cake and for the fine decorating commonly used on wedding cakes. Tip: The cake to be covered with rolled fondant must be cooled completely, preferably 24 hours, covered. This will tighten the crumbs and make the cake more solid. Tip: How far ahead you cover your cake with fondant will depend on the type of cake, filling, icing, etc. you use. With a basic butter cake, the fondant covering should be done no more than 2 to 3 days in advance of decorating and serving. A cake only remains fresh that long anyway and because fondant is sugar based, it&#39;s also how long it can stand without breaking down from the moisture in the cake. If you&#39;re using a layer cake and/or perishable fillings or icings, then you need to do everything just a day or two before the event. Tip: Fondant dries quickly, so while working with it, always keep excess well-wrapped in plastic, as well as the parts on the cake you are not working on. Tip: Once wrapped, unrolled fondant keeps for 1 to 2 months at room temperature. Do not refrigerate or freeze. If it gets too hard, put it in the microwave for a few seconds to soften; it will be easier to knead. Tip: To smooth out the fondant once it is put on the cake, use cornstarch on your hands to smooth out the fondant. Tip: If tiny cracks appear in the surface of the fondant, knead it a little - the warmth from the kneading or pressure from the rolling pin will make it smooth and satiny. Do not use water to smooth out cracks - water dissolves fondant as it is mostly sugar. Instead, use a bit of shortening on your fingertips to repair small tears. Add a few drops of vodka, lemon extract or clear vanilla extract. Use a small clean paintbrush to mix the liquid with the dust. Proceed to paint and decorate. Tip: Cracking can also be caused if your fondant is rolled too thick. Fondant is heavy and if not rolled thin enough (1/4-inch thick is usually best) the excess can pull the fondant from the top of the cake causing it to crack. Tip: To cover a crack, try rubbing a little of the same Fondant over the crack in a circular motion, then using a smother or your hands to rub it in. Tip: If fondant pleats at the bottom, gently unpleat and smooth out with the palms of your hands. With the palms of your hands, rub slightly up on sides to form an even top edge. Tip: Try to work with fondant in a cool room and on a cool surface. A warm room may make the fondant too soft and difficult to work with. Luster Dust Tips Tip: Luster dust gives colors a high sheen metallic-like finish. It can be used either alone or mixed with similar colored matte dusts to create a lustrous sheen, without lightening the color. They can also be used on gum paste, royal icing or any frosting recipe that dries hard and is firm to the touch. It is non toxic. Tip: Luster dusts can be incorporated into buttercreams to add shimmer cake decorations. Tip: When using luster dust, use an airbrush, blush brush or a small artist paintbrush to apply. Tip: Because luster dust is not water soluble, never mix them together to make paint colors. Instead use white spirits like vodka, gin, clear vanilla extract or lemon extract - the dust will absorb into these liquids and result in a more intense color. They also dry faster. How To Use: Use a bowl, mix a small amount of the dusting powder with a clear spirit. Luster dust comes in small, 2-gram, tubs. Carefully open the cap and, without breathing, put about 1/4 teaspoon into a very small cup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24618,&quot;No Pie Crust Spinach Pie 1 pound fresh spinach, rinsed, stemmed and chopped 1 cup dried bread crumbs 1 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 stick unsalted butter, softened 3 eggs 1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese 1/4 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon dried basil Fresh nutmeg Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish. For the French toast: Lay the bread slices in one layer (it&#39;s OK if they overlap a little) on a baking sheet. Bake the slices (to dry them out a little) for 6 minutes, then flip and bake for 6 minutes more. Set aside to cool. Whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, granulated sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl. Dunk each bread slice in the egg mixture to coat thoroughly and shingle the slices in the buttered casserole dish. Pour any remaining egg mixture over the bread. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. For the coconut-almond crust: Put 1/2 cup of the coconut, 1/3 cup of the almonds, granulated sugar, flour and salt in a food processor and process until very fine. Add the butter, egg and egg yolk and process well to form a smooth paste. To assemble the casserole: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the coconut-almond mixture evenly over the soaked bread slices. Top with the remaining 1/4 cup sliced almonds and 3 tablespoons coconut and bake until puffed and lightly golden and the custard is set (the center of the casserole will no longer jiggle when shaken), 45 to 50 minutes. Allow to cool for 1 hour before serving, or serve at room temperature. Serve with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and berries if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 24620,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Classic BBQ Chicken 1 cup sweet tea Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1 to 2 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 cup chopped Vidalia onions Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup ketchup<br> 1/2 cup beer<br> 1/4 cup tightly packed light brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon red cl flakes<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 2 cloves garlic, finely minced or grated on a rasp<br> Instructions: For the brine and chicken: In a medium pot on high heat, add the tea, 1/4 cup salt and 1 cup water. Cook, stirring, until the salt dissolves. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Pour the cooled brine into a large resealable plastic bag.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Combine the butter, vanilla, 4 ounces of the room-temperature cream cheese and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add 2 cups of the sugar and beat until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg yolk and beat until smooth, then add the flour and beat on low until the dough just comes together. Remove the frozen cream cheese from the freezer and chop into 1/4-inch cubes. Add the cubes to the dough, quickly stirring with a rubber spatula to evenly incorporate them into the dough. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour. Using a 1-ounce ice cream scoop or 2 tablespoons, scoop 12 portions of dough, roll into balls and transfer to the prepared baking sheet, spacing them evenly apart. Lightly flour the bottom of a 1/2-cup measuring cup and use it to flatten each cookie into a disk about 1/2 inch thick, re-flouring the cup after each cookie. Bake, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until the cookies look set but are still pale and barely brown on the bottom, 20 to 24 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 1 minute, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough.<br> Meanwhile, combine the remaining 2 ounces room-temperature cream cheese, 2 cups sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until the mixture forms a thick paste. Add the milk and stir slowly until a thick glaze forms.<br> When the cookies are cool, dip the entire surface of the top of each cookie in the glaze and lift up, letting the excess glaze drip off, then flip the cookie right-side up and onto the cooling rack. If the glaze is too thick, add another teaspoon of milk to loosen it. If using the cranberries or lime zest, sprinkle on top of the cookies while the glaze is still wet. Allow the glaze to set before serving, at least 10 minutes. Store the cookies in a single layer in an airtight container for up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24624,&quot;Water Kimchi (Mul Kimchi) 1 pound Chinese radish, sliced into 2 by 1/2 by 1/8-inch slices 1 1/2 quarts water 2 large or 3 small cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon sugar 1 dried red pepper 1/2 tablespoon salt 2 scallions, sliced into 2-inch pieces 1/2 cup red bell pepper, julienned for garnish Instructions: In a large jar or large container, combine all ingredients, except red bell pepper cover, and let sit at room temperature for 2 days.

To a small skillet preheated over medium heat, add extra-virgin olive oil, onion and garlic. Cook onions 5 minutes, until translucent. Add wine to the pan and reduce for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and break up the sliced stewed tomatoes with a wooden spoon as they heat through. When the sauce comes to a boil (2 or 3 minutes) remove it from the heat and stir in the parsley. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Pour a few spoonfuls of sauce into the bottom of a shallow baking dish. Add fish to the dish in a single layer. Add remaining sauce and bake 15 to 17 minutes until fish is firm and opaque. Remove fish to serving plate or dinner plates. Spoon a few bits of tomato and sauce over the fish. To the remaining sauce in the baking dish add 2 tablespoons butter cut into small pieces. Add hot pasta to butter and sauce and turn pasta in dish to coat evenly and to allow pasta to absorb juices. Pile pasta alongside fish and serve. If you are entertaining, try bundling portions of pasta around a large, 2-pronged meat fork, by twisting the fork in the pasta allowing it to curl up the fork. Shimmy the twisted pasta off the fork on to a plate you will create pasta \nests.\ This simple \twist\ adds a lot to the plate presentation. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 24626,&quot;Individual Molten Chocolate Cakes 7 1/2 ounces imported bittersweet chocolate (preferably El Rey or Valrhona), coarsely chopped 11 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut in large pieces 3 large eggs 3 large egg yolks 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white granulated sugar 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour, sifted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Butter and flour six 6-ounce custard cups. Place 5 1/2 ounces of the chocolate and the butter in a metal bowl, and set it over a pan of simmering water. Stir until melted and smooth. Cool slightly. Using a standard electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs, yolks and sugar at medium-high speed until they are pale and thick, about 10 minutes. Reduce the speed, and gradually mix in the flour. Add the chocolate mixture to the flour mixture, and continue to beat until thick and glossy, about 5 minutes. Divide half of the mixture among the prepared custard cups. Divide the remaining 2 ounces of coarsely chopped chocolate among them, placing the chunks in the very center of the chocolate mixture (there should be about 1 tablespoon of chopped chocolate per custard cup). Then top with the rest of the chocolate batter. Bake until the cake is set around the edges but the center jiggles slightly when the cup is moved, about 12 minutes. Cool slightly (no more than 5 minutes). Run a sharp knife around the edges of the cups.

Tear them into flat pieces. Heat a heavy skillet or griddle pan over medium heat and add 1/4 cup of the lard. Toast the chiles for 1 or 2 minutes on each side, until toasty and slightly charred but not burned. Be very careful not to burn them. Transfer the chiles to a bowl with a slotted spoon and cover them with warm water. Soak overnight. In a large bowl, combine the roasted tomatoes, breaking them up, and the chocolate, also broken up. In a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder reserved for grinding spices, pulverize the peppercorns, cloves, allspice berries, and cinnamon. Add them to the tomato mixture and set aside. In a large heavy skillet, dry-toast the sesame seeds to a deep golden color, just 10 or 15 seconds. Add to the tomato mixture and repeat with the coriander seeds. Wipe the skillet which you used to toast the chiles and add the remaining 1/4 cup lard. Toast the almonds for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned through. Transfer them to the tomato mixture with a slotted spoon and repeat with the raisins, and then with the onions and garlic, pressing down on the ingredients with the back of the spoon to rid them of excess fat before transferring them to the bowl. If necessary, add a little more lard or oil to the pan and fry the tortillas until golden. Break them up and add them to the bowl, then brown the bread on both sides, tear into large pieces and add to the bowl. Stir the mixture together thoroughly, then place 1/4 of it in a blender jar with 1/2 cup of broth. Blend as smooth as possible, scraping down the blender jar. It is best not to add any additional liquid to the mixture; try to get it to move through the blades by pulsing on and off and scraping down the sides. Repeat with the remaining mixture, 1/4 at a time, adding 1/2 cup of broth to each batch. Strain the mixture through a medium-mesh sieve into a clean bowl and set aside. Now puree the drained chiles in the blender with about 1/2 cup of their soaking water, in 3 batches. Add a little more water if needed, and add the chipotle cl to the last batch. Strain the cl puree through the same sieve into a separate bowl. In a very large (at least 8 quarts), heavy covered casserole, heat 1/4 cup of the lard over medium-high heat. Add the turkey pieces and brown, in several batches, for about 4 minutes on each side. Remove to a roasting pan and set aside. Pour off the excess fat from the casserole, leaving just a little on the bottom, and return to the heat for a moment to heat up. Add the cl puree to the casserole and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan occasionally, for about 5 minutes. The mixture should be quite dark and thick. Add the other puree and cook for a few more minutes, until it thickens once again. Add 5 cups of the broth, partially cover the pan and cook for 45 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally. Add the salt and the sugar and, if the sauce is thicker than heavy cream, thin it with a little more broth. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the sauce over the turkey. Cover the pan and roast until the pieces are tender with no trace of pink remaining, about 2 hours. Remove the pan from the oven and spoon the fat off the top or, if serving the following day, ideally let the dish cool to room temperature and refrigerate so the fat will congeal, making it easier to remove. Skin the turkey and cut the meat from the bones, or serve the turkey in large pieces, as desired. Reheat in a 350 degree F oven for 15 to 20 minutes if needed, spooning some sauce over the top of the turkey pieces to give them a nice glaze. Scatter some sesame seeds over the top just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 24635,&quot;Zen-gria 1 1/2 cups white wine (recommended: Pinot Grigio) 2 bags green tea with honey (recommended: Lipton) 1 cup frozen dark sweet cherries 1 can (10.4 ounces) mandarin oranges in juice (recommended: Golden Star) 1 cup lychees and 1/2 cup juice reserved (recommended: Golden Star) 1/2 bottle (750 ml) plum wine, chilled Instructions: In a small saucepan, over high heat, bring white wine to a simmer.

Mix together the pecans and brown sugar in a medium bowl mix, and then spread onto a baking sheet and toast for 7 minutes, making sure not to burn them. Let cool to room temperature - do not put them in the refrigerator! Once the pecans are cool, transfer them to a food processor with the breadcrumbs and boniatos and blend. Once you have your mixture you can bag it up and keep leftover mix in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Coat your fish using a standard breading procedure: dredge in the flour, then the egg, and then your pecan-boniato mixture. You&#39;re going to want to saute this fish with the butter or olive oil. Heat the butter or oil in a saute pan over medium heat for about 3 minutes, and then saute the fish until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Do not burn. Once you have that golden color place the fish in the oven for 5 minutes to make sure it&#39;s completely cooked through. For the jalapeno cream sauce: Meanwhile, mix together the onions, garlic, jalapeno and bell peppers. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan and saute the vegetables until the garlic is slightly golden in color, then add your wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up the bottom, and cook until reduced by half. Pour in the heavy cream, then the milk and bring to a slight simmer over medium heat. Stir in the butter, jalapeno juice and salt and black pepper, then reduce the heat to low and cook until the butter melts.

Brush both sides of the eggplant slices with 1/3 cup olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange on a baking pan and bake, turning once, until tender and golden brown on both sides, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 6 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add the cinnamon, allspice and tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the wine and boil until reduced by about half, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and oregano and bring to a simmer, then simmer until slightly thickened and the flavors have blended, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the bechamel: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly and stopping occasionally to run a rubber spatula around the edges of the pan to prevent burning. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, then simmer 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the goat cheese and Parmesan, whisking until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Whisk in the egg yolks. Arrange half of the eggplant in a single layer on the bottom of an 8-inch square glass baking dish. Top with half of the meat sauce. Layer the remaining eggplant slices on top followed by the remaining meat sauce. Top with an even layer of bechamel. Place the baking dish on a foil-lined baking pan and bake until bubbling and the topping is golden brown in places, 20 to 30 minutes.

Cook the pieces in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until the skin is crisped and some of the fat has been released, about 5 minutes. Transfer the kielbasa to a paper towel-lined plate to cool. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of puff pastry out to form an 8- by 11-inch rectangle. Using a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 6 circles from the pastry; cut the circles out as close together as possible and reserve the scraps. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry. Wrap a circle of puff pastry around each of a kielbasa, pinching the seams together to seal all the way around so no kielbasa is exposed and gently pulling on the ends to make a tapered football shape. Place on an ungreased baking sheet, seam-side down, and repeat with the remaining pastry and sausage. Brush the rolled sausages with the beaten egg. Use bits of the pastry scraps to make laces on each \football\ by placing 1 strip lengthwise on top of each and laying 3 smaller strip crosswise over it. Press down gently to adhere and brush the laces with a bit more egg. Bake until the pastry is browned and crisped, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve the pigskins with mustard for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24645,&quot;Lime-Tequila Shooters 1 lime, halved Good-quality tequila or mezcal Instructions: With a citrus reamer or your thumb, push a little cavity into the center of the lime to make room for the tequila (lime juice will squirt out).

Add the butter and mix thoroughly with your fingers or a fork until all of the butter has been evenly distributed and incorporated into the flour. Form into small to medium clumps with your fingers. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour, beating until just incorporated. Spoon half of the cake batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula. Dollop the strawberry jam on top and carefully smooth with the spatula. Spoon the remaining cake batter on top and smooth the top. Sprinkle on the crumb topping. Bake until the cake and topping are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan 20 minutes, then invert onto a plate; re-invert onto a rack to cool completely. For the glaze: When the cake is cool, whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and rum together in a medium bowl until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the cake and let set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24647,&quot;Purely Pound Cake 1 pound (2 cups or 4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature 1 pound (2 1/8 cups) sugar 1 pound (12) eggs, separated 1/4 cup brandy 2 teaspoons rose water (optional) 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (1/8 teaspoon if freshly grated) 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 pound (3 1/2 cups) flour, sifted 3 times Mixed berries and fruit, garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Butter 2 (6-cup) loaf pans and line them with parchment or waxed paper. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter until very light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Add the sugar and mix. Working 2 at a time, add the egg yolks, mixing well between each addition. The mixture should be very fluffy. Add the brandy, rose water, nutmeg and salt and mix to incorporate. Working in 3 batches, add the flour, mixing just until combined and scraping down the bowl between additions. In a clean dry bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Add to the batter and mix well, until no streaks of egg white remain. If necessary, fold in the last few streaks by hand. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake until golden brown and split on the top and a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean (a few crumbs are okay), 70 to 80 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Knock the cake out of the pan and let cool (do not remove the parchment paper; it helps the cake stay moist). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24648,&quot;Mile-High Meat Loaf 2 loaves day-old white bread, crusts removed 10 pounds ground beef 2 medium onions, finely chopped 8 whole eggs 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves 1 cup whole milk Salt and pepper About 3 cups ketchup, or more if desired Instructions: Preheat oven 350 degrees F.

Heat 1/3 cup olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the eggplant, season generously with salt and pepper, and let that cook down for 10 to 12 minutes, until the eggplant is soft and wilted. Remove the eggplant from the pan and onto a platter to drain. Next stop, zucchini: cook it the same way in 1/4 cup oil, then add it to the platter with the eggplant. Add another 1/4 cup olive oil to the pan, then the anchovies, onions, garlic and herbs. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the onions get nice and caramelized. Add the tomatoes and cook that down for 10 to 12 minutes, until pulpy. Return the eggplant and zucchini to the pan, crack open the cl, and add that too. Season with salt and pepper and let the ratatouille cook slowly for about 20 minutes, until the mixture is soft, mushy and juicy; you want all the flavors to come together.

Knead in the bowl until very smooth but not sticky, about 2 minutes. Form the dough into 12 equal portions and push a small hole into each. Insert 1 tablespoon of Refried Beans into each of the holes and seal to cover the filling. Roll into 12-inch oblong shapes. For each huarache: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add a huarache and cook until blackened in spots, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for another 3 minutes; remove from the skillet. Spread 8 ounces of cheese onto the skillet and immediately place the huarache on top of the cheese, lightly pressing down. Flip the huarache (the cheese should stick) and then remove to a plate. Mix together the cumin, ground garlic, black pepper, bitter orange juice seasoning and some all-purpose seasoning in a bowl. Transfer to a salt shaker. Return the skillet to high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil. Season 8 ounces of sliced steak with the spice mixture and add to the skillet. Cook, turning once, until browned on both sides and cooked through, about 6 minutes. Place on top of the huarache. Place a cactus paddle on a cutting board and make shallow incisions into it, stopping just before the core so the paddle remains whole. Heat a tablespoon of oil in the skillet and add the cactus paddle and a jalapeno; cook for about 5 minutes, flipping several times. Meanwhile, deep-fry 2 or 3 onions until tender in the center, about 3 minutes. Serve the huarache topped with the cactus paddle, with the jalapeno and onions on the side. In a large stockpot, add the beans, 12 ounces of the oil, the whole 1/2 onion, salt and 2 gallons water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 2 hours. Once cooked, strain to keep only the beans. Add the remaining 6 ounces oil to a large frying pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is warm, add the diced onions and then the beans. Begin to mash with a potato masher, adding the bouillon as you go and mixing it around evenly. Reduce the heat to low and cook for another 15 minutes, until the moisture is evaporated and the beans are your desired thickness. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 24653,&quot;Sugar Cookie Crust Fruit Pizza Nonstick cooking spray 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup light brown sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest Pinch salt 2 tablespoons orange marmalade 1/2 teaspoon herbs de Provence 1 cup blueberries 1 cup sliced kiwi 1 cup sliced nectarines 1 cup raspberries 1 cup strawberries, sliced Instructions: For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 10- to 12-inch tart pan or pizza pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugars until smooth using a handheld mixer. Add in the egg and vanilla and mix until incorporated. Slowly incorporate the flour mixture into the creamed butter, and mix until blended. Remove the dough from the bowl and press it into the prepared pan. (You may need to dust your hands with some flour to prevent the dough from sticking to them; it is a wet dough when it comes together.) Bake until the edges just start to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. For the spread: In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla, lemon zest and salt until smooth. Spread evenly on the cooled crust. For the glaze: Add the marmalade, 2 tablespoons water and the herbes de Provence to a small skillet and cook over medium heat until loosened and warm. To assemble: Arrange the fresh fruit in the desired pattern on top of the pizza. Brush the fruit with the glaze.

To set up the smoker: Take your turkey roaster and line it with aluminum foil. Drain the applewood chips and add to the bottom of the pan. Put the pan over high heat on the stove-top. The chips will begin to smolder and smoke. For spice mix: In a small bowl add the first 5 ingredients and mix well. Combine the remaining ingredients in a mortar and pestle and mash until you have the texture of coarse sand. Add this mixture to the spice bowl. Prepare the turkey. Wash the bird inside and out under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels and season inside the cavity well with the spice mix. Stuff the bird with sliced fennel, lemon, garlic, bay, sage, rosemary and thyme. Pin the wings back behind the base of the breast. Truss the bird using kitchen twine. Coat the turkey in olive oil and season all over the outside with the remaining spice mix. Once the chips start smoking arrange the turkey on a rack and put it over the smoking chips. Reduce the heat to medium and cover the whole pan with foil so the smoke encapsulates the entire bird. Turn the temperature down slightly and smoke for 10 to 15 minutes. Once done, remove the foil and lift the whole rack with the turkey out of the pan. Discard the foil with the chips. (Make sure you put the chips out by submerging in water before discarding.) Put the rack back into the roaster pan and roast in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meaty part of the thigh should register 170 degrees F. If the legs or breast brown too quickly during roasting, cover them with foil. When done, remove the turkey from the oven and set aside to rest. Transfer to a platter and garnish with sage. In a large pan over medium heat add the bacon. Cook for 5 minutes until the bacon is beginning to crisp. Add the onions, garlic, 3 torn sage leaves, and the pumpkin. Saute until the onions caramelize, about 5 minutes. Pour the chicken stock into pan to deglaze and simmer until the pumpkin is completely soft, about 10 to 12 minutes. Once the pumpkin is tender, pour the gravy through fine mesh strainer, into a bowl. Press the solids with a spoon to extract all the liquid and pulp possible. Return the gravy to the pot and continue to simmer and reduce by half, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add the remaining 3 whole fresh sage leaves. Stir in the butter and once combined pour the gravy into a serving bowl or pitcher. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 24655,&quot;Miso-Honey Shrimp Stir Fry 1/3 cup miso 3 tablespoons honey 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon sriracha 1 tablespoon peanut or canola oil 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced<br> 1 cup shredded carrots 1 cup snow peas, sliced in half 3 cups steamed white rice 1 1/2 cups mung bean sprouts Instructions: In a medium bowl, whisk together the miso, honey, soy sauce and sriracha.

Bring to a boil, remove from the heat. Let stand 1 hour, then drain. In a Dutch oven over medium heat, add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add prosciutto, cook, turning occasionally to allow to all sides to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add halved onion, carrot, celery and sage to the pot, and add with beans. Add the water and stir well. Simmer gently, uncovered, until beans are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Season with salt. Remove from the heat, and let cool in the liquid. In another large pot, heat remaining 3 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat, then add the fennel, chopped onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Cook until vegetables are softened but not colored, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the onion, celery, and carrot from the bean mixture and discard. Remove the prosciutto, dice, and set aside. Drain the beans and reserve the liquid. Add the fennel seeds to the onions, fennel and garlic. Add mixed greens and toss until they wilt evenly; adjusting the heat to keep vegetables from burning. Stir in the prosciutto. Add the beans, the reserved liquid, tomatoes, potatoes, zucchini, green beans, and jalapenos. Simmer gently until potatoes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Add fennel fronds, if using, and season with salt and pepper. Remove the jalapenos to a small bowl and discard the stems. Mash with a fork, adding a little broth and potato from the pot to make a thick puree. Serve soup, passing the jalapeno condiment on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 24657,&quot;Mandarin Meringue Pie 12 (200 grams) shortbread cookies, such as Walker 2 tablespoons (25 grams) sugar Pinch kosher salt 4 tablespoons (56 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled 1 tablespoon mandarin orange zest plus 1/2 cup mandarin orange juice 1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar 2 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk 1/4 cup evaporated milk 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 large egg whites 1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch kosher salt Instructions: Arrange oven racks in both the upper third and lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the crust: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add the cookies, sugar and salt. Process to make fine, even crumbs (but not a paste). Pour in the melted butter and pulse until thoroughly combined. Transfer the crust to a 9-inch pie plate (see Cook&#39;s Note) and press to compact and coat the bottom and sides. Bake until the crust is set, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack. Decrease the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. For the custard: In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the orange zest and juice and sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is fully dissolved. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Thoroughly whisk the whole eggs and yolk, evaporated milk, vanilla and salt in a large bowl (or large spouted measuring cup, which will make it easier to pour into the crust later). Whisk in the cooled orange juice mixture. Put the crust on a baking sheet and place on the bottom rack of the oven. Pour the custard in while the pie plate is on the rack to avoid spills. Bake until the custard is just set but the very center is still just a bit jiggly, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool completely. (The pie could be made a day ahead and chilled before topping.) For the meringue: Once the pie has cooled, preheat the oven to broil. Bring a medium saucepan with about an inch of water to a simmer over low heat. Into a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Set the bowl over the simmering water and whisk until light and foamy and the mixture reads 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. (The mixture should no longer be grainy if you rub it between your fingers and will be very warm/almost hot to the touch.) Transfer the egg mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium speed until the mixture begins to cool and forms soft peaks, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high and whisk until the meringue just forms medium-stiff peaks (don\u2019t overwhip), 1 to 2 minutes more. Spread the mixture over the pie and make swoops and peaks with the back of a spoon. Broil in the oven for 1 to 2 minutes (watching carefully so as to not to let it burn) until golden brown and toasty. (Alternatively, you can use a brulee torch to toast the meringue.) Set aside to cool. The meringue will be the best the day it is made, but leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days, though the meringue may weep a bit. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24658,&quot;Red Velvet Sandwich Cookies 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 1 1/2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda Fine salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 large egg yolk 1 1/2 teaspoons red food coloring 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 4 ounces cream cheese, softened 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Fine salt Instructions: For the cookies: Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium speed just until combined. Beat in the egg yolk just until combined. Beat in the food coloring and vanilla until the color is evenly distributed, scraping down the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture. Beat just until the dough comes together. Form the dough into two 1-inch-thick disks, wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour. Unwrap one disk, place it on the paper and cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap. Roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thick. Peel off the plastic wrap and, using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut the dough into rounds. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart (about 12 cookies per sheet). Gather the scraps, chill until firm, roll again and cut. Repeat with the remaining disk. Bake the cookies until set and brick-red, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Let the cookies cool on the sheets for 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. For the filling: Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a medium bowl if using a hand mixer), beat the butter on medium speed until light and creamy. Add the cream cheese and beat until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla and a pinch of salt and beat until smooth and fully incorporated. Refrigerate the filling until it is slightly firm, about 2 hours. To assemble the cookies, put a heaping teaspoon of filling on a cookie and top with another cookie, gently pressing to spread the filling to the edge of the cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24659,&quot;Brewhouse Beer Mustard 1 cup mustard seeds 2 cups lager beer 1 1/3 cups malt vinegar 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/4 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon dry mustard 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 tablespoons horseradish Instructions: In a small bowl combine the mustard seeds, lager, and malt vinegar.

Set aside.<br> Filling: In a medium bowl, combine the risotto, bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, and eggs. With damp hands, using about 2 tablespoons of the risotto mixture, form the mixture into 1 3/4-inch diameter balls. Make a hole in the center of each ball and insert a cube of Gorgonzola. Cover up the hole to completely enclose the cheese. Roll the balls in the breading to coat.<br> In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour in enough oil to fill the pan about 1/3 of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. (If you dont have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 2 minutes.) In batches, fry the rice balls, turning occasionally, until golden, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve. In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and keep the broth hot.<br> In a large, heavy saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with the butter. Add the wine and simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup hot broth and stir until almost completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking the rice, adding the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition of broth to absorb before adding the next. Cook the rice until tender but still firm to the bite and the mixture is creamy, about 20 minutes.

Lay out four 20-inch sheets of heavy-duty foil on a work surface. Bring 6 cups salted water to a boil in a large deep skillet. Add the linguine to the boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until pliable but not cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl using tongs, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss well. Add 1/2 cup of the cooking water and toss well (reserve the remaining cooking water). Add the shrimp, garlic, lemon zest, oregano, red pepper flakes and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil; season with salt and toss. Divide the pasta mixture among the foil sheets. Drizzle evenly with the wine and 1/2 cup more pasta cooking water total. Top each with 1 tablespoon butter. Bring the two short ends of the foil together and fold twice; fold in the sides to seal, leaving a little room for steam to circulate. Grill the packets seam-side up until puffed and the shrimp and pasta are fully cooked, 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully open the packets and add the arugula; toss to wilt slightly. Sprinkle with the parmesan and serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 24663,&quot;Stuffed Mushrooms with Pine Nuts and Golden Raisins 24 large white or cremini mushrooms, wiped clean, stems finely chopped for the filling 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1/4 cup olive oil 1/2 cup finely chopped carrot 1/2 cup finely chopped onion Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated fontina cheese 3 tablespoons pine nuts 3 tablespoons chopped golden raisins 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 cup coarse fresh white breadcrumbs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. For the mushrooms: If your mushrooms caps are very rounded, trim a very thin slice from the top of the caps to help them sit upright for baking. Toss the mushroom caps with the oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. For the filling: Heat the olive over medium-high heat. Add the chopped mushroom stems, carrot, and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until just soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Scrape into a large bowl, season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and set aside to cool. Add the fontina, pine nuts, raisins and parsley to the cooled mushroom stem mixture. Stir in the breadcrumbs until well moistened. Pack each mushroom with an equal amount of filling and transfer the filled mushrooms to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the mushrooms are tender and the filling is brown and crispy on top, about 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before removing from the baking sheet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 24664,&quot;Malted Oatmeal Cream Pies 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon malted milk powder (such as Carnation original) 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups quick or old-fashioned oats 1/2 cup sliced almonds 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more if needed 1 tablespoon malted milk powder (such as Carnation original) 2 tablespoons whole milk, plus more if needed 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Make the cookies: Whisk the flour, malted milk powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Pulse the oats and almonds in a food processor until coarsely ground; set aside. Beat the butter with the brown sugar and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Add the oat mixture and beat until just combined. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop 1/4-cup balls of dough (about 24), about 2 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheets. Freeze until firm, at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the cookies until just golden and crisp around the edges, 15 to 17 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Make the filling: Beat the butter with the confectioners&#39; sugar and malted milk powder in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-low speed until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the milk and vanilla and beat until just combined. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, at least 5 minutes. (Add more milk if the filling is too thick; add more confectioners? sugar if it?s too thin.) Sandwich the filling between the cookies. Malted milk powder differentiates this from the usual oatmeal cookie. Grinding the oats is essential to getting the right texture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 24665,&quot;Leek Potato Soup 1 pound leeks, cleaned and dark green sections removed, approximately 4 to 5 medium 3 tablespoons unsalted butter Heavy pinch kosher salt, plus additional for seasoning 14 ounces, approximately 3 small, Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced small 1 quart vegetable broth 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup buttermilk 1/2 teaspoon white pepper 1 tablespoon snipped chives Instructions: Chop the leeks into small pieces.

Slice the hot dogs lengthwise to butterfly them, making sure not to slice all the way through. Place the hot dogs cut-side down on the grill and cook until nice and charred to your liking, 4 to 5 minutes per side. (I like a good heavy char for that extra texture and flavor.) Meanwhile, fill a large pot with a lid with about an inch of water, then place a steamer basket or vegetable steamer inside, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, then add the pretzel hot dog buns and steam, covered, until soft and warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat but keep covered. Nestle the dogs into the steamed pretzel buns and ladle on plenty of the Beer Cheese Sauce. Top with the sliced pickled jalapenos, fried onions and giardiniera or cherry pepper slices. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the evaporated milk, lager, mustard and Worcestershire and whisk together until smooth. In a separate bowl, combine the cheeses and cornstarch until the cheese is completely coated.

Toss to coat, cover, place in the refrigerator and let sit 1 hour. For the stir-fry: Remove the chicken from the fridge. Add 1 cup cornstarch to a shallow baking dish and dredge each piece of chicken, shaking off any excess. Fill a Dutch oven or high-sided saute pan with enough oil to completely submerge the chicken pieces. Heat over high heat until glossy and the temperature reaches 375 degrees F. Deep fry the chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes, adding your chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding and to keep your oil from dropping in temp too much. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. In a large saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until golden brown and fragrant, about 30 seconds. Next, add the rice wine, hoisin, oyster sauce, soy sauce, honey and the chili sauces; bring to a simmer.

For the crust: Combine the graham crumbs, butter, honey, and brown sugar in a bowl. Do not over mix as it will make the crust tough. Evenly spread the mixture on the bottom and up the sides of an ungreased 9-inch pie tin or glass pie dish. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, place on a cooling rack, and let rest. For the filling: Combine the cold whipping cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, and vanilla and whip, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, until peaks form. Combine the sweetened condensed milk, diced pineapple, shredded coconut, and 4 ounces of the whipped cream mixture in a 6-quart mixing bowl and whisk well. (Place the balance of the whipped cream mixture in the fridge to keep it stiff.) Once well incorporated, slowly add the Key lime juice in intervals, do not add all at once. The juice will have a chemical reaction with the cream, causing it to thicken. Do not over mix as it will break down the mixture, causing it to become runny. The mixture will begin to thicken (you want it thick). Once the crust has cooled, spoon the pie filling into the center of the crust and spread evenly towards the edges with a pastry knife or the spoon. Place into the fridge for 2 hours to completely set up. Fill a pastry bag 1/2 way and squeeze dollops of the remaining whipped cream around the border of the cooled pie. Sprinkle coconut chips on top of the whipped cream border.

Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack the eggs and yolk into the hole, and add the olive oil, salt and water. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water and salt, and then begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture. (Be careful not to break the sides of the well, or the egg mixture will run all over your work surface and you&#39;ll have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about lumps.) When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it won&#39;t run all over the place, begin to use your hands to get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together into a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading, it is VERY important to put your body weight into it--get on top of the dough to really stretch, not tear, it. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader or 10 to 15 minutes for an inexperienced kneader. This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. For the shrimp and squid sauce: In a large pan, saute the fennel and onion in the oil until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic, zucchini, tomato and some salt, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, another few minutes. Stir in the red pepper. Add the wine, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and simmer until slightly thickened. Add the shrimp and squid. Cook until just done, being careful not to overcook the shrimp and squid or else they&#39;ll be rubbery. Take off the heat, set aside and keep warm. For the arugula salad: Toss the arugula in the olive oil; season with salt.<br> To finish the pasta: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Roll out the pasta very thin with a pasta maker, following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Then use the machine to cut the pasta into tagliatelle. Cook a quarter of the pasta in boiling water for 4 to 5 minutes (save the remainder for another use). To serve: Divide the tagliatelle among 4 plates and divide the sauce over it, making sure each plate gets some pieces of shrimp and squid. Top with the arugula salad and some grated Parmesan, and garnish with fennel fronds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 24695,&quot;Citrus Crinkle Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons finely grated citrus zest (lemon, lime or orange) plus 3 tablespoons juice 4 to 6 drops yellow, green or orange gel food coloring 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl.

Sprinkle the yeast over the water, and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Whisk together the flour, raisins, 1 teaspoon of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a large bowl. Add half the flour mixture to the yeast, and mix on low speed until incorporated, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Add the remaining flour, increase the speed to medium and continue to beat until the dough gathers around the hook and pulls away from the side of the bowl. Once this happens, continue to beat until the dough is smooth, about 5 minutes more. Remove the dough ball, butter the inside of the bowl, return the dough ball to the bowl, cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Position 2 racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, and spray generously with cooking spray. Punch down the dough, and cut it in half. Divide each half into twelve even pieces, and cover with a towel. Roll each piece of dough into an 18-inch rope, working from the middle out. (It helps to hold the dough ends and slap the center of the length on the counter as you stretch and roll.) Make a U shape with one of the dough ropes, lift the ends and twist in the center twice; fold the ends over and down, and pinch to secure them to the bottom of the U to finish the pretzel shape. Transfer the pretzels to the prepared baking sheets. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature until the pretzels rise slightly, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 10 cups water and the baking soda in a large, wide pot, and bring to a low simmer (190 to 200 degrees F), whisking until the baking soda dissolves. Stir together the granulated sugar and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl. Cut the parchment paper with scissors around each pretzel. Leaving the pretzel on the paper (so it keeps its shape while transporting to the simmering water), remove the pretzels from the baking sheets. Reline each baking sheet with parchment, and spray generously with cooking spray. Put each pretzel, top-down, into the simmering water, and remove the paper. Simmer until the pretzels plump, about 1 minute. Carefully flip the pretzels, and continue to simmer 45 seconds more. Remove each with a slotted spoon, shake off excess liquid, place on the prepared baking sheets and sprinkle with some of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Bake the pretzels until they&#39;re a few shades darker and the bottoms are nicely browned, 16 to 18 minutes, rotating about halfway through. Brush with the melted butter. Store the pretzels at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 2 days, or freeze them for up to 1 month (let thaw at room temperature). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24700,&quot;Gingered Pineapple Chicken Skewers 2 (15 ounce) cans crushed pineapple 3 tablespoons lime juice 5 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon grated ginger 3 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast or thigh meat, cut lengthwise into 1-inch wide strips 1 medium scallion, thinly sliced for garnish 36 (6-inch) wooden skewers Instructions: Combine everything except chicken and skewers in a large nonreactive bowl and whisk to combine.

Cut the ribs between the bones into individual riblets. Pat dry and season lightly with salt. Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven. Add the ribs in batches and brown all over, about 3 minutes per batch, Remove to a plate as they brown. As the ribs brown, combine the brown sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat until the mixture darkens to a deep caramel color and is syrupy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the vinegar, fish sauce, soy sauce and sriracha. Stir until smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the ginger and garlic. Once all of the ribs are out of the pot, add the brown sugar sauce and coconut water and bring to a simmer. Nestle the ribs in the sauce, bring to a simmer and cover. Cook until the ribs are tender but not falling apart, about 1 hour. Uncover the pot, increase the heat and reduce the sauce, turning the ribs to coat all sides, until it is thick and syrupy and glazes the ribs, 3 to 4 minutes. (Stir the bottom of the pot too so the sauce doesn\u2019t burn.) Pile the ribs on a platter and sprinkle with the scallions and jalapeno. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 24726,&quot;Asian Pear Salad with Tamari Pecans and Maytag Blue Cheese 2 tablespoons pear or cider vinegar 4 teaspoons Pear Syrup, recipe follows 1 teaspoon Extra-Virgin O Lemon Oil or unflavored extra-virgin olive oil 6 cups mixed bitter salad greens, such as baby mustard, lovage, arugula, dandelion, and mizuna 1/4 cup chopped Tamari Pecans, recipe follows 1/4 cup dried currants or chopped raisins 1/4 cup crumbled chilled blue cheese (recommended: Maytag) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 ripe Asian pear, cored, peeled and thinly sliced 3 cups pear juice 1 tablespoon tamari sauce 2 teaspoons molasses Cayenne pepper and salt 1 cup pecan halves Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the vinegar and syrup. Whisk in the oil and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the greens, pecans and currants. Sprinkle with the cheese and season lightly with salt and pepper. Whisk the dressing again and drizzle it over the salad. Toss the salad gently and briefly; you do not want the cheese to crumble any further and clump together. Divide the salad among 4 chilled salad plates. Fan the pear slices over each serving. Put the pear juice in a saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and skim the thick foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to low and simmer very gently, skimming occasionally, for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the juice reduces to the consistency of maple syrup. Let cool to room temperature. Use now or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a shallow bowl, stir the tamari and molasses together to blend. Season with cayenne and salt, to taste.

Add a slice or two of the Asiago cheese, Gouda and Swiss, tomato and mustard to the non-buttered side. Top with another slice of bread, buttered-side out. Lay the sandwiches on the grill and cook until brown. You might need to move the sandwich around a bit, as hot spots tend to cause the grilled cheese to cook faster in some areas than others. Flip and cook until the other side is brown and crispy, then remove from the grill. Repeat for the remaining sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24732,&quot;Simple Chicken Soup Carcass and bones from one 4- to 5-pound roast chicken (or a mild-flavored rotisserie chicken) 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 medium carrots, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds 2 celery stalks, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick slices 1 medium onion, chopped 1 bay leaf 1/2 cup white rice 2 tablespoons chopped parsley Kosher salt Instructions: Put the bones and carcass from a leftover chicken (they can be in pieces) in a large pot. Cover with the broth and 4 cups water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Skim any foam or fat from the broth with a ladle as necessary. Remove the bones and carcass with tongs or a slotted spoon; set aside to cool. Add the carrots, celery, onion and bay leaf to the broth, bring back to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are about half cooked (they will still have resistance when tested with a knife but be somewhat pliable when bent), about 10 minutes. Stir in the rice (to keep it from sticking to the bottom), and cook until the grains are just al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, when the carcass and bones are cool enough to handle, pick off the meat, and shred it into bite-size pieces. When the rice is done, add the meat to the broth and simmer until warmed through, about 1 minute. Stir in the parsley, and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt or more to taste.

Toss the pears, nutmeg and half of the lemon juice together in a bowl.<br> Melt the butter with the remaining lemon juice, the salt and 3 tablespoons water in a heavy ovenproof 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the sugar into the skillet and stir to combine. Cook the mixture without stirring, letting it foam and bubble; the butter will separate, which is OK. Watch the mixture carefully while it cooks because once the water evaporates and the sugar begins to change color, things happen quickly. When it becomes the color of light brown sugar, about 10 minutes, remove it from the heat. Stir in the vanilla.<br> Being careful not to burn yourself, sprinkle the cranberries and ginger into the caramel. Arrange the pears in the skillet round side-down in concentric circles as nicely as you can, fitting in as many pears as possible.<br> Return the skillet to the burner over medium heat and cook until the pears start to soften when you poke them with a knife, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> While your pears cook, roll out your Pie Crust on a flour-dusted surface to an 11-inch circle. Cover the crust with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.<br> Lay the crust over the pears, tucking it in around the edge of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Bake until the crust is golden brown and firm to the touch, about 30 minutes.<br> Allow the tart to cool until you can handle it, about 10 minutes. Put a plate on top of the tart using heatproof pads and flip it over so the pears are on top. Slice and serve warm with creme fraiche, if using. Combine the flour, sugar, salt and butter in a food processor and pulse until the butter is evenly distributed but still visible in chunks. While pulsing, add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is just wet enough to hold together when pinched between your fingers. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap, form into a disc and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 24 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 24734,&quot;Cucumber and Red Bell Pepper Raita 1 English hot-house cucumber, peeled and diced 1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced 6 ounces plain yogurt 2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves, finely chopped Salt and pepper Instructions: Put all ingredients in a bowl and stir to combine.

Wash the goose thoroughly inside and out. Dry well with paper towels. Prick the skin with a fork or fine skewer (this helps release the fat during cooking) and generously rub all over with sea salt. Stuff the bird with the cut fruit. Tuck the wings under so they are not exposed. Add 1/2 inch water to the roasting pan and position the goose breast side down in a roasting rack. Place the pan in the oven for 45 minutes. Check the bird while it&#39;s roasting to make sure the water doesn&#39;t evaporate or the goose fat will burn. After 45 minutes, take the goose out of the oven. Turn it breast side up and prick the skin again. Carefully remove the excess fat by tilting the pan and using a baster. Add another 1/2-inch of water to the pan. Continue to roast for another 2 hours. The goose is cooked when its juices run clear when the thigh is pierced with a skewer. If they are at all bloody, roast for a further 15 minutes and check again. To be sure the goose is cooked, insert a thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh. It should read 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes. Pour out excess fat leaving about 2 tablespoons. Add the scallions, ginger, blackberries, sugar and soy sauce. Saute for 5 to 10 minutes until the blackberries begin to break up and the juices are released. Add Zinfandel and reduce by half then add the chicken stock and reduce by half again. Pass sauce through a sieve and discard the pulp. Serve with the goose. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo]&quot; 24746,&quot;Braunschweiger Banh Mi 1 cup cauliflower florets 1/2 cup white wine vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds, lightly crushed 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 small carrot, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar 1/4 teaspoon sugar 1 small clove garlic, finely grated 1/2 small jalapeno, seeded and thinly sliced 4 thin boneless pork cutlets (about 8 ounces total), pounded to 1/4-inch thick Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 3 tablespoons vegetable oil Two 12-inch baguettes Mayonnaise, such as Kewpie, for serving Spicy brown mustard, for serving 1/2 pound braunschweiger liverwurst 1/2 English cucumber, sliced 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced 1 small bunch watercress 1 cup loosely-packed fresh cilantro leaves with tender stems Sriracha, for serving Instructions: For the caraway pickled cauliflower: Cut the florets into 1/4-inch-thick slices. It&#39;s alright if the pieces break apart. Combine the vinegar, sugar, caraway seeds, 1/3 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, whisking until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat, add the cauliflower and carrot and stir. Allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. For the garlic fish sauce: Whisk together the fish sauce, lemon juice, vinegar, sugar, garlic, jalapeno and 2 teaspoons water in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. For the fried pork cutlets: Lightly sprinkle the cutlets on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the flour, egg and breadcrumbs in three separate shallow bowls. Dredge each cutlet in the flour, dusting off any excess. Then dip in the egg and, finally, coat with the breadcrumbs. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil shimmers, fry two cutlets until browned, crispy and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Add the remaining tablespoon oil to the pan and repeat with the remaining cutlets. For the sandwiches: Trim and discard the bread heels from the baguettes. Halve each so you have a total of four 6-inch pieces. Split each piece lengthwise about 3/4 of the way and press it open like a book. Generously spread the top halves with mayonnaise and the bottom halves with mustard and liverwurst. Arrange the baguettes on a baking sheet and bake until warm, 3 to 4 minutes. Top the bottom half of each baguette with a pork cutlet (halve the cutlets for fit, if necessary) and some of the cucumber, onion, caraway-pickled cauliflower, watercress and cilantro. Top each with a drizzle of garlic fish sauce and a squirt of Sriracha and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24747,&quot;Pan Seared Airline Breast 4 full chicken breasts, (ribs removed and wing intact) 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup julienned yellow onion 1 cup trimmed julienned leeks 2 tablespoons roughly chopped garlic 1 cup jarred pitted Spanish olives, plus 1 tablespoon olive juice 1/2 cup white wine Pinch freshly chopped thyme leaves 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse and pat dry the chicken. Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Combine paprika, granulated garlic, salt and pepper, in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mix all over the chicken. When skillet is hot, add oil and sear chicken, skin side first, turn over and sear other side. Remove to a sheet tray and put into the preheated oven to cook through, about 15 minutes. To the pan you used to sear the chicken, add in the onions and leeks. Saute for 4 to 5 minutes or until lightly caramelized. Add garlic and olives and olive juice. Saute for 2 minutes more, then deglaze the pan with white wine. Reduce wine by half. Finish sauce by stirring in thyme and butter. Adjust seasoning, if necessary, and keep warm. When chicken is done, remove from oven, place on serving platter, and pour any juices into vegetable mixture. Pour over chicken and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24748,&quot;Creamy Orange Float 2 scoops vanilla ice cream Chilled orange soda<br> Whipped cream<br> Instructions: Add the ice cream to a large glass and top with some orange soda and whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 24749,&quot;Crispy Golden Sauteed Fish 12 ounces flounder or other mild white fish, 1/2-inch thick, cut into 4 (3-ounce) pieces Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Juice of 1 lemon 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Prepare the fish by rinsing and patting dry, without squeezing the delicate fish flesh. Salt and pepper both sides of the fish. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a medium saute pan. Cook&#39;s Note: Do not use a nonstick pan. The oil should be glossy, but not smoking. While the oil is heating, take a fresh paper towel and pat the fish dry a second time, and dredge the fish in flour on both sides, patting off the excess. This will make your beautiful crust-searing foolproof! Place the fish in the pan and cook undisturbed for 3 minutes. Flip the fish, being firm with the spatula in order to scrape up the whole golden-seared crust when you flip. Once flipped, place 1/2 tablespoon of butter on top of each piece of fish, and allow it to melt into the saucepan. It may brown somewhat, but it should not burn. Allow the mixture to cook another 2 minutes and then remove the fish. Deglaze the pan with the lemon juice (be careful with splatters!), and quickly scrape up the brown bits of flavor. Toss in the parsley, taste for seasoning, and spoon a teaspoon of the rich lemony butter onto the fish and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 24750,&quot;Roasted Asparagus Wrapped in Pancetta Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 24 spears medium-sized asparagus 4 sprigs fresh rosemary Good rashers of pancetta 4 good anchovies (optional) Olive oil 1/2 lemon 1 knob butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Spread the the ricotta on the towel in a thin, even layer with a rubber spatula; this will help remove any excess moisture from the ricotta. Fold the edges of the towel over the ricotta, lightly press down and set aside to drain, about 15 minutes. Finely chop 1/2 cup of the basil leaves and 1/2 cup of the mint leaves, reserving the remaining leaves for garnish. In a large bowl, mix the chopped basil and mint, drained ricotta, Parmesan, eggs, 1/4 cup of the chives, 2 teaspoons salt and a healthy crack of black pepper with a rubber spatula until smooth and well-combined. Add the flour in 4 parts (1/4 cup at a time), delicately folding with the spatula between each addition to make sure the gnocchi dough remains light and fluffy. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and dust with flour. Set aside. Dust a clean counter or cutting board with flour. Scoop the dough out of the bowl and onto the floured surface, dust with more flour and use your hands to form into a thick ball. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 12-inch-long and 1/2-inch-thick snake. Using a sharp knife or pastry cutter, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces and place on the prepared baking sheet until ready to cook. In a large skillet, bring the tomato sauce to a simmer over medium heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low to keep warm. Season the boiling water heavily with salt. Add the gnocchi and cook until they float to the top, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer the gnocchi directly to the sauce using a slotted spoon or spider, add 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and delicately toss together until warmed through, taking care to not break the gnocchi. To plate, divide the gnocchi and sauce among 6 shallow bowls and top with Parmesan, the reserved basil and mint, the remaining 1/4 cup chives and a drizzle of olive oil.

Add the tomatillos, garlic, cilantro, jalapeno and onion and bring back to a boil. Boil until the tomatillos turn olive green, about 10 minutes. Strain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Transfer the ingredients from the pot to a blender with the reserved cooking liquid and puree until smooth. Return the mixture to the same (empty) pot, bring to a boil and boil until the sauce is darker green and reduced, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with 1 teaspoon salt or to taste and set aside. For the enchiladas: Put the potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover, add some salt and cover the pot.

Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of cold butter. (If the butter gets too soft, refrigerate the mixture for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Use a fork to stir in the egg and water mixture until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more cold water.) Divide the dough into two equal-sized disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. For the filling: Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges and place in a bowl with the lemon juice and cranberries, tossing to combine. Add the sugar and toss again to combine evenly. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apple mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low, cooking until the apples soften and release most of their juices and the cranberries have burst, about 7 minutes. Strain the apple mixture into a colander set over the bowl, shaking it to collect as much of the juice as possible. Pour the liquid back into the skillet, add the cinnamon and ginger, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Return the reduced juice and the apple mixture to the bowl and toss to recombine. Chill the filling until it cools completely, at least an hour and up to 2 days. To assemble the pie: On a lightly floured surface, roll each disk into an 11- to 12-inch circle. Lay each dough circle between two pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Place a baking sheet on a rack positioned in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish with one of the dough discs and trim it to leave a 1/2-inch overhang on all sides. Stir the cornstarch into the filling and add it to the pan. Use a chef&#39;s knife, pizza cutter or fluted dough cutter to cut the second round into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lay strips of dough, evenly spaced, across the entire pie. Weave more strips of dough perpendicular through the previous strips to make a lattice or basket weave design across the entire pie. Trim the excess ends from the strips of dough. Pinch the bottom crust edge and lattice edge together, and flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes. If the edges begin to brown too fast, cover them with strips of aluminum foil. Let the pie cool 1 hour before serving. Once completely cooled, the pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24783,&quot;Pan Fried Sea Bass 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons butter, divided Two 6- to 8-ounce fillets sea bass, skin on Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup vermouth 4 sprigs fresh thyme Pinch saffron 1/4 cup heavy cream Blanched asparagus, for serving Instructions: Heat a large skillet with olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter.

Drain and set aside. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon fajita seasoning over the chicken and toss to coat. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy skillet over a high heat. When the butter has melted and the oil is hot, add half of the chicken in a single layer. Allow the chicken to brown, about 1 minute, before turning and cooking for an additional minute. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add the remaining chicken and repeat. Add the remaining tablespoon each butter and olive oil to the same skillet. When the butter has melted, add the garlic, peppers, onions and mushrooms, then cook, getting as much color on the vegetables as possible, for 1 minute. Remove the vegetables to a plate. With the skillet still over high heat, add the chicken stock and tequila to deglaze; allow to cook for a couple of minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, then sprinkle the remaining tablespoon fajita seasoning into the sauce. Stir in the cream and adobo sauce. Allow to cook, stirring, until the sauce begins to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. (The sauce should have a good amount of heat to it.) Finally, add the chicken and vegetables back to the skillet. Add the pasta and the tomatoes, then toss to combine. Cook for a couple more minutes until everything is heated through. Top with the chopped cilantro and chow down. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 24791,&quot;Grilled Stuffed Pork Tenderloin 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the grill 1 pork tenderloin (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds) 3 cloves garlic (1 finely grated, 2 smashed) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup drained jarred roasted red peppers 1 cup fresh basil 3 sticks mozzarella string cheese, halved lengthwise 2 bunches kale (preferably Tuscan) 1/2 cup drained jarred giardiniera Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high and lightly oil the grates. Butterfly the pork: Slice almost in half lengthwise, stopping about 1/2 inch from cutting through; open like a book and flatten with your hands. Cover with plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2 inch thick with the flat side of a meat mallet or a heavy skillet. Rub the pork with the grated garlic and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the red peppers on top of the pork in a single layer, then the basil and mozzarella, leaving a 1-inch border on one long side. Roll up from the opposite long side into a tight log and tie with kitchen twine in three or four places. Rub with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Grill the pork, covered and turning occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the meat (not the filling) registers 145 degrees F, 12 to 14 minutes. Let rest about 5 minutes, then slice. Meanwhile, strip the kale leaves from the stems and tear into pieces. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the kale, smashed garlic and a big pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook, tossing, until the kale is tender, about 5 minutes. Roughly chop the giardiniera and stir into the kale until heated through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Divide among plates and serve with the pork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 24792,&quot;Sole Roulade with Black Olive Paste, Roast Pepper, Capers and Basil 2 red peppers 4 sole filets, 6 ounces each 1 tablespoon black olive paste 6 ounces dry white wine 1 lemon 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed 4 ounces canned tomato juice 1 tablespoon olive oil plus 1 teaspoon 1 tablespoon basil chiffonade Instructions: Roast 2 lightly oiled and seasoned red peppers in a saute pan on the bottom of a 400 degree oven. Turn every few minutes until all sides are fairly charred, about 12 minutes. Place peppers in a plastic bag to loosen skin. When cool, peel and discard stem and seeds. Cut into sections about 4 inches by 1 1/2 inches. Place each sole filet, whiter side down on, on cutting board. Cover with double layered plastic wrap and pound lightly with the smooth side of a mallet or heavy knife to thin out fish some without tearing it. Spread black olive paste lightly onto each filet, and lay down one red pepper strip per filet. Roll each filet fairly tight from thin end (tail) to head (thicker end). Season roulades and poach in 2 ounces white wine, juice and strips of zest of one lemon, capers, tomato juice and 4 ounces cold water. Bring to boil, then simmer covered 10 to 12 minutes. When fish appears cooked whisk in 1 teaspoon olive oil and basil chiffonade.

Bring the water to a boil until the potatoes are easily pierced with a skewer (30 minutes) do not over cook. Drain potatoes and let stand until cool enough to handle. Scrape the skin off the potatoes with a paring knife. Press the peeled potato through a ricer. Spread the riced potatoes into a thin even layer on a work surface. Let cool completely. In a small bowl, beat the egg, salt, pepper, and nutmeg together. Gather the cold potatoes into a mound and form a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well. Knead the potato and egg mixture together with both hands, gradually adding the grated cheese and enough flour, about 1 1/2 cups, to form a smooth but slightly sticky dough. It should take no longer than 3 minutes to work the flour. Use a knife or dough scraper to scrape the sticky dough from the work surface back into the dough as you knead. Wash and dry hands. Dust the dough, your hands and work surface lightly with remaining flour. Cut the dough into 6 pieces and set off to 1 side of the work surface. With 1 piece of dough, form a long rope using your hands in a back and forth motion. Slice the rope into 1/2-inch pieces. Press each piece into the tip of a fork, with your thumb roll the gnocchi off the fork. Set on a baking sheet with flour. Cook immediately in boiling salted water. They are cooked when they rise to the surface, about 1 minute. Toss in Creamy Lemon Sauce and serve. Saute the minced garlic in butter on medium heat. Add the flour. Cook for 1 minute. Add the cream and lemon zest. After the gnocchi are cooked, toss in the sauce then top with Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 24794,&quot;Cuban Corn 9 ears corn 8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, melted 1 tablespoon paprika 2 tablespoons chili powder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup queso fresco, finely grated 1 bunch cilantro, stemmed and roughly chopped 2 limes, cut into wedges Instructions: Soak corn, in its husk, in water for 1 to 2 hours. Preheat grill to medium-high. Carefully peel back the husks leaving them attached at the base and remove the silk. In a medium bowl, combine the melted butter, paprika, chili powder, and season well with salt and pepper. Using a pastry brush, brush the ears of corn with the butter mixture and place on a hot grill. Be careful to leave the husks off the hottest part of the grill rack so that they do not start to burn. Grill corn on all sides until well marked and tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with grated queso fresco and cilantro and serve with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 24795,&quot;Chocolate-Dipped Strawberries 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips 3 tablespoons heavy cream 12 long-stemmed strawberries Instructions: Melt the chocolate and cream together in a bowl set over simmering water until just melted.

Add onion and cook until softened, adding more water as needed, about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and apple and stir in the broth. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until potatoes are very soft, about 45 minutes. Puree the potato/apple/broth mixture in a blender, then stir in the chopped candy and blend. Return the mixture back to the saucepan. Add the milk, sherry, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

When the water boils, add the salt to the water and then add the green beans. Cook for 4 minutes. Prepare an ice bath: Fill a large bowl halfway with ice cubes and add some cold water. Place a colander squarely inside the ice bath. The colander will keep you from having to pick the beans out from amongst the ice cubes in the ice bath. When the beans are cooked, remove them from the hot water with a strainer and transfer them to the colander inside the ice bath. Use a spoon to swirl the beans around in the ice bath so they are sure to cool down immediately. Drain and set aside. For the mushroom base: In a 10-inch cast iron skillet, melt the butter and add the mushrooms. Season with salt, to taste, and add the cayenne and mustard. Stir to blend and cook until the mushrooms give off most of their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Using a whisk, add the garlic and flour to the mushrooms. When all of the flour has been incorporated, add the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer. Taste for seasoning. Stir in the cream and sour cream and simmer gently. Continue cooking over low heat until the mixture thickens, 12 to 15 minutes. For the shallots: Pour the oil into a medium frying pan. Heat to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the flour and cayenne. Toss the shallot rounds in the flour and shake off the excess by shaking the rounds in a strainer once they have been floured. Test the oil by dropping in 1 shallot slice. It should begin to bubble and fry gradually. Prepare a baking sheet fitted with a kitchen towel. Drop a small batch of the shallots into the oil and gently swirl the oil as they fry. This will help them they fry more evenly on all sides. When they are light to medium brown, remove them with a slotted spoon and lay them out on the kitchen towel to cool. Sprinkle with a touch of salt. To assemble: Stir the green beans and some of the shallots into the mushrooms. Simmer on the stove, over low heat until the green beans become tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 10 to 15 minutes. When ready to serve, top with all of the remaining shallots. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 24798,&quot;Hot Fried Chicken with Iceberg-Pickle Slaw Four 6-ounce boneless skinless chicken breasts 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon sweet paprika 1 tablespoon cayenne 1/2 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon dill pickle powder (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar powder 1/4 cup canola oil, plus more for frying 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 4 hamburger buns, split Iceberg Pickle Slaw, recipe follows 1/2 cup olive oil 1/4 cup chopped dill pickles plus 1/4 cup pickle juice 1 teaspoon Dijon 1 teaspoon honey 4 cups shredded iceberg lettuce 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Pound the chicken breasts with a meat mallet until they are 1/2 inch thick. Slice the breasts in half, then add to a large resealable plastic bag. Mix the onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne and 1/2 tablespoon salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle half of the spice mixture over the chicken in the bag, add dill pickle powder and vinegar powder, seal the bag and shake and massage the spices into the meat evenly. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 cup oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the remaining spice mix. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a small heatproof bowl and reserve. In another large resealable plastic bag or paper bag, combine the flour with the black pepper and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add enough oil to a cast-iron or other heavy skillet to come 1/2 inch up the sides. Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches 365 degrees F. The oil\u2019s ready when a little flour dropped in bubbles and sizzles steadily. Add the chicken to the paper bag in batches and shake well until the pieces are evenly coated. Remove the chicken from the flour, shaking off excess. Carefully place the chicken in the oil. Repeat, adding just a few more pieces to the pan. You don\u2019t want to crowd the pan. Keep adjusting the heat to keep a steady sizzle and to maintain 365 degrees F. Cook until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes, then carefully turn each piece over. Cook until browned on the second side, about 3 minutes, then continue cooking and turning to evenly brown until cooked through, about 10 minutes total. Crumple up some paper towels and drain the chicken on them. Repeat with the remaining chicken, replenishing and reheating the oil between batches. Drizzle with the reserved spice oil. Repeat the breading and frying process with the remaining chicken if necessary. Spread the mayo on the hamburger buns and toast in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Starting with the bottom hamburger buns, top with the hot fried chicken and some Iceberg-Pickle Slaw. Cover with the bun tops. Whisk together the oil, chopped pickles, pickle juice, Dijon and honey in a large bowl. Add the iceberg lettuce; toss gently to coat. Season with salt and pepper.

Drain and rinse all liquid off beans. Combine beans in a bowl and set aside. Begin cooking bacon in a saute pan. Begin roasting yams in preheated oven until soft, and remove to let cool enough to handle. Heat olive oil in another large saute pan for the lamb. Season the rack of lamb with salt and pepper. Place lamb into hot pan and sear meat all around. Remove bacon to drain on paper toweling. In same pan lightly saute onion and garlic in bacon fat until translucent. Add red wine and reduce by half. Place the lamb in a roasting pan and roast in the oven until done to your liking, about 15 to 20 minutes for medium rare, an internal temperature of 125 degrees F (this means that because of the 5 to 8 minutes of carryover cooking while it rests, you pull it out at 120 degrees F so it will end up at 125 degrees F for medium rare). When yams are cool enough to handle, peel off skin and add butter and cream and mash. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Remove the lamb to a utility platter and let rest before slicing. Add demi-glace and tomato paste to the pan with the onion, garlic, and bacon fat, then incorporate all beans with mixture. Lower heat and simmer. Add rosemary and chives.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the wine, chicken stock, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, 2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil to make an emulsion. Set aside. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them into quarters or halves, depending on their size. Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl and pour enough dressing over them to moisten. (As the salad sits, you may need to add more dressing.) Add the onion, tarragon and parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss well, cover, and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.

With a ladle, slowly lower the eggs into the water, one by one. Reduce the heat to a low boil and cook for 10 minutes. Drain. When they are cool enough to handle, peel the eggs. Slice each egg in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks and place them in a food processor. Arrange the whites, cut-side up, on a serving platter. Blitz the egg yolks by themselves for about 10 seconds. To the yolks, add the mayo, mustard, capers, salt, pepper, garlic and lemon zest. Process until well blended and smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Transfer the mixture to a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag, then use scissors to snip off the tip of one of the bottom corners to form a small hole. Pipe the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites or store the egg whites and yolk mixture separately in the fridge until ready to fill and serve, one to two days. Garnish the filled eggs with paprika and parsley and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24811,&quot;Sausage Pan Pizza 1 1/2 cups warm water 4 1/2 teaspoons sugar 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 envelope) active dry yeast 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for the bowl 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 cups bread flour, plus more as needed 1 3/4 cups whole-wheat flour 8 ounces pork sausage, removed from casing 6 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup tomato sauce 1 bunch kale, stemmed and chopped 8 ounces shredded mozzarella 3 ounces Parmesan, grated 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked Zest of 1/2 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Crushed red pepper flakes, as needed Instructions: For the dough: In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix together the water, sugar and yeast. Let it sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer running on low speed, add the oil and salt, then gradually add the bread and whole-wheat flours. Increase the speed to medium high and mix, adding just enough additional bread flour so that the dough no longer sticks to the bowl, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky, 7 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, mix by hand and knead on a lightly floured surface.) Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn it once or twice to coat it in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free place for 2 hours or in the refrigerator overnight. For the pizza: If the dough was refrigerated, let the dough sit at room temperature for about an hour before shaping. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Place a 14-inch cast-iron pan into the oven to preheat while you prepare your other ingredients. Add the sausage to a medium pan over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking it up into crumbly pieces, until browned throughout and no longer pink, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside. Flour a work surface and rolling pin, then roll out the dough to a 14-inch round. Remove the cast-iron pan from the oven and drizzle with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil to coat. Carefully place the dough into the pan and push the edges up against the side of the pan. Drizzle the dough with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Top with the tomato sauce in an even layer. Then, sprinkle on the kale, sausage, mozzarella, grated Parmesan, thyme, lemon zest and some salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes. Bake until the crust is golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then slice and serve straight from the pan! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 24812,&quot;Healthy Air Fryer Baked Pineapple Upside-Down Oatmeal Nonstick cooking spray 1/2 pineapple, peeled and cored 1/3 cup packed plus 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 4 frozen pitted cherries, thawed, rinsed and drained<br> 2 3/4 cups old-fashioned oats 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cups 2-percent milk or plant-based milk 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract 2 large eggs Instructions: Spray an 8-by-8-inch baking dish without handles with nonstick cooking spray. Slice the pineapple into four 1/4-inch-thick rings and cut the remaining pineapple into small dice. Measure out 1/2 cup diced pineapple and set aside, reserving the rest for another use. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar over the bottom of the prepared baking dish and arrange the pineapple slices in a square in the dish. Place a cherry in the center of each pineapple ring. Combine the oats, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar, milk, melted butter, vanilla extract, almond extract, and eggs in a separate bowl. Pour over the oat mixture and stir to combine. Fold in the chopped pineapple. Spoon the oatmeal mixture over the pineapple rings, spreading to cover. Cook in a 6-quart air fryer at 325 degrees F until puffed and golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes (see Cook\u2019s Note). Let cool in the baking dish for 5 minutes, then gently loosen the sides with a butter knife and flip the baked oatmeal out onto a cutting board, to reveal the pineapple slices.

Let sponge, allowing the gelatin to absorb the water, about 3 minutes. While the tea is still hot, add the sponged gelatin, sugar and honey and whisk until dissolved. Set aside and let the gelatin relax and mature and cool at the same rate as the liquid so it doesn&#39;t separate when chilling. Place the berries in a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan or divide them among individual molds. Pour in the peach liquid. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 3 hours. To make the garnish: Whisk the egg white in a bowl to break up the tightness of the albumin. Spread the sugar out in a shallow bowl. Dip herb sprigs (the tops) and leaves (the larger bottom ones) in the egg white, shake them off a bit then dredge in the sugar. Set on a wire rack to dry a few minutes or overnight. When ready to serve, dip the bottom of the pan into hot water for 10 seconds. Flip the terrine out onto a serving platter and garnish with the herb sprigs.

Add the butter and pulse a few times until the mixture looks like coarse meal with some pea-size bits of butter. Drizzle in the vinegar and 3 tablespoons ice water, then pulse a few more times until the dough starts to clump together. Pinch the dough with your fingers: If it doesn\u2019t hold together, add up to 1 more tablespoon ice water, a little at a time. Turn out the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and press into a 6-inch disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 13-inch round. Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim any overhanging dough, then crimp the edges with your fingers. Refrigerate the crust at least 1 hour before filling and baking. Preheat the oven to 350? F. Make the filling: Combine the cranberries, almonds, 1/2 cup brown sugar, the cinnamon, allspice and salt in a bowl and toss until evenly coated. Spread the mixture in the crust. Beat the egg in a medium bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light in color and thick like whipped cream, about 5 minutes. Beat in the remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar and the granulated sugar, then beat in the flour, melted butter and almond extract; the batter should be the consistency of cake batter. Dollop spoonfuls of the batter over the cranberry filling, leaving gaps in between. Bake the pie until the batter is golden brown and the crust is browned and cooked through, 50 to 55 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely.

Brush each parchment-lined baking sheet with about 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Place the mushroom slices in a single layer, very close together, on the parchment and brush lightly with the remaining vegetable oil. Bake the mushrooms until slightly softened and brown, 25 to 30 minutes, then flip the mushrooms over, rotate the pans in the oven and bake until the mushrooms are well-browned and the edges are crispy, another 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to the paper-towel lined baking sheet to dry for a few minutes. (Leave the oven on.) In a large bowl, whisk together the molasses, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder and paprika. Carefully toss the baked mushrooms in the marinade until evenly coated. Place half the marinated mushroom strips in a single layer (it&#39;s ok of they overlap) into a large metal steamer basket or colander that fits snugly into a large, heavy metal pot. Prepare a stovetop smoker: Line the bottom of a large, heavy metal pot with foil. Place two large handfuls of applewood chips in the bottom of the pot. Place the pot over medium heat and use a lighter to light a few of the wood chips. Once the chips are smoking, place the mushroom-filled steamer basket or colander inside the pot, then place a tight-fitting lid on top. Allow the mushrooms to smoke for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how strong of a smoky flavor you want. Repeat with the second batch. After the mushrooms are smoked, return them to the baking sheets in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and a few grinds of pepper and return to the oven until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat in a low oven before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24819,&quot;Red cl Pork Tamales 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 medium onion, chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br> 6 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded<br> 3 dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded<br> 3 dried pasilla chiles, stemmed and seeded<br> 2 teaspoons ground cumin<br> 2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano<br> 6 cloves garlic<br> 2 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, fat trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 32 dried corn husks<br> 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar<br> 10 ounces lard, such as Manteca 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon cl powder<br> Kosher salt<br> 4 cups masa harina (instant corn flour) for tamales, such as Maseca Tamal<br> 2 1/2 to 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br> Lime wedges, for serving, optional<br> Instructions: For the braised pork: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds black pepper and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth and guajillo, ancho and pasilla chiles and bring to a boil. Cover, turn off the heat and let sit until the chiles have softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a blender with the cumin, oregano, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds black pepper and puree until very smooth. Pour the sauce back into the Dutch oven, then add the pork and bay leaves. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium low to maintain a steady simmer and cook until the pork is very tender and the sauce is brick red, 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours.<br> Meanwhile, soak the corn husks in a bowl of hot water, using a plate to keep them submerged, until pliable, about 1 hour.<br> Discard the bay leaves from the pork, then shred the pork with 2 forks. Stir in the apple cider vinegar; taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper. Set aside to cool slightly.<br> For the masa dough: Beat the lard, baking powder, cl powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and light in texture, about 2 minutes. (Alternatively, use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.) Reduce the speed to low and add the masa harina. Once just incorporated, slowly add 2 1/2 cups of the chicken broth and mix until combined, 2 to 4 minutes. Test the dough by placing a 1/2-teaspoon dollop in a cup of cold water--it should float. If not, add the remaining 1/2 cup broth and mix until combined, about 2 minutes more. This will ensure that the masa dough is light and fluffy.<br> Drain the husks and pat dry. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end of a husk, spread about 3 tablespoons of the masa dough down the length of the husk, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Spoon 2 heaping tablespoons of the pork filling down the center of the dough, then fold in the sides of the husk, wrapping the dough around the filling. Fold up the narrow end of the husk. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and filling.<br> Set a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 to 2 inches of water. Arrange the tamales standing open-end up in the steamer. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover and steam until the dough is firm, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the steamer and cool slightly before unwrapping.

Now, go for it: Slowly drizzle your oil into the mix while all the flavors are spinning around and mingling (like you did at last year&#39;s holiday party). Don&#39;t go too fast though! The sauce may break, and there&#39;s no return from that. Be gentle. But make it thick. Thick is good. Transfer to a mixing bowl and fold together all of that mayo goodness with your ketchup. You&#39;re done! Make the fried rice now, and everything will be okay. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) For the cheeseburger fried rice: Add oil and onions to a hot wok and cook until golden brown and delicious. Add cooked bacon and browned ground beef. Bring some of the reserved bacon fat into the wok and add the jasmine rice. With an aggressive approach, mix, stir, rake, swirl, toss... whatever it takes to bring that rice back to life. Make sure every grain has been given some bacon-fat lovin&#39; and nothing is sticking to the wok, until the rice has been fried and is completely alive again. Show it some respect by seasoning with mushroom seasoning and sugar. Not too much? but not too little. Taste this beautiful creation. It is delicious. If desired, add more mushroom seasoning. Toss in lettuce and tomatoes and mix just until incorporated; not wilted but not raw. For the garnish: Build this beauty like you would any other cheeseburger.

It is recommended that habaneros be handled with disposable plastic gloves. Do not touch eyes or other sensitive areas until you wash hands and utensils well. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a medium bowl, mix the sugar and spices well, breaking up any lumps of sugar. With a mixer or whisk, blend the pumpkin into the sugar and spice mixture. Beat eggs separately, then add to the pumpkin mixture along with the evaporated milk and vanilla. Blend well. Blend the minced habanero peppers into pumpkin mixture evenly. Pour into a 9-inch pie crust and place in oven. A pie skirt may be placed underneath to catch spills. Bake at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375 degrees, and continue baking for 40 to 45 minutes, until set and evenly browned. Cool completely on a rack before serving. Serving this pie with plenty of whipped cream will contrast well with the heat. This recipe may be varied by adding 1/2-teaspoon nutmeg. Also, instead of vanilla extract, maple flavoring or cinnamon extract may be substituted. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 24833,&quot;Sorghum Pilaf 1 1/2 cups cooked whole-grain sorghum 1/2 sweet onion 2 teaspoons olive oil 1/4 cup pine nuts Salt Instructions: Heat the sorghum in a microwave-safe bowl for 2 minutes.

Presoak 12 bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes. For the glaze: Combine the butter, pineapple juice, rum, sugar, tomato paste and vinegar in a small saucepan and simmer until reduced and the glaze has a texture like maple syrup, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool slightly so it thickens up even more. For the meatballs: Set a small saute pan over high heat. Coat with a little olive oil and saute the garlic and shallots until caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with some salt and pepper. Set aside to cool. In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and cream and set aside to soak. In a large mixing bowl, combine the beef, pork, cooled shallot and garlic mixture, currants, Parmesan, pine nuts and moistened breadcrumbs. Sprinkle with some salt and pepper and mix well. Form into 36 (about 1 1/2-inch) meatballs and thread 3 meatballs per skewer. Set a wire rack over a baking sheet lined with foil and spray with nonstick spray. Arrange the skewers on the rack and bake in the center of the oven until the meatballs are just barely cooked but will hold their shape on the grill, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven. Heat a grill to high and wipe down with an oil blotted paper towel to clean and create a nonstick surface. Place the skewers on the grill and char for about 30 seconds per side. Once they are browned, brush with the glaze and cook until the glaze is shiny and lightly coats the meatballs, 30 to 40 seconds more. Serve with any remaining glaze on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 24839,&quot;Macarons 1 cup plus 2 tbsp/4 1/2oz/125g confectioners&#39; sugar generous 1 1/3 cups/125g/4 1/2oz ground almonds 1 1/2oz/40g egg whites 2 tbsp water generous 1/2cup/4oz/110g superfine sugar 2oz/50g egg whites Food coloring (optional) Shredded coconut, for sprinkling (optional) 2/3 cup/5floz/150ml heavy or whipped cream, whipped Pastry bag fitted with a 1/2in (1cm) tip Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the confectioners&#39; sugar, ground almonds, and 1 1/2oz (40g) egg whites together in a large bowl and mix to a paste. Put the water and superfine sugar in a small pan and heat gently to melt the sugar, then turn up the heat and boil it until the mixture starts to go syrupy and thickens. I don&#39;t use a thermometer but it would read 239 degrees F (115 degrees C). Whisk the remaining egg whites in a small bowl until medium-stiff peaks form, then pour in the sugar syrup, whisking until the mixture becomes stiff and shiny. For colored macarons, add a few drops of food coloring. Tip this meringue mixture into the almond paste mixture and stir gently until the becomes stiff and shiny again. Spoon into the pastry bag. Pipe a little mixture under each corner of the parchment paper to stop it sliding around. With the bag held vertically, pipe 1 1/2in (4cm) flat circles onto the lined sheet, about 34 in (2cm) apart, twisting the bag after each one. The mixture should be quite loose to give a smooth finish. The piping will leave a small \tip\ on each circle so, when they&#39;re all piped, give the sheet 2 to 3 slams on a flat surface to flatten them. At this stage, sprinkle with shredded coconut if you want. Let stand for 30 minutes to form a skin, then bake in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes with the door slightly ajar, until firm. Remove from the oven, then lift the paper off the baking sheet and let the macarons cool on the paper. When cool, sandwich the macarons together with whipped cream. They can be kept for a couple of days, if they hang around that long. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24840,&quot;Late Summer Tomato Bruschetta 1 loaf day old country bread 6 whole canned tomatoes 6 roughly torn basil leaves 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic, peeled Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan.

Toss to coat, then set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature. For the sauce: Meanwhile, combine the gochujang, sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, sesame oil, gochugaru, garlic and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat and cook until the garlic is fragrant and the sauce is slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the rice vinegar. Set the sauce aside.<br> For the batter: Fill a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot with 3 to 4 inches of oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F.<br> Whisk the flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, curry powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups cold water and whisk until the batter is smooth and very thin (about the consistency of half-and-half). If needed, add more cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin the batter.<br> Remove about a third of the chicken wings from the soju marinade and dip in the batter, letting any excess drip off. Then, using tongs, hold the chicken halfway in the hot oil for 1 to 2 seconds before letting go completely, as this prevents the wings from sticking to the bottom. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a temperature between 300 and 325 degrees F. Stir occasionally to prevent the wings from sticking. Fry the wings until the coating is crisp but not browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove to a rack set on a baking sheet to drain. Let the oil temperature return to 350 degrees F. Dredge and fry the remaining chicken wings in 2 batches.<br> Remove any floating debris and cooked batter from the oil with a hand-held strainer. Increase the oil temperature to 375 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the chicken again until the coating is browned and very crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature above 350 degrees F. Remove the wings with tongs and transfer to a clean rack set on a baking sheet. Let stand for 1 minute to allow the coating to set. Brush all over with the sauce.

Add the pork tenderloins and turn to coat with the marinade. Squeeze out the air and seal the bag. Marinate the pork in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours but preferably overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the tenderloins from the marinade and discard the marinade but leave the herbs that cling to the meat. Sprinkle the tenderloins generously with salt and pepper. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large oven-proof saute pan over medium-high heat. Sear the pork tenderloins on all sides until golden brown. Place the saute pan in the oven and roast the tenderloins for 10 to 15 minutes or until the meat registers 137 degrees F at the thickest part. Transfer the tenderloins to a platter and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Carve in 1/2-inch-thick diagonal slices. The thickest part of the tenderloin will be quite pink (it&#39;s just fine!) and the thinnest part will be well done.

Divide the skins in the water and cook for 4 minutes in each pot before draining. This process removes bitterness from the skin. Combine the sugar, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon and 2 1/2 cups water in one of the pots from boiling the oranges and submerge the blanched orange skins. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium-low heat for 45 minutes. (Do not allow the syrup to brown or discolor.) Drain the skins of any excess syrup (reserve the syrup for another use, such as for cocktails) and place them in a single layer on a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack. Cover and allow them to sit overnight. Cut them into strips. Make the sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together the soy sauce, honey, lime juice, garlic and 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil over medium heat until the sauce reduces slightly, about 10 minutes. For the stir-fry: In a large heavy-bottomed skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon canola oil over medium heat. When the oil begins to smoke, add the mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook until they soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the skillet.

Peel the mangoes with a paring knife. One at a time, set each mango on its side on a cutting board and cut the flesh away from the large flat seed in the center. Place the largest 2 pieces from each mango in a medium bowl (set the rest of the flesh aside for another use). Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat and cook until it turns nut brown. Add the Toasted Spice Rub and salt. Remove the skillet from the heat. Pour or brush the butter mixture over the mangoes and toss well to coat them. Grill the mango slices (only on the flat, cut side) over medium-high heat until nicely marked, 3 to 5 minutes. While mangoes are grilling, cut the blue cheese into 1-inch pieces. Remove the mango slices from the grill and spread them on a baking sheet, with the grilled sides facing up. Divide the cheese on top of the mango slices. Place under the broiler for 30 seconds to weep the cheese (optional step). Be careful not to get the mango too hot. Arrange on a platter or individual plates. In a heat-proof bowl, warm the honey briefly in the microwave and drizzle over the top. Serve warm. 1/4 cup fennel seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon peppercorns 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1/4 cup pure California chili powder 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan; add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Toasting freshens spices, releases their oils, and makes them more fragrant, as well as adding a new dimension of flavor. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. Taste your chili powder and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chiles are almost sweet, not hot.

Drop the meat into the bag and move it around to evenly coat it. Let stand 10 to 12 minutes. Preheat a grill pan or indoor/outdoor grill to high. Thinly slice 1 1/2 onions and reserve 1/2 onion whole but peeled. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons butter and melt it. Add the sliced onions to the pan. Peel, core and slice the apple and add it to the onions. Season the apples and onions with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cook the apples and onions 5 or 6 minutes, then add cooked red cabbage and combine then reduce heat to low. Set aside and keep warm. Place meat on grill and let a bay leaf remain stuck on each steak. As the meat cooks, the heat will infuse the flavor throughout the meat. Cook steaks about 6 minutes on each side. Then, let meat rest. Discard leaves. While meat cooks, place potatoes in a pot and cover with water, bring water to a boil then salt it. Cook potatoes 10 to 12 minutes or until tender. Drain potatoes and return to the hot pot. Mash them with sour cream, horseradish and chives and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Potatoes will be thick and spicy. If you like looser mashed potatoes, add a little milk or stock, continue to smash. While potatoes cook, remove the red cabbage to a serving bowl and cover with foil. In the same skillet that the cabbage was cooked in, add 2 tablespoons butter. Melt butter then grate the reserved 1/2 onion with a hand held grater into the butter. Cook the grated onions 2 minutes then add flour and cook a minute more. Whisk in red wine and cook off a minute then whisk in stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in mustard and gingersnaps and season the sauce with salt and pepper. Let sauce thicken a couple of minutes. Thinly slice the flank steak on an angle against the grain. Place a mound of potatoes on each dinner plate. Lay out some sliced flank steak along the edge of potatoes and dress with a ladle of sauer-sauce. Serve red cabbage, apples and onions alongside or in small side dishes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 24888,&quot;Sizzling Snapper with Diablo Sauce 1/4 pound tomatoes (1/2 medium-large round or 2 to 3 plum) 5 chiles guajillos, stemmed and seeded 3 chiles costenos rojos, stemmed and seeded, or 3 chiles de arbol 1/4 medium white onion, thickly sliced 5 garlic cloves 1 teaspoon fresh Oaxacan oregano or 1/2 teaspoon dried 2 whole allspice 3 black peppercorns 2 tablespoons white vinegar 1 1/2 teaspoons Worchestershire sauce 1 teaspoon butter 1 teaspoon sunflower or vegetable oil 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste 2 large banana leaves, fresh, or (substitute frozen) approximately 1/2 pound 2 1/2 pounds whole sea bass, red snapper or striped bass, butterflied or fillets 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) soft butter, to coat the foil and fish Salt and pepper mixed, to sprinkle on fish 3 tablespoons Worchestershire sauce 3 tablespoons Maggi sauce 1/2 pound tomatoes (1 medium-large round or 4 to 5 plum) thinly sliced 1/2 medium white onion, thinly sliced 5 bay leaves 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley leaves Instructions: In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Cut an \x\ in the bottom of the tomatoes. Place the tomatoes in the boiling water and boil for 5 minutes. Remove the tomatoes from the pot and reserve the water. When tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skins. On a dry comal, griddle or in a cast-iron frying pan, toast the chiles until they give off their aroma. Place in a bowl and cover with reserved tomato water. Soak for 20 minutes. Remove chiles from the water. Reserve the water. On the same comal, roast the onion and garlic for 8 to 10 minutes over medium heat or until transparent. Place the chiles, tomatoes, onion, garlic, oregano, allspice, peppercorns, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender. Blend well with 1/2 cup cl soaking water. Pour through a strainer to remove the skins. In a medium frying pan, heat the butter and oil. Pour in the cl mixture add the bay leaf. Fry for 5 minutes. Add salt. Holding the banana leaves with tongs, pass the leaves over a gas flame to soften them. If you don&#39;t have a flame handy, you can boil them until soft, about 20 minutes, covered. Remove and set aside. Heat a long griddle that covers 2 burners until very hot. Open the fish so it is lying flat, skin side down. Cut a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil twice the size of the fish. Totally butter one half of the foil. Place the banana leaf on the buttered portion of the foil. Lay the fish skin side down, on top of the leaf. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the fish. Spoon 1/4 cup of the salsa del diablo over the fish. Sprinkle the Worcestershire and Maggi sauce over the fish, including the head. Dot butter over the fish. Add the tomato and onion slices. Add the bay leaves and parsley. Cover the fish with the banana leaf. Pull the foil over the top of the fish and seal by folding over the edges. It is important to have a good seal on all 3 edges, so the steam does not escape during cooking process. Carefully move fish over to the grill and cook for 10 minutes. The foil should fully puff up in the process. Watch the foil to make sure that the steam is not escaping. If it is, reseal the fish. Serve immediately with totadas or totopos. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 24889,&quot;Gulf Shrimp with Peanuts and Green cl Slices with Dirty Rice 2 tablespoons olive oil 24 medium Gulf shrimp, shell removed and deveined 1 poblano pepper, quartered and thinly sliced 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 4 cups shrimp stock, recipe follows 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/4 cup chopped cilantro Salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup chopped peanuts Dirty Rice, recipe follows 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cups shells and tails from raw shrimp 1 large onion, coarsely chopped 1 small carrot, coarsely chopped 1/2 medium celery stalk, coarsely chopped 6 cups water 1 cup white wine 1 ripe medium tomato, chopped or 1/2 cup canned plum tomatoes 1 bay leaf 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound chicken livers 1 large red onion, finely diced 1 yellow pepper, finely diced 1 red pepper finely diced 1 stalk celery, finely diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 serrano cl, finely diced 2 cups long grain rice 4 1/2 cups home-made chicken stock or low sodium canned stock 2 tablespoons maple syrup Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat leaf parsley 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme Instructions: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat.

Combine the levain and water in a 6-quart bowl. Break up the levain well with a wooden spoon or squeeze through your fingers until it is broken up. Continue stirring until the levain is partially dissolved and the mixture is slightly frothy. Add 1 cup (5 ounces) of the flour and stir until well combined. Add the salt and just enough of the remaining flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding remaining flour when needed, until dough is firm and smooth, 15 to 17 minutes total. The dough is ready when a little dough pulled from the mass springs back quickly. Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly floured surface while you scrape, clean, and lightly oil the large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn once to coat with oil. Take the dough&#39;s temperature, the ideal is 78 degrees. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees F) draft-free place until increased in volume about 1/4 to 1/2. This dough will not behave like an ordinary yeasted bread dough. It won&#39;t rise to a puffy state. Deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling up on the sides. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly. Shape into a tight ball and place on a lightly floured board. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degree) draft-free place for 30 minutes. Flatten the ball with the heel of your hand on a lightly floured work surface into a disk. Shape into an oblong loaf about 14 inches long. Place the loaf seam side up in a well-floured couche*. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees F) draft-free place until almost doubled in volume, or until a slight indentation remains when the dough is pressed with a fingertip. This dough gets softer, lighter, and very delicate as it proofs?more so than any other dough in this book. After 4 hours there will be a pronounced difference between the dough you set in the couche and the final light dough. Preheat the oven and baking stone to 450 degrees, 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking. The oven rack must be in the center of the oven. If it is in the lower 1/3 of the oven the bottom of the breads may burn, and if it is in the upper 1/3, the top crusts may burn. Using the couche as an aid, gently roll the loaf from the couche onto a lightly floured peel so that it sits seam side down. Using a very sharp, serrated knife or a single-edged razor blade, score the loaf by making quick shallow cuts 1/4 to 1/2-inch deep along the surface. Using the peel, slide the loaf onto the hearth. Quickly spray the inner walls and floor of the oven with cold water from a spritzer bottle. If there&#39;s an electric light bulb in the oven, avoid spraying it directly?it may burst. Spray for several seconds until steam has filled the oven. Quickly close the door to trap the steam and bake 3 minutes. Spray again in the same way, closing the door immediately so that steam doesn&#39;t escape. Bake until the loaf begins to color, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 400 degrees and continue baking until deep golden in color and the crust is firm, 20 to 25 minutes. To test the loaf for doneness, remove and hold the loaf upside down. Strike the bottom firmly with your finger. If the sound is hollow, the bread is done. If it doesn&#39;t sound hollow, bake 5 minutes longer. Cool completely on a wire rack. Note: If the dough temperature is higher than 78 degrees, put it in a cooler than (78 degree F) place like the refrigerator, until the dough cools to 78 degrees. If it is lower than 78 degrees, put in it a warmer than 78 degree place until the dough warms to 78 degrees. The point is to try to keep the dough at 78 degrees during its fermentation. If you do have to move the dough, be gentle and don&#39;t jostle it, or the dough may deflate. *Couche?French for \couch\ or \resting place. This is a simple holding device you make yourself for proofing long loaves like logs, torpedo shapes, and baguettes. Using well-floured canvas or linen towels create folds to separate loaves while hold them securely next to each other during proofing. Use a length of fabric at least a yard long. Place 12 to 16-inch wooden blocks cut from 2 by 4&#39;s at either long end to contain the loaves. Or substitute large books to contain the loaves. Add the flour directly into the container with the full batch of room-temperature, batterlike ripe chef. Stir vigorously to add fresh oxygen to the mixture. This will form a stiff consistency more like a stiff dough than a batter. This firm texture is important for ripening levain, because a dense rather than loose levain creates delicious sour bread without an overpowering tangy bite. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly, and let stand in a cool to moderate (about 70 degrees) draft-free place for 8 to 10 hours. The levain should have doubled in volume. The texture will be somewhat light, with many tiny bubbles throughout. Do not let the levain stand for longer than 10 hours, or the yeast will become exhausted and not raise the final dough. This recipe yields 18 ounces of levain. The Chef Day 1 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water Combine the flour and water in a tall 2 to 3-quart clear plastic container with a lid. Stir well to make a thick, soft dough. The exact consistency of the dough will vary with the brand of flour or water at this point to adjust the texture. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, cover tightly with lid and let stand in a moderate (about 70 degree) place for 24 hours. Day 2 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water The chef should have almost doubled in volume. You will see tiny bubbles on the surface, and you might notice a slight musty smell. Add the flour and water to the mixture and stir vigorously to distribute the fresh ingredients and add fresh oxygen to the chef. The texture will still be like a soft dough. You may add a little more flour or water to make this texture, if necessary. Scrape down the sides, cover, and place in a moderate (70 degree) draft-free place for 24 hours. Day 3 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water It will have almost doubled in volume and be quite bubbly. Add the flour and water, and stir well to make a thick batter. (You may have to add a little more water if your flour&#39;s absorption level is high). With a marker pen, mark the level of the chef on the side of the container. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly, and let stand in a moderate (70 degree) draft-free place for 24 hours. It should now be loose in texture, like a pancake batter. It will have doubled in volume from the last addition of flour and water. The chef may rise and fall, but as long as it doubles at some point during this last period, it&#39;s fine. You now have a fully ripe chef ready to transform into a levain. If you don&#39;t want to make the levain immediately, the chef can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]</p><p>These wines are all known for their light, fruity flavors and crisp acidity, which would complement the delicate, sour flavors of the pain au levain nicely.

Submerge the pork chops in the brine and let sit in the refrigerator until ready to cook, at least 30 minutes. Bring the chops to room temperature before cooking. Remove the chops from the brine, discarding the brine. For the chops: Preheat a cast iron pan. Roll the fat edge of each pork chop in the fennel pollen. Place the pork chops gently in the heated pan. Sear the chops on all sides and cook for about 9 minutes. Remove the chops from the pan and let rest in a warm place before serving. The doneness of the meat should be about medium to medium-well and be very juicy. For the fennel-fontina sausage: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Season the pork shoulder with the garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, fennel seed, and coriander. Grind the pork twice through the large grind of a stand mixer fitted with a meat grinder attachment. Gently stir in the cheese. Add the cold water and mix lightly. Stuff the ground pork into a casing using the sausage horn attachment to the stand mixer and twist off into evenly sized links. Transfer to a parchment-lined sheet pan and roast in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat a saute pan and drizzle with olive oil. Remove the sausages from the oven and brown them in the pan. For the Swiss chard: Coat a saute pan with olive oil. Toss in the garlic, red pepper flakes, bacon, and a couple drops olive oil. Bring the pan to medium heat. When the garlic is golden and very aromatic, remove it and discard. When the bacon has become crispy, toss in the Swiss chard stems and fennel and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, as needed, and season with salt. When the chicken stock has reduced, toss in the Swiss chard leaves and season with salt. Cook the leaves until they are just wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. For the polenta cakes: In a saucepan, combine the milk, water, bay leaf, and cayenne. Bring the mixture to a boil over low heat and season generously with salt. (Take the seasoning to the edge of too salty. To do this you must taste as you go. Polenta acts as a salt eraser, if you don&#39;t season abundantly here you will never recover from it.) Once the liquid is at a boil and is seasoned appropriately, sprinkle in the polenta, whisking constantly. Once the polenta is combined, switch over to a wooden spoon and stir frequently until the polenta has become thick. Taste the polenta to see if it has cooked through. If it still feels mealy and grainy, add some more milk or water and cook it to a thick consistency. Repeat this process, as needed, until the polenta feels smooth on your tongue, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and stir in the chopped sage and mascarpone. Line a 7 by 7-inch square pan with plastic wrap. Pour the polenta into the prepared pan. Cover the top with more plastic wrap smoothed onto the surface of the polenta. Chill in the refrigerator until needed. (All of this can totally be done ahead of time, like yesterday! Cool!) Remove the polenta from the pan and cut into desired shapes. Coat a nonstick saute pan with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot and starting to smoke just a little, add the polenta shapes. Cook the polenta on both sides and finish by sprinkling with a little bit of grated Parmigiano. For plating: Place 1 polenta cake on each plate and top with Swiss chard and bacon. Lean 1 chop on each polenta cake. Slice the sausages on the bias and plate 2 slices on each plate. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 24929,&quot;Soy Wasabi Mayonnaise 1 cup homemade or store-bought mayonnaise 2 tablespoons lime juice<br> 2 teaspoons soy sauce<br> 1 teaspoon wasabi paste<br> 1 teaspoon grated ginger<br> Instructions: In a medium bowl mix the mayonnaise, lime juice, soy sauce, wasabi paste and ginger, until well combined. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24930,&quot;Coriander Lime Grilled Chicken Legs 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 2 limes, zested 1 tablespoon toasted ground coriander 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves 2 tablespoons chopped scallions 1 tablespoon honey<br> 1 cup olive oil 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon ground white pepper 12 chicken legs Instructions: Put the lime juice, zest, coriander, cilantro, scallion and honey in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine.

Scatter butter pieces and sprinkle sugar evenly in a 9 to 10-inch copper tartin pan or heavy baking pan. Tightly pack apple halves around inside edge of pan, reserve 4, standing upright, nestled against one another, with round side tilted down. Place 4 remaining halves in similar position in center of pan. (Apples will shrink as they cook and slip round side down into pan.) Bake for about 2 hours. Transfer pan from oven to stove top and cook over medium-high heat until butter and sugar caramelize to a rich brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and gently ease sticky apples away from side of pan with a knife. Refrigerate overnight so that apples firm up and \confit\ further. For pastry, preheat oven to 350 degrees about 1 hour before serving tart. Sift flour, salt, and sugar into a bowl. Rub butter into flour mixture with your fingers until it resembles coarse crumbs.

Place tomatoes and rapini on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper and coat with 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Roast the vegetables until tender, then remove and allow to cool. Begin the Marsala sauce by heating 1/4 cup of the oil in a saute pan and cooking the shallots or onion gently until translucent. Deglaze the pan with the wine and add the stock and fresh thyme. Allow to reduce by 2/3. For the stuffed chicken, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay a long piece of plastic wrap over your cutting board and tuck it underneath the sides of the board. The chicken breasts should be placed on the covered cutting board, skin side down, with enough space between them so they can lay flat after you \butterfly\ them. To make the butterfly cut, carefully slice open (without slicing the chicken all the way through) and spread the flesh of the chicken out so you will be able to pound it out into a single thin piece on which you will place stuffing and then roll up. Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Then put another length of plastic wrap over the seasoned chicken breasts and flatten with meat mallet to integrate the seasoning into the chicken. (Covering the chicken with the plastic will also keep the mess down when you pound with the meat mallet.) Pound chicken thin and remove plastic. Lay sliced smoked mozzarella on each breast followed by broccoli rabe and roasted tomatoes. Fold in each end and roll tightly, securing with toothpicks as needed, and placing on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and brush with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place in the oven and roast until fork tender about 45 to 50 minutes. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet, season with salt and pepper, and coat with olive oil. Place in the oven and roast potatoes until they are also fork tender. Strain Marsala sauce and whisk in butter to finish. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Remove any toothpicks securing the chicken. Slice each chicken roll to reveal the stuffed interior. Place on serving plate with roasted potatoes. Spoon Marsala sauce around chicken. Garnish with chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 24985,&quot;Grilled Corn with Cheesy Taco-Spiced Butter 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup finely grated pecorino or Parmesan, plus more for serving 1 tablespoon taco seasoning Finely grated zest and juice of half lime 6 ears fresh corn, shucked 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons sea salt Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium heat. Combine the butter, pecorino, taco seasoning and lime zest and juice in a small bowl and mix until smooth. Set aside at room temperature. Put the corn on a baking sheet or platter and drizzle with the oil, turning to coat on all sides. Season with salt. Grill the corn, turning occasionally, until lightly charred on all sides and the kernels are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the cooked corn from the grill and spread the seasoned butter on top of each cob. Sprinkle each with more pecorino. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 24986,&quot;Orechiette with Sausage, Beans, and Mascarpone 1 pound orechiette pasta 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 pound turkey sausage, casing removed 1 small onion, chopped 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves 1/2 cup mascarpone cheese 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. In a large, heavy skillet warm the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and onions. Using a wooden spoon break up the sausage into bite-sized pieces as it browns. Continue cooking until the sausage is golden and the onions are tender. Add the beans and oregano cook for 2 more minutes. Add the cup of pasta cooking liquid and stir, scrapping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the mascarpone cheese and stir until it dissolved into a light sauce. Add the salt, pepper, and hot pasta. Stir until coated and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 24987,&quot;Fried Chicken with Honey-Pink Peppercorn Sauce</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/Combine the pork.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Combine%20the%20milk.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Combine the milk</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/cup%20Arborio%20rice.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>cup Arborio rice</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
