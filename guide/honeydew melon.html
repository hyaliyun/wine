and honey dew. Blend 1 minute or until honeydew and juices are smooth. Pour into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with an apple slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15568,&quot;Wilted Spinach with Butter and Wine 3 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces 1 1/2 pounds triple washed spinach, coarsely chopped, tough stems removed 2 cloves garlic, smashed 2 pinches of salt 1/2 cup dry white wine Salt and pepper Instructions: This dish takes only 5 minutes to prepare, so begin preheating the skillet 7-8 minutes before you are ready to sit down and eat. Heat a medium sized skillet over medium heat. With the flat side of your knife, make a garlic paste with smashed garlic and salt. Melt butter into pan. Add garlic paste to the pan and the spinach in bunches, adding more spinach to the pan as it wilts down. When all of the spinach is wilted, add wine and turn to coat. Let wine cook down a minute or 2. Season spinach with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 15569,&quot;Nori Rolls 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce 2 teaspoons honey 1 teaspoon grated garlic 1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger 1 pound extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips 2 cups short-grain brown rice 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 tablespoon extra-fine sugar 2 scallions, white part only, minced 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted 5 sheets nori (available in Asian-specialty sections) 1 cup finely shredded carrots 10 fresh spinach leaves, steamed and squeezed dry 1 1/2 cups alfalfa sprouts Instructions: In a deep, wide dish or pie plate, combine the soy sauce, honey, garlic and ginger. Add the tofu and let it marinate for at least an hour, turning it over half way through. Cook the rice according to the package. In a large glass or ceramic bowl, combine the rice vinegar and sugar. Add the hot rice in fourths, stirring the mixture well after each addition. Stir in the scallions and sesame seeds, mix well. For each roll, place a sheet of nori on a piece of wax paper so that the bottom edge of the nori lies along the bottom edge of the paper. Moisten your hands with cold water and place a handful of rice in the center of the nori, spread it out in a thin layer to fill the sheet evenly. Add more rice if necessary. Place 2 strips of tofu across the center of the nori, so they run the entire width of the sheet. Place a portion of the carrots on top of the tofu, some spinach over that, finishing with some sprouts (use about a fifth of each filling ingredient). Start rolling the nori from the bottom by gripping the nori and the wax paper, and using the paper to help you make a tight roll. Let the nori rest, seam side down, while you repeat the remaining procedure with the remaining rice and nori. You should have 5 rolls. To serve, wet the blade of a serrated knife and cut rolls into rounds about an inch thick. Serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15570,&quot;Chocolate-Dipped Ice Cream Cones 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces 1/4 cup coconut oil or vegetable shortening Kosher salt 8 small sugar cones 2 pints of your favorite ice cream 1/4 cup chopped nuts or toasted coconut or other topping Instructions: Make a cone holder: Find a small, sturdy, clean box that will fit in your freezer. Turn it over, and cut eight X&#39;s about 2 inches apart with a sharp knife. Open up each X with your fingers so it will securely hold an ice cream cone upright. Cook the chocolate, coconut oil and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until melted, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. Pour about 1 tablespoon of melted chocolate into a sugar cone, and swirl to completely coat the inside. Pour any excess chocolate back into the bowl. Place the cone in the cone holder. Repeat with the 7 remaining cones. Freeze the cones to set the chocolate, about 10 minutes. Fill each cone to the top with ice cream, and top with an additional 1/3-cup scoop. Return the cones to the cone holder, and freeze to harden the ice cream, about 30 minutes. Dip the cones: Put your desired topping in a small bowl. If the remaining chocolate starts to solidify, heat it in the microwave in 10-second increments, stirring in between, until it is fluid again. Dip each top scoop of ice cream in the chocolate to mostly cover it, leaving a little bit exposed. Let any excess chocolate drip off, then immediately dip the top scoop in the topping. Work quickly, as the chocolate shell sets in seconds. Serve the cones immediately, or put them in the freezer until ready to serve. To freeze individually (for up to 2 weeks), roll the cone up in a large triangle of wax paper and tape closed. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Prosecco]&quot; 15571,&quot;Black Sea Bass in Spring Vegetable Broth 1 clove garlic Kosher salt 1 teaspoon dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 large pasteurized egg yolk, at room temperature 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup vegetable oil 6 small spring onions 1/2 small fennel bulb (with fronds) 1 celery stalk, halved crosswise 1 small carrot, halved crosswise 2 sprigs parsley, plus 1 tablespoon chopped leaves 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon peppercorns 1 pound fresh fava beans 1 1/4 pounds small red-skinned potatoes, halved Kosher salt 1 cup multicolored cherry tomatoes, halved 6 5-to-6-ounce black sea bass fillets, pin bones removed Crusty bread, toasted, for serving Instructions: Make the aioli: Mince the garlic, then sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and mash with the flat side of a chef&#39;s knife to make a paste. Transfer to a medium bowl; add the mustard, lemon zest, lemon juice and egg yolk and whisk to combine. Gradually whisk in the olive oil, then the vegetable oil, whisking constantly until smooth; whisk in 1 teaspoon water to loosen. Cover and refrigerate the aioli until ready to use. Make the broth: Trim the spring onions to about 6 inches; transfer the tops to a large saucepan (set the bulbs aside). Trim the fennel and thinly slice; transfer 1 cup fennel fronds to the saucepan (set the sliced fennel aside). Add the celery, carrot, parsley sprigs, bay leaf, peppercorns and 8 cups water to the saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; reduce the heat to medium and cook, 15 minutes. Remove the fava beans from their pods. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the fava beans and cook 1 minute; drain and rinse under cold water. Slip off the skins; set the beans aside. Strain the vegetable broth into a wide pot. Add the potatoes and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Add the reserved spring onion bulbs and the tomatoes to the broth; simmer 5 minutes. Make the fish: Score each fish fillet crosswise 3 or 4 times on the skin side (do not cut through to the flesh). Season the flesh side with salt. Add the fish to the pot; add the fava beans and reserved sliced fennel, cover and cook until the fish is just opaque, about 6 minutes. Divide the potatoes among shallow bowls; top each with a fish fillet, then divide the broth and vegetables among the bowls. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and top each with a spoonful of aioli. Serve with bread and the remaining aioli. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 15572,&quot;Buffalo Chicken Salad 2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast halves 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper hot sauce (or other hot sauce), plus more to taste 2 teaspoons olive oil 2 hearts Romaine, cut into 1-inch strips (about 8 cups) 4 celery stalks, thinly sliced 2 carrots, coarsely grated 2 scallions, green part only, sliced 1/2 cup Blue Cheese Dressing, recipe follows 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1/4 cup lowfat buttermilk 1/4 cup plain fat-free yogurt 1 tablespoon white vinegar 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Put the chicken between 2 sheets of waxed paper and pound with a mallet or hammer so the chicken is an even thickness of about 3/4-inch, then cut the chicken crosswise into 1/2-inch strips. In a large bowl, combine the hot sauce and the oil, add chicken and toss until the chicken is well coated. Arrange the chicken on a baking sheet and broil until it is cooked through, about 4 to 6 minutes, turning once. In a large bowl combine the Romaine, celery, shredded carrots and scallions. Toss with the dressing. Divide the greens between 4 plates, top with the chicken. Serve with extra hot sauce. Fold a full sheet of paper towel into quarters and put it into a small bowl. Spoon the yogurt onto the paper towel and place in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to drain and thicken. In a medium bowl, whisk the buttermilk and thickened yogurt into the mayonnaise until smooth. Add the vinegar and sugar and continue to whisk until all the ingredients are well combined. Stir in the blue cheese and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 15573,&quot;Jeff&#39;s Famous Chicken Salad Croissant Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Four 6- to 8-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts 2 ribs celery, diced 2 scallions, white and pale green parts only, sliced thin 1/4 cup dried cherries 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup walnuts, toasted Romaine lettuce leaves, for serving 4 fresh croissants, sliced and lightly toasted, cut-side up, in the broiler Sliced Roma tomatoes, for serving Hot cherry pepper relish or giardiniera, for serving Balsamic glaze, for drizzling Instructions: In a large Dutch oven or pot, stir 1 tablespoon salt into 6 cups cold water. Add the chicken and heat over medium heat until the water hits a temperature of 170 degrees F. Take the pot off the heat, cover, and let the chicken sit in the warm water until its internal temperature hits 165 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the chicken to paper towels to dry. Once cool enough to handle, pull the chicken apart with your hands or forks until shredded but still chunky. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix the celery, scallions, cherries, mustard, sugar and salt and pepper to taste. Let this mixture sit for at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour to extract all that flavor. Add the mayo and mix until incorporated. Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Add the shredded chicken and walnuts to the mayo mixture. Adjust the seasonings. Let it sit in the fridge for at least 1 hour before serving, overnight preferred.

Add the remaining peas and the scallions and pulse 4 or 5 times to break up the peas but not completely puree them. Scoop about a heaping tablespoon of the mixture at a time into your hands and form about 24 balls. (The balls do not need to be perfectly round--they are more authentic if roughly formed.) Put the cornmeal in a shallow baking dish. Roll the balls in the cornmeal, leaving them in the baking dish, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. For the sauce: Heat the peanut oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the habaneros and onions and cook until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, salt and black pepper. When the tomatoes start to break down and get soft, put a lid on the pan, lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. Let the sauce cool slightly, and then blend in a food processor until smooth.<br> Pour 2 to 3 inches of peanut oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan or Dutch oven. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Fry the fritters, in 2 or 3 batches, about 4 minutes per batch. Remove to drain on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet.

Do not stir the sugar as it melts but do shake the skillet from time to time. Add the boiling water, stirring briskly to dissolve the caramelized sugar. Simmer uncovered 8 to 10 minutes until the consistency of maple syrup. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the caramelized syrup for the flan; pour the balance into a chilled, well-buttered, shallow fluted 2-quart mold. Set the mold in the freezer while preparing the flan. For the flan: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Combine the half-and-half, heavy cream, and sugar in a large heavy saucepan; add in the orange zest and bring to a simmer over moderately low heat, stirring now and then; blend in the 2 tablespoons of reserved caramelized syrup. Beat the egg yolks until frothy; blend 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the yolks, stir back into pan, and heat, stirring constantly for 1 minute, until it lightly coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and mix in the Port. Strain all through a fine sieve, then pour into the prepared mold. Set the mold in a shallow baking pan and pour in enough hot water to come halfway up the mold. Bake uncovered for 1 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted near the center of the flan comes out clean. Remove from the oven and the water bath; cool for 1 hour, then refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours until firm. To invert the flan, dip the mold quickly in hot water, then turn out on a dessert plate with a turned up rim; the caramel syrup will come cascading down over the flan. Don&#39;t worry if the flan cracks, it will still be creamy and luscious. Cut into slim wedges, if possible, or scoop out, and serve.

Mix for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir the water and vinegar together, then gradually add to the flour mixture. Mix at medium speed just until a dough forms. Do not over-mix. Divide the dough in 2 and shape into round, flat disks on sheets of waxed paper. Wrap separately and refrigerate for 30 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough with a lightly floured rolling pin into a large circle about 1/8-inch thick. Place your pie plate upside down on top and trim with a sharp knife, leaving about 2 inches extra dough all the way around. Roll the dough circle up onto your rolling pin, then unroll it into the pie plate; or, fold into quarters, transfer to the pie plate, and unfold. Gently press the crust into place, turning any excess dough hanging over underneath to create a thicker edge. Press the edge with the back of a fork to create a decorative edge. Repeat with the other piecrust and leave covered for 30 more minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line each crust with a sheet of regular-weight aluminum foil, then pour in about 3/4 pound dried beans or pie weights. Bake the crusts 25 to 30 minutes, just until dry and set - then remove the foil and beans. Bake another 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown, checking frequently to prevent over-baking. Remove from the oven immediately and let cool on wire racks. Banana Cream Filling: Combine the milk, salt, and vanilla bean in a non-aluminum pan and heat, stirring occasionally. As soon as the mixture begins to boil, turn off the heat and stir the mixture for 1 minute. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until thick and pale yellow, then gradually whisk in the cornstarch. Gradually whisk in half of the hot milk mixture. Pour the yolk-milk mixture back into the saucepan with the milk mixture and cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture boils and begins to thicken. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring, about 5 minutes more, until the mixture no longer tastes starchy. The mixture should become very thick, like a set custard. When cooked, turn off the heat. Stir in the butter until it melts completely and fold in the bananas. Pour the filling into the pre-baked pie shells. Push the banana slices below the surface to prevent them from browning, then smooth the tops. Cover with plastic wrap, gently pressing the plastic wrap against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate at least 7 hours or overnight, and serve with whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 15583,&quot;Kung Pao Calamari 1 1/2 cups plum sauce 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons roasted chili garlic sauce 2 tablespoons sesame oil Pinch black sesame seeds Pinch white sesame seeds 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped fine Flour Dredge (or substitute your favorite store-bought fish fry mix): 2 pounds corn flour 1 tablespoon baking powder Salt and ground pepper 2 1/2 pounds cleaned calamari (fresh or frozen), cut into 1/4-inch-thick rings 15 ounces sliced hot pepper rings, drained 5 to 10 ounces dry roasted peanuts 5 ounces chopped scallions Lemon wedges, for garnish, optional Instructions: For the kung pao sauce: Mix the plum sauce, 1/2 cup water, rice wine vinegar, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, both sesame seeds and the cilantro in a large bowl and set aside.<br> For the flour dredge: In a separate large bowl, combine the corn flour, baking powder, and some salt and pepper.<br> For the calamari: Prepare a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F.

Whisk together the tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup of the beef broth and 2 tablespoons of the Worcestershire in a small bowl until smooth. Pour over the beef and add the thyme sprigs and smashed garlic. Seal the bag and press the meat so it is covered by the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours. Preheat the broiler. Line the bottom of a broiler pan or rimmed baking sheet with heavy-duty aluminum foil. If using a baking sheet, place a rack over the foil. Remove the meat from the bag and discard the marinade. Pat the meat dry and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Pour the remaining 1 1/2 cups beef broth into the bottom of the prepared pan and place the meat on top of the broiler pan or rack. Broil, turning once, until a thermometer inserted in the center registers about 125 degrees F, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let the meat rest on the rack for 5 minutes then transfer to a cutting board and let rest an additional 5 minutes. Reserve the juices in the bottom of the broiler pan or baking sheet. Meanwhile, heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, chopped thyme and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the onions are very soft and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Spoon into a bowl and set aside. Pour the reserved juices from the broiler pan and the remaining 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce into a small pot and cook over medium heat until hot.

Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking, until thick, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl. Whisk in the butter and vanilla. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Fold the chopped candy into the pudding. Whip 3/4 cup of the cream with an electric mixer just until stiff peaks form. Fold a third of the whipped cream into the pudding to lighten it, and then fold in the other two-thirds until no streaks remain. Transfer to the pie crust and freeze until firm but not frozen solid, about 3 hours. Whip the remaining 1/2 cup cream just until soft peaks form. Spread over the pie and garnish decoratively with sliced or chopped candy. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 15595,&quot;Cameron&#39;s Four-Cheese Pizza 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey 1 cup warm water, 105 to 115 degrees F 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing 12 ounces (1/2 recipe) pizza dough 2 tablespoons pesto, recipe follows 2 tablespoons oven-dried tomatoes, recipe follows, cut into thin slices 3/4 cup shredded or grated mozzarella, about 3 ounces 3/4 cup grated Fontina 2 Roma tomatoes, ends trimmed and cut into 12 slices 2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano leaves 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 6 to 8 large fresh basil leaves, cut into chiffonade 2 pounds Roma tomatoes, about 12 medium-sized tomatoes 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional as needed 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves 6 garlic cloves, crushed 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon sugar 12 medium fresh basil leaves, washed, dried, and coarsely chopped 3 medium garlic cloves, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons pine nuts, lightly toasted Pinch salt 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: For the pizza dough: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand for 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled. Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Yield: Makes 4 (8-inch) pizzas For the Pizza: Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch or 10-inch rounds, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough. Brush lightly with pesto and scatter the oven-dried tomatoes evenly around the inner circle of the pizza. Sprinkle the mozzarella and Fontina, arrange the slices of the Roma tomatoes, and then sprinkle with the goat cheese, oregano, thyme, and finally the Parmesan. Bake on the pizza stone until the pizza crust is nicely browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. When the pizza is removed from the oven, transfer to a cutting board and garnish with the chiffonade of basil leaves, cut the pizza into slices, and serve immediately. Yield: 1 (10-inch) or 2 (8-inch) pizzas; 3 to 4 servings Preheat the over to 250 degrees F. In a pot of boiling water, blanch tomatoes. Drain and refresh in ice water. Drain. Peel, core, cut into quarters, and remove seeds. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and arrange the tomato quarters on the tray, cut side down. Drizzle generously with olive oil. Sprinkle with thyme and garlic. In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper and sugar, and sprinkle evenly over the tomatoes. Bake until the tomatoes begin to shrivel, about 1 hour. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, transfer to a container. Pour olive oil over and cover the container. Refrigerate and use as needed. In a mortar and pestle, pound the basil, garlic, nuts and salt until thoroughly mashed. Add the oil, a few drops at a time, until you have a smooth paste. Pesto can also be made in a blender. Pour in the oil first, then the garlic, nuts, and finally the basil leaves. Blend on low to a smooth paste. Season with the kosher salt. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 15596,&quot;Wafers 1 pint half-and-half (single) cream 2 tablespoons rose water 1 cup plain white flour 1 cup icing sugar Instructions: Mix all the ingredients thoroughly in a bowl.

For the tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Increase the heat to high and add the tomatoes and oregano if using. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning (adding a pinch of sugar if needed) and stir in the basil. For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking rack over a baking sheet and set aside. Put the breadcrumbs, flour and beaten eggs in separate shallow dishes and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sprinkle each chicken breast on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge each breast in the flour and tap off any excess, then dip in the egg wash and let the excess drip off. Finally, dredge in the breadcrumbs. Transfer the breasts to a baking sheet or large plate. Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook 2 breasts at a time in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the breasts to the baking rack on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts and oil. Place in the oven to cook further for a couple minutes, then remove and set aside. Change the oven setting to broil. For the arugula salad: Dress the arugula in a large bowl with the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper and toss together. Top each chicken breast with some tomato sauce and mozzarella slices. Broil until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese has melted, 1 to 3 minutes. Place some arugula salad on each plate next to a chicken piece.

Put the chicken in a large pan, season with salt and pepper and cover with water. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Remove the chicken and let cool, then shred the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Save the broth for cooking the spaghetti. Remove the sausage from the casings and put into a large skillet with the olive oil. Cook over medium heat, breaking up the sausage meat into small pieces, until it is no longer pink, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Add the mushrooms to the skillet. When they give up their liquid, add the green peppers and sundried tomatoes, then cook until just beginning to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and set aside on top of the sausage. Reserve the oil in the skillet. Bring the reserved chicken broth back to a boil. Cook the spaghetti in the broth until al dente according to the package instructions, then drain, reserving the broth. If there is less than 2 tablespoons oil/fat in the skillet, add some olive oil to make 2 tablespoons. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute over medium heat. Whisk in 1 1/2 cups of the reserved chicken broth. When it starts to thicken, after about 5 minutes, add the half-and-half. If it is too thick, thin with some more broth. Turn off the heat and add the basil and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan; season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the chicken, sausage and vegetables. Stir in the spaghetti. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish, sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan on top and cover with aluminum foil. Cook the casserole immediately, or let cool completely, then freeze. If cooking right away, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cook for 25 minutes, then uncover the baking dish and cook until heated through, an additional 20 minutes. To cook from frozen: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Cook the frozen casserole for 2 hours, then raise the temperature to 375 degrees F, uncover and cook until heated through, 15 minutes more.

Remove and reserve the heart and giblets from the turkey cavity; remove and discard the liver. Flip the turkey upside down so the breast is on your cutting board. Using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the backbone to remove it. Using your fingers, gently separate the skin from the breast meat while keeping it attached. (You want to create a pocket for the sage butter without tearing the skin.) Push the Sage Butter under the skin of the turkey, being careful not to puncture it. Rub the skin with olive oil, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Set aside. For the gravy: Put the bay leaves, garlic, apples, celery, carrots, onions, cinnamon stick and thyme in a roasting pan and sprinkle with salt. Add 2 cups of the chicken stock and 1 cup of the apple cider, as well as the heart, giblets and backbone of the turkey. Roast the turkey: Place a roasting rack on top of the vegetables and set the turkey on the rack. Roast for 1 hour 15 minutes. Tent the turkey with foil and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the leg (without touching bone) registers 175 degrees F. Let the turkey rest for 15 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, finish the gravy: Strain all the veggies over a bowl; discard the veggies. Skim the fat from the pan juices and add it to the roasting pan; this is the fat for the roux. Set the roasting pan over 2 burners over low heat and whisk in the flour. Cook until the mixture looks like wet sand, 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the remaining 1 cup apple cider and 2 cups chicken stock, as well as the strained pan juices from the bowl. Cook until the mixture has thickened and reached a gravy consistency. Taste and adjust with additional salt and pepper as needed. Pour into a serving pitcher or bowl and serve with the turkey. Mix the butter with the sage and some salt and pepper until well blended. Set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15625,&quot;Grape Sparkler Cocktail 6 cups red seedless grapes 3 tablespoons simple syrup 1 cup vodka, cold 2 cups club soda or seltzer, cold Instructions: Freeze half of the grapes.

Whisk together the buttermilk, eggs and oil in a separate large bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until the mixture just comes together. Add the wild rice and fold until just combined. Let mixture rest for 10 minutes. While the mixture is resting, heat the waffle maker. Brush the waffle grates with some of the melted butter and make the waffles according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. For the Chicken: Whisk together 1 quart of the buttermilk, 2 tablespoons salt and the cl de arbol in a large bowl or large baking dish. Add the chicken, turn to coat, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Stir together the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika and cayenne in a large bowl and divide among 2 shallow platters. Season generously with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the remaining 2 cups buttermilk and allow excess to drain off. Dredge in the second plate of flour and pat off the excess. Put the chicken pieces on a baking rack set over a baking sheet while the oil heats. Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast iron skillet; the oil should not come more than half way up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces. For the Butter: Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until combined. For the Syrup: In a small bowl whisk together all ingredients. To serve: Place waffle on plate, top with 2 pieces of fried chicken, and a dollop of butter.

Begin by re-hydrating the figs. In a large mixing bowl add the figs, honey, lemon juice and cover with warm water. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 20 to 25 minutes until the figs are tender and soft. Strain the figs and reserve the liquid - as this will be the base for the glaze. To make the stuffing, heat a little extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat and gently saute the onions with rosemary. Add the sweet Italian sausage and continue to saute until browned, 10 to 12 minutes. When done, scrape it all into a large mixing bowl, add the cornbread pieces and figs and season well with salt and pepper. Give it a good toss until it&#39;s well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, cream, and stock, and pour that over the cornbread. Stir the stuffing together and set it aside while you work on the hens. Wash and clean the birds. Season the cavities with salt and pepper and fill with stuffing. Dot the top of each bird with butter and season with salt and pepper. Lay out on a roasting tray and pop into the oven for 40 to 45 minutes. While they are roasting, set the fig liquid over medium-high heat and add balsamic and butter. Reduce until syrupy and baste the birds with 10 minutes to go. When done, an instant-read thermometer should registers 160 degrees F in the thickest part of the thigh.

Combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Whisk the juices together in another bowl. Let cool slightly, then whisk half the syrup into the juices and taste. Slowly add more syrup, tasting frequently. The mixture should taste definitely tart and sweet; you might not use all the syrup. Freeze in an ice cream machine, then transfer to the frozen bowl and keep frozen.<br> Ice Cream: Combine the milk with 1/3 cup of the sugar in a saucepan and heat just to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat. Whisk the egg yolks with the remaining 1/3 cup sugar until well combined. Whisk a few tablespoons of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, then pour back into the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. Test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Strain the mixture into a bowl and place it in the ice bath to cool. Let cool, stirring often. When cold, whisk in the sour cream and freeze in an ice cream machine. When frozen, use a small ice cream scoop to make walnut-sized balls and freeze solid again. To assemble, let the sorbet soften slightly. With a larger ice cream scoop, dig out flat globs of sorbet and pack it around the ice cream balls, covering completely. Freeze for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 15630,&quot;Best Chocolate Chip Cookies 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened<br> 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips<br> Instructions: Arrange racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

Halve the zucchini lengthwise and gently scrape out the center flesh and seeds. Chop the center flesh and seeds and reserve. Halve each zucchini again crosswise. Arrange the zucchini and bell peppers cut-side up in a baking dish. Drizzle with EVOO and season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons EVOO in a round-bottomed risotto pot or pan over medium to medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chopped zucchini and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir in the rice, then add the wine and cook until evaporated, about 1 minute. Add the stock mixture a few ladles at a time, stirring vigorously after each addition and allowing the liquid to mostly evaporate before adding more. The rice will take about 18 minutes to cook to al dente. In the last minute or so of cooking, stir in 1/2 cup cheese, the butter and the lemon and orange juices. Scoop the risotto into the vegetables. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons EVOO and 1/2 cup cheese with the breadcrumbs. Sprinkle over the tops of the risotto filling. Cover with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Uncover and bake until the tops are browned, 10 to 15 more minutes. Garnish with the parsley. Cook&#39;s Note: If you are not serving the dish immediately, fill the vegetables with the risotto and let cool (do not bake). Cover and store in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, bake as directed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 15639,&quot;Grilled Cabbage Steaks with Cilantro-Lime Sauce 2 cups lightly packed fresh cilantro leaves 2 cups lightly packed fresh Italian parsley leaves 2 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled 1 medium jalape?o, stemmed and coarsely chopped Zest and juice of 1 lime (about 2 tablespoons juice) 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 teaspoon honey Kosher salt 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 1 medium head savoy cabbage 1/2 teaspoon ancho cl powder 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium heat. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 15 minutes. Combine 1 1/2 cups of the cilantro, 1 1/2 cups of the parsley, the garlic, jalape?o, lime juice, rice vinegar, honey and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender and blend on high until smooth. With the blender running, drizzle in the oil in a slow stream to make a very smooth sauce. Transfer to a serving bowl and season with more salt, if needed.<br> Remove any loose leaves from the exterior of the cabbage and set it on its stem end. Cut a thin piece off one side of the cabbage to make it flat; then slice a thin piece off the other side of the cabbage. (Reserve the pieces for another use.) Slice the cabbage vertically to make 4 thick steaks, each about 3/4- to 1-inch thick.<br> Lay the steaks on a baking sheet and stick a skewer horizontally through any that are not holding together. Brush both sides of the steaks with olive oil and sprinkle with the lime zest, ancho powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Grill the steaks, covered, moving them occasionally so they cook evenly, until charred and crisp-tender, 6 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter, brush the tops lightly with olive oil and remove any skewers you used.<br> Coarsely chop the remaining 1/2 cup cilantro and 1/2 cup parsley. Drizzle about half of the sauce over the cabbage. Sprinkle with the herbs and red onion and serve the remaining sauce on the side.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 15640,&quot;Whole Smoke-Roasted Striped Bass and Rocket Pesto 1 whole striped bass or salmon, around 20 to 30 pounds (9 to 13.7 kg), scaled 2 cups (475 ml) olive oil 5 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 5 cups (300 g) fresh Italian parsley leaves, plus 1 whole bunch fresh Italian parsley 8 sprigs rosemary, needles removed and stems discarded 1 cup (235 ml) fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup (75 g) kosher salt 2 tablespoons (12 g) ground black pepper 2 cups (80 g) loosely packed basil leaves 10 tarragon sprigs 12 thyme sprigs Rocket Pesto (recipe follows) Cheesy Grilled Corn (recipe follows) 1 pound (455 g) arugula (also known as rocket)<br> 1 1/2 cups (220 g) pistachios, shells removed, toasted 2 cups (475 ml) olive oil 3 cloves garlic, chopped Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste 1/2 cup (50 g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 20 ears corn, shucked, snapped in half, and blanched for 30 seconds 4 cups (480 g) crumbled queso fresco (if you can&#39;t find queso fresco, feta works as well) 1/2 cup (64 g) chili powder 2 egg yolks 10 limes, cut into 6 wedges each 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 tablespoons (30 ml) fresh lemon juice 2 cups (475 ml) vegetable oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste Instructions: Make sure the fish has had all its scales removed, and that the inside cavity is clean. If there are any scales left, remove them using the back of a knife to scrape the skin from tail to head. Pat the skin dry with a towel. Prepare smoker and bring heat to 400degreesF (200 degrees C). We recommend oak or hickory as the smoke wood. In a blender, puree the olive oil, garlic, 5 cups (300 g) parsley leaves, rosemary, lemon juice, salt, and pepper until smooth. Coat the fish with the herb mixture inside and out. Stuff the cavity with the basil, tarragon, thyme, and remaining 1 bunch parsley. Transfer fish to a large foil-lined baking sheet, and smoke for 5 minutes for every inch (2.5 cm) the fish measures at its largest circumference, or until the fish&#39;s internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). To serve, gently transfer roasted fish to a large platter or cutting board and drizzle with Rocket Pesto. Serve with Cheesy Grilled Corn. Pesto is traditionally made with basil, garlic, parmesan or pecorino cheese, pine nuts, and olive oil, but we thought we&#39;d shake things up a bit by replacing the basil with arugula and substituting pistachios for pine nuts. In a food processor, puree the pistachios, garlic, and cheese. Add arugula and pulse to combine. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Grilled corn with cotija cheese (a hard, dry cheese named for the town in Mexico from whence it originates), mayonnaise, and a dusting of chili powder is popular street food in Mexico. One bite and it&#39;s easy to see why. Here&#39;s our version. In the bowl of a food processor, puree the egg yolks, garlic, and lemon juice. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in oil to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and reserve. Prepare grill. When fire is medium-hot (you should not be able to hold your hand over the coals for more than 10 seconds), grill corn for about 5 minutes, rolling it to toast all sides and keep it from burning (C). Remove from grill and slather with aioli, then sprinkle with queso fresco and chili powder. Serve with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 15641,&quot;White Bean, Tomato and Sausage Orecchiette Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound orecchiette pasta 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, removed from casings 1 yellow onion, diced 3 cloves garlic, sliced 2 pints grape or pear tomatoes, quartered 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes One 15-ounce can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus additional for garnish 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, cut into chiffonade, plus additional for garnish Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the orecchiette according to package instructions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with the back of a spoon, until it starts to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the sausage to a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving all the oil in the skillet. Add the onions to the oil and cook until they start to soften and turn translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes start to blister and split, about 4 minutes. Add salt and pepper. Add the beans and return the sausage to the skillet. Cook until warmed through. Add the pasta and toss until it is completely coated. Add the Parmesan in batches, stirring to incorporate and letting it melt before more is added. Stir in the basil. Plate the pasta and top with more Parmesan and basil.

Prepare a grill for indirect heat. (For a gas grill, turn one burner on each far side to medium heat and the middle burners to low; for a charcoal grill, bank the coals on one side of the grill.) A grill thermometer should read 325 to 350 degrees F. Tear off a long piece of foil and fold into thirds so it&#39;s about the size of a baking sheet. Spray the foil with cooking spray. Push the hot dogs onto the skewers so the hot dogs are flush with the top. Use a sharp paring knife to cut a spiral (4 or 5 rings total) along the hot dog, cutting all the way down to the skewer. Gently pull the hot dog down to open up the spiral. Unwrap the crescent dough. Cut it crosswise into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a snake 8 to 9 inches long. Press one snake into the cut spaces in each spiral, wrapping it as you go and tucking in the ends.<br> Set the foil on the indirect (low) heat part of the grill and add the hot dogs, leaving some space between each. Grill, covered, until the bottoms of the dogs are golden and top of the dough is set, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip the skewers and cook until the bottom is browned again, 5 to 6 minutes more. Flip once more to an unbrowned side and grill until the dough is cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes more.<br> Transfer the pigs in blankets to a platter and serve with ketchup and mustard.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15643,&quot;Monjunis Muffuletta 1 (12-inch) muffuletta bun spread with garlic butter 16 pieces Genoa salami 8 ounces thinly sliced ham 6 pieces thinly sliced provolone 4 pieces thinly sliced tomato 4 pepperoncini peppers, sliced Monjunis Olive mix, recipe follows 1/4 cup good quality olive oil 1/2 cup black olives, pitted 1/2 cup green olives, pitted 1 stalk celery 2 tablespoons capers 2 red peppers 2 cloves fresh garlic Fresh or dried Italian herbs such as basil, oregano, or parsley Instructions: Layer the bun with ingredients, in order given, and top with the peppers.

Lay out the tomatillos, red onion and jalapeno on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, then roast until slightly charred and softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Transfer to a food processor and puree until smooth. Add the cilantro and lime juice, season with salt and continue to puree until smooth. For a thicker salsa, pour into a cheesecloth-lined strainer and let drain. Make the burgers: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high. Form the chorizo into 4 balls, then flatten with your palm. Season them with salt. Oil the grill grates. Place the patties on the grill and press with a spatula to form thinner patties. Cook, without moving, until a good crust forms on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low and top each burger with a slice of cheese; cover and let the cheese melt, about 1 minute. Remove the burgers and place on the toasted buns with the salsa verde, avocado, red onion and some piquillo peppers. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 15645,&quot;French Toast Puffs 8 ounces butter or butter alternative, preferably Earth Balance 1 to 2 tablespoons agave syrup<br> 1 tablespoon ground ginger Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking sheet 2 ripe bananas<br> 3 cups oat milk<br> 1 cup toasted coconut flakes<br> 1/3 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 2 teaspoons ground turmeric<br> 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Pinch salt<br> 1 to 2 loaves gluten-free millet bread (or favorite bread), cut into crouton-size pieces<br> Maple syrup, preferably from Vermont, for serving Instructions: For the ginger butter: Place the butter, agave and ginger in a food processor and process until smooth. (If no processor is available, you may use softened butter and whisk all ingredients instead.) The butter should have a smooth consistency, ready to be dipped into. For the french toast puffs: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F, using convection if available. Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Put the bananas, oat milk, coconut, sugar, cinnamon, turmeric, nutmeg, vanilla and salt in a blender and blend until smooth. If there are a few small chunks of banana, don&#39;t worry, it will add to the texture of the puffs. Put 1 loaf&#39;s worth of bread chunks in a large mixing bowl, followed by the batter. With a spatula or fingertips, gently fold everything together. Take care not to overmix. Homogenous is boring, so we are looking for the bread to be mostly intact, moistened by the batter. Let sit for 5 minutes. The texture should now be soft and wet, not soupy (if it&#39;s soupy, add more bread). When the correct texture is achieved, it will be easily scoopable with a golf-ball-sized cookie scoop. Scoop out all of the bread-batter mix onto the prepared baking sheet. Keep it funky and scoop larger amounts than the scoop can hold, like a scoop of hard ice cream. Bake until golden brown and crispy on the outside, 10 to 15 minutes. (Browned and slightly crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside, is our goal.) Eat with hands, dipping into Vermont maple syrup and ginger butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15646,&quot;One-Pot Mushroom Biryani with Tamarind and Coconut Milk 1 1/4 cups basmati rice 2 teaspoons sugar 2 teaspoons tamarind paste, such as GloryBee Organic Tamarind Puree or Tamicon Tamarind Concentrate 3 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee 1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 3/4 to 1 cup mixed nuts (I like using peanuts and cashews) 1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (depending on your spice preference) 2 sprigs curry leaves (about 20 curry leaves), optional 1 large onion, chopped 1 pound mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, oyster, shiitake, etc.), trimmed and sliced 4 cloves garlic, grated or finely minced One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated or mashed 2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons vangi bhath masala powder (See Cook\u2019s Note) 1/2 teaspoon garam masala 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder Kosher salt 3 plum tomatoes, peeled and chopped (about 1 1/4 cups) or 1 cup canned whole peeled tomatoes, crushed 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving Instructions: Wash the rice in cold water until the water is no longer cloudy, 3 to 4 times. Fill the bowl with cold water and let the rice soak until ready to use. Combine the sugar, tamarind paste and 3 tablespoons hot water in a small bowl; set aside. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. When hot, add the mustard seeds and fennel seeds and let sizzle until you hear popping sounds, about 10 seconds. Add the nuts, crushed red pepper flakes and curry leaves if using and cook until the mixture gets a hint of color, about 2 minutes (be careful as the curry leaves might sputter). Set aside about three-quarters of this mixture for garnish. Add the onions to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add the mushrooms, garlic and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are nicely roasted, about 8 minutes. Add the vangi bhath masala, garam masala, turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt and cook until the raw smell dissipates, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon and stirring intermittently until the tomatoes are broken down, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the tamarind mixture, coconut milk, stock and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix gently and bring to a simmer. Drain the rice, add it to the pot and gently mix to combine. Bring it back to a simmer, reduce the heat just enough to keep it at a gentle simmer, cover and cook until the rice is cooked, about 25 minutes. Peek only after 25 minutes to see if it needs to cook further. Turn off the heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 minutes. Gently mix the rice, taste and adjust the salt if needed.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking until the sugar is dissolved. Meanwhile, whisk the cornstarch and egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup sugar in a medium bowl until smooth. Ladle about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture into the bowl while whisking, then add all of the mixture back to the saucepan. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly; let boil until thickened, about 2 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then stir in the preserves, schnapps and almond extract. Cool the pastry cream slightly, then cover the surface directly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold. For the cookies: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the sugar, milk, butter, nectar, schnapps and eggs in a large bowl. Add the flour mixture and beat with a wooden spoon until smooth to make a thick, sticky dough.<br> Lightly grease your hands with the oil and roll tablespoons of the dough into balls, arranging them about 1 1/2 inches apart on the lined baking sheets. Bake one sheet at a time, until the undersides of the cookies are golden and the tops are just set, about 15 minutes. Cool just a few minutes. While the cookies are still warm, use a sharp paring knife to cut an approximately 1-inch-wide teaspoon-sized divot into the flat side of each cookie (be careful not to pierce the tops or sides of the cookies). Bake the other sheet of cookies and cut out the divots. Cool the cookies completely. Spoon a heaping teaspoon of pastry cream into each cookie, then sandwich 2 similar-looking ones together to make a peach shape, cleaning off any pastry cream that squeezes out of the seams. At this point, the cookies may not stick together very well; prop them up next to each other to keep their shape.<br> For decorating: Combine the nectar and almond extract in a small bowl and add enough food coloring to make it bright red, about 8 drops. Put the sugar in another bowl. Working one at a time, paint each peach cookie all over with the red nectar mixture using a medium paintbrush, then roll in the sugar to coat thoroughly. Make sure the cookies are still nicely sandwiched and place in a 9-by-13-inch baking pan (the cookies should fit snugly in the baking pan so that they keep their shape). Cover the dish with plastic and refrigerate 8 hours and up to overnight (this will blend the flavors and also set the pastry cream to keep the cookies together). Just before serving, garnish each cookie with a clove and mint sprig to look like little stems. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15659,&quot;Swordfish with Ginger Bbq Sauce 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 medium onion, diced 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger 1/4 cup white vinegar 1 cup adobo or barbecue sauce 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds swordfish, cut into 1 1/2inch thick steaks Olive oil for brushing fish Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat the oil in a skillet over medium low heat.

You can use a traditional 9-inch baking pan, if you prefer. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the cake: Melt the butter into the coffee. When the butter has melted, whisk in the buttermilk. Placed the eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and place on low speed. Add the flour, salt, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda 1 at a time and mix just until combined. Add the vanilla and the coffee buttermilk mixture. Mix just until combined. If you are using dry measure cups, place the batter in a container with a spout to make it easier to pour the batter into the dry measure cups. Place the measuring cup molds onto a cookie sheet. Spray each cup with vegetable cooking spray. Fill each cup half full. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. To make the ganache drizzle: Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous. Unmold the cakes and let cool on a wire rack placed over a parchment paper lined baking sheet. When cool, stack the cakes on top of each other with the largest cake on the bottom layer. Placing the cakes on a wire rack placed over a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Use an offset spatula to spread the ganache over the cakes letting the excess drizzle over the sides. Use an offset spatula to move the cakes to the presentation plate. Make the chocolate curls: Use a block of white chocolate. Pull a vegetable peeler over the edge to create chocolate curls. Use the curls to decorate the cakes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 15676,&quot;Vegan Black Bean and Sweet Potato Soup 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving 1 large yellow onion, chopped 2 stalks celery, chopped 1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped 1 large carrot, chopped Kosher salt Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 3 tablespoons tomato paste 3 cloves garlic, chopped 2 teaspoons smoked paprika (pimenton) 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 2 dried bay leaves 2 large sweet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and chopped Two 15.5-ounce cans black beans, rinsed and drained 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Sherry vinegar, for serving, optional Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat.

Put pot on stove on medium flame and add salt. When water comes to a boil, and the potatoes are cooked, drain the potatoes and spread out on a side towel to dry. While potatoes are doing their thing, add bacon to a large saute pan and cook over a low/medium flame. When the bacon is cooked remove with a slotted spoon and drain the bacon fat, reserving some if you want to add it later. Wipe out the pan with a wad of paper towels (and crank up the heat), add a decent amount of a neutral oil, like canola, and heat it until you get some smoke. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the potatoes and shake the pan a couple of times to make sure nothing sticks. Lower the heat a little and let the potatoes brown. Season with salt and pepper. After a few minutes, shake the pan and get the other sides going. When the potatoes are almost completely cooked, add the red onion and let everything cook together. Once the onions are caramelized, add the capers, red wine vinegar and deglaze. When the vinegar is mostly evaporated, add the extra-virgin olive oil, mustard and bacon (and reserved bacon fat if you want), re-season with lots of cracked black pepper.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium speed just until combined. Beat in the egg yolk just until combined. Beat in the food coloring and vanilla until the color is evenly distributed, scraping down the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture. Beat just until the dough comes together. Form the dough into two 1-inch-thick disks, wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour. Unwrap one disk, place it on the paper and cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap. Roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thick. Peel off the plastic wrap and, using a 2 1/2-inch round or square cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out the dough. Place the cut-outs on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart (about 12 cookies per sheet). Gather the scraps, chill until firm, roll again and cut. Repeat with the remaining disk. Bake the cookies until brick-red and set, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Let the cookies cool on the sheets for 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Scoop a generous 1/4 cup ice cream into a 2 1/2-inch round or square cookie or biscuit cutter set on the parchment. Smooth the top flat and remove the cutter.

Traditionally gungo peas - also called gunga peas, Congo peas, no-eye peas or, most familiarly, pigeon peas - are used but don&#39;t make it a sticking point. I&#39;ve often used black-eyed peas, and once or twice cranberry or kidney beans. The truth is, as the song almost has it, any bean will do. Drain and rinse the gungo peas, and heat the oil in a heavy based saucepan that has a lid. Fry the onion for about 5 minutes, stirring every now and again, letting it soften and brown a little. Then add the chopped cl and garlic, and give everything a good stir around. Now stir in the rice, making sure it is all slicked with oil, then pour in the coconut milk and chicken or vegetable broth and stir in the drained gungo peas. Bring to a bubble, clamp on the lid, and turn down the heat to very low and let it cook gently for 15 minutes. Check the rice is cooked through and the liquid is all absorbed - give the rice another 5 minutes if it needs it.

You should have approximately 3 cups of corn kernels from 4 cobs of corn. Save the corn cobs and set aside. The cobs will add additional corn flavor to the soup. In a medium-sized saucepan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil, then the onions. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes until they are translucent, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and chipotle chili powder and saute for 1 more minute. Add the corn kernels and saute for another 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the salt, black pepper, and chicken stock and bring to a boil. (If you have cut your corn fresh from the cob, place the reserved cobs into the saucepan at this time). Once the mixture has boiled, reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the corn kernels from burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan. While the corn soup is simmering, roast the red bell pepper. Char the skin of the pepper until it is black over an open flame or on a grill. When the skin is blistered and blackened, remove the pepper from the flame and place in a paper or plastic bag and seal. Let steam for 15 minutes. When the pepper is cool enough to handle, peel, seed, and dice it. Place the diced bell pepper into a blender with 1/2 cup of the heavy cream and blend thoroughly for 1 minute. Pour through a fine sieve and discard the contents of the sieve. Pour the red bell pepper sauce into a plastic squirt bottle and set aside. Remove the corn soup mixture from the heat, discard the corn cobs and set aside. Place the corn soup mixture in a blender and puree for 3 minutes.

Begin by removing the legs and chop in half by cutting at the center joint, giving you a drumstick and a thigh. Cut off the neck and slice into little pieces and put this together with the wings into the chicken stock. Chop through the breast and put the back part of the chicken into the simmering stock. Sever the actual breast into 3 pieces and remove the tiny bones. Dry the chicken portions with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat some clarified butter in a frying pan and when hot, place the legs and thighs in to fry (these portions take longest to cook). After a couple of minutes turn the chicken pieces. It should be a crisp golden color. Now add the chicken breasts and allow all the pieces to continue cooking. Turn the breast portions until evenly colored. Heat another pan and add the unmelted butter to begin the &#39;Roux&#39;. Once the butter has melted remove the pan from the heat and add the flour. Stir it well then return to the heat and stir the &#39;roux&#39; briskly so that all the flour is cooked. Turn the chicken portions once again and reduce to medium heat. Remove the roux from the heat and blend in the chicken stock gradually. Stir briskly so that no lumps form. Return to the heat and bring the sauce to a boil, stirring continually. Boil for 3 minutes and then reduce heat to a low simmer. Add the juice from the tin of cepes, white wine, and cream to the simmering sauce. Bring it all to the boil stirring constantly. Turn the chicken once again and add the garlic. Allow it to give up its flavor for 2 minutes only, then discard. Whisk the sauce until smooth and creamy. Pour off the butter and chicken juices into a dish, and fry the cepes with the chicken in the pan. Pour the sauce over the chicken and cepes and add the juice from the truffle and the chopped parsley.

While the pasta is cooking, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and add the onion, cooking until translucent. Add the flour a little at a time to make a roux. Do this gradually because some batches of flour absorb more than others and you may not need as much. Incorporate enough of the chicken broth a little at a time to form a smooth sauce. Simmer for a least 10 minutes to allow the flour to \cook out.\ Add the heavy cream and Cheddar, then season with salt and white pepper, to taste. Then fold in as much pasta as you need to acquire the right consistency for macaroni and cheese. Transfer to a 3-quart baking dish and sprinkle with crushed crackers.

Place the dough on the wrap and let rest until nearly doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 20-by-14-inch rectangle. Cut the dough into 3 long strips that are each about 4 1/2 inches wide. Spread 2 tablespoons pizza sauce down the center of each dough strip. Sprinkle 1/3 cup cheese over the sauce on each strip. With the long side of 1 strip facing you, roll the dough over the sauce and cheese, forming a tight log. Seal the seam with a little bit of water. Repeat this process with the remaining 2 strips of dough to form 3 logs. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Gently lay the logs into the baking dish to resemble the shape of creepy intestines. Fold the logs into curves against one another and pinch the ends to curve inwards. (It is okay to leave space in between the logs, since the dough will puff up as it bakes.) Combine 1 tablespoon of water with the red gel food coloring in a small bowl, then stir in the egg white just until combined. (You do not want the mixture to get foamy.) Brush the egg wash over all sides of the \intestines.\ Fill the space in between the logs with the remaining pizza sauce, being careful not to spread or drip the sauce on the \intestines.<br> Bake until crispy, but not browned, about 30 minutes.

Whisk in the fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, and 1 cup water until the sugar dissolves. Transfer to a serving bowl for dipping. For the banh xeo: Whisk the flour together with the scallion, salt, turmeric and 1/4 cup cold water in a bowl until completely smooth. Set aside. Heat a well-seasoned 9-inch carbon steel skillet over high heat until smoking hot. Add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan generously and swirl to lightly coat the sides, too. Add the shrimp and bacon, and cook, stirring and tossing, until the shrimp start to curl but before they become completely opaque, about 1 minute. Whisk the batter again to mix in any flour that has settled on the bottom, then ladle a spoonful into the pan. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom and an inch or so up the sides with a thin layer of the batter. Repeat two more times. Let the batter set, about 30 seconds. Drizzle the egg over the crepe and swirl the pan to evenly coat the crepe with egg. The crepe should have released from the sides of the pan; squirt oil between the crepe edges and the pan. Gently shake the pan to keep everything moving. Poke a hole in the crepe with a fork or spoon to keep it from bubbling up -- you want a flat crepe. Oil should be sputtering at the edges of the crepe; if it isn&#39;t, add more. Cook the crepe, oiling and shaking until the egg has set on top and the bottom of the crepe is dark brown around the edges and speckled on the bottom. Pile the bean sprouts on one half and fold the other half over with a spatula. Hold the folded omelet against one side of the pan and tilt the oil out the other side into a heat-safe bowl; discard. Lift the omelet out of the pan with the spatula and immediately serve with the shrimp and bacon, lettuce and shiso leaves, herbs and nuoc cham. Tear off a piece of omelet with a bunch of bean sprouts and tuck it into a lettuce leaf with a shiso leaf and some bacon and shrimp. Pluck a few fresh herb leaves of basil, cilantro, dill and mint, and stuff them in there, too. Then roll it up and dip into the nuoc cham. Eat. Repeat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15715,&quot;Apricot and Nut Cookies with Amaretto Icing 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 large egg 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup dried apricots, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted 2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted 1 3/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 5 to 7 tablespoons almond flavored liqueur (recommended: Amaretto) Instructions: For the Cookies: In a large bowl, beat the butter, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.

Line two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment and lightly coat with cooking spray. Spread the pecans on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until light brown and fragrant, 7 minutes. Set aside 12 pecan halves to decorate the finished cake; chop the remaining pecans. Set aside 1 cup of the chopped pecans to use in the batter; reserve the rest for decorating the finished cake. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the eggs and granulated sugar in a large bowl until smooth, about 1 minute. Whisk in the oil until well combined. Add the grated carrots, vanilla and 1 cup chopped pecans, and mix well. Add the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the cakes are nicely browned, about 30 minutes. Let cool on a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Loosen the edges with a spatula, turn the cakes out and let cool completely, right-side up, on the cooling rack, about 2 hours. Remove the parchment before frosting. For the frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, scraping down the side as necessary, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon salt; gradually increase the mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until the sugar is incorporated and the frosting is fluffy and smooth, about 3 minutes. With the mixer on medium-high, add the cream a few drops at time until it&#39;s all incorporated. Continue beating for 1 more minute until the frosting is slightly lighter in color and creamy. To assemble: Place one of the cake layers on a serving plate, and spread 1 cup of the frosting over the top. Top with the other layer, and use the remaining frosting to frost the top and sides of the cake. Arrange the 12 whole pecans on top of the cake like the numbers on a clock face, and sprinkle the remaining chopped pecans in between. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 15718,&quot;Potato Salad with Roasted Red Peppers 2 pounds small red bliss potatoes Kosher salt 4 tablespoons canola oil 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon agave syrup 1 clove garlic, minced Freshly cracked black pepper 1/3 cup roasted red peppers, julienned 1 cup finely sliced scallions, optional garnish Instructions: In a medium pot, add the potatoes, some salt and water to cover.

(This sedates them and makes them more manageable.) Meanwhile, combine 1 gallon water, the bay leaves, thyme, red pepper flakes, paprika, parsley and peppercorns in a large pot. Halve the 4 lemons; squeeze the juice into the pot and then add the halves. Season the liquid with salt until it tastes as salty as the ocean. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to a simmer. Kill the lobsters: This is the most humane method: Position the point of a knife on the middle of the back of the head; push the point straight down through the shell and lower the knife through the head. (The lobster may continue to move for a few minutes.) Poach the tails and claws: Hold each lobster over the pot of simmering liquid and twist the tail away from the body. Put the tails in the pot and cook 3 minutes, then twist off the large claws (with the knuckles attached), add to the pot and cook 7 more minutes. Transfer the lobster tails and claws to a bowl with tongs; let cool to room temperature. Make the aioli: Put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard, vinegar, hot sauce and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a food processor; pulse to combine. With the motor running, add the canola oil in a slow, steady stream and process until thick and creamy. Scrape into a bowl and set aside. Shell the lobsters: Stand each claw on one of its narrow edges and whack the top with a knife. Wiggle the knife until a crack runs through the claw. Repeat on the opposite edge, if necessary, to make the crack bisect the shell. Pull the claw apart and remove the meat. Insert the handle of a spoon into each knuckle and twist to pull out the meat. Lay each tail on its side. Put the palm of your hand on top, then press that hand with the heel of your other hand until the shell cracks. Hold the tail with the underside facing up. With your thumbs, grab the edges of the bottom of the shell. Bend back the edges of the shell to crack open the underside and remove the tail meat. Chop the lobster meat: Pull the flat piece of cartilage from the middle of each piece of claw meat and discard. Halve each tail lengthwise and clean out any visible vein or roe. Cut the claw, knuckle and tail meat into bite-size pieces. Make the salad: Combine the lobster meat, celery, about 1/4 cup aioli, the tarragon and chives in a bowl; toss. (Cover and refrigerate the rest of the aioli for up to 4 days.) Scoop the lobster salad onto butter lettuce leaves and sprinkle with more chives. Serve at room temperature with the lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 15728,&quot;Ponzu Salmon Rice Bowls 3 cups frozen cooked brown rice 1 pound skin-on salmon fillets<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon ponzu sauce 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil 2 tablespoons finely chopped pickled ginger, plus 1 tablespoon brine 1/2 teaspoon wasabi paste 3 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced 4 cups baby kale salad mix 8 strips salted seaweed snacks, torn into small pieces 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds Instructions: Heat the brown rice as the label directs; let cool slightly.

When hot, add the garlic, pork and curry paste. Turn the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally to break up the pork, for about 5 minutes until fragrant. While cooking do the following: Pound the jackfruit with the salt in a large mortar and pestle until the jackfruit has been smashed into shreds. Add the tomatoes, fish sauce and lime leaf and pound until combined with the jackfruit but still holding some of their shape. Add to the pan, scraping the mortar with a spatula or spoon to get all the food out. Cook together for about 2 minutes to combine flavors. Taste; it should be rich, a bit salty and a bit sour from the tomatoes. Add 2 tablespoons of the mixed herbs and mix together. Turn onto plate in a mound. Top with the remaining mixed herbs, fried garlic, khaep muu and phrik kaliang. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15741,&quot;Creamy Mushroom Soup 4 tablespoons salted butter 1 1/2 pounds mushrooms, sliced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked 1 medium onion, diced<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 3/4 cup sherry<br> 4 cups vegetable stock<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar<br> Roughly torn fresh parsley, for serving<br> Crusty bread, for serving<br> Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a pot over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, add a third of the mushrooms to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until dark golden brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then remove them from the pot and reserve for serving. In the same pot, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Reduce the heat to medium and, when the butter has melted, add the rest of the mushrooms, along with the garlic, celery, thyme and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle the vegetables with the flour and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, then cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes, allowing the flour to cook. Slowly pour in the sherry, stirring all the time, then slowly add the stock. Keep stirring to reduce the likelihood of lumps. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and thickened, about 20 minutes. Using an immersion blender, puree until the mushrooms are mostly broken up into small barley-sized bits. (NOTE: You may use a blender, though allow the soup to cool until warm before pureeing.) Add the cream and heat until the pot is simmering. Add the balsamic, then taste and adjust the seasonings. Serve warm in bowls with the reserved mushrooms on top. Garnish with parsley and crusty chunks of warm bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 15742,&quot;Pralines 1 cup sugar 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup cream 2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 cups roasted chopped pecans Instructions: In a heavy saucepan combine the sugar, brown sugar, and cream and bring to a boil. Cook on medium heat to softball stage (238 degrees F), then add the butter and pecans. Continue cooking until hardball stage (245 degrees F). Spoon large dollops of it onto a silicone mat or parchment lined baking tray. The pralines will spread and crystallize as they cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Port]&quot; 15743,&quot;Eggs Benedict 3 egg yolks Juice of 2 whole lemons 2 sticks butter, melted and slightly cooled Dash of salt Cayenne pepper 4 whole eggs 2 English muffins, split, toasted and buttered 4 slices Canadian bacon, warmed in a skillet Dash of paprika Instructions: Add the egg yolks to a blender or a food processor. Add in the lemon juice and blend for several seconds. With the blender on, slowly drizzle in the melted butter. Turn off the blender and add in a little salt and cayenne. Whip it again until combined. Set this aside for a minute. Next, poach an egg by gently cracking an egg into simmering, slightly bubbling water. Leave the egg alone for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, and then remove it with a slotted spoon and carefully place it on a plate. Repeat with the remaining eggs. To serve, place a buttered, toasted English muffin half on a plate. Top the English muffin with a warm slice of Canadian bacon. Place the warm poached egg on top. And then drizzle on some warm hollandaise. Sprinkle a little paprika on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15744,&quot;Pumpkin Sticky Buns with Pecan Bourbon Caramel Goodness Nonstick cooking spray 1/2 cup butter 1 tablespoon active dry yeast 1/4 cup warm water 1 cup warm whole milk 1/2 cup granulated sugar 22 ounces solid pumpkin puree, divided 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 5 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus 1/4 cup as needed, plus more for flouring 1 cup dark brown sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Pinch cloves 6 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature 8 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, packed 6 tablespoon light corn syrup 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/3 cup bourbon 2 cups pecan halves, lightly toasted Instructions: For the sticky buns: Melt the butter in heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until it foams, about 5 minutes. As soon as it subsides and begins to have a nutty aroma, pull the saucepan immediately off the heat. The butter will burn quickly so be careful. Set aside to cool. Begin making the sticky dough in a large mixing bowl by sprinkling the yeast over the warm water. Let the yeast sit until slightly foamy and creamy, 5 to 6 minutes. Heat the milk and sugar in a small saucepan over low heat just until the sugar dissolves. Add the browned butter and set aside to cool. Add the cooled milk mixture to the yeast and whisk to combine. Add 15 ounces of the pumpkin puree and the salt and mix with a spatula. The dough will become sticky. Start adding the flour, one cup at a time until you have added all the flour. Feel the dough and if it&#39;s really soft, add an additional 1/4 cup flour. Mix the dough with your hands. While still in the bowl, keep folding the dough onto itself, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the pumpkin dough in a larger lightly-oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and allow the dough to rise until it&#39;s doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours depending on the temperature in your kitchen. I place my dough in the laundry room, it&#39;s the warmest place in my house. When the dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough and either cover and chill the dough overnight or use it right away. In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt and cloves. Toss to mix and set aside. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Remove one piece at a time while keeping the other half covered with plastic wrap. Lightly flour a work surface. Shape the dough into a rectangle. Since the dough is super soft, you may need additional flour. Keep in mind too much flour will make the dough heavy and dry. Roll each piece of dough into a 12- by 18-inch rectangle. Brush off any excess flour. Spread half the softened butter on each rectangle of dough, leaving a 1-inch border across the top length of the dough, followed by the remaining 7 ounces pumpkin puree - it will be messy, that&#39;s ok - and then half the brown sugar mixture. Starting with the wider edge, start rolling the dough from the bottom upwards. Roll this as tightly as you can. When you come up to the 1-inch border, slightly pinch it together. Once completed, set the first log on a baking pan and chill while rolling the remaining dough. Repeat the steps with the remaining dough, making sure to chill each log in between. These logs can be chilled overnight or for 2 hours if you want to bake them the same day. These are much easier to cut when cold. For the caramel: While the dough is chilling, place a small pan over low heat and melt the butter. Add the brown sugar, corn syrup and salt. Increase the heat to medium and whisk until the sugar and syrup are dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, whisk in the bourbon. The caramel should look shiny. If not, put back on the heat for 1 minute. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the muffin pans. Pour about 1 1/2 tablespoon of the warm caramel into each muffin mold. Drop 2 to 3 toasted pecan halves into the caramel. Set aside and allow the caramel to cool to room temperature. Set aside the extra caramel sauce and pecans. Cut each log of buns into eight 1 1/2-inch slices. Round up the buns and fit them into pans, cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm spot until they double in size, about 30 minutes. Bake the buns, 22 to 25 minutes. It&#39;s a bit hard to test for doneness due to the sticky (and yummy) caramel. I tend to slightly under-bake them by 1 to 2 minutes rather than over-bake. Carefully remove the buns from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan, 5 to 10 minutes. Place a baking pan on top of the muffin pan and quickly invert. The buns should slowly unmold. Reheat 1 to 2 minutes if they are sticking. Author: Hedy Goldsmith Date: August 2012 Before serving, toss the remaining pecans with the caramel sauce and add spoonfuls over the tops. These are best eaten warm, not hot, out of the oven. Cook&#39;s Note: Use extra-large muffin pans to bake perfectly shaped sticky buns.

Add 1/2 clove of garlic, salt, pepper, and thyme sprig. Remove from the heat and chill. Dice finely and reserve. Saute the nettles and the remaining 1/2 clove of garlic in a little clarified butter. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and cool. When cooled, mix with the cooled morels. Mix the shallots, ground lamb, hazelnuts, herbs, and bread crumbs in a small bowl. Moisten with the egg until the mixture reaches a spreadable consistency. Chill. Taste the ground lamb mixture by sauteing a small portion to check for seasonings. Season the rack of lamb and sear until golden brown on all sides in clarified butter. Allow to cool on a rack. On a flat surface lay out a sheet of plastic wrap, on top of the plastic, lay a sheet of the caul fat. Season the lamb rack again with salt and pepper. Spread a 1/4-inch layer of the ground lamb mixture on the caul fat, and place the lamb rack (loin side) on the mixture. Spread a little more of the mixture onto the lamb to provide a nice ring around the caul fat. Wrap the caul completely around the lamb rack, taking care not to tear the caul fat. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat a heavy saute pan and place the rack, saddle-side up, in the pan. Baste the rack with the pan juices. To cook caul fat and cause it to shrink, turn the rack over and place in the oven and roast for 10 minutes. Rest in a warm area for 10 minutes to allow the juices to reabsorb and allow the meat and ground lamb mixture to secure together. Serve with Wheat Berry Pilaf. 24 hours before, cover the wheat berries with cold water and set in refrigerator to absorb liquid. Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a large pot, and add the wheat berries. Boil until the wheat berries have softened. Drain and allow to cool, do not rinse with cold water. At serving time, saute 1 tablespoon butter and shallots, carrots, celery and garlic until soft. Add the wheat berries when the aromatics are cooked and saute briefly to coat the berries with the seasonings. Check for salt and pepper. Deglaze with the lamb jus and add the rest of the butter, the albumen and reduce until syrupy. Stir in the thyme leaves and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 15746,&quot;The Best Chicken Tikka Masala 1 1/4 cup whole milk yogurt 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger<br> 4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 1 teaspoon garam masala<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric 2 cloves garlic, finely grated<br> 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 pounds)<br> 4 tablespoons ghee (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 large onion, sliced<br> 2 serrano chiles, stemmed, seeded and chopped<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger<br> 4 cloves garlic, finely grated<br> 2 teaspoons dried whole fenugreek leaves (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 2 teaspoons garam masala<br> 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder<br> 1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika<br> One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> Chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, for serving<br> Basmati rice, for serving<br> Naan, for serving<br> Instructions: For the chicken marinade: Whisk together the yogurt, ginger, salt, chili powder, garam masala, pepper, turmeric and garlic in a large bowl until combined.

Generously butter a 9-inch round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Use a fine grater to zest 1 teaspoon zest from each of the citruses (for a total of 1 tablespoon zest). Reserve the zest for the cake. Cut the top and bottom off of each citrus and place them with a flat side on the cutting board. Then, following the curve of the fruit, use a sharp knife to cut off the peels and as much of the white pith as possible. Slice the fruit crosswise into 1/4-inch thick rounds; carefully remove any seeds. Combine the butter and sugars in a small saucepan and warm over medium-low heat until melted. Pour into the prepared cake pan and spread evenly. Top with the citrus rounds so that they fit very snugly and are slightly overlapping (you may not use every slice). Drizzle with the orange liqueur, if using. For the cake: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Put the butter, sugar and reserved zest in another bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour; mix until just combined. Pour the cake batter over the citrus and bake until a wooden pick inserted into the center just comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the edge of the cake and let it cool for 15 minutes, then carefully invert it onto a platter, replacing any citrus that may have stuck to the pan. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15751,&quot;Grilled T-bone Lamb Chops with Fava Bean and Feta Salad 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon coriander seed, toasted 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 8 t-bone lamb chops 1 small bunch fresh mint, tied together for brushing Blended oil Kosher salt 8 whole fava beans, shelled 1 shallot, minced 2 cloves garlic, smashed and minced Zest and juice of 2 lemons 2 Fresno peppers, thinly sliced Extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 2 cups pitted kalamata olives 4 to 8 ounces crumbled feta (1 cup) 8 to 10 sprigs fresh mint, leaves torn Instructions: For the lamb: Put the salt, coriander seeds, sugar, and red pepper flakes into a mortar and pestle and crush to blend. Place the lamb chops on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Liberally season the chops on both sides with the spice blend. Allow to sit in the refrigerator, covered, for at least 8 to 24 hours before grilling, if possible. This will act as a quick cure, adding more flavor to the lamb when it&#39;s cooked. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Put about 1/2 to 1 cup blended oil into a small bowl. Use the small bunch of mint as a brush and brush the oil onto one side of each lamb chop. Place the oiled-side of the lamb face down on the hot grill. Brush the second side or top of the lamb chop with oil and allow to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reaches 125 to 130 degrees F for medium-rare to medium, about 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once. Allow the chops to rest briefly before serving. For the Fava Bean and Feta Salad: Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Place a large pot of water over high heat and bring to a boil. Add salt to taste. Add the fava beans to the water and blanch for about 40 to 50 seconds, or to al dente. Immediately plunge the beans into the ice bath to cool. Once cooled, remove the second shell and set the shelled beans aside. To a bowl add, the shallot, garlic, and season with salt to help bring out the moisture. Add the juice of 2 lemons, sliced Fresno peppers, 1/2 to 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, and freshly ground black pepper and taste. Add the olives, shelled fava beans, crumbled feta and torn mint leaves. Toss to combine. Taste for seasoning. For each serving, place 2 lamb chops onto a plate. Top with the feta salad, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and zest of 1/4 lemon. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 15752,&quot;Open-Faced Tuna Tea Sandwiches with White Bean Spread One 15-ounce can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained 4 ounces mascarpone, room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (2 small lemons) 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 small lemons) One 6.7-ounce jar tuna packed in olive oil, drained and flaked 2 ribs celery with leaves, finely chopped<br> 3 tablespoons finely chopped fennel or 1 teaspoon fennel seed 2 tablespoons finely chopped fennel fronds 2 tablespoons finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes 1 tablespoon capers, drained and rinsed<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br> 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (1 small lemon) 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 English muffins, halved, lightly toasted<br> 1/4 cup baby arugula<br> Instructions: For the white bean spread: Combine the cannellini beans, mascarpone, salt and lemon zest in a food processor.

For the crust: Combine the butter, flour, and salt in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture looks like Parmesan cheese. Drizzle in half the cold water and pulse until the mixture forms a rough ball, adding the remaining water if needed. Remove the dough from the food processor, form into a disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. For the filling: In a small saucepan, melt the butter and cook it until it starts to brown and begins to smell like hazelnuts. Transfer the butter to the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a paddle. Add the sugar and beat together on medium speed. Gradually add the flour. Once the flour has combined, add the eggs one at a time. Beat in the vanilla bean seeds. For the apples: In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the apples and sugar and cook until the apples start to soften, 6 to7 minutes. Pull the pan off the burner and add in the brandy. Return to the fire and flambe, if desired, or just let the alcohol burn off. Toss in the raisins. To assemble: Remove the dough from the fridge 15 minutes before ready to use, this will allow the dough to soften and come to room temperature. Dust a clean work surface with flour. Roll the dough out 1/8-inch thick and lay it in the tart pan with lots of overhang on the sides. Schmear half the filling into the bottom of the tart pan and top with the apple mixture. Fold the extra dough over the top of the apples. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Bake the tart in the oven until the top is golden brown and slightly crispy, 45 to 50 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 15754,&quot;Salmon with Coconut Sauce 4 tablespoons coconut oil, divided 1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon cardamom seeds 1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds 1 tablespoon ground coriander, plus 1/2 teaspoon to season salmon 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes 1 cup coconut milk Pinch salt and freshly ground pepper 2 (6-ounce) salmon fillets Instructions: For the sauce: Put 2 tablespoons coconut oil into a large skillet over low-med heat and then add ginger.

Transfer to a small bowl. Mix in the Italian seasoning, garlic powder and 1 tablespoon salt. Cut each tenderloin in half crosswise to make 4 equal pieces. Rub the fennel mixture all over pork and let sit at room temperature, uncovered, 1 hour, or chill up to 8 hours. Position a rack in center of oven preheat to 400 degrees F. Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high and cook onion and peppers, tossing occasionally, until they begin to soften, 5 about minutes. Stir in vinegar and season with salt. Let sit until cool enough to handle. Using a sharp knife, cut slices across each tenderloin, about 3/4-inch apart going as deep as possible but without cutting all the way through. Stuff about a tablespoon of onion mixture in between each slit arranging the vegetables neatly so that there is little overhanging the sides of the tenderloin. Repeat with remaining pork and vegetables. Transfer the stuffed tenderloins to a rimmed baking sheet spaced evenly apart and arrange any remaining vegetables around each tenderloin. Roast until thickest part of the tenderloin reaches 140 degrees F, about 20 minutes. Put 2 slices of cheese over each tenderloin and continue to bake until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 15756,&quot;Smoked Pork Loin Center Cut Chops in Belgian Ale Marinade 1 tablespoon 4-color peppercorns 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 1 tablespoon dried bay leaves, chopped 1 tablespoon dried lemon peel 2 teaspoons dried shallots 2 teaspoons roasted freeze-dried garlic 1 teaspoon anise seeds 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon allspice berries 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 24 ounces Belgian ale (recommended: Duvel) 2 tablespoons brown sugar 2 teaspoons sea salt 3 tablespoons grape seed oil 3 tablespoons malt vinegar 1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon leaves 6 whole allspice berries Several grinds Pete&#39;s American BBQ, recipe follows 5 to 6 pound \center-cut\ boneless pork loin, cut into 1-inch chops 5 pounds apple wood chunks 2 sprigs fresh rosemary Water pan, for catching drips Instructions: Combine all the ingredients for the BBQ Blend. In a shallow glass or ceramic casserole whisk together the beer, sugar, salt, oil, vinegar, tarragon, allspice berries, and several grinds of the All-American BBQ Blend. Mix well and add the pork chops, massaging and turning them once in the marinade to coat well. Cover and place in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours, turning once half way through. Remove the meat about 30 minutes before putting on the barbeque to come up to room temperature. Place the apple wood chunks and rosemary sprigs on to soak and start about 15 pounds of charcoal. Place a hotel pan with water in it under the grill where the meat will be smoking to add moisture to the smoke and catch the drips of fat. When the coals are good and white hot, and you have blown on them a few times to stoke the fire, spread them out and add a few drained wood chunks at a time to the hot coals. Be careful not to put the fire out. You should start with only half of the total amount of wood chunks. Stoke the fire some more and close the top to the BBQ. Open the flue and chimney cap. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15757,&quot;Avgolemono 1 3 1/2- to 4-pound whole chicken 1 bay leaf 3 quarts low-sodium chicken broth 1 cup orzo Kosher salt Grated zest and juice of 3 lemons (about 2 tablespoons zest and 1/3 cup juice) 2 tablespoons instant flour (such as Wondra) 2 large eggs 1/2 cup fresh dill, chopped Instructions: Place the chicken, bay leaf and broth? in a large pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer 1 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken to a plate and let it cool. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Clean out any scum in the bottom of the pot and add the broth back to the pot. Bring to a simmer, then add the orzo and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes. Check for seasoning here, as you may need to add a few teaspoons salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the lemon zest and juice and the flour. Whisk the eggs into the lemon mixture. Pour a little of the simmering broth slowly over the egg mixture and whisk it together. Reduce the heat under the broth to low and whisk in the egg mixture. The soup will thicken slightly and become cloudy. Make sure you don\u2019t bring the soup to a rolling boil after you add the eggs. Your eggs will scramble, which will leave you with more of an egg drop soup (which would still be fantastic, but just not the same). Chop up the chicken, removing the skin and bones, and add it to the soup along with the dill. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 15758,&quot;Ginger Pear Tea 1/2 cup sugar 4 cups water 2 pears, peeled and coarsely grated 1-inch piece ginger, sliced into 1/8-inch coins Instructions: In a medium pot bring water, grated pear, ginger and sugar to a boil over medium heat.

Continue mixing and add all the flour and water; continue mixing until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on work surface, and knead the dough until elastic and smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.<br> Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with flour. Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through the pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at its widest setting. Guide the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue until the machine is at its narrowest setting. The dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick.<br> Dust the counter and dough with flour, and lay out the long sheet of pasta. Brush the top surface of dough with egg wash. Drop 1 tablespoon of cooled filling about 2 inches apart on half the sheet of pasta. Fold the unfilled half over the filling. With an espresso cup or finger, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling and form a seal. Use a crimper to cut each pillow into squares. Check to make sure the crimped edges are well sealed before cooking. If making ravioli in advance, dust with cornmeal to prevent them from sticking.<br> Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. Ravioli will float to the top when cooked so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Plate the pasta, top with your favorite pasta sauce and grated cheese before serving. In a mixing bowl, thoroughly combine all ingredients. Chill in the refrigerator a few minutes to firm up the filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 15761,&quot;Herbed Desai Vada with Cilantro Chutney 1/4 cup black Indian chickpeas (chana dal)\u202f 1/4 cup white lentils (urad dal)\u202f 1/4 cup white rice (any kind) 1/4 cup plant-based yogurt\u202f 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\u202f 1 cup sorghum flour 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour\u202f 1/4 cup fresh fenugreek\u202fleaves, chopped 2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped\u202f 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon ground turmeric\u202f 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3 Thai bird chiles, minced One 1/4-inch piece ginger, peeled and grated 1 teaspoon safflower or grapeseed\u202foil, plus more for deep-frying\u202f Kosher salt Cilantro Chutney, recipe follows 3 cups chopped cilantro 3/4 cup roasted split chickpeas (daliya) 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon minced peeled fresh ginger 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon minced Thai bird chiles 1/4 cup ice Kosher salt Instructions: Wash the lentils and rice, then drain.

Drain them then make a puree and reserve it. In a saucepan over medium heat, heat the half-and-half, cream, vanilla, orange rind, and cinnamon stick, whisking occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat and let the flavors infuse for 10 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together. In a thin stream, whisk half of the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Then pour the egg-cream mixture back into the saucepan containing the rest of the cream mixture. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you do not have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Meanwhile, in a bowl put 2 handfuls of ice cubes in the bottom, and add cold water to cover. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Combine the carrot puree with the custard, mixing well.

Combine the gelatin with 2 tablespoons water in a small microwave-safe bowl and set aside to soften, about 5 minutes. Beat the cream cheese on medium-high speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer) until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, sour cream, lemon juice, vanilla and a pinch of kosher salt, and beat on medium-high speed until incorporated and smooth, about 1 minute. Microwave the gelatin until melted, stirring as needed, about 30 seconds. Add the gelatin to the cream cheese mixture and beat on medium-high speed to combine, about 30 seconds. Pour the cream cheese-gelatin mixture into the springform pan and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9-inch cake pan; dust with flour and tap out the excess. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and fine salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla, until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and alternate adding in the flour mixture and the milk, adding the flour in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour. Mix just until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 2 hours. To assemble: Evenly cut the cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife so you have two cakes that are the same height. Remove the sides of the springform pan. Place the bottom layer cake upside down on top of the cheesecake and flip it over so that the cheesecake is now on top of the cake. Remove the parchment paper from the top of the cheesecake and place onto a cake plate or cake stand. Top with the second cake layer and place in the fridge while you make your ganache. Make the ganache: Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring the heavy cream and butter to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour over the chocolate and let it stand for 5 minutes. Stir until completely melted and smooth. Remove the cake from the fridge and pour the ganache over the top of the cake, smoothing out the top with a small offset spatula and letting it drip over the sides. Refrigerate until the chocolate sets, about 20 minutes. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15778,&quot;Atlanta Fish Market Crab Cakes 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons white pepper 4 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons dry mustard 4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 4 teaspoons lemon juice 2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 1 1/3 cups mayonnaise 2 cups soft, white bread crumbs 4 eggs 4 pounds jumbo lump crabmeat, picked clean of all shells, see *Cook&#39;s Note 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 lemon wedges, for serving Tartar sauce, for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine cayenne, white pepper, salt, dry mustard, Worcestershire, lemon juice, seafood seasoning, mayonnaise, bread crumbs, and eggs in a large bowl and mix until thoroughly combined. Place crabmeat in another large bowl and gently fold egg mixture into crabmeat, being careful not to break up large crab pieces. Shape into 4 crab cakes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the crab cakes, in batches if necessary, and cook until lightly browned, approximately 1 minute on each side. Transfer crab cakes to a sheet pan (or place skillet in oven if oven-safe) and finish cooking the crab cakes in the oven until heated through. Serve with lemon wedges and tartar sauce, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15779,&quot;Spaghetti Puttanesca (Scotty&#39;s Style) 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed 2 anchovy fillets, rinsed (if oil-packed) or soaked in a couple changes of water (if salt-packed)<br> 1 shallot, finely sliced<br> 2 cloves garlic, finely sliced<br> 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper<br> 1 sprig oregano, finely chopped<br> 2 plum tomatoes<br> 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves, plus more for garnish if you like<br> 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed (if oil-packed) or soaked in a couple changes of water (if salt-packed)<br> 2 tablespoons pitted and quartered black olives, preferably Gaeta<br> 1 pound dry spaghetti<br> Instructions: In a small skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the anchovies and cook, breaking them up with a fork or wooden spoon, until they have disintegrated into the olive oil. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring, until they just begin to brown. Then add the oregano, if using. To peel the plum tomatoes, use a paring knife to cut a small x on the tomato. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil, and have ready a bowl of ice water. Boil the tomatoes for about 10 seconds, then plunge them into the ice bath. The shock of going from hot to cold should cause the skin to contract, making it easier to peel. Use your fingers or a small paring knife to pull the skin off. If the skin is stubborn, try boiling and shocking the tomato again.<br> Cut the plum tomatoes into 8 pieces and the cherry tomatoes in halves or quarters depending on size. In a bowl, combine the cherry tomatoes, plum tomatoes and parsley. Add the capers and olives and let this mixture sit for a few minutes or up to an hour at room temperature for the combined flavors to develop. (Refrigerate it for any longer stretches and use it within 24 hours.)<br> When ready to serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until just shy of al dente. Before draining, reserve about 1/2 cup of the cooking water. When the pasta is just about done, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add a couple of tablespoons of the olive oil, and when hot, add the tomato mixture to the pan. (You want the tomatoes to have enough surface space so that when they hit the pan, the liquid that is released from them evaporates almost immediately.)<br> Drain the spaghetti, add it to the skillet, and use tongs to toss it with all of the ingredients. Add some of the pasta cooking liquid to the pan as necessary to keep the pasta moist. Transfer the spaghetti to warm bowls and drizzle with a little more of the remaining olive oil and some fresh chopped parsley, if you like.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 15780,&quot;Barilla Whole Grain Rotini with Fresh Bell Peppers 1 box BARILLA Whole Grain Rotini 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided 2 cups (1 medium) white onion, chopped 1 red bell pepper, julienne 1 yellow bell pepper, julienne 1 green bell pepper, julienne Salt to taste Black pepper to taste 4 leaves fresh basil 1/3 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, grated Instructions: BRING a large pot of water to a boil. HEAT half of the olive oil in medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat. ADD onion and saute for 4 minutes or until translucent. ADD peppers, and season with salt and pepper. Add just enough hot water to cover the peppers; simmer for 12 minutes until peppers are tender and water is completely reduced. MEANWHILE, cook pasta according to package directions. DRAIN pasta and add to skillet with onions and peppers. Toss pasta with the remaining oil, basil leaves and cheese before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15781,&quot;Liberty Chocolates 2 cups heavy cream 21 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped Splash Grand Marnier Liberty molds 16 ounces white chocolate, tempere Instructions: Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Make sure you chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about 1/2 of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous. If the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools, it will thicken and set. Use a ladle to fill the mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Use a spatula to spread some of the cooled ganache into the chocolate mold. Fill it just short of the top so there will be room to close the chocolates. When finished, use a spatula to spread tempered white chocolate over the ganache. Allow this to set. When the chocolate has set completely, unmold the chocolates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15782,&quot;Roasted Root Vegetable Pasta Salad 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces penne pasta, cooked and cooled 2 to 3 cups leftover Roasted Root Vegetable Salad recipe, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 medium onion, sliced Instructions: In a small bowl whisk together the oil, vinegar, mustard, and salt and pepper, to taste.

Line a baking sheet with a wire rack. Mix the masa harina and 1 teaspoon salt together in medium bowl. Add the warm water and combine until it comes together, about 30 seconds. Cover the dough and let rest for 8 to 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and roll each into a smooth ball. Keep covered and work quickly. Cut two 8-inch squares of parchment and line a tortilla press. Add a dough ball, then top with the other piece of parchment and press into disc, 5- to 6-inches in diameter. Carefully remove the tortilla and place in the hot oil. Fry the tortilla until it begins to puff, 25 to 30 seconds, then flip the tortilla, cooking another 25 to 30 seconds. Press down in the center of the tortilla with a metal spatula to form a taco shell, submerging the tortilla completely. Fry until golden brown and the taco shell holds its shape, another 30 to 45 seconds. Let drain on a wire rack lined baking sheet, then season with salt and reserve. Repeat with the remaining dough. For the filling: Heat a 12-inch cast-iron pan over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook, stirring to break up; sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook the ground beef fully, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and onion, stirring to prevent burning. Meanwhile, combine the cumin, chili powder, Mexican oregano and cayenne in a bowl, stirring to combine. Once the garlic and onion begin to turn translucent, about 1 minute, add the seasoning mixture and stir to combine. Add the crushed tomatoes to the same bowl and stir to combine, collecting any remaining spices, then add to the pan. Stir together until the beef is coated and allow to simmer until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Equally divide the taco meat into the puffy taco shells. Add equal amounts lettuce, sour cream and pico de gallo to each taco. Grate Cheddar over each taco with a rasp grater.

Salt the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Drain and return them to the pan. Set the pan over low heat and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the excess moisture evaporates. Rice the potatoes in a food mill or ricer into a bowl, or simply put them in a bowl and mash them with a potato masher. Add the butter, working it into the potatoes until blended. In a small saucepan, bring the half-and-half and sliced truffles to a boil over medium heat, infusing the cream with a powerful truffle flavor. Add the mixture to the potatoes slowly, stirring gently, until desired consistency. Do not overmix the potatoes.

Add the onions, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and salt and pepper and cook until the onions are very soft and caramelized, about 25 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the wine has evaporated and the onions are dry, about 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Dust the onions with the flour and give them a stir. Turn the heat down to medium low so the flour doesn&#39;t burn, and cook for 10 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste. Now add the beef broth, bring the soup back to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. When you&#39;re ready to eat, preheat the broiler. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle the slices with the Gruyere and broil until bubbly and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Ladle the soup in bowls and float several of the Gruyere croutons on top. Alternative method: Ladle the soup into bowls, top each with 2 slices of bread and top with cheese.

Preheat a grill to medium low and prepare for indirect cooking: On a gas grill, preheat the grill, then turn off half the burners. On a charcoal grill, light the coals, then bank to one side; put a disposable aluminum drip pan on the unlit side of the grill under the grates. Meanwhile, soak the wood chips in water, 30 minutes; drain.<br> Make the ribs: Turn the ribs bone-side up. Slip a paring knife between the thin membrane and the bone to loosen, then pull off the membrane; trim any excess fat. Season both sides of the racks with the rub (about 1/2 tablespoon per side). Transfer to a roasting pan, bone-side down, and let sit 30 minutes. When the grill registers 250? F, add the wood chips: On a gas grill, fill a smoker box with the chips and use according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; on a charcoal grill, sprinkle the chips over the coals. Place the ribs bone-side down on the cooler side of the grill. Cover the grill and smoke the ribs for 2 hours (if using charcoal, adjust the air vents and add more coals as needed so the temperature stays around 250? F).<br> While the ribs are smoking, lay out 2 long sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil (or double pieces of regular foil). Spread 1/2 tablespoon each of the rub, brown sugar and maple syrup down the center of each piece of foil.<br> Place the ribs, meat-side down, on the prepared foil, then top each rack with another 1/2 tablespoon each of the rub, brown sugar and maple syrup. Fold the foil over the ribs and crimp the edges, leaving one side open; pour 2 tablespoons apple juice into each packet and crimp the final edge to seal. Return to the grill and cook until the meat is tender, 2 to 2 1/2 more hours.<br> Meanwhile, make the barbecue sauce: Heat the canola oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the ketchup, 1/2 cup honey, the tomato paste, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, mustard powder, cayenne and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a low boil, whisking, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Whisk in 1/2 cup water and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup of the rub until dissolved; season with more of the rub, 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed. Let cool.<br> Make the glaze: Whisk 3/4 cup of the barbecue sauce with the remaining 1/4 cup honey. Set aside the rest of the barbecue sauce for serving.<br> Carefully remove the ribs from the foil; return to the grill, meat-side up. Brush with the glaze and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and slice. For \u201cmuddy style,\u201d sprinkle with more of the rub.

Bring a pot of water to a boil and prepare an ice water bath. Blanch the asparagus briefly, then transfer them to the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain and pat dry. In a bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, chiles, pine nuts, raisins, olive oil and garlic. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Butterfly the steak horizontally (the striations and grain should run horizontal at the end), opening the top flap like a book until it is one flat piece. Gently pound out with a meat mallet to even the thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Layer the cheese over the steak, leaving about a 1-inch perimeter. Then add the breadcrumb mixture and spread it within 1 inch of the edge, patting it down evenly. Next, horizontally layer the asparagus in the same fashion. Starting at the shorter end of the steak (the striations and grain of the meat should be running horizontally), tightly roll the steak into a pinwheel, taking care to make it even. Using twine, tightly tie the roll in 1-inch increments, then loop around the edge to seal the sides. Heat one side of a gas grill on high for indirect cooking. For the braciole baste: Combine the olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and oregano in a small bowl and mix together. Season the exterior of the braciole with salt and pepper. Brush with the baste and sear on all 4 sides until properly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Lower the heat to medium and move the braciole to the cool side of the grill. Cover and cook, basting every 5 minutes with the braciole baste, until the internal temperature hits 120 degrees F, 40 to 45 minutes. Tent with foil and let rest for at least 15 minutes. For the braciole sauce: This can be done directly on the grill while the braciole is resting. Heat a large, cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and tomatoes. Give a toss, then don&#39;t move the tomatoes until they start to char and blister, 3 to 4 minutes. Toss again and finish charring for about 3 minutes. Pour into a bowl, toss with the basil and vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Stir until slightly broken and chunky.<br> Remove the string from the braciole, then slice into 1-inch medallions. Serve with the braciole sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 15803,&quot;Cantaloupe Sangria 1 cup seedless green grapes 4 cups cubed cantaloupe (about 1 large cantaloupe, seeded and peeled) 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 lemon, thinly sliced Fresh mint sprigs 1 (750 ml) bottle chilled pinot grigio Instructions:</p><ol><li>Cut the grapes crosswise, then freeze.

Raise the heat to high and add the red wine and reduce by half. Add the broth and reduce by half. Check for seasoning, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Keep warm on low heat. Brush the flank steak on both sides with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and season with the salt and pepper. Place on the center of grill and sear 5 to 8 minutes per side for rare to medium rare, testing by pressing the meat with a finger: The spongier the meat feels, the rarer it is cooked. Remove from the grill and allow to rest, very loosely tented with aluminum foil, 5 to 10 minutes, to allow the juices to reabsorb into the meat. Slice the flank steak on the diagonal and place on a large platter. Finish the sauce by swirling in the chunks of cold butter, then top the steak with some of the sauce and serve the rest on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 15807,&quot;Parmesan Roasted Asparagus 2 1/2 pounds fresh asparagus (about 30 large) 2 tablespoons good olive oil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 2 lemons cut in wedges, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Season the spinach with salt, black pepper, and a little nutmeg. Add the chopped hard-boiled eggs, currants, pine nuts, finely chopped garlic, and cheese to the bowl and gently combine. Season the meat with salt and pepper and arrange each steak with one of the narrow ends near you. Divide the filling evenly among the meat slices. Scatter the filling over the meat leaving a 1/2-inch edge or border on the sides. Fold the edge over the filling and tuck in the edges as you roll each bundle to secure the filling. Wrap and roll the remaining bundles and secure with kitchen twine to cover the ends and middle, like wrapping a package. Heat a large Dutch oven with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil a couple of turns of the pan over medium-high heat. Brown the meat bundles 6 to 8 minutes to evenly caramelize the meat all over. For the sauce: Remove the bundles from the pan and add 1 tablespoon more olive oil, give a turn of the pan to coat. Add the chopped carrots, onions, sliced garlic, bay leaf and season with salt and pepper. Let the vegetables cook 5 minutes to soften, then stir in the chopped rosemary and sage for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir to develop the fragrance, then add the white wine and scrape up the pan drippings. Stir in the chicken stock and tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes with a spoon or potato masher. Bring the sauce to a bubble, add the meat back to the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook 2 hours more, stirring occasionally. After 2 hours, brown the sausages in a frying pan with a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan. Add the browned links to the sauce and gently submerge them, nestling them in with the meat bundles. Simmer the mixture 30 minutes more to cook the sausages through and combine their flavor into the sauce. Bring a pot of water to a boil for pasta. Salt the water and cook the pasta to al dente. Reserve a cup of starchy cooking liquid just before draining. Remove the meat bundles to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove the sausages to a separate plate to cool. Drain the pasta and return to a hot pot. Add 1 tablespoon butter, cut into pieces, and half of the sauce, toss to combine, adding a little starchy cooking water to make it all come together for you. Cut the string from the meat and serve the meat dotted with more sauce and sprinkled with fresh parsley on large dinner plates with hot pappardelle pasta topped with fresh basil and some shaved Parm alongside. Cook&#39;s Note: Reserve the sausages and any remaining spoonfuls of sauce for a make-ahead meal later in the week. Open Faced Sausage, 3 Pepper and Onion Sandwiches with Provolone, recipe follows. Special equipment: Kitchen twine . To make sandwiches: If you are cooking a make-ahead meal with bread that will not be used for a couple of days, place it in the freezer in an airtight bag or wrap well. Unwrap to defrost at room temperature and then crust in a warm oven. Meanwhile, heat a couple of tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, cubanelle peppers, cl pepper, and garlic to tender-crisp, 5 minutes more. Cook&#39;s Note: Do not salt the onions and peppers as it will draw more liquids out and we are undercooking a bit for a make-ahead meal. Cool and store the mushroom mixture. To reheat the mushroom mixture: Add a splash of stock or water over medium heat and season with salt and pepper. To reheat the sausages: Add a splash of stock or water to the sausages to loosen the sauce. Add a ladle of sauce to the mushroom pan. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Split the bread horizontally then halve into 4 large pieces. Arrange the bread pieces on cooling racks set over baking sheets to allow the heat to circulate all around the bread. Halve the sausages lengthwise. Dot the bread with sauce, top with the sausages cut-side-down, dot with more sauce and top with peppers and cheese. Bake the bread 12 to 15 minutes, or until melted and brown at the edges. Garnish with parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 15822,&quot;Spanish Egg Tortilla with Charred Peppers, Goat Cheese, Potatoes and Caramelized Onions with Parsley Salad in Sherry Vinaigrette 2 red peppers 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 Spanish onions, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped Salt and pepper 4 small new potatoes 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil Charred peppers Caramelized onions Roasted potatoes 12 eggs, lightly beaten 1/4 pound goat cheese, crumbled Finely chopped fresh parsley 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 bunch curly parsley leaves 2 scallions including green tops, thinly sliced 6 cherry tomatoes, cut in half 4 button mushrooms, cleaned and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts Instructions: For the Charred Peppers: Preheat broiler.

Whisk together 2/3 cup of the buttermilk, the sour cream, eggs, yolks, 1 tablespoon of the vanilla paste and the oil in a medium bowl until completely combined. Fold the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients just until a soft and sticky dough comes together (do not overwork). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and liberally dust with flour (about 1/3 cup). Scrape the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Dust your hands and the top of the dough with more flour, then gently pat the dough to 3/4-inch thick.\u202f<br> Working on the baking sheet, punch out as many rounds as you can with a 3 1/4-inch cutter. Then use a 1 1/4-inch cutter to punch out the center of each round. Dip the cutters in flour before each cut to avoid sticking. Gather the dough scraps and gently re-roll without overworking the dough. Repeat cutting until all the dough has been used (you should have 8 doughnuts).<br> Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and line a second rimmed baking sheet with several layers of paper towels. Fit a large heavy pot with a deep-fry thermometer and pour in oil to a depth of 3 inches. Heat over medium-high until the thermometer registers 375 degrees F.<br> Fry the doughnuts in batches until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the wire rack and let cool slightly. Fry the doughnut holes until deep golden brown, about 90 seconds per side. Transfer to the wire rack and let drain for 1 minute. Then transfer to the paper-towel lined baking sheet to cool for 10 minutes before glazing. (This two-step process gets a lot more oil out of the doughnuts than using only one method.) Repeat with the remaining dough, making sure the oil returns to temperature between batches. \u202f<br> Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, the remaining 6 tablespoons buttermilk, the remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla paste and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until the glaze is smooth and the consistency of honey; add more confectioners&#39; sugar or buttermilk if necessary.<br> Dip each doughnut into the glaze on one side (we like the craggy side, it has more texture for an appetizing appearance), letting the excess drip back into the bowl, then return it to the wire rack. Toss the doughnut holes in the glaze to coat completely and return to the wire rack. Let the glaze set for 10 minutes before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15840,&quot;Exotic Panna Cotta with Tropical Sorbet 8 3/4 ounces heavy cream 1 3/4 ounces tropical puree 1 1/2 ounces sugar 1 sheet gelatin Exotic Jelly, recipe follows Exotic Fruit Soup, recipe follows 8 3/4 ounces tropical puree 1 3/4 ounces sugar 1 sheet gelatin 1-ounce mango puree 1-ounce papaya puree 1/2-ounce passion fruit puree 1-ounce Exotic Syrup, recipe follows 1/2 cup diced mango 1/2 cup diced papaya 1/2 cup diced pineapple 1/2 lemon, zested 1/2 orange, zested 1/2 vanilla bean, cut in 1/2 lengthwise 1/2 cinnamon stick 4 ounces sugar 1 cup water Instructions: Combine the cream, puree, and sugar in a small saucepan and warm over low heat.

Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and bake until toasted, 12 to 15 minutes; let cool completely. Combine 1 cup each hazelnuts and sugar and the potato starch in a blender or food processor and pulse until very finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl. Reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a bowl as a guide, draw three 7-inch circles on the parchment with a pencil (2 circles on 1 piece and 1 circle on the other); flip the parchment so the markings face down. Put the egg whites, 1/2 cup sugar and the salt in a large heatproof bowl. Set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) and whisk until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is warm, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff and shiny but not dry, about 2 minutes. Fold the milk and one-quarter of the egg white mixture into the nut mixture with a rubber spatula until smooth, then fold in the remaining egg whites until just combined. Divide the batter among the 3 circles on the parchment and spread evenly with an offset spatula to fill the circles. Bake 1 hour, 30 minutes, then switch the position of the pans and continue baking until firm, dry and golden, 1 to 2 more hours. (The layers are done when they easily peel off the parchment.) Let cool slightly on the baking sheets; peel off the parchment and transfer to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the ganache: Put 1 cup cream in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave until very hot, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the chocolate and espresso powder until smooth. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until cold, thick and spreadable, at least 30 minutes. Make the whipped cream: Combine the remaining 4 cups cream and 1/3 cup sugar in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium speed until it barely holds soft peaks, 1 to 2 minutes. Finish beating the cream by hand with a whisk until soft peaks form; do not overbeat. Put 2 meringue layers on a baking sheet; spread half of the ganache on each, to the edge. Refrigerate until set, 15 minutes. (If the ganache is too firm to spread, microwave in 20-second intervals to soften.) Place one of the ganache-topped meringues on a platter. Spread with 1 cup whipped cream. Stack the other ganache-topped meringue on top; spread with another layer of whipped cream. Top with the last meringue, then cover the top and side of the cake with the remaining whipped cream. Chop the remaining 1/3 cup hazelnuts and sprinkle on top of the cake along with the shaved chocolate.

Transfer the tots to a flame-proof dish that you can also serve in; a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, a nice ceramic baking dish or anything that holds about 3 quarts will work. Evenly top the tots with the chopped kimchi and shredded Cheddar. Bake until the cheese is melted, the kimchi is hot and the edges start to brown, about 10 minutes. While the tots bake, make the yogurt sauce: Combine the yogurt, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, lemon juice, kimchi brine and salt in a small or medium bowl. Whisk to combine and set aside. (The yogurt sauce can be made ahead of time and refrigerated; if it separates a little just give a quick stir.) Turn on the broiler to the highest setting and broil until the cheese is brown and speckly and the edges of the kimchi are browned; start checking after about 3 minutes. Top the tots with Pickled Onions, yogurt sauce, mayo and scallions. Serve immediately with lemon wedges. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the apple cider vinegar, sugar, salt, mustard seed and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil and let cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved, Remove from the heat and pour over the onions in a medium bowl. Refrigerate until you are ready to serve.

Simmer for about 3 hours, keeping the lid of the pot slightly askew to prevent condensation of the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 15930,&quot;Leg of Venison with Cider-Baked Apples, Red Chard, and Cranberry Sauce 2 teaspoons black peppercorns 2 teaspoons juniper berries 2 teaspoons fennel seeds 2 teaspoons dried or fresh thyme leaves 1/2 cup olive oil 1 (3-pound) boneless venison leg roast or turkey breast, trimmed and tied 1 cinnamon stick, snapped in half 4 teaspoons fennel seeds 4 teaspoons whole cloves 4 teaspoons black peppercorns 4 teaspoons juniper berries 6 cups fresh cranberries (about 12 ounces) 1 1/2 cups red wine, such as pinot noir 1 cup balsamic vinegar 2/3 cup sugar 2/3 cup undiluted orange juice concentrate 4 cups apple cider 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 6 star anise pods (optional) 2 cinnamon sticks 4 whole cloves 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 cup unsalted butter 4 Braeburn, Jonathan, Gala, or Red Delicious apples, cored and halved lengthwise 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 bunches firm red or white chard, stemmed 1/4 cup apple cider (or cider residue from baked apples) 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To prepare venison: In a spice grinder or food processor, grind the peppercorns, juniper berries, fennel seeds, and thyme together. Mix with 4 tablespoons of the olive oil and rub on the venison. Cover and let stand in the refrigerator for 4 to 12 hours. Remove the venison from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to come to room temperature. To make the cranberry sauce: In a food processor or spice grinder, coarsely grind the cinnamon, fennel seeds, cloves, peppercorns, and juniper berries together. Place in a cheesecloth square and tie closed with a string. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine the cranberries, wine, vinegar, sugar, and orange juice concentrate. Add the spice bundle and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cranberries are very soft. Remove the spice bundle, pour the sauce into a bowl, and let cool. Use now, or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before serving. While the cranberry sauce cools, make the baked apples: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, cook the cider, vinegar, star anise, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and butter for 5 minutes. Place the apples, cut-side down, in a baking pan. Pour the cider mixture over the apples. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until semisoft; set aside and keep warm, or reheat just before serving. To make the venison: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 4 tablespoons oil and brown the venison on all sides. Place on a rack in a roasting pan and roast in the oven for about 50 minutes for medium-rare. For medium-done, roast 6 to 7 minutes longer. Remove the venison from the oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let stand for 5 minutes before slicing. To make the chard: In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chard and apple cider and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, transfer the venison to a platter and arrange the apples beside it. Divide the chard and cranberry sauce between bowls. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Riesling]&quot; 15931,&quot;Baked Pears with Currants and Cinnamon 6 firm green Anjou pears, peeled, halved and cored 3 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 3 tablespoons coconut oil, cut into 12 small pieces<br> 3/4 cup white wine<br> 1/4 to 1/2 cup dried currants<br> 6 ounces mascarpone, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Roll out 1 puff pastry sheet with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface to a 12-inch square. Whisk the egg in a small bowl with 1 tablespoon water until blended. Brush the dough with a thin layer of the egg wash. Sprinkle half the Asiago onto the dough, and press it in with the rolling pin or the back of a measuring cup. Cut the dough in half horizontally (a pizza roller is very handy for this). Place one half on top of the other, cheese-side up. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch vertical strips; you should have 24. Pick up 1 strip with a hand on each end, and twist in opposite directions until you have made a spiral. Place the spiral on the baking sheet, and gently pinch the ends to adhere them to the parchment. Continue with the remaining strips, placing them about an inch apart, 12 per baking sheet. Brush the twisted dough with the egg wash, and bake until golden and puffy, 15 to 17 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Let cool completely on the baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining puff pastry and cheese to make 24 more cheese straws.

Lay out the turkey breast on a flat surface with the skin side down. Pull the fillet (the piece that is loosely attached to the center of the breast on the opposite side from the skin) toward the middle of the breast so that it lays flat. Split open the large end of the turkey breast, while still keeping it attached to the rest of the breast, and lay next to the fillets. You should have a turkey breast that is roughly rectangular. Cover with plastic wrap and pound with a mallet until the surface is even and flat. Season the flattened breast with kosher salt and Szechuan peppercorns. Sprinkle the surface with the chopped herbs. Cover with the prosciutto. Starting with the end closest to you, roll tightly into a cylinder and tie every 2 inches with the butcher&#39;s twine. Season trhe outside with Kosher salt and Szechuan peppercorns. Place in a roasting pan and bake for about 1 1/2 hours, or until an internal temperature of 140 degrees is reached.<br> To preapre the roasted vegetables: Toss the onions, carrots, turnips, and parsnips in the oil and vinegar. After the ballotine has been cooking for 45 mintues, add the vegetables to the roasting pan. When the ballotine and vegetables are cooked, remove them from the oven. Let the turkey rest for 20 minutes, loosely covered with aluminum foil. To serve, remove the strings from the turkey (scissors work best for this), slice, and serve with the roasted vegetables. Wine Notes To satisfy everyones taste, it is traditional to serve both red and white wine at the Wente family Thanksgiving dinner. More importantly, it is not necessarily the turkey that you are trying to pair with the wine. The other side dishes, gravies, and stuffing may have the stronger flavors and intensity with which the wines need to be paired. For a white wine, we usually serve a Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon blend or a full-bodied Chardonnay--both providing enough flavor and weight. We generally tend toward a light to medium-bodied red wine with nice acid, balanced tannins, and rich fruit, such as a Pinot Noir or Merlot. Whatever you choose, remember that there is no one right answer to a melting pot of traditions and flavors. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay]&quot; 15951,&quot;Instant Pot Chili 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 1/2 pounds ground chuck 1/4 cup chili powder Kosher salt<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 large onion, chopped One 15-ounce can fire-roasted tomatoes One 15-ounce can pinto beans, rinsed and drained 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon instant coffee or unsweetened cocoa powder For serving: cooked rice, grated cheese, sour cream and pickled jalape?os (or your favorite chili toppings) Instructions: Turn a 6-quart Instant Pot? to the normal saute setting and add the oil.

Preheat the oven 425 degrees F. You can make the stuffing in advance.<br> Soak the prunes in hot tea (Earl Grey) until soft, stone them and drain, or get pre-stoned ones - easier. Place prunes, vermouth and stock in a saucepan, bring to the boil, then simmer for ten minutes until tender. Strain but reserve the liquid.<br> Melt the butter in a little pan and gently fry the shallots and liver for a couple of minutes, stirring all the while. Place in a mixing-bowl which will hold all the ingredients. Boil the port in the same pan until reduced to two tablespoons, scrape round the sides and add to the liver mixture. Beat the pate, bread crumbs, allspice and thyme together and combine thoroughly with the rest. Season with salt and a good quantity of the pepper. Stir in the prunes.<br> Put the goose in the sink and pour a kettle of boiling water over it. This ensures a good, crisp skin. Remove and dry with kitchen towels. Salt the cavity and fill loosely with the stuffing, then sew up the vent. Prick the skin all over but not the flesh. Place on the grid in the roasting pan and roast breastside up for 15 minutes.<br> Lower heat to 350 degrees F, turn the goose onto its side. Halfway through, turn onto the other side, then for the last 15 minutes onto its back again. Throughout the cooking, baste every 20 minutes with three tablespoons of boiling water and remove the fat from the pan into a bowl. The easiest way to perform both these operations is with a bulb baster. The whole cooking time should be 2 1/2 hours. Test by piercing the thickest part of the thigh: the juices should run pale yellow.<br> When ready, the goose should be put on a very hot dish. Pour off the remaining fat from the roasting pan and make the gravy from the reserved prune liquid, adding it to the residual juices in the pan. Bring to the boil and simmer for a few minutes, adjust the seasoning, strain into a sauce boat and hand round separately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]</p><p>&quot; 15976,&quot;Orange Monkey Bread with Strawberry Coulis Cooking spray 1 16-ounce tube refrigerated biscuit dough 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup strawberries, chopped 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Instructions: Make the monkey bread: Preheat the oven to 375? and coat an 8-inch (6-cup) Bundt pan with cooking spray.

Preheat oven safe skillet over high heat or wrap rubber handles in double layers of foil to protect the surface in the oven. Prick the potatoes 3 or 4 times each with a fork and cook them in the microwave on high for 5 minutes. Pat cod dry and squeeze a little lemon juice over it and season with salt. Drizzle fish with extra-virgin olive oil. When potatoes cool just enough to handle, slice them into 1/4-inch pieces lengthwise. Coat them with extra-virgin olive oil and salt and pepper. Arrange them on a cookie sheet in a single layer and roast them for 20 minutes. Do not move them or turn them as they cook. Chop tarragon, chives and parsley and combine and reserve. Add cod seasoned side down to very hot skillet. Sear it 2 minutes, then drizzle the tomatoes with extra-virgin olive oil and season them with salt and pepper and add them to the fish. Sear tomatoes 1 minute, then transfer the pan to the oven and roast the fish and tomatoes 8 minutes until fish if firm and opaque and tomatoes have all burst. Place parsley, mint, chicken stock and shallot in food processor or blender and puree. Transfer to small sauce pot and bring to a simmer. Season the broth with salt and pepper, to your taste. Heat the light frying oil in small skillet over medium heat. Add sliced garlic to the hot oil and let it fry until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain garlic chips on a paper towel and reserve. When the potatoes are very brown and crisp on the bottom side and tender on the top side, remove. Coat sliced potatoes liberally with the chopped herbs. Pour warm pesto broth onto each dinner plate. Remove the fish from the oven. The bottom should be crisp and brown. Turn the fish over to place the crispy side up in pools of parsley-mint broth. Arrange the herb potato slices and tomatoes decoratively around the fish.

Meanwhile, pour the vegetable broth into a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add in the green onions, season with salt and pepper and cook just until bright green and starting to lightly color, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the garlic, allowing the residual heat from the pan to lightly cook the garlic for about 30 seconds. Transfer to the blender. Add the herbs, lemon zest, lemon juice and 3 cups of the hot broth. Place the lid on the blender, remove the vent cap, cover with a kitchen towel and blend on high until smooth. Add in the Pecorino cheese, if using. Season to taste with more salt, pepper and lemon juice. For a thinner soup, add more stock. Blend to combine. Serve as is topped with sour cream, yogurt or crme fra?che and Pecorino cheese, if using. This soup can also be served chilled or heated to a higher temperature (though additional heating might tone down the bright green color). Combine the cream and buttermilk in a glass jar and cover with a clean kitchen towel or paper towel affixed with a rubber band. Leave the mixture out on the counter at room temperature, undisturbed, for 12 to 24 hours, until thick. Stir and cover with an airtight lid and transfer to the fridge until ready to use for up to 10 days. Feel free to up the flavor by stirring in some lemon zest, lemon juice, pepper or finely chopped herbs just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 15998,&quot;Buttery Pretzels 1 tablespoon active dry yeast 2 sticks unsalted butter 5 tablespoons packed light brown sugar<br> 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading<br> 1 tablespoon fine salt<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing the bowl and baking sheet 3/4 cup baking soda<br> Pretzel salt, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: Add the yeast to 2 cups warm water (no hotter than 110 degrees F) in a bowl and whisk until dissolved. Slice 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) of the butter into thin slices. Lightly whisk the butter slices and brown sugar into the yeast mixture, then fold in 2 cups of the flour with a rubber spatula until combined. Add the salt and remaining 2 1/2 cups flour and mix until combined; the dough will be sticky. Place the dough on a floured surfaced and knead until smooth but still slightly sticky, 8 to 10 minutes. Place in a bowl that has been sprayed with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to double in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Deflate the dough by punching it in the center, then, on a lightly floured surface, divide it into 12 pieces. Roll the pieces until they are about 1/2 inch thick, then form each into a pretzel shape. Whisk the baking soda into 4 cups warm water until dissolved. Dip each pretzel into the mixture, then place on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with pretzel salt and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1 1/2 sticks butter and transfer to a shallow dish. When the pretzels are done, dip the salt side of each in the butter. Place on a drying rack and allow to cool slightly. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 15999,&quot;Fruit-Sweetened Lemonade 2 Golden Delicious apples, cored and cut into chunks 2 small lemons, peel removed and flesh cut into chunks Kosher salt Instructions: Set up your juicer and turn it on.

Add the pastina and cook for half the time recommended on the package. The pasta should still be very firm in the center as it will be cooked more. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta, rinse with cold water, and drain again. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil to keep the pasta from sticking together. (You can prepare the pasta to this point up to 8 hours ahead; refrigerate it until you are ready to finish the dish). Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Add the garlic and saute until browned. Add the oregano and cook briefly to release its fragrance, then add 1 1/2 cups water. Bring the liquid to a boil, add the partially cooked pasta, and stir to coat. Add 1 cup stock or broth, season with salt and pepper, and simmer until all the liquid has been absorbed, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the Roasted Tomato and Pepper Sauce and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, then stir in the spinach to wilt. Thin, if desired, with some of the reserved pasta water. Remove from the heat, place in serving spoons and sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Serve warm. Note: If you don&#39;t have any small pasta shapes in the pantry, you can grind spaghetti in your food processor until it&#39;s reduced to short lengths. Put the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the broiler to high. Smash the tomatoes with your hands and put them and their juice to a large bowl. Add the peppers, garlic, oil, vinegar, and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper and mix the ingredients well. Pour out onto a shallow baking pan and place the pan on the middle rack of the oven under the broiler for 15 minutes. Give the mixture a good stir and cook for another 15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender. Puree the mixture in batches in a blender. (Do not fill the blender more than half full and hold a kitchen towel firmly over the blender lid while pureeing. Hot liquids can expand causing the lid the pop off and the hot liquid to splatter.) If not using right away, allow to cool to room temperature before refrigerating.

Slather on the lamb chops. Marinate the chops at room temperature up to 2 hours or in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. For the tzatziki: Combine all the ingredients. Season with more salt, if necessary. Let sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature before serving. Preheat the grill to medium. When the grill is hot, brush the grates with a wire grill brush to loosen any crud. Wipe the grates with an oiled side towel to pick up any loose soot or crud. If the lamb was in the refrigerator, let it come to room temperature before grilling. Arrange the lamb chops on the grill. Do not move the chops for 2 to 3 minutes to allow lovely grill marks to form. Rotate the chops 90 degrees to create cross-hatch grill marks, and grill for another 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the chops and repeat the process. Remove the chops from the grill to a platter and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. For the salad: Toss the arugula with the lemon juice, big fat finishing oil, and salt. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary, and sprinkle with the crumbled feta. Divide the salad among 4 serving plates and top with a lamb chop. This will slightly wilt the salad. Drizzle with big fat finishing oil and top with a dollop of tzatziki. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 16002,&quot;Hoboken Eddie&#39;s Root Beer Chicken 2 (12-ounce) bottles root beer 2 tablespoons oil Salt and pepper 4 (6-ounce) boneless chicken breast Jamaican Jerk rice: 8 cups water 4 cups white rice 4 tablespoons Jalapeno sauce (recommended: Hoboken Eddie&#39;s Mean Green Sauce) 4 tablespoons Teriyaki with Wasabi and Ginger Sauce (recommended: Hoboken Eddie&#39;s Hukilau Hanna Sauce) 4 tablespoons hot red pepper sauce (recommended: Hoboken Eddie&#39;s Hot Sauce) 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon allspice 4 bananas, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds 1 tablespoon butter 1 Scotch bonnet pepper, seeded and thinly sliced</em> Instructions: Place root beer in a saucepan and bring to a boil.

Set aside to cool.<br> Put the Big Four Paste and the minced garlic in a mortar and pound until blended into a paste. Add the unpeeled garlic cloves and pound until the garlic and peels are blended into the paste. Do not worry if the membrane is separated from the cloves. (You may want to remove the peel; I encourage you to try it the authentic Thai way. It may seem unusual, but the reward is the wonderful texture and added taste of crispy garlic peel.) Add the chiles and continue pounding. Add the green peppercorns and, instead of pounding, crush them by pressing them against the side of the mortar in a circular motion. Transfer the paste to a small bowl and set aside. The paste will keep well in a jar with a tight-fitting lid in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.<br> Trim any fat from the chicken breast. Cut the breast in half. Working with one half breast at a time, slice horizontally almost but not quite in half. Open the meat up into a butterfly shape. Put your hand firmly on top of the meat and press down on it to flatten it. Using a very sharp knife, held at a 75-degree angle to the work surface, slice thinly against the grain into 2 to 3 long pieces. Try to keep the pieces the same size and thickness. Set aside on a plate.

Add the oil, then add the cl paste, stirring it quickly, until it turns slightly brown and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken, lower the heat to medium, and sprinkle a bit of water into the pan to prevent the paste from burning. Try to keep the chicken pieces flat as you saute them to ensure even cooking. When the chicken is browned, push it to one side of the skillet and add the fish sauce and sugar to the center of the skillet. Stir and blend until the mixture bubbles, then push the chicken pieces into it while you continue to stir until the chicken is coated. If needed, sprinkle a bit more water to prevent sticking.

In a large skillet, preheated over high heat, pan-broil the steaks, until the large ones are almost done to taste, or the small ones are well browned. If using large steaks, you probably will not be able to fit them all in the pan at once. Do a couple at a time, then remove them and set them aside while cooking the rest. The small steaks should fit comfortably in the pan side by side, but if they crowd the pan, do not brown them all at once. When all the steaks have been cooked, pour off any fat in the skillet.<br> Add the 2 cups of tomato sauce and dried oregano to the pan, scraping up any brown film or bits in the pan. Return the cubed steaks to the pan if you are using them and they were set aside. Bring to a simmer over high heat. If using cubed steaks, cover the pan and adjust the heat so the tomatoes simmer gently for about 40 minutes, or until the meat is tender.<br> Place each steak on dinner plate and top with sauce. If the sauce on the cubed steaks is not thick enough, uncover pan at the end of the cooking time and reduce.<br> In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan, combine the oil and onion and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onion is fully tender and golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Or, over medium-low heat, combine the oil and the garlic. Cook the garlic, pressing it into the oil a couple of times to release its flavor, until it barely begins to color on both sides. Remove the garlic.<br> With a food mill, puree the tomatoes directly into the pot and stir well. Add salt and either hot pepper flakes or black pepper to taste.

Lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes. Strain the stock, return to the pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce the stock to 2 1/2 cups. (The stock can be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated, covered.) Make the Soup: Combine all of the ingredients in a non-reactive pot, season with salt, to taste, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the celeriac is tender. Strain the soup, reserving the celeriac and liquid separately. Working in small batches, puree the celeriac with enough liquid to let the blender blades spin, and transfer to a bowl. Whisk enough liquid into the puree to reach a soup-like consistency. Strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve. . (The soup can be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated, covered.) To make the Glazed Celeriac: Combine all the ingredients in a large skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the water has evaporated and the celeriac is glazed. Set aside. To make the Curried Apple and Celery: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Combine the honey, butter, curry powder, and salt in a medium oven-proof skillet and cook, until fragrant and bubbling, stirring occasionally over medium heat. Add the apples and baste them with the curry mixture, using a kitchen spoon. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake, basting every 15 minutes, until the apples are tender and glazed, about 1 hour. Let the apples and cool. Core the apples and cut into slices about 1/16 inch thick. Set aside. (The apples can be made up a day in advance and refrigerated, covered.) Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil. Using a peeler, peel the celery, removing the strings. Thinly slice the celery on the diagonal, add to the water, and cook until crisp-tender, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the celery to a bowl of ice-water, to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside. When ready to serve, arrange the glazed celeriac, curried apple, and celery in the bottom of 8 soup plates. Meanwhile, bring the soup to a boil in a teapot.

Transfer to a small saucepan and stir in the almond milk, sugar, honey, vanilla, salt and lemon zest and juice. Bring to a rapid simmer and cook, stirring often, until thick and jammy (if you draw a spoon across the bottom of the pan, you will see a line), 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely. (You can refrigerate to expedite the process.) For the dough: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the coconut oil and sugar in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on high speed until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the lemon zest and 2 of the eggs, then beat until very smooth, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and beat on medium-low just until the dough comes together and cleans the side of the bowl. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill until the dough firms up enough to be rolled but is not so cold that it will crack, about 15 minutes. (You can make the dough ahead and refrigerate, but let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes or so before rolling.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg with a splash of water. Cut the dough in half. Roll one piece on a floured work surface to about 1/8-inch thick. Use a 3-inch ring cutter to cut out as many circles as you can, saving the scraps. To form the hamantaschen, brush a circle with the egg wash and dollop about a teaspoon of filling in the center. Fold the dough up into 3 corners to form a triangle with the filling exposed in the middle. (Don&#39;t worry if the hamantaschen don&#39;t look completely full at this point; the filling expands as it bakes.) Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining circles and dough half, rerolling the scraps once, if desired. Have your sprinkles standing by. Brush the hamantaschen with the egg wash (just the dough, not the filling). Bake, rotating the trays from top to bottom halfway through baking, until the filling is bubbly and the dough is set and light golden, about 12 minutes. While the filling is still hot, top with the sprinkles.

They won&#39;t need much, but keep an eye - some fillets may be thicker than others - and remove to a couple of warm plates, tented with foil, as they&#39;re cooked. I think those look best with the pearly pink skin uppermost. When all the fish fillets are cooked, add a tablespoon of olive oil plus the dribble of anchovy oil to the pan and stir in the minced garlic and the anchovy fillets. Keep stirring with a wooden spoon or spatula and, as the oil warms, the garlic should soften and the anchovies seem to melt into a sauce. Add most of the thyme leaves, then the sherry. After a scant minute&#39;s bubbling, replace the wooden spoon in your hand with a wire whisk or a handheld mixer or electric whisk - one of my favorite pieces of equipment - and, off the heat, whisk in the butter. Pour this amount of viscous sauce over the 2 plates of fish (this is for flavoring, not coverage), then sprinkle with the few remaining thyme leaves. Serve with the chickpeas and tomato salad. I know this sounds like a lot for 8, but I like to work on making enough for half those present to have second helpings. At any rate, I&#39;ve found that a good rule of thumb. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 16032,&quot;DQ Bourbon Pecan Pie 8 tablespoons butter, chilled 4 tablespoons vegetable shortening, chilled 1 1/2 cups flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 5 tablespoons water, chilled with ice Optional: Substitute 1 tablespoon cider vinegar for 1 tablespoon water 1 1/2 cups pecan halves, toasted lightly 3 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons bourbon 3 eggs, beaten slightly 1 cup dark corn syrup 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 2/3 cup sugar Pinch salt 2 cups sweetened whipped cream, for garnish Instructions: Prepare flaky pie crust in advance. Cut firmly chilled butter and shortening into small pieces. Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse for 10 seconds. Add chilled shortening and butter and pulse for about 20 seconds longer, or until the pieces of mixture are about the size of very small peas. Add chilled water (or water and vinegar) and mix for about 10 seconds. Do not overmix or the dough will be tough. Transfer to a floured cutting board and knead lightly until the mixture forms a dough. If the mixture is already together, immediately form the dough into a round disk about 5 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a diameter of about 12 inches. Transfer the dough circle into 9-inch glass pie plate and crimp edges. Place in refrigerator for 20 minutes. While crust is resting, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toast pecans lightly on cookie sheet for 3 to 5 minutes. Also, cut a parchment paper circle the size of the bottom of the pie plate. Prick the bottom of chilled crust with fork. Just before baking crust, set parchment paper circle on chilled dough and cover with a layer of dry beans or rice. Bake crust for 10 minutes, until the top edge just starts to brown. Remove beans/rice and paper and return crust to oven for about 5 minutes to lightly brown the crust bottom. If the crust edge is browning too quickly, cover the edge with foil or turn down the temperature of the oven to 325 degrees F. Remove crust from oven and cool. Just before baking, make the Bourbon Pecan Pie filling: In a saucepan melt butter, and add remaining filling ingredients, except pecans. Over a low flame, stir filling until the mixture reaches about 100 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Pour heated filling into prebaked crust and arrange the pecans decoratively on top. Bake until the filling has started to rise and a knife inserted into the center comes out sticky but hot, about 30 to 40 minutes. The pie will not be completely set in the center at this point but it will continue to cook a bit when out of oven. This method yields a rich, creamy texture. Cool for at least 1 hour and serve with sweetened whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 16033,&quot;Sesame Corn and Basil Saute 2 1/2 teaspoons sesame seeds 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 6 ears fresh corn, shucked and kernels cut off the cobs (about 4 cups)<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons fresh basil chiffonade<br> Instructions: Lightly toast the sesame seeds in a large skillet over medium heat, taking care not to burn them, 2 to 3 minutes.

Apples start with approximately 2 pounds of apple to yield 1 1/4 pounds of diced apple. Place in a mixing bowl and mix with the lemon juice. This will keep the apple from discoloring. Before dicing the celery, blanch it in boiling water for 60 seconds and cool it with cold water. This will bring out the sweet flavor and extend the salads shelf life. Combine diced apple, lemon juice, mayonnaise, celery and chill. Serve on a bed of lettuce topped with walnuts and add a simple fruit garnish. Traditionally this is also served with tiny sweet finger sandwiches. (Example: date nut bread and raspberry jam.)

Place the sauerkraut in a colander and rinse briefly to remove some of the salt from the brine-don&#39;t rinse it too much, or you will lose a lot of the flavor. (Alternatively, if the sauerkraut is not excessively salty, use as is.) Press to release most of the excess liquid and set aside. In a large nonreactive skillet, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat and add the bacon. Cook until most of the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Add the onions and continue to cook until they are soft but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon-onion mixture to a nonreactive roasting pan or large ovenproof Dutch oven. Add the drained sauerkraut and toss to combine. Using a small piece of cheesecloth, make a bouquet garni with the thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, juniper berries, and garlic and place in the baking dish. Add the ham hocks, chicken stock, and beer and stir to combine. Cover the casserole and bake, undisturbed, until ham hocks are mostly tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over high heat and brown the sausages on both sides. Set aside. Brown the pork chops and set aside. When the hocks are mostly tender, remove the casserole from the oven. Place the sausages on top of the sauerkraut. If the liquid has reduced to less than 2/3, add a bit more water. Cover the casserole and return it to the oven. Cook for about 30 minutes, or until the sausages are tender and heated through. Add the pork chops and press them into the sauerkraut. Cover and return to the oven and cook until pork chops are heated through and tender, about 30 minutes longer. Remove the casserole from the oven and discard the bouquet garni. Serve immediately, with each person receiving some of each of the sausages, part of a hock, part of a pork chop and some of the sauerkraut. Pass the mustard at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 16044,&quot;Air Fryer Veggie Chip Medley 1 sweet potato (about 4 ounces), scrubbed 1 purple potato (about 4 ounces), scrubbed 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 red beet (about 6 ounces), scrubbed<br> 1 golden beet (about 6 ounces), scrubbed<br> Instructions: Thinly slice both potatoes on a mandoline, about 1/16 inch thick.

Stir in the rest of the Ghee in 1/4 cup increments until all of it has been absorbed. Keep stirring over medium to medium-low heat; the mixture will become a single mass and will roll around in the pan. If the mixture begins to brown, lower the heat. Continue stirring until the mixture becomes porous and starts to appear drier -- this can take up to 10 minutes.<br> Spread the mixture in an ungreased 9-inch square baking pan and press into 1/2 inch thickness. Immediately sprinkle with the almonds, gently pressing them into the surface. While still warm, cut into 36 squares or diamond shapes.<br> Serve at room temperature. In a heavy skillet, over medium to medium-low heat, heat the butter until it is completely melted. Watch as the butter boils, first with large bubbles and white milk solids floating on the surface, then with only a fine white foam filling the entire surface. Stir occasionally.<br> Soon, small patches of golden brown will appear on the surface, and the overall color of the butter will change from yellow to golden. Push aside the foam periodically to check the color of the sediment. When the sediment turns light brown, remove from the heat. (see note)<br> Decant into a jar with a tight lid.

Meanwhile, make the dressing: Smash the garlic clove, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and, with the side of a large knife, mash and smear the mixture to a coarse paste. Put the paste in a bowl and add the orange zest, vinegar, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper, to taste. Gradually whisk in the olive oil, starting with a few drops and then adding the rest in a steady stream to make a smooth, slightly thick dressing. Using a handheld mandoline or a knife, cut the fennel lengthwise into long, thin slices. Add to the onion and toss with the chickpeas, peppers, artichoke hearts, arugula, parsley, and dressing. Scatter the olives and shave the Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 16048,&quot;Chocolate Hazelnut Mooncakes 1/4 cup (80 grams) golden syrup, such as Lyle\u2019s, or honey 1/2 teaspoon food grade lye water (available at Asian grocery stores or online) 2 tablespoons (30 grams) neutral oil 1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting Pinch of kosher salt 1 cup (170 grams) milk chocolate chips 1/2 cup (140 grams) natural and unsweetened hazelnut butter or natural and unsweetened peanut or almond butter 1 cup (120 grams) powdered sugar 1/4 cup (20 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder Kosher salt to taste 1 large egg, beaten with 1 teaspoon of cold water Instructions: For the dough: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the golden syrup, lye water and oil and whisk to emulsify. Add the flour and salt and mix with a rubber spatula until it begins to form a stiff dough. Use your hands to massage the dough into the sides and bottom of the bowl, ensuring that all the ingredients are evenly combined, and the dough is smooth and slightly oily. Wrap in plastic and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the filling. For the filling: In a medium mixing bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, melt the chocolate chips and nut butter together. (Alternatively, you can do this in 30 seconds increments in the microwave.) When the chocolate and nut butter mixture is smooth and combined, remove the bowl from the heat and add the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Add a few pinches of salt and mix with a spoon or spatula until it comes together, then bring together with your hands. It will seem dry and crumbly at first but the more you work it with your hands, the more it will come together and become pliable like a stiff cookie dough. Divide the filling into 12 portions that weigh about 30 grams each. Roll into balls, arrange on a countertop and cover with plastic wrap to keep from drying out. Unwrap the dough and divide into 12 portions that weigh about 20 grams each. Roll into balls and set aside on the counter and cover with plastic wrap to keep from drying out. To assemble the mooncakes: Using your hands, take one ball of dough and flatten into a 3 1/2-inch-wide circle that is about a 1/8 inch thick. Add a ball of the filling into the center of the disc of dough. Wrap the filling with the dough, gently pinch to seal and then roll in your hands to form a perfectly round ball. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough and filling. Arrange an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly dust a filled ball of dough with flour and place in the cavity of a 50 gram mooncake mold (easily available online) and then press, flip over and press down until you feel resistance. Carefully unmold and place on the prepared baking sheet. (Alternatively, you can press each ball into a regular sized muffin pan with paper liners, then peel off and place on a baking sheet. BUT most of the fun in making these are the fun shapes and the mooncake press is easy to order and pretty cheap.) Bake the cakes for 10 minutes then remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly (so the egg wash does not coagulate immediately). Brush with the egg wash and put back in the oven and continue baking until evenly golden brown, begin checking at 8 minutes. (If you use honey instead of golden syrup, you will not get the same coloring, but it will come close if you bake for an additional 5 minutes or so.) These are nice right out of the oven when they are still warm and a little soft, but when they cool the outer shell will get hard. They will soften over the next couple of days kept in an airtight container on the counter; typically, they are served on day 2 or 3. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 16049,&quot;Broccoli Cheese Soup 1 cup (240 ml) skim or low fat milk ? cup (38 g) shredded low fat cheddar cheese 1? cups (195 g) broccoli or cauliflower, fresh or frozen, steamed 1 teaspoon diced onion ? chicken or vegetable bouillon cube Instructions: 1.Place all ingredients into the Vitamix container in the order listed and secure lid. 2.Select Variable 1. 3.Turn machine on and slowly increase speed to Variable 10, then to High. 4.Blend for 6-7 minutes or until heavy steam escapes from the vented lid.

I felt so independent, so excited about the future in journalism ahead of me. One Sunday morning, I met up with a couple of my friends at a beer garden, where I had one of the best Bloody Marys ever; not only did it come with blue-cheese stuffed olives, but it also came with a shot of Guinness in the bottom. The beer gave it just a hint of bitterness and a nice depth. Now that I can&#39;t handle gluten (ugh!), I can&#39;t do the beer, but if you can, try it. In a mini-chopper, combine the mint, jalapeno, pickling juice, Worcestershire sauce, turmeric, paprika, garam masala, and salt and pepper, to taste. Whizz until the mint is finely minced and the mixture is as smooth as you can get it. In a pitcher, combine the mint mixture with the lime juice, lemon juice, tomato juice, and vodka. Stir, and pour into 4 ice-filled glasses. Stab 2 or 3 blue cheese olives on a toothpick and let it fall into the glass along with an asparagus spear and pickled jalapeno.

Seriously! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 16052,&quot;Steamed Whole Fish 1 whole (2 to 3 pound) fish, such as sea bass, red snapper or rock cod, cleaned and gutted, with head and tail intact 1 teaspoon salt juice of 1 lemon 1 tablespoon sesame oil 2 tablespoons peeled and slivered ginger 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 2 scallions, white and green parts, cut into slices on diagonal 2 chunks ginger 3 tablespoons peanut oil 2 tablespoons sesame oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon sugar Garnish: sliced scallions, black and white toasted sesame seeds Instructions: Rinse the fish under cold running water, pat dry, and place on a lightly oiled, heatproof platter that will fit in your steamer or a large roasting pan. Cut 3 deep diagonal gashes along each side of the fish, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat. Sprinkle the inside cavity and outside of the fish with the salt, squeeze the lemon juice over the fish, drizzle with sesame oil, then stuff the slivered ginger and chopped garlic into the gashes. Scatter the scallions over the fish, and marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes. Fill the steamer or roasting pan with water to within an inch of the steamer rack, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and add the ginger chunks to the water. Place platter with fish on steaming rack, cover, and steam over low heat for 20 to 25 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish (plan on 10 minutes for each 1inch of thickness at its widest point). About 5 minutes before the fish is done, heat the peanut oil and the sesame oil in a small saucepan until hot, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the soy sauce, lemon juice and sugar. Test fish for doneness by poking with a fork or chopsticks. The fish meat should flake easily at its thickest part. Remove from the steamer, pour the hot oil mixture over the fish, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16053,&quot;Sherry Trifle 1 (6-ounce package) raspberry gelatin, plus 1 (3-ounce) package raspberry gelatin 2 (3-ounce packages) soft ladyfingers 1 Jigger (1 1/2-ounces) good quality sherry 2 cups berries, raspberry, and blackberry mixed, fresh or frozen, thawed and well drained 1 (4 1/2-ounce package) gelatin custard 1 pint heavy cream 3 tablespoon cappuccino hazelnut syrup, or to taste Whole Fresh berries, for garnish Rainbow sprinkles, for garnish Mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: In trifle bowl or very large glass serving bowl, prepare both packages of gelatin as directed except omit 1/2 cup water.

Arrange ladyfingers in the bowl containing the gelatin by covering the bottom and sides of the bowl. Refrigerate until firmly set. Arrange berries over gelatin and ladyfingers. Prepare the custard as directed. Cool custard until it is only slightly warm, approximately15 to 20 minutes. Gently cover the fruit; gelatin trifle, with custard; be careful not to crush the fruit. Refrigerate until cooled and set about 2 to 3 hours. Just before serving, whip heavy cream and syrup together into stiff peeks. Do not over sweeten, cream should be lightly flavored and rich. Layer whipped cream over top of trifle. Garnish with fresh fruit, sprinkles or mint leaves. Note: Keep refrigerated until ready to serve; the whipped cream will fall if not served soon. Also, if you use too much sherry, gelatin will not set. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Moscato, Prosecco, Cava]</p><p>&quot; 16054,&quot;Steak and Potato Kebabs Vegetable oil, for the grill 1/2 pound fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise 1 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 bunch asparagus, cut into 1-to-2-inch pieces 1/4 cup ketchup 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons steak sauce Pinch of red pepper flakes Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high and brush the grates with vegetable oil.

In a separate pan create a roux by cooking the butter and flour for a few minutes, stirring continuously, without browning, until it emits a nutty aroma. Remove from the heat. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the cooled down roux, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and season, to taste, with salt and white pepper. Whisk in mustard and cover with a piece of plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Heat the grill to medium heat. Prepare the tortillas by laying 1 or 2 slices of cheese on top of each and set aside briefly. Slowly cook the bratwurst over medium heat, turning as needed to prevent them from getting charred. (They tend to split when the heat is too high.) When they are browned and cooked through, which takes 10 to 15 minutes, transfer them to the cheese lined tortillas, and roll up the bratwursts so that the cheese will melt and hold everything together. Place the rolled bratwursts in a skillet over medium heat, allowing the tortillas to toast slightly. Serve with mustard sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 16057,&quot;Arugula Pesto 4 cups packed fresh arugula 1 tablespoon minced garlic Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup pure olive oil 2 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted, plus 1 tablespoon 1/8 teaspoon vitamin C (optional) 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Prepare an ice water bath in a large bowl, and bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the arugula in a large sieve and plunge it into the boiling water. Immediately immerse all the arugula and stir so that it blanches evenly. Blanch for about 15 seconds. Remove, shake off the excess water, then plunge the arugula into the ice water bath and stir again so it cools as fast as possible. Drain well. Squeeze the water out of the arugula with your hands until very dry. Roughly chop the arugula and put in a blender. Add the garlic, salt and pepper to taste, olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the pine nuts, and the vitamin C, if using. Blend for at least 30 seconds. In this way the green of the arugula will thoroughly color the oil. Add the cheese and pulse to combine. The pesto will keep several days in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. Pull out before dinner to get to room temperature. Before serving, add the remaining 1 tablespoon toasted pinenuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 16058,&quot;Braised Duck with Spiced Lentils and Lime Onions 1 (5-pound) duck 2 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 cinnamon sticks, halved 4 cups chicken or duck fat or lard 1/3 cup olive oil 2 onions, thinly sliced 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice Spiced Pineapple Lentils, recipe follows, warmed Instructions: Cut the duck in quarters and remove the drumstick tips. Season with 1 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper, rub all over with the garlic and place a piece of cinnamon stick on each quarter. Let sit at room temperature 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Transfer the duck to an ovenproof frying pan along with the chicken or other fat. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover with foil and transfer to the oven.

Remove and discard the core and outer leaves of the cabbage and trim the leaves of the tough membranes. Blanch the cabbage in boiling, salted water for 1 minute until wilted, then shock in ice water. Roughly chop the cabbage and transfer to a food processor. Pulse until well chopped. Squeeze out excess water and transfer to a large bowl. Blanch the soy bean sprouts in the same boiling, salted water for 1 minute and shock in ice water. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until well chopped. Squeeze out the excess water and add to the cabbage. Stir in the chopped tofu. Transfer the mixture to a cheesecloth lined sieve, place a weighted plate on top of the mixture, and let stand over a bowl in the refrigerator for 2 hours to remove excess water. Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large bowl and add the scallions, garlic, ground meat, salt, and sesame oil. Mix well. To assemble the wontons, place a teaspoon of the filling in the center of a gyoza wrapper. Brush the edges with water and pinch the edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers. To make the broth, combine the flank steak and the water in a pot and let simmer for 1 hour. Remove the meat. When cool enough to handle, slice the beef thinly against the grain.

Slice the potatoes lengthwise 1/4 inch thick, then stack the slices and cut into 1/4-inch-thick sticks, adding them to the ice water as you work. Refrigerate 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Lift the colander out of the ice water, rinse the potatoes well and pat very dry. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat 4 inches vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven until a deep-fry thermometer registers 280 degrees F. Add half of the potatoes; fry until tender but still colorless, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Increase the oil temperature to 365 degrees F. Whisk 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, the rice flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt and the cayenne in a large bowl. Whisk in the beer until mostly smooth. Let sit 5 minutes to thicken. Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet. Season the fish with salt. Working in two batches, dredge the fish in the remaining 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, then dip in the beer batter, letting the excess drip off. Fry until crisp and golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to the rack; sprinkle with salt. Keep warm in the oven. Increase the oil temperature to 380 degrees F. Working in two batches, fry the potatoes again until crisp and golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Serve the fish and chips with malt vinegar and lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 16064,&quot;Flambeed Crepes with Mascarpone and Cherries 1 pint mascarpone, room temperature 3/4 cup tiny chocolate chips 1/2 cup sugar Pinch ground cinnamon 1 pound cherries, pitted and halved 3/4 cup sugar 1 Meyer lemon, zested and juiced Splash water 1/2 recipe Basic Crepes, recipe follows 1/4 cup kirsch, for flambe 1 cup all-purpose flour Pinch kosher salt 2 eggs 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup club soda 3 tablespoons butter Instructions: For the filling: In a small bowl, combine the mascarpone, chocolate chips, sugar, and pinch of cinnamon. Set aside. If making more than 2 hours ahead, reserve in the refrigerator but let come to room temperature before serving. For the sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the cherries, sugar, lemon zest and juice, and a splash of water. Cook until the cherries have let off their juices and the flavor has concentrated, 10 to 12 minutes. When done, the cherries should be very sweet and the juice should be syrupy. Turn off the heat and set aside. To assemble: Schmear some of the mascarpone/chocolate mixture, about 1/4-inch thick, onto the lower half of a crepe. Fold the top half over the bottom to create a perfect half circle and press to secure. Fold the crepe in half again, to create a loose triangle. Repeat this process with remaining 7 crepes. Heat the pan with the cherry sauce over medium heat until it just begins to bubble. Be careful not to burn the sauce. Pour the kirsch into a measuring cup with a spout and carefully pour into the cherry sauce. Turn off the heat and carefully light the sauce using a long lighter. Allow the flames to burn off. To serve, arrange 2 crepe triangles on each serving plate and spoon the warm flambeed cherries over the top. Sa- weeeeeet! Batter: In a mixing bowl, add the flour and salt and make a well in the center. Add the eggs, milk, club soda and 3 tablespoons of melted butter into the center of the well and whisk together until just combined. The mixture should be like VERY loose pancake batter. If the mixture is a little thick, whisk in a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using. Crepes: Melt about a 1/2 teaspoon of butter in a small nonstick saute pan. The butter should coat the bottom of the pan, if there is a lot of excess, wipe it out with a paper towel. Keep the paper towel handy in case you need it again (you will). Put the pan over medium heat. Fill a 2-ounce ladle, almost to the top, with batter and pour it into the preheated pan, tipping and rolling the pan, as you ladle the batter, to evenly cover the bottom. This will take a little practice, even when you are an experienced crepe maker the first couple always get wasted. Accept it and move on. When the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bottom begins to brown a little, turn the crepe over and cook it for about 1 minute on the other side. Remove the crepe from the pan to a plate and let cool. Stack the crepes as they are cooked between parchment paper squares. Repeat this process, until all the batter is used, wiping the pan with your paper towel or melting a little more butter to the pan, as needed.

Add the olive oil, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning to the bag and smush everything together. Seal and refrigerate. For the red pepper sauce: Melt the butter and add the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute for 2 to 3 minutes or until starting to soften. Add the red peppers and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until hot. Add the broth (if you like a thicker sauce only add 1 cup broth, for a thinner sauce add 2 cups broth), salt and pepper and stir until heated. Splash in the cream. Remove the skillet from the heat. Carefully transfer the contents of the skillet to a food processor or blender. Place on the lid and puree the pepper mixture until totally blended (there will still be some texture to the peppers). You can serve the sauce right away or cool it and bag it up. When ready to cook, heat a grill pan over medium-high heat and grill the chicken until cooked through, about 4 minutes a side. Heat up the red pepper sauce in a pan. Serve everyone a piece of chicken, spoon some sauce over each piece, and garnish with Parmesan shavings and a sprinkling of parsley. Serve with roasted vegetables alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, GSM]&quot; 16099,&quot;Lentil Salad 3 cups lentils 1 cup onion, diced 1 cup carrots, small diced 3 Tbs. granulated sugar 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 1/2 cup olive oil, plus 2 Tbs. 1/4 cup parsley, chopped salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Simmer lentils in salted water for 45 minutes until tender.

Line a 8 by 8-inch baking pan with foil letting long flaps overlap on each side. Spray foil with nonstick spray. Break up the brown sugar to remove all lumps. In a standing mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and sugar on medium speed until very smooth. Add the cream and beat slowly; then add the yolks and vanilla mixing until just combined. Gently stir in peanut butter. Take care not to over beat the mixture; this incorporates too much air and causes the cheesecake to crack. Pour and evenly spread the batter in the prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes. Open the oven to release some heat, then lower the temperature to 200 degrees F. Continue to bake the cheesecake until the outside is set but the center is still loose, for about 45 minutes. Turn off the oven, and cool cheesecake in the oven for 45 more minutes. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Lift cheesecake from the pan by lifting up the foil. Transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Stick a wooden pop stick halfway into each bar and freeze for 1 hour. Meanwhile, put the shortening and chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue to heat until completely melted, about 1 minute more.) Dip the pops into the chocolate mixture, and stand on waxed paper to set, about 5 minutes. Serve cold (straight from the fridge), or freeze up to 2 weeks. Frozen pops make a cool summer treat, or can be allowed to temper for 10 minutes at room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 16101,&quot;Verdura Mista 2 aubergines (eggplants), sliced into rounds 2 heads fennel, sliced 3 courgettes (zucchini), sliced lengthways 1 bunch of asparagus 4 yellow patty pan squash 4 green patty pan squash 2 red peppers, charred and skins removed 2 orange peppers, charred and skins removed Extra-virgin olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper White wine vinegar 1 handful chopped basil leaves 1 clove garlic, finely sliced 1 handful fennel tops Instructions: Place all the vegetables on a hot barbecue or griddle pan and chargrill them for a few minutes on each side so you get those lovely black striped char marks.

Rub the 8 sweet potatoes wedges with grapeseed oil. Season the parsnip and potato with salt and pepper. Bake on a sheet tray in a pre-heated 400 degree oven until browned and cooked through (approximately 15 minutes). Heat a large, nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Season each duck breast with salt and pepper. Press one side of the duck breast into the coriander seeds. Use a squeeze bottle to drizzle a thin line of grapeseed oil over the coriander on each duck breast. Add the duck breasts, seed side down to the hot saute pan. Saute until the coriander browns. Turn the duck breasts over and set the pan off the flame for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the breasts and allow them to rest 2 to 4 minutes. To plate, set a piece of parsnip and wedge of sweet potato on each plate. Slice each duck breast into 1/4-inch slices and arrange against the vegetables. Spoon sauce onto each plate and garnish with pea shoots. Juice sweet potatoes and allow the juice to stand for 4 hours. This will allow much of the potato starch in the juice to settle. Pour the juice through a fine mesh strainer being careful to leave the settled starch behind. Place over a medium flame and reduce to approximately 1 1/2 to 2 cups, or until the sauce naturally thickens. Remove from the fire and stir in the ginger and Thai cl pepper. Stir until the sauce tastes spicy enough and strain immediately.

Warm the honey in a microwavable bowl for approximately 1 minute or until hot (be careful, as it can burn quickly). Add the honey to the miso mixture. Put the fish into a resealable plastic bag and add the honey mixture. Seal the bag and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the Chinese long beans and blanch until tender, but not overcooked. Shock the beans in iced water, to stop the cooking and maintain their color. Drain and dry the long beans and either chop into 4 to 6-inch segments or form circles by wrapping the beans around themselves. In a large skillet add the grapeseed oil and heat until smoking hot. Remove the fish from the marinade and sear in hot skillet until the flesh has an opaque color, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the fish from the pan to a large plate and reserve. For the sauce, using the same skillet, over medium heat, add the onion and saute until translucent, then add the chicken stock, ginger and lemongrass and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and strain the liquid, discarding the solids. Return the liquid to a clean skillet, over medium heat. Add the raisins and reduce the liquid by half its volume. Stir in the butter cubes and whisk until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and allow to rest until needed. Heat a little grapeseed oil in a medium skillet, over medium heat, and add the long bean circles or strips and saute until golden brown. To serve, arrange 2 long bean circles in the middle of each plate. Top the beans with a fish fillet and drizzle with the sauce. Garnish with cilantro and lemon.

Sprinkle 2 tablespoons salt all over the riblets and cover with cold water. Let soak for 30 minutes. Pour the riblets along with the water into a colander and rinse with cold water. Shake out the excess water and place the colander directly back in the bowl to allow any remaining water to drain out. Whisk the fermented black beans, cornstarch, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sugar, sesame oil, white pepper, garlic, ginger, Fresno cl and 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a medium bowl until combined. Add the riblets to the mixture and toss well until everything is fully coated. Marinate, refrigerated, for 1 1/2 hours, then remove from the refrigerator and marinate at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes. Put the rice in a medium bowl and cover with water; drain. Repeat until the water runs clear, 6 to 8 times; drain well in a fine-mesh sieve. Meanwhile, fill a large donabe with 2 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat, add the rice and smooth it into an even layer with a rubber spatula. Cover and cook until most of the water has been absorbed but some is still visible between the grains, 3 to 5 minutes; the rice will still be raw. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil mainly along the sides of the donabe and a little in the middle. This will help create the crust on the bottom. Using tongs or chopsticks, arrange the riblets in an even layer on top of the rice (try not to include the liquid from the marinade). It is okay if the riblets touch the rim of the donabe. Cover and continue to cook over medium low until the riblets and rice are completely cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully transfer the donabe to a trivet and let sit for 10 minutes. Use caution when removing the lid as the steam can burn. Top with cilantro or scallions and drizzle with Sweet Soy Sauce. Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the scallions, ginger and garlic and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar, light and dark soy sauces, sesame oil, white pepper and 1/4 cup water and simmer until the garlic and ginger coins have softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and transfer to a small bowl until ready to serve.

Add the octopus, cover with parchment, and reduce the heat, if necessary to keep the liquid at a simmer. Simmer until quite tender but the tentacles are still attached, about 1 hour. Bring another large pot of water to a boil, salt it generously, and add the lobster. Cook 4 minutes and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Puree the peppers in a blender with the lemon juice, paprika, 1 teaspoon honey and some salt and pepper. Taste, and add more honey if you like, and salt or pepper. Cut the tentacles from the octopus and discards the heads. Some of the skin will slough off on its own; don&#39;t worry about removing the rest. Chop roughly into bite-sized pieces. Remove the lobster claws and tail from the shell, and cut into bite-sized pieces. Toss the octopus and lobster with enough of the pepper puree to coat lightly.

Soak the bread slices in the milk mixture for about 5 minutes, turning once so that they absorb the milk evenly. Beat the egg with the sugar and pour onto a plate. Heat the butter in a skillet until sizzling. Take the bread from the milk, holding it above the bowl to drain slightly. Dip into the egg mixture to coat both sides, then drop into the sizzling butter and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. At the last minute, sprinkle the tops with a little extra sugar and \broil\ with a blowtorch (or place them on a baking sheet under the broiler until the sugar, melts, bubbles and turns golden). Divide the bread among serving plates. Serve hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a dribbling of fresh, ripe cherries and blackberries that have been sauteed in butter and sugar and possibly flamed. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Brachetto]&quot; 16118,&quot;Vanilla, Chocolate and Kahlua Chiffon Cake with Port Wine and Raspberry Sauce 2 cups sifted cake flour 1 1/2 cups sugar, divided 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup sunflower oil 2 tablespoons Kahlua or other coffee flavored liqueur 2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract 7 large egg whites 1 teaspoon cream of tartar Nonstick cooking spray or oil to brush on baking pan Port Wine and Raspberry Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup fresh raspberries 1 1/2 cups nonfat yogurt 1/4 cup port wine 2 tablespoons sugar (optional) Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Into a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, 1 cups of the sugar, the cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well in the center and add the oil, Kahlua and vanilla. Do not mix. In another bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until white and foamy. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat. Mix 1/4 of the egg whites until well incorporated into the flour mixture. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites using a rubber spatula. Spray a 9-inch tube pan with nonstick cooking spray, or brush the inside with oil. Dust with flour and tap out the excess. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bang the mold on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake for 55 minutes, or until the top feels springy, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cake upright on a wire rack for 1 hour. Loosen the sides with a small, thin knife. Remove the cake from the pan and allow it to cool.

Put the chopped pineapple in a baking dish, cover with foil and roast in the oven until soft and lightly golden brown. Leave the oven at 350 degrees F. Put the sugar, vanilla bean and 1/2 cup of water in a medium saucepan and cook over high heat until it turns a light caramel. Add the chopped pineapple, cream, salt and arbol and cook until slightly reduced. Let cool for about 5 minutes before adding it to a blender. Remove the vanilla bean, then carefully transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain through a medium mesh strainer into a bowl. Return the mixture to the saucepan and reduce it to a sauce consistency. Pour the caramel into a seasoned 10-inch cast iron pan and let cool slightly. Arrange the pineapple slices on top of the caramel and set aside. Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl once.

Put the rhubarb into a large ovenproof dish. I find a rectangular size measuring 12 by 8 by 2 inches perfect for the job. Sprinkle over the sugar, add the orange juice and zest, and 2 cups of water, and cover, either with lid or with foil. Bake for 1 hour. Take out of oven, remove lid, and let cool. Strain carefully into a large measuring cup. I find this gives about 3 cups. Put the pulp aside (you can freeze it for use in the custard or trifle). If using granulated gelatin, soften it in 1/4 cup of the Muscat, about 5 minutes. Heat the mixture in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until the gelatin has dissolved, about 1 minute, and add to the rhubarb juice. Pour the remaining Muscat into the juice to bring it up to 3 3/4 cups; if not using granulated gelatin, add the Muscat as is to the juice to the required measurement. Taste; you may want some more sugar or a squeeze more orange or, indeed, more Muscat. Lightly oil a 4-cup jelly mold by dabbing a paper towel in some suitably flavorless oil and then rubbing it over the interior of the mold. Soak gelatin leaves in a dish of cold water until softened. Put 2 ladles of rhubarb and Muscat syrup in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Squeeze out the gelatin leaves and whisk into the syrup. When they&#39;ve dissolved, pour the contents of the pan back into the measuring cup. If you want to make sure everything&#39;s well enough blended, you can pour from the cup to the pan and back into the cup again. Pour into the jelly mold and place in the refrigerator to chill and set, about 6 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 16129,&quot;Candied Bacon 10 strips thick-cut bacon About 1/4 cup brown sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Separate the two strands of each licorice piece, leaving them attached at one end. Roll 2 small (1/4-inch) balls of green fondant for each pair of antennae and attach the balls to one end of the licorice. Enclose the remaining fondant in plastic wrap so it does not dry out. Repeat with the remaining pairs of antennae. Set aside to dry. For the head and body: Roll seven 1/2-inch balls of green fondant. Take one ball and attach a pair of antennae by sticking the licorice into it. With a small brush, dab a little water to moisten the top and attach 2 yellow sprinkles for eyes. Add pupils to the eyes by dipping a skewer into the melted chocolate and make small dots on the yellow sprinkles. Gently press the 6 remaining balls together to form the body of the caterpillar, and curve them to make it look wiggly. Moisten the top of an end ball and affix the caterpillar&#39;s head. Repeat to make 11 more caterpillars. Allow them to dry 20 minutes. To assemble: Frost each cupcake with about 2 tablespoons buttercream.

In a large bowl, mix together potato, celeriac and scallions. Season well. In a hot non-stick pan, liberally coat with clarified butter and cover with mix. Cake needs to get brown on this side. Drizzle a little of butter on the raw side then flip the cake over and place in a 375-degree oven to cook through. Cook about 12 minutes until hot in the middle. Slice pie shaped wedges for serving. In a wok, add canola oil and garlic and slowly heat. Eventually, the garlic will start frying. Carefully watch garlic and strain out once the garlic is light brown and crisp. Save the oil. Wipe out wok and bring to high heat. Add 1 tablespoon garlic oil and quickly stir in the spinach. Season and add back the crispy garlic and stir in the vinegar. Check for seasoning. In very salted water, blanch basil and spinach for 1 minute until very soft, yet still very green. Plunge in ice bath and squeeze out water. Blend at high speed and add salt and the oil. Cover blender and blend until the cup becomes warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 16139,&quot;Sweet and Spiced Pecans 1/4 cup dark agave nectar 2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 2 tablespoons sugar 2 cups pecans Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Place meat in a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix the cumin, ginger, cinnamon, and saffron; sprinkle over the meat and set aside. On a cutting board, mince together the orange zest, cilantro leaves, garlic, and salt until you have a paste. Add to the meat along with the orange juice and stir well to coat. Cover the bowl and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Transfer the mixture to a heavy pot, add the onions, tomatoes, and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer (or bake in a preheated 350 degree oven) until the meat is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add olives and, if using, preserved lemon to the pot. Cook about 10 minutes more, then serve. Wash a 1-pint glass-canning jar and its lid with hot soapy water; rinse and dry thoroughly. Cut 6 of the lemons, 1 at a time, into quarters through 1 end without cutting all the way through the other end. You want the lemon to open out like a flower, but not to separate. Place the lemon on a large piece of parchment or waxed paper, spread quarters open and sprinkle flesh with a heaping tablespoon of kosher salt; put the lemon into the jar. Continue with remaining lemons, sprinkling salt on each. Pack the lemons in the jar tightly, filling it to the top (you may need more or less than 6 lemons, depending on their size). When you reach the top, lift the parchment and pour the excess salt from it into the jar of lemons. Slide the bay leaves down opposite sides of the jar. Juice the remaining lemons 1 by 1, adding juice to the jar, until it reaches the top. Seal jar, shake well, and let stand at room temperature, shaking well every 12 hours, for 1 week. After 1 week, transfer jar to the refrigerator, continuing to shake every day. Lemons are preserved after 3 weeks and keep up to several months in the refrigerator. To use lemons, pull out as needed and scrape away pulp. Dice peel and use as a condiment. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 16141,&quot;Sweet Potato Hash 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 cups yams, peeled and diced 2 cups butternut squash, peeled and diced 1/2 cup red pepper, diced 1/2 cup green pepper, diced 1/2 cup onion, diced 1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced 1/4 cup fresh sage, chiffinade 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 4 ounces vegetable stock Instructions: In a heated saute pan add the olive oil, yams, squash, peppers and onions.

Chop roughly and process in food processor until reduced to a textured paste. Put ginger in a large non reactive container and pour boiling water over it. Stir in the lime juice, zest and cream of tartar. Cover and stir occasionally as mixture cools. When lukewarm, mix the yeast with the warm water, pressing out lumps, and add to container. Cover and let stand for 6 hours. Stir the sugar into the ginger beer until completely dissolved and immediately pour into sterilized bottles, making sure the stoppers are well sealed and airtight. The ginger beer will keep for 3 to 4 days in a cool place. To keep longer, add rum. To serve, strain and pour into glasses (over shaved ice if desired), with a sprig of mint and thin slice of lime. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 16181,&quot;Toasted Coconut Flan 2 cups milk 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup coconut cream 1 cup toasted coconut, recipe follows, or store bought toasted coconut 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup water 2 tablespoon lemon juice 6 eggs 3 egg yolks Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Combine milk, coconut milk, and coconut cream in a saucepan. Stir, bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 15 minutes until slightly reduced. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Add toasted coconut and infuse for 15 minutes. To make the caramel: combine the sugar, water, and lemon juice in a medium saucepot and cook over high heat, without stirring, until it darkens to amber. Pour the caramel evenly into 6 (4-ounce) ramekins and set aside. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and the yolks. Strain the milk mixture into the eggs and whisk to combine. Fill each ramekin with this mixture, then place ramekin in roasting pan. Create a water bath by filling the roasting pan 1/3 way with hot water, and cook, covered with foil, for 25 minutes. Allow to cool before serving. To unmold the flan: take a paring knife and run it around the sides of the ramekin to loosen the flan. To help it along, you may also place the ramekin in a shallow bowl with warm water until it comes halfway up the sides for a few seconds. Invert a serving plate on top of the ramekin and flip over to unmold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 16182,&quot;Crostini 1 loaf crusty bread, sliced into 1/2-inch slices Olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the bread in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Wash luau leaves, remove stems and thick veins. In a pot, boil 3 cups of water with the Hawaiian salt and baking soda. Add the leaves to the boiling water and reduce heat. Simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour. Drain, and squeeze out liquid. Saute onions and calamari in butter until the onions are translucent. Add the coconut milk, cooked luau leaves, salt and sugar. Simmer for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 16184,&quot;Sole Almondine 2 cups blanched slivered almonds Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups all-purpose flour Freshly ground black pepper 4 eggs 1 cup milk 4 cleaned sole fillets (6 ounces each) 1 large or 3 small shallots, finely chopped 1 cup white wine 1 lemon, juiced 1/4 chopped flat-leaf parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Set a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Add the almonds and toast until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and set aside. Return the pan to medium heat (if you have 2 pans you can work simultaneously at this point, i.e. 2 fillets per pan) and add a 2-count of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter to each pan. Put the flour in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper, to taste. In another shallow dish, whisk together the eggs and milk and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Dredge the fillets in the seasoned flour, then dip them into the egg mixture. Allow some of the excess egg to drain off, then add them to the hot pan. Cook 2 pieces at a time. Fry for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, then carefully turn the fish over to cook the other side. With a spoon, baste the fillets with the butter sauce. Repeat basting to ensure the fish remains moist. Once the other side is cooked (about 30 seconds) carefully remove the fillets from the pan to a serving platter. Repeat with remaining 2 fillets and a 2-count of oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Once the fillets have been removed the pan, add the chopped shallots and gently saute over low heat until translucent, about 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and finish with the lemon juice. Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the parsley and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. To serve, spoon the sauce over the top of the fillets and sprinkle generously with the toasted almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 16185,&quot;Cherry Cheesecake Muffins 1 box moist white cake mix 8 ounces cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup sour cream 2 eggs 1/4 cup plus 1/2 cup sugar 2 cups graham cracker crumbs (crushed with rolling pin) 6 tablespoons butter, melted 1/4 cup cherry preserves 8 ounces cream cheese, softened 1/4 cup sugar 1 egg 1/2 teaspoon freshly-squeezed lemon juice Instructions: Lightly grease a 12-cup muffin pan and set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To make the batter, in a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, softened cream cheese, sour cream, eggs, and 1/4 cup sugar. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. To make the crust, combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup sugar, and melted butter in a small bowl. Set aside. In a smaller mixing bowl, beat together all ingredients for cheese filling until smooth. Set aside. Divide half of the graham cracker mixture among the 12 muffin cups and lightly press into bottoms. Fill cups all the way to the top with muffin batter. Place 1 teaspoon of cherry preserves on top of muffin batter and with a teaspoon, lightly cut preserves into batter. With the back of a spoon dipped in water to keep from sticking, indent the batter and top with a dollop of filling to cover the cherry preserves. Sprinkle remaining graham cracker mixture over the top of muffins. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before removing muffins from pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 16186,&quot;Grilled Radicchio and Cantaloupe Salad 1/2 cup plain whole Greek yogurt, such as Trader Joe&#39;s organic cream top 1/2 lemon zested and juiced<br> 1/2 lime zested and juiced<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Half a cantaloupe (about 1 pound), rind and seeds removed and cut into 1-inch-thick slices 2 small heads radicchio, trimmed and quartered but leave enough of the core so the quarters hold together<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5-ounce container baby arugula<br> Instructions: For the Lemon-Lime Dressing: Add the yogurt, lemon and lime zest and juice and the honey to a small bowl. Whisk together well and season to taste with salt and pepper. Reserve in the fridge if not using right away. For the Salad: Preheat an outdoor grill to medium. Place the cantaloupe and radicchio on baking sheets and brush with the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the cantaloupe and radicchio on the grill (you may have to do this in batches) and grill the cantaloupe until you see grill marks, 1 to 2 minutes a side. Grill the radicchio until soft and browned on the outside, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Cut the cantaloupe into cubes. Arrange a bed of baby arugula on a platter, top with the grilled cantaloupe and radicchio and drizzle with the dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16187,&quot;Mughlai Chicken 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled 4 cloves garlic, peeled 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon dried chili flakes 4 tablespoons ground almonds 1/2 cup water 5 cardamom pods, bruised 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half 2 bay leaves 4 cloves 1/4 cup vegetable oil 3 pounds boned chicken thighs, each cut into 2 2 onions, finely chopped 1 cup Greek yogurt 1 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup sultanas (golden raisins) 1 teaspoon garam masala 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup flaked almonds, toasted, to garnish Instructions: Put the ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, and chili into a food processor, or into a mortar and pestle, and blend to a paste. Add the ground almonds and water and then blend again, set aside. Heat the oil in a large pan and add the chicken pieces - in batches so they fry rather than stew - and cook them just long enough to seal on both sides, then remove to a dish. Add the spices and turn them in the oil. Add the onions and cook them until softened and lightly browned, but keep the heat gentle and stir frequently, to avoid sticking. Pour in the blended paste, and cook everything until it begins to colour. Add the yogurt, half a cup at a time stirring it in to make a sauce, then stir in the stock, cream, and sultanas. Put the browned chicken back into the pan, along with any juices that have collected under them, and sprinkle over the garam masala, sugar, and salt. Cover and cook on a gentle heat for 20 minutes, testing to make sure the meat is cooked through. It&#39;s at this stage, that I like to take the pan off the heat and leave it to cool before reheating the next day. So either now, or when you&#39;ve reheated it, pour into a serving dish and scatter with the toasted flaked almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 16188,&quot;Asian Mushroom Risotto 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 stalk lemongrass, smashed with the back of a knife<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature<br> 1 pound mixed mushrooms (shiitake, hon shemeji or maitake), torn or cut into similar sizes 2 cups thinly sliced Tokyo negi (approximately 1 bunch) or leeks or scallions<br> 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger<br> 2 fresh green Thai chiles, chopped fine<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup Arborio rice<br> 1 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio<br> 1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil<br> 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano, plus more for garnish<br> 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped<br> 1/4 cup pickled ginger<br> Instructions: Bring the chicken broth and lemongrass to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and keep warm. In a straight-sided medium skillet, warm the olive oil and butter over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted and stopped bubbling, add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the mushroom are beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the Tokyo negi, garlic, ginger, Thai chiles and salt. Cook an additional 3 minutes, or until the negi has softened and the mixture is fragrant. Add the rice to the pan; mix well to coat the grains in the flavorful oil. Deglaze the pan with the white wine, scraping up any brown bits that have formed in the pan. Simmer until the wine has almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add 1 cup of the simmering broth and cook, stirring, until almost completely absorbed, about 4 minutes. Add 3/4 cup broth and once again cook until evaporated, stirring constantly. Continue in this manner, adding 3/4 cup broth at a time, until the rice is tender, but still with some bite, and the mixture is creamy, about 20 minutes total. Remove from the heat and stir in the sesame oil and Parmesan. Serve garnished with Parmesan, basil and pickled ginger. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 16189,&quot;Mesclun Greens with Creamy Garlic Dressing and Roasted Garlic Crouton with Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese 2 cups mesclun greens 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese 1/2 cup prepared or homemade mayonnaise 1/4 cup roasted garlic paste 3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper 3 tablespoons roasted garlic 1 slice of french bread, trimmed, (2 by 4 inches) Olive oil Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the dressing: Combine all the ingredients together and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. For croutons: Slice the bread on an angle, resulting in two long triangles. Place on a sheet tray and season with olive oil, salt and pepper, seasoning both sides. Bake until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and cool. Mound the garlic paste on the entire crouton, spreading evenly. To assemble, toss the greens with the dressing, using just enough to lightly coat and flavor the greens. Mound in the center of the plate. Place the croutons right on top of the greens. Sprinkle with the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Garnish the plate with a couple turns of black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 16190,&quot;Sprinkles Cake 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pans 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 4 large egg whites<br> 1/4 cup flavorless oil<br> 1 tablespoon imitation vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br> 3/4 cup whole milk<br> 1/2 cup rainbow sprinkles (artificially colored cylinders, not nonpareils, sanding sugar or anything naturally colored)<br> 1 3/4 cups (3 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 3 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons whole milk<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons imitation vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottoms of three 8-inch cake pans with butter and line with parchment or line two 12-cup cupcake tins with liners and set aside. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. In the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the granulated sugar and butter until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg whites, one at a time, mixing well after each. Add the oil and the extracts. With the mixer running on low, add the dry mixture and the milk in 2 or 3 alternating batches and mix until just barely combined. Gently fold in the sprinkles using a rubber spatula until they&#39;re evenly distributed. Distribute the batter among the cake or cupcake pans, spreading it out evenly if using cake pans, and bake until lightly browned on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Begin checking for doneness at 25 minutes for cakes and 20 minutes for cupcakes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Beat the butter until smooth with the whisk attachment and gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar until creamed. Add the milk, extracts and salt and beat to combine. Decorate as desired and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 16191,&quot;Warm Indian Rice Pudding 1 cup short grain Indian or Italian (Arborio) rice 1 1/2 cups water 2 to 3 cups milk 1/2 cup sugar, or to taste 1/4 cup golden raisins 1/4 cup raw cashews or shelled pistachios, chopped fine Seeds from 4 cardamom pods Ground cinnamon, to taste Instructions: In a saucepan combine the rice and water, bring to a boil, stirring, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add 2 cups of the milk, the sugar, raisins, cashews or pistachios, cardamom seeds, and cinnamon, and simmer, stirring often, for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until rice is tender and mixture creamy. Add additional milk if necessary. Pudding may also be served chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 16192,&quot;Paczki 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed and for dusting (see Cook\u2019s note) 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup whole milk One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast 1/2 cup granulated sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing 2 large eggs plus 3 yolks 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 to 4 quarts vegetable oil, for frying 1 1/2 cups jam or jelly, such as apricot or grape 1/3 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more if needed 1 tablespoon whole milk, plus more if needed Instructions: For the paczki: Whisk together the flour and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. Microwave the milk in a small microwave-safe bowl until warm (between 110 to 115 degrees F.), about 1 minute, then stir to even out the temperature. Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the granulated sugar, stirring just enough to hydrate the yeast. Let bloom for 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add the butter and remaining granulated sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Cream together on medium high-speed, stopping and scraping the bowl once or twice as necessary, until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the whole eggs and beat on medium high to combine, about 1 minute. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and beat together another minute.<br> Starting with the mixer on low and then raising to medium high, add the flour mixture in 2 parts, alternating with the yeast mixture. Once the last addition of flour has been combined, knead the dough in the mixer until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. The dough will be slack and sticking to the sides but not too sticky to the touch. If it is too sticky, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of flour and knead a minute more to tighten it up. Put the dough on a flour-dusted surface and knead by hand a few times, tucking the dough under itself to form a smooth ball. Transfer to a large, greased bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and leave to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 40 to 60 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll or pat down to 1/2 inch thick. Cut the dough into 3-inch circles and place on a lightly floured baking sheet. Make one more circle from the dough scraps or make mini paczki to fry. Cover the dough circles with a kitchen towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, heat the oil in a deep Dutch oven to 350 degrees F; line a baking sheet with paper towels.<br> Shake off any flour from the dough circles and fry in batches of 3 to 4 until deep golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on each side. You will be able to tell they are cooked through because the amount of bubbles will reduce to almost nothing. Transfer the doughnuts to the paper towel-lined baking sheet as they come out of the oil. Return the oil to 350 degrees F between batches. Let rest until cool enough to handle.<br> For the filling and glaze. Fit a pastry bag with a small round tip and fill with the jam. Set aside.<br> Use a thick skewer or chopstick to poke a hole in the middle of each doughnut and wiggle a little space, taking care to not poke all the way through. Fill with the jam using the pastry bag. To make the glaze, add the confectioners&#39; sugar to a small bowl big enough to dip a doughnut into. Whisk in the milk until smooth. The glaze should be a little loose, close to the consistency of maple syrup. Dip each doughnut in the glaze, letting it roll off a bit before turning it over to set. Some of the glaze will run down the sides which is okay, but if you need to adjust the thickness, add a little more confectioners&#39; sugar or milk depending on what you need. Let the glaze set for about 5 minutes! If you want to skip the glaze, just dust with confectioners&#39; sugar; many paczki are enjoyed this way too. Paczki are best the day they are made, but they can be stored in an airtight container to enjoy the next day.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16193,&quot;Low Carb Big Beef Bacon Cheeseburgers with Sauteed Mushrooms 8 slices applewood or other thick, center-cut bacon, from the meat case of market 1 1/2 pounds ground beef sirloin Worcestershire sauce, for brushing Olive oil, for drizzling Grill seasoning (recommended: Montreal Seasoning by McCormick) or coarse salt and black pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream 1 clove crushed garlic 1 pound crimini (baby Portobello) mushrooms, cleaned with a damp towel, sliced 3 or 4 sprigs fresh sage Salt and pepper 1/4 cup dry cooking sherry 8 ounces fontina or Swiss cheese, thinly sliced Grainy, stone ground prepared mustard, for passing at the table Instructions: Let meat rest to take the chill from the refrigerator.
