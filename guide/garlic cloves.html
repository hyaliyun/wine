ground black pepper 1 cup panko (Japanese bread flakes) 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest Good olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted 1/4 cup good Dijon mustard 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (4 large) 1 pound fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise 12 ounces baby frisee or chicory salad greens Mustard Vinaigrette (recipe follows) 1/4 cup minced shallots 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 1/2 cup good olive oil 1 tablespoon good Dijon mustard Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the garlic, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until the garlic is finely minced. Add the panko, lemon zest, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and the butter and pulse a few times to moisten the panko. Pour the mixture into a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl, whisk together the mustard and wine.<br> Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Dip each piece first in the mustard mixture to coat the top and bottom and then coat the skin side only in the crumb mixture, pressing gently to make the crumbs adhere. Place the chicken on one side of a sheet pan, crumb side up, and press any remaining crumbs onto the chicken.<br> Place the potatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl and toss. Spread the potatoes on the other side of the sheet pan in one layer and roast both together for 40 to 50 minutes, turning the potatoes once during roasting, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. The chicken and potatoes should be done at the same time. Meanwhile, place the greens on a serving platter. When the chicken and potatoes are done, toss the salad with enough vinaigrette to moisten and place the chicken and potatoes on top, adding any crumbs from the sheet pan. Sprinkle with salt and serve while the chicken and potatoes are still warm. Place the shallots, vinegar, olive oil, mustard, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl and whisk until emulsified. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 57470,&quot;Dark Chocolate Bark !-- link to blog <a href="http://blog.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2010/03/24/5-ingredients-dark-chocolate-bark-2-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://blog.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2010/03/24/5-ingredients-dark-chocolate-bark-2-ways/</a> -- &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah]&quot; 57471,&quot;Vichyssoise of Kumumoto Oysters and Royal Sterling Caviar 8 Kumumoto oysters 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon chopped leeks 1 small Yukon gold potato, peeled and cut into small dice 1 cup cold water Salt 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1/2 cup packed fresh spinach, blanched and squeezed to remove excess water 5 tablespoons creme fraiche 1 1/4 sheets silver gelatin, bloomed 1/4 sheet gelatin, bloomed American farm-raised white sturgeon caviar, for garnish (recommended: Royal Sterling) Chive blossoms, for garnish Fresh dill, for garnish Instructions: Pry open the oysters and separate the juice from the meat, reserving both in the fridge. Clean the bottom shells very well and reserve them for later.; To make the vichyssoise base: Heat the butter and leeks in a small saucepan over low heat and cook until the leeks are softened but not browned. Add the potatoes and water and simmer until the potatoes are tender. Chill and season with salt. Pour into a blender and puree with the cream and blanched spinach to get a light mint green color. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. To make the mousse: Whisk the creme fraiche to soft peaks in a mixer. Heat 1/2 cup of the vichyssoise base in a medium saucepan. Add the bloomed gelatin to the base. Fold in the whipped creme fraiche and 1/2 cup more of vichyssoise base. To make the oyster glaze: Bring 3 tablespoons of the reserved oyster juices to a boil in a small saucepan. Strain through a coffee filter. Add the bloomed gelatin to the liquid. Let cool but not enough to set. To finish: Fill the 8 reserved oyster shells about 3/4 full with the vichyssoise mousse and set an oyster on top. Keep cool and brush with the still-liquid oyster glaze. Repeat the brushing until the whole oyster has a shine to it. Garnish with a quenelle of caviar, chive blossom, and dill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 57472,&quot;Papas con Mojo 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes 1/2 onion, sliced 1/2 ounce olive oil 1/2 garlic, minced 1/4 cup white wine 6 oranges, juiced 1/2 bunch chopped fresh oregano 1/2 bunch chopped fresh cilantro Kosher salt, to taste Pepper, to taste Instructions: Roast potatoes in a preheated 375-degree oven.

Turn the heat to medium-low and slowly bring to a boil, making sure to whisk often so that the milk doesn&#39;t scorch. Slowly whisk in the polenta, making sure to whisk out any lumps. Turn the temperature to low and cook, stirring every few minutes, until the mixture is smooth and silky, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cheese and butter. For the mushrooms: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread out the mushrooms on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil to lightly coat. Toss and spread out in an even layer. Roast until browned around the edges, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, add the bacon lardons to a large saute pan. Turn the heat to medium and cook until the bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Add olive oil to the pan if needed to lightly coat. Add the shallots and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and toss to combine until starting to brown. Add the veal demi-glace or stock to deglaze the pan (if using demi, add 1/2 cup water and stir to combine). Add the thyme and stir, then reduce by three-quarters, about 10 minutes. Add the bacon and mix to combine. Taste and season with salt as needed.

Bring 1/2 cup sugar and the water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Pour over the cranberries and set aside 1 hour. Drain the cranberries, then toss with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Spread the cranberries and sugar on a baking sheet and set aside to dry, rolling occasionally in the sugar to coat, 2 to 3 hours. Meanwhile, make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with liners. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, allspice, cloves and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the molasses, sugar, vegetable oil and vanilla in a large bowl. Dissolve the baking soda in the boiling water in a liquid measuring cup, then whisk into the molasses mixture. Whisk in the flour mixture, then the egg, until combined. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds of the way. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes spring back when gently pressed, about 22 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Make the frosting: Beat the egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Put 1/4 cup sugar on a large plate; set aside. Combine the remaining 1 cup sugar, the water and rosemary sprigs in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil. Cook until the syrup registers 235 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 5 minutes; remove from the heat. Working quickly, remove the rosemary with tongs and transfer to the plate with the sugar; toss to coat, then set aside. Turn the mixer on high and slowly drizzle the hot syrup into the bowl with the egg whites, aiming the syrup between the side of the bowl and the beater. Continue beating until both the bowl and the mixture are cool to the touch, 12 to 15 minutes. Switch to the paddle attachment and beat in the butter on medium speed, 1 piece at a time, until the frosting is smooth and thick. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip; pipe onto the cupcakes. Top each with a few candied rosemary needles and 2 sugared cranberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57476,&quot;Caramel Apple Cake 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 3 cups sugar 5 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 cup heavy cream 4 large Golden Delicious apples (1 3/4 to 2 pounds) 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup sour cream 1/3 cup fresh orange juice 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 stick unsalted butter, softened 1 1/2 cups sugar 3 large eggs Instructions: Butter a 9-by-3-inch round cake pan. Make the caramel: Cook the sugar and corn syrup in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is dark amber, 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium. Carefully add the cream and 4 tablespoons butter (it will splatter) and cook, stirring, until combined, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let sit 1 minute. Pour 1 1/2 cups caramel into a glass measuring cup and set aside. Pour the remaining caramel into the prepared pan and set aside until set, about 30 minutes. Cut 3 apples into quarters and cut out the cores with a paring knife. Arrange the pieces skin-side down in the pan (overlapping them slightly) to form a ring about 1/2 inch from the edge. Save any pieces that do not fit for later. Halve the remaining whole apple crosswise. Scoop out the seeds with a melon baller or measuring spoon, leaving the stem on the top half. Chop the bottom and any of the leftover quartered apples into pieces; set aside. Arrange the apple top, stem-side down, in the center of the pan. If the quartered apples shift, just push them back into place. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make the batter: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl. In a small bowl, whisk the sour cream, orange juice and vanilla. Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Slip them into the mixer bowl, one at a time, and beat until the mixture is pale and creamy, about 5 more minutes. Scrape down the bowl and beater with a rubber spatula. With the mixer on low speed, add half of the sour cream mixture, then half of the flour mixture. Repeat. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula; finish combining the batter by hand. Spread the batter over the apples in the pan. Top with the chopped apple. Bake on the middle oven rack until the cake is brown on top and springs back when pressed, 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes (don&#39;t worry if the top is dark). Cool in the pan on a rack. Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer in a skillet wide enough to hold the cake pan. Carefully run a sharp knife around the inside of the pan several times, then rest the pan in the water to soften the caramel, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the water and dry. Invert a plate on top of the cake, then flip over the cake and plate. Using pot holders or a towel, wriggle the pan off. Soften the reserved 1 1/2 cups caramel in the microwave, about 2 minutes. Drizzle the cake with some of the caramel. Slice and serve with the rest. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 57477,&quot;Maria&#39;s Meat Pie 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus additional for drizzling over the pie 1 onion, minced 1 pound zucchini, trimmed and sliced thin 1/2 teaspoon herbes de Provence Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 3/4 pound ground veal 1 large egg, beaten lightly 5 tablespoons minced fresh parsley 2 cloves garlic, finely minced 1 1/2 teaspoons each minced fresh thyme and rosemary leaves, or 1/2 teaspoon each dried mint and rosemary, crumbled 1/2 teaspoon Cevender&#39;s Greek seasoning, if available 1/2 cup dried or fresh bread crumbs 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, or to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Turn the heat to medium low and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and pasty, about 3 minutes. Scrape the starter into a small bowl. When cool, cover and refrigerate to allow the starter to rest and firm up slightly, about 2 hours. For the dough: After the starter rests for 2 hours, briefly stir together the flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a stand mixer fitter with the dough hook attachment. Add the milk, egg and starter and knead on low speed until completely combined, about 3 minutes. Add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time and knead on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the hook once or twice, until the dough is smooth, elastic and a little sticky, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease a large bowl. Generously grease a 9-by-4-inch pullman loaf pan or 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.<br> Gather the dough from the mixer, form into a ball and place in the greased bowl seam-side down. Cover with a kitchen towel, set in a warm place and let rise until doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Punch down the dough and roll it out onto a clean work surface. (If needed, lightly flour the surface.) Cut the dough into 2 pieces. Gently form each piece into a ball and set the pieces next to each other seam-side down. Cover with the kitchen towel and let rise for about 15 minutes.<br> When the dough is ready, lightly flour a rolling pin and/or the work surface, if needed. Gently roll out 1 ball of dough into a 6-by-9-inch oval. Fold the top edge of the oval over to the center, then repeat with the bottom edge. Tightly roll the right edge of the dough until you form a log. Gently transfer the log to the prepared pan seam-side down, so one of the smooth sides touches one end of the pan. Repeat with the remaining ball of dough, setting it in the pan so one of the smooth sides touches the other end of the pan. Cover with the kitchen towel, set in a warm place and let rise until doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.<br> Meanwhile position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.<br> When the dough is ready, brush the top with a little milk and bake until the center measures 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 35 minutes. Carefully remove the bread from the pan and set on a wire rack on its side for at least 1 hour before slicing. (If you cut it when the bread is warm, it will compress and lose its fluffy texture.)<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57480,&quot;Chocolate Peak Cupcakes Butter, for greasing pan Flour, for flouring pan 1 1/3 cups hot water 2 tablespoons instant coffee crystals 1 (18.3-ounce) box chocolate fudge cake mix 1/3 cup vegetable oil 3 eggs 12 soft caramel candies, unwrapped 1 (16-ounce) container chocolate frosting 1 (7-ounce) jar marshmallow creme, refrigerated 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut, toasted Instructions: Butter and flour 2 (6-cup) cupcake pans.

Get a freezer bag, put in the potatoes unpeeled but diced, about 1/2-inch square, maybe slightly smaller sometimes, throw chopped garlic after them and then add 2 tablespoons olive oil. (When I&#39;m in a hurry, I forget the garlic and use garlic-infused oil instead.) I shake the bag about so that the oil disperses and covers all the cubes of potato. Empty them onto a baking pan, and then roast them for 45 minutes to 1 hour in the preheated oven. When they&#39;re glistening brown, I lay them on some paper towels and sprinkle with coarse sea salt. You don&#39;t want them to go on the salad when searingly hot, so cool on some paper towels for about 10 minutes. Put some water on for the eggs, put a matchstick into the pot (this stops the white from flowing out if the shell cracks), and then, when boiling, lower in the eggs and boil for exactly 1 minute. Remove and set aside. Tear the romaine leaves into edible sizes and toss with the remaining 3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil to coat well but lightly.

Combine the ground coffee, cocoa powder and cinnamon and mix well. Spread the mixture over a work surface and roll the beef in it until coated evenly. Allow to marinate approximately 30 minutes at room temperature ? it won&#39;t cook evenly if it&#39;s cold. Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the butter and saute the onion and garlic cloves until nicely browned. Add chiles and tortilla pieces and lower the heat, gently sauteing until they are golden brown. Add the chicken stock. Bring the stock to a boil, then simmer, lightly covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the stock from the heat and allow to cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Transfer the ingredients to a blender and puree for 1 minute or until smooth. Pass the sauce through a sieve to remove any coarse pieces. Add the cream, remaining 1 teaspoon salt and brown sugar and blend. The sauce should not be too thick. If too thick, add some more chicken stock or water; it should be a very light consistency. Reserve. Place the beef on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast in the oven for 10 minutes. Immediately lower the heat to 250 degrees F and roast for 20 minutes. Check the beef&#39;s internal temperature with a meat thermometer (125 degrees F for medium-rare, 135 degrees F for medium). If further cooking is necessary, return the beef to the oven (still set at 250 degrees F) and slowly roast to the desired temperature. Remove the beef from the oven and let rest for a few minutes. Before carving, remove the string. To serve, slice the filet into 1/4-inch thick slices. Ladle the pasilla cl broth over the filet. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 57499,&quot;Royal Icing with Meringue Powder 2 pounds confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons meringue powder (egg white powder) Food coloring, as desired Instructions: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and 3/4 cup water in a large bowl. Mix slowly with an electric mixer until stiff enough to form peaks; the icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is over beaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, and then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting. Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. Gels are best with royal icing. You don&#39;t want to thin them with liquid colors. Be careful of adding too much color, which reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days. Store the icing at room temperature, covered, with plastic wrap on the surface. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57500,&quot;Oxtail Stew 7 pounds beef oxtails 1 pound onions, minced 1 ounce salt 1 ounce sugar 1/2-ounce garlic powder 1/4 cup ketchup 1/3 cup soy sauce 2 teaspoons liquid browning or soy sauce 1 teaspoon ground allspice 2 tomatoes, diced 1 bunch scallions, minced 2 cans butter beans, drained Cornstarch mixed with a little cold water, if necessary Instructions: Put the oxtails, onions, salt, sugar, garlic powder, ketchup, soy sauce, liquid browning, allspice, tomatoes and scallions in a 10- to 12-quart pot.

Place the beans in a bowl and mash until pureed. Season with salt and black pepper and keep at room temperature. To assemble the plate: Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Place the fritters in the hot oil and cook until golden brown on each side. Reduce to low flame and continue to cook until the fritter is hot throughout. Serve immediately, with a dollop of sour cream and cured red onions. Plantain Dough: Rinse the plantains with the skins on. Place the plantains in a sauce pan and cover with hot water. Place the saucepan over high heat and cook until the skins of the plantain start to open. Drain the liquid and lay the plantains to cool. Peel the plaintains while the plantains are still warm, mash in a bowl to form a dough. If the dough is too wet add bread crumbs until workable. Divide the dough into 8 balls. Using a clean flat surface, flatten the balls into round circles 1-inch thick. Spoon 1/4 teaspoon of the black bean mixture in the center of the plantain. Fold the edges of the plantain over the center of the plantain to close the bean mixture inside. If you can&#39;t cover all the bean mix, take a piece of plantain mash and place over the beans, while forming into a 1-inch thick round circle.

(You can keep the mixture in a ziptop bag or a large jar ahead of time and have in your pantry, ready to go at a moment&#39;s notice, just like a box mix.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the bottoms but not the sides of three 6-inch cake pans with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper. Add the dry ingredients to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the butter in small pieces and the oil. Mix until the mixture looks like damp sand. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Add the coffee, vanilla and 1/2 cup water, and mix on high for 30 seconds. Divide the batter evenly among the 3 prepared cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the cakes spring back when gently poked. Cool the cakes, then wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for 30 to 40 minutes until firm but not frozen through. Slice each cake in half horizontally to create 2 layers. For the cream cheese frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the cream cheese and mix until smooth. Add the butter and beat on high until smooth. Add the vanilla and, with the mixer on low, slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt. Once the confectioner&#39;s sugar is all added, raise the speed to high and beat until light, fluffy and smooth. For the assembly: Cut three 6-inch rounds of cardboard and place a 6-inch round of parchment on top of each. Place a bottom cake layer from each of the halved cakes on each of the parchment-lined cardboard rounds. Top the 3 rounds with 1/2 cup frosting each, then top with another cake layer and press gently to adhere so you have 3 double-tired cakes. Using a small offset spatula, frost the tops of the cakes smoothly and frost the sides roughly to resemble bark. Place in the refrigerator until set, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, gently melt the chocolate over a saucepan of simmering water or in the microwave. Transfer the chocolate to a pastry bag fitted with a small open tip. Pipe several thin concentric circles on the top of each cake to resemble tree rings. Stack the 3 cakes in a zigzag configuration, placing thick straws into the first 2 layers to add stability where the cakes overlap. If you&#39;re afraid that the layers are unstable after they&#39;re stacked, secure them with wooden skewers: poke the pointy ends down and through the cakes and tap gently with a hammer to force the skewers all the way through the three cakes and into their cardboard rounds (but remember where the skewers are so you can remove them before serving). Top with a Gingerbread Ax before serving. Make the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, white pepper, salt, baking soda, nutmeg and cloves. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, brown sugar and barley malt syrup until smooth. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add the whole egg and continue to mix until completely incorporated. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl again and add the vanilla, fresh ginger and orange zest. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in the mixer. Mix until just combined. Then, turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and press into a disk. Cover completely in the plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes. Draw an ax (to the best of your ability) that&#39;s about 12 inches in length on a piece of parchment. Cut out the ax template from the parchment and set aside. Roll the dough out about 1/4 inch thick between 2 pieces of lightly floured parchment paper. Place the rolled out dough onto parchment on a cookie sheet in the freezer for 15 minutes. Place the ax template drawn-side up on the dough and use a sharp paring knife to carefully cut out an ax from the dough. Repeat a second time to make 2 axes (it&#39;s good to have an extra, in case the first breaks). Cut the remaining dough with cookie cutters. Place the axes and cookies onto parchment-lined cookie sheets. You can gather scraps together and reroll the dough 1 additional time. Brush the ax-head portions of the axes with the egg white and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until just beginning to brown around the edges. Allow the cookies to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57519,&quot;Beef Stroganoff with Beet Creme Fraiche 2 cups beet juice 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 cup creme fraiche<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt 1 pound egg noodles<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 filet mignon steaks (each 1 1/2 -inches thick) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup steak rub, such as Bobby Flay&#39;s Steak Rub 4 tablespoons canola oil<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 1/4 pounds assorted mushrooms (cremini, shiitake, oyster), sliced and chopped<br> 2 large shallots, finely diced<br> 3 cloves garlic, grated finely or chopped to a paste<br> 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups homemade beef stock or low-sodium beef broth<br> Dill and parsley, for serving Instructions: For the beet creme fraiche: Combine the beet juice and sugar in a small nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.

Remove from the heat, add the remaining 2 cups water and cool the brine completely. Put the wings in a bowl and pour in the brine, making sure all the wings are submerged. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. For the wing sauce: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic and ginger are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the hot sauce and sugar and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 5 minutes to develop the flavors. You can leave the sauce on the back of the stove until you need it. For the frying: When you&#39;re ready to fry, drain the wings and pat them dry with paper towels. Put the flour, cornstarch, cornmeal, and chipotle powder in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Dredge the wings in the seasoned flour, making sure each piece is well coated. Leave them on a rack while you heat the oil. Fill a large saucepan one-third full with peanut oil. Set over medium-high heat and heat to 360 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the wings until they&#39;re fully cooked and golden brown, 8 to 9 minutes. Keep an eye on the heat and adjust it to keep the oil between 350 and 375 degrees F. Drain the wings on a rack set over a baking sheet. For serving: When you&#39;ve fried all the wings, put them into a large bowl, pour in the wing sauce, and toss to coat all the wings with sauce.

On a large sheet tray, spread the pound cake cubes evenly and drizzle with the melted butter. Bake for 10 minutes, until golden brown and toasted. For the whipped cream, combine the heavy cream and sugar in a bowl and whisk until soft peaks begin to form. (Alternatively, use an electric beater to whip the cream.) Add the lemon zest and juice and continue to whip to combine. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Meanwhile, preheat a grill to medium heat. Brush the fruit with oil. Grill until the fruit is caramelized and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes per side for the bananas and pineapple and 1 to 2 minutes per side for the strawberries. If the strawberries are small, skewer them to grill. Remove from heat; when slightly cool, slice the fruit into large pieces. Place the toasted pound cake in a large bowl and top with the whipped cream, grilled fruit, sliced almonds, honey and mint. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 57544,&quot;Chicken and Broccoli Twice-Baked Spaghetti Squash 1 medium spaghetti squash (2 1/2 to 3 pounds) 1 cup broccoli florets<br> 2 cups 2% milk<br> 1 clove garlic, smashed<br> 4 ounces Neufchatel cheese (or 1/3 less fat cream cheese)<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella 1/4 cup Greek yogurt<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cooked chicken breasts, diced (use rotisserie chicken for a shortcut)<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. With a sharp knife, carefully cut about four 1/2-inch slits in the squash to allow steam to escape while it cooks. Put the squash on a baking sheet and roast for about 1 1/2 hours. Let the squash cool for about 20 minutes on the baking sheet. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a bowl and prepare an ice water bath. Blanch the broccoli briefly in the boiling water, then transfer to the ice bath to cool. Drain and set aside. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. With a large fork, pull the squash fibers away from the outer peel (use a towel to hold the squash in place if necessary). Reserve the squash and the outer peel. Preheat the broiler. Put the milk and garlic in a saucepan over medium-high heat and heat until it just begins to simmer, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, add the Neufchatel cheese, Parmesan and 1 cup of the mozzarella and stir until melted. Turn off the heat, stir in the yogurt and season with salt and pepper. Remove the garlic. Add the squash, chicken and broccoli and toss to coat. Divide the mixture between the reserved squash peels. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella. Place the stuffed squash onto a baking sheet and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly, a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 57545,&quot;Roasted Stuffed Pheasant with Fresh Corn Sauce 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 small white onion, finely diced 1 large stalk celery, finely diced 1/2 cup finely crushed plain salted crackers, such as wheat crackers 1 large egg 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage 1/3 cup fresh corn kernels, roasted 6 tablespoons chicken stock 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 fresh pheasant (about 2 1/4 pounds) 2 to 3 strips country-style smoked bacon 6 cups fresh corn kernels (6 ears) 1/2 habanero cl, seeds removed 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice 2 teaspoons salt Instructions: To prepare the stuffing: Melt the butter in a saute pan over low heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 20 minutes, or until the onion is cooked through but not brown. Set aside. Put the crackers in a large bowl, add the egg, the cooked onion and celery, the sage, roasted corn, chicken stock, salt, and pepper and mix well. To stuff and roast the pheasant: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Season the pheasant cavity with some of the salt and pepper, then put the stuffing inside. Truss with skewers or tie with butcher&#39;s twine. Season the bird with the remaining salt and pepper. Lay the bacon over the breast. Place the pheasant on a metal roasting rack set inside a roasting pan and place on the middle rack of the oven. Roast for 25 minutes, basting the legs once or twice with the pan juices. After 25 minutes raise the temperature to 450 degrees and finish the bird for 10 minutes more, or until golden brown with an internal temperature of about 140 degrees near the thigh. To prepare the sauce: While the pheasant is roasting, puree the corn kernels in a food processor. You should have about 2 cups of pure. Place in a small saucepan with the habanero. Bring the juice to 200 degrees. Do not boil or the sauce will break. Add the lime juice and salt. To serve: Let the bird rest for 5 minutes before carving. Take the bacon off the breast and carve the bird, dividing the breast and thighs. Serve with the corn sauce and sauteed leeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 57546,&quot;Rocky Road Cheesecake Cooking spray 6 chocolate wafer cookies 20 ounces cream cheese (2 1/2 eight-ounce packages), at room temperature 1 1/4 cups sugar 3 large eggs, at room temperature 1 cup heavy cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 2 meringue cookies, coarsely crushed 2 tablespoons salted peanuts, chopped Instructions: Fill a large roasting pan about one-third of the way with water and carefully place on the middle oven rack. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Wrap the outside of an 8-inch springform pan with aluminum foil. Coat the inside of the pan with cooking spray. Finely crush 3 chocolate cookies and sprinkle the crumbs in the bottom of the springform pan; tap out the excess. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the sugar, eggs, 3/4 cup cream and the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and beat until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is creamy, scraping down the bowl as needed (do not overbeat; if there are still lumps, whisk the batter by hand to smooth them out). Put the chocolate and the remaining 1/4 cup cream in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the chocolate melts, about 45 seconds. Stir in the cocoa powder until smooth. Divide the batter between 2 large liquid measuring cups or bowls (about 2 1/2 cups batter in each). Stir the melted chocolate mixture into one of the batters. Pour about half of the vanilla batter into the pan, then slowly pour half of the chocolate batter into the center of the vanilla, letting it spread. Pour the remaining vanilla batter into the center of the chocolate batter, letting it spread; pour the remaining chocolate batter into the middle. Carefully transfer the cheesecake to the pan of hot water and bake until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly, 1 hour, 30 minutes to 1 hour, 45 minutes. Turn off the oven and keep the cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar, 30 minutes. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and transfer to a rack. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen and let cool completely, then refrigerate overnight. Remove the springform ring. Crush the remaining 3 chocolate cookies and toss in a bowl with the crushed meringues and peanuts.

Butterfly each medallion crosswise, and then place each medallion between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet, pound until each patty is 1/8-inch thick and 6 to 8 inches wide. Mix together the buttermilk, honey, granulated garlic, salt, onion powder and paprika in a bowl to make the marinade. Place the pork into a 9- by 13-inch dish and cover in the marinade. Marinate in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Set up a three-stage breading station, with the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in three separate baking dishes. Place the marinated tenderloins first in the flour, shake off any excess, and then in the eggs, and let any excess drip off, and then in the breadcrumbs. Press the patties into the breadcrumbs until total coverage is achieved. One at a time, fry each patty until golden brown, about 3 minutes, flipping if necessary. The pork is so thin, that by the time it is golden brown, it is done. Once the pork is finished, place it onto a wire-rack-lined baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm, if you like. If not, no worries, it&#39;s just as good at room temperature. For the apricot mustard spread: Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, apricot preserves, honey and horseradish in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. For the sandwich build: On each bottom bun, place 2 slices American cheese and then top with the warm pork tenderloin. Top the pork with red onions, pickles and lettuce.

Gradually pour the oil into the vinegar mixture while whisking constantly to make a creamy dressing.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 57555,&quot;Three-Onion Cherry Jam 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 large sweet yellow onion, sliced thin 1 large red onion, diced small 4 large shallots, sliced thin Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1 cup red wine 1 cup tart cherry juice 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 4 stems thyme 2 stems rosemary 1 dry bay leaf 4 tablespoons brown sugar, divided 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: In a large saucepan, over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the yellow onion, red onion, and shallots to the pan and stir well. Season the onions with salt, and pepper, to taste.<br> When the onions have cooked down and they are deepening in color, deglaze the pan with the red wine. Let the wine cook until reduced and absorbed by the onions. Cook the onions for about 5 minutes more, then add the cherry juice and red wine vinegar. Reduce the heat to medium-low heat, and let cook at a slow simmer. Add the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf. Let the onions cook down until they start taking on a soft texture and the liquid is reduced and absorbed by the onions. Stir in 2 tablespoons brown sugar and honey. Cook, stirring occasionally until the liquid has reduced and the onions have absorbed most of the liquid, about 8 to 10 minutes. Taste the mixture and add more sugar if it is too tart. Test the consistency of the jam by drizzling a spoonful of it onto a plate and letting it cool. It should be thick and not runny. If it is too runny, simmer the mixture longer until more liquid is cooked out.<br> Serve the jam with pork, beef, chicken, or fish, or try it with roasted vegetables. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57556,&quot;Best Mustard Ever 1/4 cup dry mustard powder 2 teaspoons light brown sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1/4 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 cup sweet pickle juice 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup cider vinegar 1/4 cup mustard seed Instructions: In a small, microwave-proof bowl whisk together the dry mustard, brown sugar, salt, turmeric, paprika and garlic powder.

Cover and let sit for 15 minutes. Evenly divide the meat mixture and cheese to each loaf. Top the cheese with the bacon and remaining green onions. Cut the loaves in half and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 57558,&quot;Cornmeal Wreaths 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup yellow cornmeal 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon anise extract, optional 2 large eggs, room temperature 1 cup cornflakes 1 large egg white, beaten Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Whisk the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. In another bowl, beat the butter with a handheld electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugar, vanilla, and anise to the butter and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes more. Add the eggs 1 at a time to the butter mixture and mix until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Stir the flour-cornmeal mixture into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Divide the dough into 34 (1-inch) balls (3/4-ounce). Arrange the cookies on 2 parchment-lined cookie sheets about 1-inch apart. Make a hole in the center of each ball with your finger or the tip of a wooden spoon. Work each piece of dough by hand into a doughnut-like shape with a 1-inch hole and about 2 inches wide. Use scissors to snip 1/2-inch long angled cuts, about 1/2-inch apart around the outside ring of each cookie. Freeze cookies on the sheet until firm, about 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toss a few of the cornflakes at a time with the egg whites and arrange on the surface of the cookies in a leaf like pattern. Bake until just golden around the edges, about 14 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 57559,&quot;Smashed Parmesan Potatoes 3 pounds baby red-skinned potatoes, unpeeled, halved 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/2 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine the potatoes in a large pot of water. Cover and bring the water to a boil. Continue boiling until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, reserving 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid. Return the potatoes to the pot. Coarsely mash the potatoes, adding enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten. Using a large fork, stir in the Parmesan and the oil. Season the potatoes, to taste, with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57560,&quot;Herb Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Pimento Sauce 1 (6 pound) boneless leg of lamb, with shank Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 3 tablespoons pureed garlic 2 tablespoons chopped chipotles (canned) 1/2 cup chopped fresh oregano 2 tablespoons olive oil Pimento Sauce (recipe follows) 2 tablespoons olive oil 5 shallots, finely sliced 1/2 cup mushrooms, sliced 3/4 cup dry white wine 5 cups lamb stock or beef broth 1 teaspoon tomato paste 3 tablespoons pimento or roasted red pepper pureed in a blender 1 teaspoon pureed garlic 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cold Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste Instructions: Ask a butcher to remove all bones, except shank, and to clean meat of all sinew and excess fat inside and out. Butterfly leg for stuffing. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lay lamb flat on counter. Using a sharp knife, make several slits, about 2 inches long by 1/4 inch deep, so seasonings can penetrate meat. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Puree whole garlic cloves with a little olive oil in a food processor. Add canned chipotles and blend into a paste. Spread the paste on the lamb and cover with the oregano. Roll meat to enclose stuffing and tie with string at 1inch intervals, keeping the diameter of the roll the same so that the roast cooks evenly. Shank bone will protrude at one end. Generously season outside with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Brown lamb on all sides. Roast on rack in roasting pan 30 to 40 minutes for medium rare, 1 hour for well done. (A meat thermometer inserted to the center should read 160 to 165 degrees or a thin blade knife inserted to the center for 20 seconds should feel lukewarm on your lips.) Let sit at room temperature about 10 minutes before carving, so juices can run to center. Remove strings and slice meat thinly across the roll. Top with Pimento Sauce. By removing the center bone, leg of lamb is much easier to carve and serve to guests. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over moderate heat. Cook shallots and mushrooms until golden. Add wine, turn heat to high, and reduce by half. Add stock and reduce again by a quarter. Whisk in tomato paste, pimento puree and garlic. Break butter into small pieces and whisk into sauce until smooth. Adjust seasonings and strain through a fine sieve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 57561,&quot;Low-Carb Broccoli Cheddar Soup 6 strips thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 3 pounds broccoli (about 4 heads), separated into florets and stems (about 15 cups total)<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 large white onion, diced (about 2 cups)<br> 1 teaspoon Hungarian smoked paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 4 cups chicken broth<br> 2 cups grated sharp Cheddar (8 ounces), plus more for topping<br> 1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese (4 ounces), plus more for topping<br> 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar<br> Pinch cayenne pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Cook the bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 6 minutes.

Add the paprika and crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until incorporated.<br> Add the broccoli florets, chicken broth and 2 cups water. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened and the broccoli stems and florets are cooked through, about 25 minutes.<br> Remove from the heat and use an immersion blender to blend the soup until creamy. If using a stand blender, work in batches, transferring the soup to the blender and pureeing until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids); return the soup to the pot.<br> Return the soup to medium-low heat and whisk in the Cheddar and Monterey Jack until smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with the vinegar, cayenne and some salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and sprinkle with the bacon and extra Cheddar and Monterey Jack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 57562,&quot;Chinese Milk Bread 2 cups (240 g) plus 2 tablespoons (18 g) bread flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup (114 g) plus 1 tablespoon cold whole milk 4 tablespoons (50 g) plus 2 teaspoons sugar 5 tablespoons (65 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 teaspoons (7 g) active dry yeast 2 large eggs, straight from the refrigerator 3 tablespoons (21 g) dry milk powder 1/4 cup (28 g) cake flour 1 teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt 2 teaspoons hot water Instructions: Whisk the 2 tablespoons (18 g) bread flour with 1/2 cup cold water in a medium saucepan until no lumps remain. Cook, whisking constantly over medium heat until thickened and opaque, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a stand mixer bowl and let cool slightly. Add the 1/2 cup milk and whisk by hand until the mixture is broken up in small pieces. Whisk in the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Let sit until foamy on the surface, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, grease a large bowl with 1/2 tablespoon of the butter and set aside. Grease a 9-inch nonstick springform or cake pan with 3-inch-high sides using another 1/2 tablespoon of the butter and set aside. Top the yeast mixture with the following ingredients in this order: 1 of the eggs, the dry milk powder, remaining 2 cups (240 g) bread flour, the cake flour, 3 tablespoons of the sugar and the salt. Fit the stand mixer with a dough hook and mix on low speed until all the flour is moistened. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth and passes the window pane test, about 10 minutes (see Cook\u2019s Note); scrape down the bowl halfway through. Mix in 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter on medium-low speed until absorbed. Repeat, adding 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter at a time, and mix after each addition until the dough is smooth, about 6 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and form into a tight ball by pulling the edges of the dough toward the center. Toss in the prepared bowl to coat with butter, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Reserve plastic wrap. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and flatten to deflate it. Divide into 8 equal pieces, each about 90 g. Flatten 1 piece into a 3-inch disk and gather all the edges to meet at the center. Flip over and roll into a ball on a work surface, cupping the top of the dough with one hand, until the ball is completely smooth. Repeat with the remaining pieces and transfer all the balls to the prepared pan. Cover with the reserved plastic wrap and let rise until puffy and the buns completely cover the bottom of the pan, about 35 minutes. Position an oven rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Whisk together the remaining egg with the remaining 1 tablespoon milk in a small bowl until no streaks of egg white remain and set aside. Brush onto each bun. Bake until the tops are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the hot water with the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in a small bowl until the sugar is slightly dissolved. Brush onto the tops of the buns when they\u2019re done baking and let cool for 5 minutes. Run a thin knife around the pan, release the buns from the springform or cake pan and let cool on a wire rack until still slightly warm. Enjoy the soft and sweet buns. The buns can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for about 5 days or tightly wrapped and frozen for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57563,&quot;Sunday Dinner Pork Roast with Mushroom Gravy 1 (5 to 7 pound) pork loin or butt 1 pound button or cremini mushrooms 1 whole head garlic, cloves separated and peeled 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce Emeril&#39;s Red Hot Sauce or other hot sauce Salt 1 tablespoon Essence, recipe follows Freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon garlic powder 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 large yellow onion, chopped 2 ribs celery, chopped 1/2 medium green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 6 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons flour 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped 1/2 medium green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped 1 rib celery, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 bunch green onions, green and white parts chopped separately 2 cups rich beef stock 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Pierce the roast all over with the tip of a paring knife and stuff one clove of garlic into each hole, followed by a few drops of hot sauce. Sprinkle on all sides with Essence and garlic powder and rub into the meat. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat and brown the roast evenly on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the chopped onion, celery, bell pepper, and enough water to come 1-inch up the sides of the pan. Add the teriyaki sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and stir to combine and loosen any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Cover and bake for 45 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and add a more water as necessary to come 1-inch up the sides of the pan. Continue to cook until very tender, about 3 1/2 hours total cooking time. Meanwhile, to make the gravy, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan. Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat, until milk chocolate-colored roux is formed, about 15 minutes. Add the onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic, and the white part of the green onions, and cook until the vegetables are soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the beef stock and heavy cream and cook until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. While the sauce is simmering, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until tender and golden brown around the edges, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and teriyaki sauce to the gravy and simmer until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Remove the roast from the oven and transfer to a platter. Cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Strain the pan juices through a fine mesh strainer into the gravy and simmer until heated through and thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve over the carved roast. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container.

Add the butternut squash, carrots, celery and onions and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Saute until they develop some color and cook down a bit, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the beans, tomatoes, Parmigiano rind and 3 cups of the stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Remove the Parmigiano rind. Add the cabbage and kale and simmer for an additional 20 minutes. Check the soup for seasoning and adjust to taste. Add the bread and press it into the broth to absorb. Simmer for 5 more minutes. If the bread still seems dry, add the remaining cup stock (it should have the look of bread pudding). Cool the ribollita to room temperature before placing it in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Add 2 tablespoons light oil to the bottom of a 10-inch nonstick skillet and preheat it over medium-high heat until hot. Using two spoons, spoon 1 1/2 to 2 cups ribollita into the skillet to cover the bottom. Flatten it a bit and let it cook until both sides are deeply golden brown and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes on each side. (Don&#39;t worry if the ribollita breaks as you are flipping it with your spatula; just continue to cook until browned on both sides.) Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining ribollita in the same manner. For serving: Add the crispy ribollita to a platter. Top with the burrata, freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and freshly ground black pepper. Cut into wedges and serve the prosciutto alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 57566,&quot;Plumbers Hot Sub 8\ club roll Russian dressing 4 oz. fresh carved or quality deli turkey 2-3 slices of crisp bacon 2-3 slices of Swiss cheese Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Split the club roll 2/3rds of the way down from the top center of the roll with a serrated knife. The roll bottom should be able to sit flat on a pie tin or cookie sheet. Spread Russian dressing generously over the inside of the roll. Layer turkey inside the roll. Place bacon strips over the turkey inside the roll. Layer Swiss cheese across the opening of the roll as a cap (not tucked in roll). Bake for 5-7 minutes until cheese bubbles and starts turning light brown (dark brown does not taste very good). Let stand for a minute to cool cheese so it doesn&#39;t burn anyone. To impress your friends, cut diagonally across center and serve while it is still steaming. For a variation use mayonnaise instead of Russian dressing. Add a little heat with some fresh horseradish (especially good with the mayonnaise version).

Saute shallots until golden, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook over high heat until slightly browned, about 2 additional minutes. Remove from heat and add brandy and Madeira reserving 1/4 cup of each for final seasoning. Cook over high heat until liquid is reduced by half. Add lobster stock and return to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the strength of your stock. (Weaker stocks need to cook longer to concentrate their flavors.) Occasionally skim and discard foam that rises to the top. Make beurre manie by mixing butter and flour with your fingers to form a smooth paste. Press onto ends of a whisk. When broth has a strong, almost salty, lobster flavor, add cream and bring it back to a boil, skimming foam occasionally. Then whisk in beurre manie until dissolved. Cook an additional 5 minutes over high heat, whisking occasionally. Strain through a fine sieve, pressing with the back of a ladle to extract all juices. Season with lemon juice, reserved brandy and Madeira, and hot pepper sauce, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 57599,&quot;Gelato-Style Vanilla Ice Cream 2 1/2 cups whole milk 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch 3/4 cup heavy cream 2/3 cup organic cane sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Instructions: Combine 1/2 cup milk and the cornstarch in a medium bowl; whisk until smooth. Combine the remaining 2 cups milk, the heavy cream, sugar and salt in a medium high-sided saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar, until steaming, 3 to 5 minutes. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the cornstarch mixture, whisking constantly, then pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil, about 5 minutes (it will foam up a bit). Boil, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds, then remove from the heat. Pour the mixture into a medium heatproof bowl. Stir in the vanilla. Let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until the mixture stops steaming, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until cold, 2 to 3 hours. Stir the mixture, then strain it if it looks lumpy. Transfer to an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions until the consistency of soft serve.

Butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins and set aside. Over a double boiler, melt the butter and chocolate, whisking until smooth. Whisk in the sugar and transfer to a medium bowl. Whisk in the eggs and flour until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared ramekins about 2/3 full. Place 1 of the small chocolate squares right in the middle of each cake and press down with your fingers so it rests in the middle of the ramekin. Bake the cakes until slightly puffy and set around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Don&#39;t worry if your cake tester comes out wet, the center should still be loose. BYOC: Use a nice sea salt to garnish, or try toasted coconut flakes, toasted and chopped nuts, fresh berries in the summer or freshly whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Zinfandel]&quot; 57601,&quot;Cheese on Toast 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 to 5 sprigs fresh thyme, washed, dried and stemmed 1 loaf Italian bread, cut into 16 (1-inch) thick rounds on the bias Kosher salt 16 ounces fresh, tangy goat cheese, preferably in log form, cut into 16 slices Sea salt Instructions: The thing I like most about a recipe like this is that you have a chance to showcase your favorite type of cheese in a way that&#39;s hard for people to resist. I like goat cheese for the \tang\ factor and the supple texture. This goes great with a bowl of my chicken soup but can really fit in with any soup for the \comfort\ factor. Heat a large skillet, over medium heat, and add the olive oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat and add the thyme leaves. The thyme should make a crackling sound as it hits the oil, cooking it slightly and mellowing the flavor. Add the bread in a single layer. Turn the heat back on and cook over medium heat until the first side browns, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a pair of tongs to turn the toasts on their second side and season with kosher salt. Top each round with a slice of cheese and continue cooking them over very low heat or off the heat, for 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the seasonings with sea salt, to taste. Serve alongside soup, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57602,&quot;Oven-Roasted Halibut with Black Olive Tapenade on Roasted Red Peppers (Rape Asado con Tapenada Negra Y Pimientos Morrones) 1 1/2 cups Gaeta olives, pitted 1 1/2 cups oil-cured olives, pitted 2 anchovy fillets 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 3 tablespoons capers, preferably nonpareil, drained 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves 6 (7 to 8-ounce) halibut fillets, with skin Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 3 cups slice (1/4) bottle roasted sweet red peppers, see Cook&#39;s Note Instructions: Put all of the tapenade ingredients into the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until smooth. Scrape the tapenade into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. The tapenade may be made up to 3 days in advance. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Pat the halibut fillets dry with paper towels. Season the halibut steaks generously with salt and pepper. Heat the canola oil over medium-high heat in a large oven-proof frying pan (no plastic handles!) until hot but not smoking. Slip the halibut pieces skin side down into the pan and cook until the bottom side has is golden and the edges of the fish start to look opaque, about 3 minutes. Flip the steaks over and place in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes or until the steaks are just opaque in the center. While the fish is cooking, warm the red peppers in a skillet over low heat. To serve, place a small mound of red peppers on each plate and place the halibut on the mound. Using 2 teaspoons, form a quenelle (egg-shape) of tapenade and set atop the steak. The tapenade used to top the fillets keeps for a good long time in the refrigerator. You can use it to top just about any fish or chicken off the grill, stir it into salad dressings or as a sandwich spread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 57603,&quot;Chipotle-Lime Chicken Tacos 1 bone-in, skin-on whole chicken, rinsed and dried Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 lime, zested and juiced (lime halves reserved), plus 1 lime, zested 1/4 cup water 1 cup crema 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, finely minced into a paste 8 (6-inch) corn tortillas, warmed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks, mayonnaise, mustard,Tabasco®, chives, tomatoes, tarragon, salt and nutmeg together. Add the crab to the ingredients in the mixing bowl, and fold with hands. Add the panko bread crumbs and mix well. Scoop 2-ounce balls of mixture onto a sheet pan and set aside. Wrap the crab balls in kataifi phyllo dough until enclosed and completely covered. Place on a sheet pan; cover and set inside the refrigerator. To make the sauce, in a saucepan saute the shrimp, onion and garlic in the butter until lightly browned. Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, cook for 8 minutes. Deglaze with the white wine, and reduce until the wine is evaporated. Add the lobster base, Old Bay® seasoning, tarragon, thyme, heavy cream, and let it simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and puree the mixture in a blender. Strain through a chinois, and reserve until ready to use. To serve, place each kataifi-wrapped crab on a spoon and slowly immerse into a preheated fryer set at high heat until golden brown.

Add the butter and pulse 12 to 15 times, until the butter is the size of peas. Add the egg yolks and pulse a few times to combine. With the motor running, add the ice water through the feed tube and pulse until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a floured board and roll it into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Meanwhile, place the tomatoes in a large bowl. Put the parsley, basil, garlic, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until finely minced. With the processor running, pour the olive oil down the feed tube and process until combined. Pour the mixture over the tomatoes and toss gently. Set aside. On a well-floured board, roll the dough out to an 11 x 17-inch rectangle and transfer it to the prepared sheet pan. Don&#39;t worry if it doesn&#39;t fit exactly; you want it to cover most of the bottom of the pan but it can be a little rough on the sides. Place a second sheet pan directly on the pastry and bake for 15 minutes. (You can also line the pastry with foil and fill it with dried beans.) Remove the top sheet pan (or the beans and foil). Using a dinner fork, pierce the pastry in many places. Bake for another 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned. Check the pastry during baking; pierce any spots that bubble up. Allow the crust to cool for 15 minutes. Lower the oven to 375 degrees. Brush the mustard on the crust with a pastry brush. Sprinkle a thick even layer of Gruyere on the pastry, reserving 1/2 cup for the top, and sprinkle with the 1/2 cup of Parmesan. Place overlapping tomatoes in rows on top. If there is a little garlic and herb mixture in the bowl, sprinkle it over the tomatoes, but if there is liquid in the bowl, strain it through a very-fine-mesh strainer, discard the liquid, and sprinkle the garlic and herb mixture on the tomatoes. Sprinkle the reserved 1/2 cup of Gruyere and the remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan on top. Bake for 30 minutes. Cool slightly, cut into squares, and serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 57610,&quot;Baked Brie with Fig Compote 1/2 cup dried Mission figs, stemmed and chopped 2 wide strips orange zest (removed with a vegetable peeler) 2 sprigs thyme 3 tablespoons brandy 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Freshly ground pepper 1 piece refrigerated pie dough (half a 14-ounce package) All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 7- to 8-ounce wheel brie cheese 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions: Combine the figs, orange zest, thyme, brandy, sugar, vinegar, a few grinds of pepper and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid is syrupy and the figs are softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl, discard the zest and thyme and let cool, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a food processor or mini chopper and pulse until mostly smooth. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll the pie dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll out the outer 2 inches of dough with a rolling pin to make the edge slightly thinner than the rest of the dough. Put the cheese in the center of the dough and top with the fig compote. Trim about 1 inch off the outer edge of the dough. Pull the dough up and over the cheese, folding and pleating the dough all the way around until the cheese is covered. Pinch the dough together at the top to seal. Transfer the wrapped cheese to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the dough with the beaten egg and bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool about 10 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board to slice. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 57611,&quot;Devil&#39;s Food Cake 15 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, finely chopped 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 2 cups all-purpose unbleached flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar 3/4 cup nonalkalized cocoa powder (not Dutch-processed) 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups water 1/4 cup milk Instructions: To make the frosting: Put the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate, move the bowl gently to let the cream settle. Set the mixture aside until softened, about 4 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Cover the surface of the frosting with plastic wrap. Set aside and let set up at room temperature, about 2 hours. To make the cake: Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with a circle of parchment or wax paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter at medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium-high and slowly add the sugar. Continue beating until light and smooth, about 4 minutes. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla and beat at medium speed for 1 minute more. (Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl again, if needed.) With the mixer running at medium-low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, beating for 1 minute between each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Combine the water and milk in a saucepan and bring just to a boil. Remove from the heat. With the mixer at low speed, add the flour mixture, about a 1/4 cup at a time. Carefully pour the hot liquid into the batter. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a large rubber spatula, finish combining the batter until smooth. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Lightly drop each pan onto the counter to settle the batter. Set the pans on the middle rack in the oven. Bake until the cakes begin to pull away from the sides of the pans and the center springs back when touched lightly, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes, in the pans, on a rack for 10 minutes. Turn the cake layers out of the pans and cool on the rack. (If not assembling the cake right away, wrap the layers in plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 1 day, or freeze for up to 2 months.) Assemble the Devil&#39;s Food Cake. Place 1 cake layer upside-down on a cake stand or flat plate. Scoop about 1/3 of the icing onto the center of the layer. Using a large, offset spatula, spread the icing evenly over the layer to the edges. Place the other cake layer, rounded-side up, on top. Evenly spread half of the remaining icing over the top, spreading any excess icing down the sides. Spread the remaining icing around the sides of the cake. Use the tip of the offset spatula to make a swirling pattern in the icing. Serve. Store under a cake dome or loosely wrapped with plastic, at room temperature, for up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 57612,&quot;Watercress, Chayote, Papaya, and Avocado Salad Tropical Dressing, recipe follows 1 bunch watercress, cleaned 2 chayotes, cooked and diced into 1-inch cubes<br> 1 cup ripe papaya, diced into 1/2-inch cubes 1 cup ripe avocado into 1/2-inch cubes Salt and pepper 1/2 cup deep-fried green plantain slivers, for garnish 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 3 tablespoons lime juice 2 tablespoons orange juice 4 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1 teaspoon honey 1/4 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Salt and pepper Instructions: Place some the dressing in a large bowl and gently toss the watercress with the dressing, lightly shaking off excess.

Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour three 8-inch round cake pans; line the bottoms with parchment paper. Sift the flour, baking soda and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the granulated sugar and vegetable oil in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until it looks like wet sand, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla; beat on high speed until light, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour. Continue beating until smooth, about 1 minute. Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then invert onto racks; remove the parchment and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the topping: Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk the egg whites in a medium bowl until just foamy. Spread the granulated sugar in a pie plate or shallow bowl. Dip the grapes in the egg whites, letting any excess drip back into the bowl, then roll in the sugar. Transfer the sugared grapes to the prepared baking sheet. Freeze at least 30 minutes. Make the frosting: Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, then the vanilla. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until very light and fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Assemble the cake: Put 1 cake layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread about one-third of the grape filling on the cake, then top with another cake layer and half of the remaining filling. Top with the third cake layer. Cover the top and side of the cake with the frosting. Refrigerate to set the frosting, 15 to 20 minutes. Spread the remaining filling on top of the cake, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Arrange the frozen grapes around the border. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 57617,&quot;Orange Grand Marnier Sauce for Nian Gao 1 cup fresh orange juice 1/2 tablespoon minced ginger 4 oranges, broken into segments 1/2 cup Grand Marnier Instructions: In a non-reactive saute pan, add juice and ginger and bring to a boil.

Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity and rinse the chicken under cold water, inside and out. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Season the body and cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, mix together the butter, lemon juice and chopped herbs. Rub the herbed butter all over the chicken. Put the lemon halves, onion, garlic and whole herbs inside the bird. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine to help hold its shape. Place the chicken, breast side down, on a V-rack in a roasting pan. Cooking the chicken on a rack helps make its skin crisp and keeps it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Pour water in the roasting pan to prevent the fat drippings from burning and smoking. Roast the chicken for about 20 minutes, then carefully turn the bird over breast side up. It is best to take the pan out of the oven, close the oven door to maintain the temperature, and rotate the chicken on the counter. Baste the chicken all over with the pan drippings. Turn the heat down to 375 degrees F and return the pan to the oven. Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees to 170 degrees F, count on this taking about 2 hours. Remove the chicken to a platter and let stand for 15 minutes so the juices settle back into the meat before carving. Meanwhile, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a gravy separator or measuring cup to let the fat rise to the top. Skim and discard the fat then return the pan juices back in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on top of the stove over medium heat. Add the sherry and deglaze, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Season with salt and pepper, and serve with chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57621,&quot;Rivoli Hors d&#39;Oeuvres 24-ounce jar pickled herring, about 5 fish 2 large green apples, cored and seeded 1/4 cup Calvados 1/4 cup whipping cream Freshly ground salt Freshly ground white pepper 1 package gelatin 1/2 cup cold water 2 egg whites, whipped* (See Disclaimer) 4 tablespoons clarified butter 4 onions, 2 ounces each, quartered and petals separated 3/4 cup dry white wine 3/4 cup ketchup 1/2 cup golden raisins Freshly ground salt Freshly ground pepper 8 ounces button mushrooms 2 veal brains, rinsed well and soaked in cold water for 1 hour 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup white wine vinegar 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Instructions: For Pickled Herring Mousse: Chill mold for mousse in freezer.

Working 1 potato at a time, slice the potatoes very thin on a mandoline. (Work quickly to prevent discoloring, and don&#39;t put the potatoes in water, as this will wash off the starch.) Coat an 8-inch nonstick saute pan with olive oil, then layer the potato slices, starting in the center of the pan and making concentric circles. (Remember that eventually the bottom will become the top, so it is important for the first circles of potato to look pretty.) Brush each potato layer with olive oil, and sprinkle every second or third layer liberally with grated Parmigiano and salt. After each layer, press the potatoes so they are very compact. Place the pan over medium heat, and cook until the olive oil begins to sizzle and the potatoes begin to brown on the bottom. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake about 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Carefully and completely drain the excess oil out of the side of the pan (drips may cause burns). Flip the pan so the potato cake is turned out onto the bottom of the lid, then slide the potato cake off the lid and back into the pan (so the brown side is now facing up and the top becomes the bottom). Return the cake to the oven and bake until fork-tender, another 10 to 15 minutes.

Lay 8 wooden skewers in a baking dish and cover with cold water; soak for 15 minutes (you can skip this step if using metal skewers). Thread 4 shrimp onto two skewers for each serving. Season the shrimp with the dried oregano and some salt and pepper and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Grill the shrimp, turning occasionally, until pink in color and cooked through, about 5 minutes total.<br> While the shrimp are on the grill, in a medium bowl toss together the tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, olive oil, juice of half the lemon, and some salt and pepper. Let the salad marinate for 5 minutes. Cut the remaining lemon half into wedges<br> Once the shrimp come off the grill, brush both sides of the bread cheese slices with the remaining vegetable oil and grill just until softened, about 20 seconds per side. Serve the bread cheese while still warm with the vegetable salad, grilled shrimp, wedges of lemon, and a few drizzles of extra-virgin olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57648,&quot;Graham Cracker Cake with Peanut Butter Frosting Nonstick cooking spray 2 cups graham flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups granulated sugar 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 3 large eggs plus 2 large yolks, at room temperature 2 cups buttermilk, well-shaken 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 cups creamy peanut butter 1 1/4 sticks (10 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: For the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat two 9-inch cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. Line the bottoms with parchment rounds; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray.<br> Whisk together both of the flours, baking powder, salt, baking soda and cinnamon in a large bowl until combined. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and vanilla in another bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the whole eggs and yolks one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl, until the batter is completely combined, smooth and creamy. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.<br> Scrape the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Smooth the tops. Bake, rotating the pans from left to right halfway through, until the cakes are a light golden brown and a tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer the pans to a wire rack and let the cakes cool for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the sides of the cakes and invert onto the wire rack. Remove the parchment and let the cakes cool completely.\u202f<br> For the frosting: Beat the confectioners\u2019 sugar, peanut butter, butter, vanilla and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until very smooth, about 5 minutes.

Cover and set aside. Shake or stir the mixture every so often to coat the fruit with the rum. Prepare Sponge: In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast in the water to soften. Heat the milk to 110 degrees F and add it to the yeast along with the honey and 1 cup flour. Cover the sponge with plastic wrap and let rise until light and full of bubbles, about 30 minutes. By Hand: Add the fruit mixture, honey, egg, butter, zest, salt, mace, almonds, and 2 cups of the flour to the sponge. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until the dough is smooth and elastic. By Mixer: In the mixer bowl, add the fruit mixture, honey, egg, butter, zest, salt, mace, almonds, and 2 cups of the flour to the sponge. Using the paddle, beat the mixture on medium low speed for 2 minutes. Gradually add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl. Change to the dough hook. Continue to add flour 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough just begins to clean the bowl. Knead 4 to 5 minutes on medium-low. First rise: Put the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Shape and Fill: Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface. For 1 large loaf, roll the dough into a 9 by 13-inch oval. For 2 loaves, divided the dough in half and roll each half into a 7 by 9-inch oval. Brush the melted butter over the top of the oval(s). Combine the cinnamon and granulated sugar and sprinkle over one lengthwise half of the oval(s). Fold the dough in half lengthwise and carefully lift the bread(s) onto a parchment-lined or well-greased baking sheet. Press lightly on the folded side to help the loaf keep its shape during rising and baking. Second rise: Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise for 45 minutes. Preheat oven: About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake and cool: Bake for 25 minutes until the internal temperature of the bread reaches 190 degrees F. Immediately remove from the baking sheet and place on a rack to cool. To serve: Sprinkle heavily with confectioners&#39; sugar just before serving. Variation: Between 2 pieces of waxed paper or plastic wrap, roll 3 ounces almond paste or marzipan into the lengthwise shape of half the oval. Omit the butter and cinnamon-sugar filling. Place the marzipan on half of the oval and fold the dough in half. Let rise and bake as directed. Notes: One cup coarsely chopped mixed dried fruits may be substituted for the candied fruit. Cover the dried fruit with boiling water and let sit at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours. Drain and use as you would candied fruit. You can also make your own candied fruit and peel. This bread freezes nicely for up to 6 months. If freezing it, do not sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar. To serve, first thaw the bread, then bake on a baking sheet in a preheated 375 degree F oven for 7 to 10 minutes.

Scrub the potatoes well and pierce in several places with the tip of a knife. Bake on a baking sheet until cooked through, about 1 hour. Set aside to cool. Once they&#39;re cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes and pass the flesh through a ricer or the finest holes of a food mill. Place 1 1/2 cups of the flour on a clean work surface and put the potatoes in the middle. Season with the salt. Knead the potatoes and the flour together until it&#39;s a smooth ball of dough that&#39;s slightly sticky. If the dough is too sticky, add more of the remaining 1/2 cup flour gradually to achieve the smooth consistency. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and cover 3 of them with a dampened kitchen towel. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the uncovered piece of dough into a 1-inch-thick rope. Cut into 3/4-inch pieces. Turn a fork over and hold at a 45-degree angle, with the tines touching the work surface. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll it down the fork tines, pressing with your thumb to make ridges on one side. Place on a large baking sheet lined with a kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add half the gnocchi and cook until they bob to the surface of the water. Transfer to a shallow bowl and cook the remaining gnocchi. Serve the gnocchi warm with the Marinara Sauce. Top with shaved Parmesan and garnish with chopped basil. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until starting to shimmer. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the butter until melted. Remove from the heat and add the chopped basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 57657,&quot;Big Sky Posole 2 cups white hominy 2 cups blue hominy 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 2 ounces baking soda 4 dried chiles (such as pasilla, ancho, or guajillo)* or any combination of chiles, as long as there is a little variation for increased complexity) 4 tablespoons olive oil 3 cups diced onions 6 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning 1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for seasoning 2 teaspoons dried oregano 2 (14-ounce) cans diced tomatoes, in juice 1 pound tomatillos, peeled and quartered 1 gallon vegetable stock 1/2 cup lime juice 1/2 bunch chopped fresh cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish Crumbled queso fresco, for garnish optional Toasted pumpkin seeds, for garnish, optional Instructions: Soak the different colors of hominy in separate bowls of water overnight. In a small, dry skillet over high heat, roast the cumin and coriander seeds until they toast, about 2 minutes. When cool, grind in a food mill, mortar and pestle or clean coffee grinder. Strain the hominy and put each color variety in its own pot, generously covering with water. Add 1-ounce of the baking soda to each pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about 2 hours. Add more water as needed. Check hominy for tenderness; it does not have to be completely cooked as it will be cooked further in the stew. Strain and rinse the hominy. While the hominy is cooking, soak the dried chiles in hot water. When softened, remove the seeds and stems, then dice. In a separate stockpot, heat the olive oil and saute the onions and garlic with the salt, black pepper, oregano, cumin and coriander until the onions are translucent. Add the diced tomatoes, tomatillos, chiles, vegetable stock and cooked hominy. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer for about 1 1/2 hours. The posole is done when the hominy is cooked through. Add the lime juice, cilantro, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Posole is also delicious for breakfast, served over cornbread with a poached egg on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 57658,&quot;Cauliflower Croquettes with Peppadew Aioli 3 cups milk Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 2 cups cauliflower florets 2 tablespoons butter 3 eggs 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg 2 cups panko bread crumbs 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 cups vegetable oil, for frying 3 cloves garlic 1 lemon, zested and juiced 4 egg yolks* 3/4 to 1 cup olive oil 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 cup drained and roughly chopped peppadews Instructions: To make the croquettes: In a large saucepan over low heat, add the milk and a large pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, add the cauliflower and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Remove the cauliflower from the pot, place in a bowl and pat dry with a towel. Toss the cauliflower with 2 tablespoons butter and put into a food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times. Let the mixture cool slightly and add 1 egg, Parmesan, parsley, nutmeg, salt and pepper, to taste, and pulse to combine. Remove to a large bowl, then add 1 cup of the bread crumbs and stir. There should be enough bread crumbs to hold the mixture together to form into balls. If the mixture is too wet add a little more panko. Heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven. Form the mixture into 2-inch round balls and set aside on a plate. Place the flour, 2 whisked eggs, and remaining panko into 3 separate bowls and season each with a little salt and pepper. Place each of the croquettes into the flour then the egg wash and then the panko. Place the croquettes into the oil, in batches if necessary, and fry until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the croquettes with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and place on a serving dish. To make the aioli: Place garlic, lemon juice, zest, and egg yolks in a blender or food processor. Blend until the ingredients are combined. With the machine running, remove the lid and slowly drizzle in the olive oil. When well combined, taste for seasoning, adjust if necessary, then add the peppadews and pulse until aioli is speckled with them, but not fully blended. Remove the aioli to a small serving bowl and serve with the Cauliflower Croquettes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 57659,&quot;4-Bean Relish 1/3 cup red wine vinegar 4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/4 cup scallions, sliced 3/4 cup red onions, finely diced 1/4 cup peppadew peppers (sweet red peppers) or roasted red bell peppers, finely diced 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 3 tablespoons honey 1 (12-ounce) can white beans, drained 1 (12-ounce) can chick peas, garbanzo beans, drained 1 (12-ounce) can pinto beans, drained 1 (12-ounce) can black beans, drained Instructions: Mix all ingredients together and let sit in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour for the flavors to blend.

Set aside. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the marshmallows (reserving 4 pieces for garnish) and stir until completely melted, about 5 minutes; stir in the vanilla. Add the rice cereal and stir with the sprayed utensil until the cereal is completely coated and the mixture is thoroughly combined. Coat your hands with a little nonstick cooking spray so the mixture does not stick. Divide the crispy treat mixture into two portions, 1/4 of the mixture (about 9 ounces) and 3/4 of the mixture (about 1 1/2 pounds). Using the larger portion, make a teardrop-shaped body 8 inches across at the wide end and about 12 inches long. Using your hands or a spoon, create a cavity at the tail end of the teardrop shape, where you would ordinarily put stuffing in a real turkey. Do not hollow out the entire body, you only need to make an indentation about 4 inches deep. Take the remaining crispy treat mixture and set one-third of it aside to make the wings. From the other two thirds, mold two drumstick shapes and affix them to either side of the cavity. Make two wings and attach them to either side of the wide end of the teardrop. Transfer the turkey to a serving platter and fill the cavity with chopped-up chocolate-wafer candy bars. For a little flourish, mix in some sliced-up green gummy candy to resemble parsley. Whisk the cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar over the turkey to give the outside a browned look. Attach the four reserved mini marshmallows to the ends of the drumsticks to resemble bone tips. Tuck the slices of dried pineapple, dried kiwi and some grapefruit gummy candy around the turkey for garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 57661,&quot;Single Malt Scotch Martini 3 ounces Oban scotch 1/4-ounce Tio Pepe Fino Sherry Lemon peel spiral Instructions: Combine scotch and sherry in cocktail shaker, stir, strain into martini glass and garnish with the lemon peel spiral.; &quot;,&quot;[Single Malt Scotch, Fino Sherry]&quot; 57662,&quot;Oysters Rockefeller Chowder 12 Maryland select oysters and liquor 6 strips bacon 1 baking potato, like russet 1 tablespoon minced shallots 6 ounces liquorice flavored liqueur (Recommended: Pernod) 1 cup finely chopped fresh spinach 1 quart heavy cream 1/2 tablespoon white pepper 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup shredded white cheddar Instructions: Shuck oysters and reserve liquor.

Salt and pepper can be added now, immediately before cooking to allow full incorporation into the eggs. Heat the pan over medium to low heat. Add the butter and allow to heat to a bubbly state without burning or browning. Add the beaten eggs to the pan and immediately begin to stir the eggs in a circular fashion so they do not stick to the bottom at the same time that you shake the pan across the burners. Keep the pan moving, stirring with your spatula, so that as the eggs begin to cook and coagulate, you pull cooked egg from the outer edge of the pan over raw egg in the center. When the eggs are half cooked, cease stirring and shaking the pan, and now roll the raw and runny egg outward by twisting your wrist. The uncooked egg will now cook on the bottom and sides of the pan. The entire cooking process will take at most 2 minutes and experience will be the best teacher to master the classic omelette. The omelette should not brown but should stay a beautiful egg golden. .Give the pan 1 or 2 good firm raps on the burner and, holding the handle in one hand in an underhanded grip, tilt the handle upward and begin to roll the edge of the omelette furthest away from the serving dish towards the plate. Roll this edge of the omelette one third towards the center, begin to slide the front of the omelette out onto the plate so the leading edge becomes the seam of the omelette and is flatly on the bottom. This will from the perfect oval shaped omelette. To make filled omelettes, add cooked vegetables, cheese or meats to the center of the omelette just before you begin to roll the omelette for the finished plate. Always heat fillings separately and cut the meat and cheese thinly enough to be thoroughly heated by the heat from the omelette center. Suggested fillings: Sauteed mushrooms and goat cheese, fresh herbs; thyme, chives, tarragon, parsley, sauteed spinach, cheddar cheese and jalapeno pepper, cooked bacon or country ham ratatouille &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 57666,&quot;Cola Barbecue Sauce 1 cup cola 1 cup ketchup 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon liquid smoke 3 tablespoons steak sauce 1 teaspoon onion flakes 1 teaspoon garlic flakes 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine all the ingredients in a heavy non-reactive saucepan and gradually bring to a boil over medium heat.

Add the carrots, parsnips, celery root and the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables start to soften, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Gradually stir in the heavy cream and 1 cup water until smooth. Tie the thyme sprigs and bay leaves together with kitchen twine; add to the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the liquid is thick, about 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Discard the herb bundle. Stir in the lemon zest and juice, scallions and parsley. Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Spread the shallots evenly over the crust in the baking dish, then add the root vegetable filling in an even layer. Cover with the prepared top crust; use kitchen scissors to trim the excess pastry so there is a 1-inch overhang. Pinch the 2 crusts together, then fold the overhanging dough under itself. Chill 20 minutes. Brush the top crust with the beaten egg. Score decoratively with a paring knife, being careful not to pierce completely through; poke a few vents in the crust to allow steam to escape. Bake until the crust is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57679,&quot;Sweet and Sour Long Beans 2 cups long grain rice 3 1/2 cups water or stock 2 garlic cloves, minced 3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger 4 tablespoons soy sauce 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice 3 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon peanut oil 1/4 pound ground pork 1 1/2 pounds yard long beans, trimmed and cut into 2 inch pieces (regular green beans can be substituted) Instructions: To cook the rice: Place the rice and water in a glass-measuring cup large enough to hold them or any microwave safe bowl. The rice expands a lot during cooking, so choose a container large enough to accommodate the final product. Microwave on high, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Microwave on medium-low, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Do not stir the rice at any time during the cooking process. Season with salt and fluff with a fork just before serving. To prepare long beans: In a small non-reactive bowl, combine garlic, ginger, soy sauce, lime juice and brown sugar, stir until completely mixed. In a large skillet or wok pan, heat oil over medium high heat. Add pork and cook until browned, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the beans and toss until well coated. Cook 7 to 10 minutes or until beans are almost cooked. Increase heat to high, add the sauce and cook until sauce reduces and thickens, about 5 to 6 minutes. Serve immediately over hot rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57680,&quot;Super Summery Corn Gnocchi 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates 4 large ears corn, husks and silks removed 2 Fresno chiles 1 medium leek, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 2/3 cup low-sodium vegetable broth 1/3 cup half-and-half 1 pound frozen potato gnocchi 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar Instructions: Preheat a grill for cooking at medium heat and lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the corn and chiles, turning every few minutes, until the corn is tender and browned in spots and the chiles are nicely charred, about 8 minutes for the corn and about 4 minutes for the chiles. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool slightly. When they are cool enough to handle, stem and deseed the chiles (keep some of the seeds if you prefer a spicier dish). Finely chop the chiles and transfer to a medium bowl. Using a sharp chef\u2019s knife, cut the kernels off the corn cobs. Using the back of the knife, scrape along the cobs to release the starchy, milky liquid and any remaining kernels. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half the kernels to the same bowl as the chiles and set aside; keep the remaining half of the kernels and the corn \u201cmilk\u201d separate. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.<br> Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, a pinch of salt and a couple grinds of pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, turmeric and coriander and cook until the garlic is tender and the spices are lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes more. Stir in the reserved corn kernels and corn \u201cmilk\u201d and cook until warmed through. Stir in the broth, half-and-half and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, bring the mixture to a simmer and then remove from the heat.<br> Use an immersion blender to puree the corn mixture into a very smooth and creamy sauce. Alternatively, transfer to a blender and blend on high speed until very smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep the corn sauce warm in the saucepan over low heat.<br> When the water boils, salt it and cook the gnocchi according to the package directions. Drain well. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place half the gnocchi in the skillet and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula to flip the gnocchi and continue to cook until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi.<br> Just before serving, stir the basil, parsley, vinegar and remaining 1 tablespoon oil into the reserved corn and cl mixture until combined. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Spoon the corn sauce into 4 shallow dinner bowls and place the crispy gnocchi on top. Garnish with the corn and cl salad.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57681,&quot;Kabocha Squash and Shiitake Wontons with Pomegranate-Vinegar Syrup 1 medium kabocha squash 4 tablespoons butter, softened 1 tablespoon canola oil<br> 1 teaspoon minced garlic<br> 1 teaspoon minced ginger<br> 1 cup shiitake mushrooms, cut into fine dice<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 package thin square wonton wrappers<br> 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for the egg wash<br> Canola oil, for frying<br> 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds<br> 1/4 cup dark rum<br> Pomegranate-Vinegar Syrup, recipe follows, for serving 2 tablespoons chopped chives, for garnish<br> 16 ounces naturally brewed rice wine vinegar, such as Wan Ja Shan 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Slice the squash in half and place the halves face-up on a baking sheet. Bake until soft and fork-tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Scrape into a large bowl, add 2 tablespoons of the butter while still warm and mash with a fork until mostly smooth. (Alternatively, you can puree in a food processor.) Allow to cool. Meanwhile, in a small saute pan over medium heat, add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the garlic and ginger and cook 1 minute to soften. Add the shiitake mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a plate to cool completely. In the bowl containing the squash, fold in the cooled mushroom mixture and remaining 2 tablespoons butter and stir until well blended. Adjust the seasoning as necessary. Place 1 wonton wrapper on a work surface with 1 corner nearest you. Place 1 scant tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper, moisten the edges with the egg wash and fold the bottom half over the top to create a triangular dumpling. Bring the left and right sides under the dumpling, moisten the points with the egg wash and pinch together to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Fill a fryer or medium heavy pot one-third full with oil. Over high heat, bring the oil to 350 degrees F on a deep-frying thermometer. Add half the wontons and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove with a large mesh spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining wontons. Season with salt. Transfer to a platter. In a small skillet, warm the pomegranate seeds over high heat. Once the pan is hot and the seeds begin to sizzle, add the rum and light with a lighter to flambe. Let the alcohol flames burn off, then pour the seeds over the wontons. Drizzle with the Pomegranate-Vinegar Syrup, sprinkle with the chopped chives and serve. In a nonreactive saucepan on low heat, add the vinegar and pomegranate seeds. Bring to a simmer and reduce by three-quarters, about 20 minutes. Test the reduction by drizzling a little on a chilled plate; the syrup should hold a line when the plate is tilted. Transfer the syrup to a small glass jar and cover when cooled. Store in the refrigerator up to 4 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57682,&quot;Mini Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins Nonstick cooking spray 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 cup pure pumpkin puree 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted 1/3 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Make a marinade by combining red wine, vinegar, water, onions, peppercorns, juniper berries, bay leaves and cloves in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Let this marinade cool to room temperature. Place the beef in the now cooled marinade, cover, and refrigerate, overnight if possible, but for at least 2 hours. Remove the meat from the marinade and set aside on a utility platter. Strain the marinade into a pot, bring to a boil, and skim, then reduce to a simmer. Heat the oil in a large saute pan. Add the beef and sear it on all sides, then remove to a utility platter. Combine the carrots, onion, and celery in the same pan to make a mirepoix. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, deglaze pan with a small amount of the warmed marinade, then add the tomato paste and continue cooking for another 2 to 3 minutes. Add a bit more of the warmed marinade to the saute pan to de-glaze, and reduce heat to medium. Add the flour gradually until a paste is formed. Then, slowly add all of the warmed marinade to the mixture, similar to making a roux. If the sauce is too thick, which can sometimes happen due to density of flour, gradually add chicken or vegetable stock until you reach the consistency where it coats the back of a spoon. Return the meat to the pan, cover and simmer until fork-tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove meat and let rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing. Strain the sauce, place slices of meat on serving plate, spoon sauce around and garnish with steamed vegetables and dollops of sour cream. Serve with cooked egg noodles as an accompaniment. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57700,&quot;Salty Vanilla and Cinnamon Ice Cream 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Pinch of ground nutmeg 2 cups whole milk 6 large egg yolks 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 2 cups cold heavy cream 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt Waffle cones, for serving Chopped Marcona almonds, for garnish Coarse sea salt, for garnish Instructions: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the split vanilla bean, cinnamon and nutmeg. Bring the milk to just a simmer, cover and turn off the heat. Let the spices steep, about 15 minutes. In a large nonreactive bowl, add the egg yolks and both sugars. Whisk until the sugar is mostly dissolved into the egg yolks, about 2 minutes. Temper the eggs into the milk by adding 1 cup or so cooled milk to the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Continue slowly adding the milk to the egg mixture until both are combined. Transfer the milk mixture back to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture is thick enough to coat back of the spoon, 2 minutes or so. Remove the pan from the heat and add the heavy cream, vanilla extract and salt. Strain through a fine sieve into a cooled bowl. Stir the mixture occasionally until cooled completely. Stir the vanilla extract into the cooled custard. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturers&#39; instructions. Serve the ice cream in waffle cones and garnish with chopped Marcona almonds and coarse sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 57701,&quot;Heinz 57 Meatloaf 1/4 cup Heinz 57? 1/3 cup Lea &amp; Perrins?

Alternatively, wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel and press it under a heavy plate for 20 minutes to 1 hour. Combine the tofu, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, miso and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor. Process until the tofu is smooth but with a slightly crumbly texture. For the pi?on pasteln roll-ups: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease a 7-by-11-inch casserole dish with 2 tablespoons of the oil and set aside. Brush each plantain slice with the remaining oil and place side by side on a baking sheet. Bake until the bottoms of the plantains are caramelized and golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Flip the plantains with tongs and bake 5 more minutes, then remove from the oven and decrease the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Choose the 4 longest slices each of zucchini and yellow squash, place them on a wire rack and sprinkle with salt. This will release the excess moisture. Reserve the remaining slices for another use. For the sazn tempeh mushroom Bolognese: While the plantains bake, tie the thyme, sage and bay leaves in a bundle with kitchen twine or cheesecloth to create a bouquet garni. Set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the tempeh and cook, stirring occasionally and adding more oil if the skillet is dry, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until browned, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the carrots, onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the sazn, oregano and paprika. Stir to combine, add the wine, scraping the bottom of the skillet, and cook until almost reduced, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, then season with salt and pepper. Nestle the bouquet garni into the sauce and simmer until all of the flavors become incorporated, 7 to 10 minutes. Taste and add more salt and pepper, as needed. Remove and discard the bouquet garni. For assembling and serving: Cover the bottom of the prepared casserole dish with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the Bolognese. Stack 1 plantain slice on 1 zucchini slice. Scoop 2 tablespoons of the tofu ricotta, draining any excess liquid, onto the center of the stack. Roll up tightly and place in the casserole dish with the filling exposed on top. Repeat, alternating the squash and zucchini for stacking with the plantain, until the casserole dish is filled. (Fitting the roll-ups snugly in the dish should help them hold their shape; otherwise you can use toothpicks to secure them.) Top with another 2 cups of the Bolognese and sprinkle with the cheese. Reserve any remaining Bolognese for serving or for another use. Bake until the zucchini and squash are fork tender, about 25 minutes, rotating the dish halfway through. Sprinkle the cilantro on the roll-ups and serve with a spatula. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 57703,&quot;Fig and Fennel Caponata 3 tablespoons good olive oil 1 1/2 cups (1/2-inch-diced) red onion 2 cups (1/2-inch-diced) fennel (1 large) 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 1/3 cup good sherry vinegar 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes in puree, such as Redpack 8 dried Calimyrna figs, stems removed and 1/4-inch-diced 2 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar, lightly packed 2 tablespoons drained capers 1/2 cup green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped, such as Cerignola 1 teaspoon grated orange zest Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley Grilled bread for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a 10-inch saute pan.

Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or your hand for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth, and dough is elastic. The starter will be thick and stretchy. It will become more elastic after it has risen. Scrape the starter into a clear container with high sides, and cover with plastic wrap. Mark the height of the starter and the time on a piece of tape on the side of the container so you can see how much it rises. At this point, you have two options. If you plan on making the dough the same day, let the sponge rise at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to indent on top. This may take 6 to 8 hours. It will triple in volume, and very small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top of the surface as it reaches its peak and begins to deflate. Use it before it sinks too much. If you plan to make the dough the following day, let the sponge rise for 1 hour after mixing, then place it in the refrigerator and let it rise for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water in the dough. Let it sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature. This may take several hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57714,&quot;Chocolate Espresso Martini 1 lemon wedge 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar (raw sugar) 2 tablespoons finely chopped bittersweet chocolate 4 tablespoons espresso, cooled 1 1/2 ounces best vodka, chilled 1/2 ounce creme de cacao Long lemon twist Instructions: Wipe the rim of a chilled, oversized martini glass with lemon wedge.

Stir in 1 1/2 cups/375 ml water to blend. What you&#39;ll have is a wet, shaggy, sticky dough, but not so wet as to be batter. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let it rest in a warm place for at least 12 hours, and up to 24 hours. It&#39;s ready for the next step when the surface is dotted with bubbles. Flour a work surface and dump the dough out onto it. Sprinkle over a little more flour and fold it once or twice. Cover with the tea towel and let rest 15 minutes. Using only enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to your fingers, shape the dough into a ball. Coat a cotton towel with cornmeal, wheat bran or flour and lay the dough on it, seam-side down. Dust with more cornmeal, wheat bran or flour. (You need quite a lot because you want to be sure the dough doesn&#39;t stick to the towel). Cover and let rise for about 2 hours. When ready, the dough will be more than double in size. Half an hour before the dough is ready, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F/230 degrees C. Put a 2-liter cast-iron pot or Dutch oven (cocotte) inside to heat. When the dough is ready, remove the pot from the oven and turn the dough into it, seam-side up. (It will look messy, but this is OK.) Shake the pot to settle the bread evenly. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake until the loaf is nicely browned, another 15 to 30 minutes.

Taste--it should be salty, sweet and a bit tangy. Balance the seasoning if needed. Refrigerate. For the tuna: In a large bowl, mix together the tempura batter, cold seltzer and soy sauce. You want the batter to have a pancake-like consistency; you may not need all the seltzer. Set aside in the refrigerator. Slice the tuna against the grain into 3/4- to 1-inch-thick sticks. You should be able to make 4 to 5 sticks from each tuna steak. If using skewers (not needed), push one down the center of each. Dust each tuna stick all over with salt and pepper, then some flour. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, add enough oil to a pot to deep-fry the fish sticks and heat to 375 degrees F. When ready to fry, remove the batter from the refrigerator and the floured tuna from the freezer. Check all sides to make sure the flour is still dusty and not soaked in; sprinkle with flour again if needed, then dip into the batter and fry until golden, about 2 1/2 minutes.

Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars on high speed until light, approximately 5 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix well. Combine the buttermilk, sour cream, and coffee. On low speed, add the flour mixture and the buttermilk mixture alternately in thirds, beginning with the buttermilk mixture and ending with the flour mixture. Mix the batter only until blended. Divide the batter between the 3 pans and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake on the middle rack of the oven as follows: for the 4-inch pan 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean; for the 6-inch pan 70 to 75 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean; and for the 8-inch pan 85 to 90 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes each on a cooling rack, carefully remove from the pans and allow to finish cooling. Place the 8-inch cake on a serving plate, flat side up. Frost the top of that layer with buttercream. Place the 6-inch cake in the center of the top of the 8-inch cake, flat-side up, and frost the top and sides. Place the 4-inch cake in the center of the top of the 6-inch cake, flat side down. Frost the top and sides of that layer with buttercream. Spread any remaining buttercream over the cake evenly. Chop the chocolates and place them in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan simmering water. Stir until melted and set aside until cooled to room temperature. Mix the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Place the bowl of egg whites over the pan of simmering water and heat the egg whites until they are warm to the touch, about 5 minutes. Return the bowl to the electric mixer and whisk on high speed for 5 minutes, or until the meringue is cool and holds a stiff peak. Add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, while beating on medium speed. Scrape down the bowl, add the melted chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and rum, if using, and mix for 1 minute or until the chocolate is completely blended in. If the buttercream seems very soft, allow it to cool, and beat it again. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 57768,&quot;Hot and Sweet Orange Salad 3 cups baby arugula 4 navel oranges, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick 1 Fresno cl pepper, very thinly sliced with seeds<br> 1/2 small red onion, very thinly sliced 4 sprigs fresh tarragon, leaves stripped and coarsely chopped 3 tablespoons EVOO<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Put the arugula on a platter.

Add the onion and garlic and saute until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in the cl, breaking it into lumps. Gradually pour in 1 quart of water, stirring to combine. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it coats a spoon thickly. (The sauce can be made several days ahead, then cooled, covered, and refrigerated. Reheat before proceeding.) Separate the eggs, placing the whites in a nonplastic mixing bowl and the yolks in a separate medium bowl. Whisk the yolks lightly, just to combine, then add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat the egg whites with a mixer on high speed until they are stiff but not dry. Gently fold the yolk mixture into the egg whites. It&#39;s fine to have a few streaks remaining. Heat 1-inch of oil to 375 degrees F in a large skillet or Dutch oven. Drop a large spoonful of the batter gently into the oil. Within seconds it should puff up to be about double in size. Fry briefly until golden-brown and crisp, turning as needed to cook evenly. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain. Cut into the fritter to verify that is has cooked through but is still moist with a nearly melting center. Adjust the oil temperature a bit if necessary to get the desired result. Fry the remaining fritters a few at a time until all the batter is used. Spoon cl sauce on a platter and arrange the fritters over it. Serve immediately, passing any remaining sauce separately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 57770,&quot;Eggs Sardou 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar Sauteed Spinach, recipe follows Hollandaise Sauce, recipe follows 2 ounces prosciutto or Serrano ham, cut into thin chiffonade Essence, recipe follows, for garnish Chopped chives, garnish 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 4 whole artichoke hearts, boiled until tender, trimmed of choke, and leaves discarded or reserved for another use<br> 4 whole artichoke hearts, boiled until tender, trimmed of choke, and leaves discarded or reserved for another use Salt and pepper 4 large eggs 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Olive oil, for sauteing 1 pound fresh spinach, tough stems removed and washed well 1 teaspoon minced garlic Salt and freshly ground pepper 3 egg yolks 2 teaspoons water 1/2 cup clarified butter, or 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon salt Pinch cayenne Instructions: In a skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.

Into a large saute pan or deep skillet, pour about 2 inches of cold water and the vinegar. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce the heat so that the surface of the water barely shimmers. Break the eggs into individual saucers, then gently slide them 1 at a time into the water and with a large spoon, lift the whites over the yolks. Repeat the lifting once or twice to completely enclose each yolk. Poach until the whites are set and the yolks feel soft when gently touched, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon, and place on a large plate. Arrange the warm artichoke hearts on each of 4 plates and top with the spinach. Lay 1 egg on top of each bed of spinach and drizzle with warm Hollandaise sauce. Garnish with the chopped prosciutto, Essence, and chives and serve immediately. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch. Published by William and Morrow, 1993. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add spinach and garlic and saute, stirring, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste. Serve hot.

Rub hen inside and out with salt. Place the chicken in a pot that is just large enough to hold it and tall enough to completely cover it with water. Add cold water just to cover the chicken and stir briefly. Place in the refrigerator for 3 hours. Remove the bird and rinse for several minutes under cold running water to remove all salt inside and out. While the chicken is in the refrigerator, make a simple stock by simmering the neck, giblets (no liver), 1 onion quartered, 1 leaf end of celery, 2 sage leaves, 2 thyme sprigs, and 1 quart water in a large saucepan over low heat for 1 to 2 hours. Strain and save the stock. Pull the meat from neck and add to the stock. Cut up the giblets and add to the stock. Preheat the oven 475 degrees. Arrange a V-rack for holding the bird over a pan to catch juices. Pour 1 1/2 cups of the stock into the pan, reserve the rest. Place the remaining onion, leaf ends of celery, sage leaves, and thyme sprigs, plus the orange and bay leaf, in the chicken cavity. In a small bowl, stir together corn syrup and butter. Brush the chicken lightly with this mixture and place in a V-rack, breast side down. Roast 20 minutes, basting with drippings in pan every 7 minutes. Remove the chicken from oven and turn so that one leg and thigh are up. Baste with the butter mixture and return to the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven again, turn completely over so that the other leg is up, baste well with the butter mixture, and return to the oven for another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven again and turn the oven down to 325 degrees. Leave the oven door partially open so oven temperature will come down quickly. Turn the bird breast side up, brush well with butter mixture and return to the oven. Baste every 5 minutes. In 5 minutes, check breast meat temperature using an instant-read thermometer. The ideal temperature to remove it is 150 degrees to 154 degrees. If necessary, place back in oven an additional 5 to 10 minutes until it reaches this temperature. Breast meat temperature rises about 2 degrees every minute in the oven at this temperature. Add as much of the pan drippings to the remaining stock as you can without getting the sauce too salty. Stir cornstarch into 1/4 cup cold water and stir it into the stock-drippings mixture in a large saucepan. Heat over medium meat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Allow chicken to stand at least 15 minutes after removing from the oven. Carve or partially carve the chicken and arrange back in bird form on the serving platter. Pass hot gravy in a separate bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57779,&quot;Chocolate Strawberry Hearts 4 ounces semisweet or dark chocolate, chopped 1 tablespoon coconut oil<br> 8 ounces strawberries<br> Instructions: Put the chocolate and coconut oil in a glass bowl over a pot of simmering water to melt.

Butter two 8-inch square cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the parchment and dust with flour, tapping out excess. Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the melted butter, buttermilk, egg, vanilla and 1/2 cup water together in another bowl until smooth. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans, smoothing the tops. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through cooking, until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Discard the parchment paper and flip the cakes right side up again. Let the cakes cool completely. Make the coconut filling: Pulse the coconut in a food processor until finely chopped and transfer to a large bowl. Combine the gelatin with 2 tablespoons cold water in a small microwaveable bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Heat the gelatin in the microwave until it melts completely, about 10 seconds, stirring to dissolve. Add the gelatin mixture, cream cheese, sour cream, coconut milk, sugar, vanilla and coconut extracts and salt to a food processor and process until smooth, at least 1 minute. Scrape the mixture into the bowl containing the chopped coconut and mix until evenly combined. Let the mixture sit until it is just thick enough to spread, about 10 minutes. (Do not let the filling firm up too much.) Place one cake on a cake stand and pile the coconut filling in the center, spreading it in a thick layer almost to the edge. Top with the remaining cake, aligning the layers directly on top of each other so the cake does not lean. Refrigerate the assembled cake for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the chocolate ganache: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan then remove from the heat. Add the chocolate, shaking the pan gently to submerge it. Allow the pan to stand, off the heat, for 3 minutes to melt the chocolate. Whisk the ganache until smooth, then refrigerate until it is just thick enough to spread (like mayonnaise), about 15 minutes. (Do not let the ganache harden too much.) Stir the ganache again and scoop it on top of the cake, spreading it over the top and sides. Make a swirl pattern on the top with a spatula to resemble a coconut candy. Refrigerate the cake until the ganache is set, at least 1 hour or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Reds, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 57781,&quot;Serious Vanilla Ice Cream 2 cups half-and-half 1 cup whipping cream 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons peach preserves (not jelly) 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped Instructions: Combine all ingredients (including the bean and its pulp) in a large saucepan and place over medium heat.

Microwave for 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add about three-quarters of the sifted confectioners&#39; sugar into the marshmallow mixture and stir to combine. Once the mixture becomes too stiff to stir, grease your counter and hands with shortening (or wear greased plastic, disposable gloves) and dump the mixture onto the counter. Knead, adding the remaining quarter of confectioners&#39; sugar, a little at a time, until the fondant is very smooth, not sticky and holds its shape into a ball without relaxing. Use right away or grease it lightly with additional shortening, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and store in an airtight plastic bag or container at room temperature for up to several days.<br> Divide the fondant in half. Color one half dark black with food coloring (about 5 to 6 drops, rolling and kneading to evenly incorporate the color. Work in a little confectioners&#39; sugar if the moisture from the food coloring makes the fondant too soft. (Wear plastic, disposable gloves and wash your hands well after so as not to bleed colors.) Divide the white portion into 6 pieces and the black into 6 pieces.<br> For the panda head, eye whites and foot pads: Pull off an almond-size piece of white fondant from one of the pieces and set aside. Roll the larger piece into a head that is slightly triangular, but still rounded. Roll the smaller (almond-size) piece out with a greased rolling pin about 1/4-inch-thick. Use a 1/4-inch round pastry tip to cut out 2 eyeballs and 2 footpads. Press all 4 slightly to make slightly larger, but still round.<br> For the panda legs, ears, eyes and nose: Divide a black piece of fondant into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Form the larger piece into 2 stubby legs. Press together to join in a \v\ shape. Arrange the set legs on the parchment, \v\ point-up and attach the head onto the point. Use the 1/4-inch pastry tip to make toe indentations in the tip of each leg. Attach the white foot pads to the bottom of the feet, brushing with a little water if needed to adhere. Roll a tiny piece of the remaining black fondant to make a slightly flat, triangular shaped nose. Stick in the middle of the face, point side-down. Roll out the remaining black fondant with a greased rolling pin. Use a pastry tip with a 3/4-inch base to cut out 2 ears. Crease with the back of a paring knife. Brush the panda&#39;s head lightly with water where the ears go and attach the ears, pressing slightly. Use the 1/4-inch pastry tip to cut out 2 eyes. Flatten to make slightly oval and larger than the white eyeballs. Stick the black eye circles to the sides of the nose. Attached the white eyeballs inside the black. Roll 2 tiny black balls and stick inside of the white. Repeat with the remaining fondant to make 5 more pandas.<br> Let the pandas dry, uncovered, overnight.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57790,&quot;Granola Parfaits 2 1/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (not quick-cooking) 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 3/4 cup slivered almonds 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1/4 cup honey, plus more for drizzling 3/4 cup dried cranberries 3/4 cup golden raisins 1/3 cup shelled and salted sunflower seeds 2 cups low-fat plain Greek yogurt Fresh berries (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cut the salmon into paper-thin slices. Reserve. Roll or stretch the dough into 4 (8-inch) circles. Place the pizzas on a lightly floured wooden peel. Brush the center of each pizza to within 1 inch of the edge with olive oil and sprinkle it with some of the red onion. Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake 8 to 12 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven. Mix the dill with the sour cream or creme fraiche and freshly ground pepper to taste. Transfer the pizzas to heated dinner plates and spread them with the sour cream mixture. Divide the salmon, and arrange decoratively over the cream. Place a spoonful of golden caviar in the center of each pizza, then spoon a little of the black caviar into the center of the golden caviar. Pizza Dough: 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough.

Prepare and bake the brownies in the prepared pan according to the package directions for a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Let cool completely on a rack, about 1 hour.<br> Meanwhile, slice 5 to 6 strawberries into 1/8-inch-thick slices--you will need enough to fit around the edges of the pan; set aside. Leave the remaining strawberries whole. Beat the cream cheese, sugar and 3 1/2 cups of the heavy cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold in the sour cream and vanilla until smooth.<br> Bring the remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan, then whisk in the gelatin. Continue to whisk off heat until the gelatin is dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold the gelatin mixture into the cream cheese mixture until well combined.<br> Stand the sliced strawberries upside down around the perimeter of the pan with the flat/cut sides touching the side of the pan, cutting an extra strawberry or two if needed. Pour 3 cups of the cream cheese mixture on top of the brownies and use an offset spatula to spread and smooth it out. Press the remaining whole strawberries into the cream cheese upside down (pointed ends up); you should have about 8 rows of 5. Spread the remaining cream mixture on top of the strawberries and smooth out the top with an offset spatula.

You will not cook the pasta all the way as you will finish it in the pan with the sauce. Drop the pasta into the boiling water to start the cooking process. Meanwhile, in a saute pan heat some oil over high heat and add the pancetta. Saute until the pancetta is rendered (most of the fat melts away), and then turn the heat down to medium. Pancetta should look like crispy bacon. Add the onions and stir constantly making sure the onions do not burn. Once the onions are soft and cooked through, add the red sauce. Cook for 1 minute, and then add the cheese and pepper flakes, stirring to incorporate. Turn off the heat on the sauce and add the cooked pasta to the pan with the sauce. Turn the heat back on to low and toss the pasta constantly so that the sauce will stick to the pasta (the sauce should be thick and shouldn&#39;t create a pool on the plate).

Stir together the warm water, warm milk and sugar in a medium bowl or 4-cup liquid measuring cup until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the yeast and let stand until the mixture is foamy and the yeast is dissolved, about 5 minutes.<br> Whisk together the flour and salt in the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. With the mixer on medium-low speed, slowly add the yeast mixture and beat until fully incorporated. The dough will be shaggy. Add the butter and increase the mixer speed to medium high. Beat until the dough is smooth, elastic and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 15 minutes. (The dough will become wet and sticky and then come back together as gluten forms.) Turn the dough out from the bowl and gently shape into a ball. Place inside the prepared bowl and turn to coat in the cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours (see Cook&#39;s Note). Lightly spray a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment, leaving a 3-inch overhang on each of the longer sides.<br> Once the dough has doubled in size, remove the plastic wrap and save for the next rise. Lightly flour the work surface and punch the dough down. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out into an approximately 8-by-14-inch rectangle, with a shorter side facing you. Starting at this end, roll the dough away from you into a tight log, then pinch the seam and ends to seal. Place into the prepared loaf pan seam-side down, then tuck the ends of the dough under and gently press the top of the loaf with the palm of your hand to make the top even. Loosely cover with the reserved plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until puffy and domed about 1 inch above the rim of the pan, 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br> At this point, the loaf can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours covered tightly with plastic wrap; before proceeding, loosen the wrap and let rise at room temperature until an indentation made with your finger remains in the dough.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Use a pastry brush to gently coat the top of the dough with the remaining 1 teaspoon milk. If there are any large bubbles on the surface of the dough, carefully prick to deflate them before baking. Bake, rotating halfway through, until golden brown and the interior of the loaf registers 210 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 50 minutes. Allow the loaf to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan using the parchment overhang. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.<br> For the cinnamon-raisin loaf: Make the basic loaf dough as instructed above, beating in the raisins with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until evenly distributed before removing the dough from the bowl.<br> After the dough has risen for the first time, mix the sugar, cinnamon and 2 tablespoons milk in a small bowl until combined.<br> Once the dough has been rolled out to a rectangle, use a small offset or rubber spatula to spread the cinnamon-sugar filling all over the surface of the dough, making sure to go all the way to the edges. Roll into a tight log and proceed with the recipe.<br> For the ham and Havarti pull-apart loaf: Make the basic loaf dough as instructed above and form into a ball.<br> After the dough has risen for the first time, mix together the butter, scallions, Dijon and garlic in a small bowl until combined.<br> Once the dough has been rolled out to a rectangle, use a small offset or rubber spatula to spread the butter mixture all over the surface of the dough, making sure to go all the way to the edges. Top with the Havarti, overlapping slightly to cover completely. Layer the ham evenly on top of the cheese.<br> Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the dough lengthwise into 3 strips, each about 4 inches wide. Cut each strip into four 4-inch squares. Stack the squares on top of each other, flipping the final square dough-side out. This will ensure the cheese melts on the inside of the loaf. Carefully place the stacked dough on its side into the prepared pan so the squares are shingled inside. Loosely cover with the reserved plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes while the oven preheats to 350 degrees F.<br> Gently brush the top of the loaf with the milk.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Mix the blueberries, the 1/2 cup of sugar, the flour, lemon zest, lemon juice, and cassis in a large bowl. Carefully ease one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate, making sure not to stretch the dough at all, or it will shrink as the pie bakes. With a sharp knife, cut the excess dough off at the edge of the pie plate. Spoon the blueberry mixture into the pie shell, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula to be sure you have all the juices. Brush the edge of the crust with the egg wash. Carefully lay the second crust on top, again easing -- not stretching -- it onto the pie. Cut the excess dough off at the edge of the pie plate. Press the two edges together with a dinner fork. Brush the top crust with the eggs wash, cut three slits for steam to escape, and sprinkle with sugar. Place the pie on the prepared sheet pan and bake in the middle of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes, until the filling is very bubbly and the crust is nicely browned. Allow to cool and serve warm or at room temperature. Cut the butter in 1/2-inch dice and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out onto a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle at least 1 inch larger than the pie pan, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough so it doesnt stick to the board. (You should see bits of butter in the dough.) Fold the dough in half, ease it into the pie pan without stretching at all, and unfold to fit the pan. With a small sharp paring knife, cut the dough 1 inch larger around than the pan. Fold the edge under and crimp the edge with either your fingers or the tines of a fork. \Barefoot Contessa Foolproof\ by Ina Garten (c) Clarkson Potter 2012. Provided courtesy of Ina Garten.

Place a large overlapping piece of aluminum foil over the bottom of the springform pan, and then insert pan ring over it. Fold the foil extra foil up and around the pan and place the whole thing on a second piece of foil, also folding it and pressing it securely around the pan, having a water tight covering. In a food processor, process cookies until they are crumb-like, add melted butter and continue to process. Pour crumb mixture into springform pan and press with your fingers to line the pan. Place the pan in the refrigerator to set while you prepare the cheesecake. Place a kettle of water on for water bath. In a food processor beat the cream cheese until smooth, add the sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and lime juice. Take crumbed pan from the refrigerator and place it in a roasting pan. Pour the cheesecake mixture into the crumb pan, and then carefully pour the hot kettle of water into the roasting pan so the water reaches 1/2 way up the pan so the water does not splash into cheese cake. Place roasting pan in oven for 1 hour, checking after 50 minutes. It should feel set, but still wobbly in the center. Take the roasting pan out of the oven, carefully remove the springform pan from the roasting pan and place it on a rack. Peel off the outer layer of foil, and tear away the side bits of the first layer of foil and leave the pan to cool. Once the cake comes to room temperature, place it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes before serving. Transfer to the plate you&#39;re going to serve it on, a plate without a lip, or a cake stand. Unclip the springform pan and remove the outer part. Carfully lift the cheesecake removing the metal bottom. The aluminum foil can stay on the cake.

Place the white chocolate pieces in a small bowl and pour the hot milk over. Whisk until the chocolate is completely melted. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk the sugar into the mascarpone. Set aside. In a small, chilled bowl, whip the cream with the vanilla until soft peaks form (do not overbeat.) Whisk the white chocolate mixture into the mascarpone. Fold in the whipped cream. The texture should be like lightly whipped cream; if it doesn&#39;t \flow, thin the mixture slightly by stirring in some milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. Spoon the liqueur evenly over the cake slices. Place 1 slice of cake in the bottom of each goblet. Spoon half of the cream mixture over the cake slices (about 2 1/2 tablespoons for each slice.) Sprinkle each with 1/2 tablespoon of the grated chocolate. Slice 8 strawberries and place some slices over the chocolate in each goblet. Repeat the cake, cream and chocolate layers. Refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours. To make the chocolate leaves: line a plate with waxed paper. In a double boiler over low heat, melt the grated semisweet chocolate. Remove the chocolate from the heat. Using a pastry brush, spread the underside of each leaf with a layer of chocolate. Place the painted leaves, chocolate side up, on the prepared plate. Freeze until the chocolate is set. Carefully peel the leaf off the chocolate, handling the chocolate leaf as little as possible. Return the leaves to the freezer if the chocolate is melting. Just before serving, top each tiramisu with raspberries and garnish each with a strawberry half and chocolate leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 57852,&quot;Easter Egg Nest Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the bowl One 15.25-ounce box carrot cake mix<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1/3 cup canola oil<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the bowl 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> One 12-ounce bag marshmallows<br> 3/4 cup white chocolate chips or melts<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 3 drops brown gel food coloring<br> 2 drops yellow gel food coloring<br> 6 cups fried chow mein noodles (about two 6-ounce bags)<br> One 10-ounce bag white chocolate chips or melts Blue gel food coloring<br> Green gel food coloring<br> 10 filled chocolate eggs with a firm filling, such as peanut butter-filled or chocolate sandwich cookie-filled Two 16-ounce cans cream cheese frosting 2 cups shredded coconut, toasted<br> Fresh mint sprigs<br> Edible flowers<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a large metal mixing bowl (about 10 1/2 inches in diameter) with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Combine the cake mix, eggs, oil and 1/2 cup water in a large bowl. (The water and oil is less than what the box instructions call for.) Mix with an electric mixer on medium speed until fully combined, about 2 minutes. Pour the batter into the prepared bowl and bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes in the bowl, then remove from the bowl and let cool completely on a cooling rack, about 2 hours. For the nest: Meanwhile, spray the same bowl you used to bake the cake in with nonstick cooking spray. Melt the butter and marshmallows together in a large pot over low heat, stirring frequently. Add the white chocolate and cinnamon and stir until fully combined. Add the brown and yellow food coloring and mix until blended. Add the chow mein noodles and mix until all the noodles are coated with the marshmallow mixture. Transfer the mixture to the prepared bowl and quickly press into the bowl to form a nest shape. If your hands start to stick, spray them with cooking spray (Caution: the mixture is hot, but you have to work quickly or it will harden; you can wear gloves for this step if necessary). Let cool about 2 hours. Remove the nest from the bowl and line the bowl with plastic wrap, letting some plastic wrap hang over the edge of the bowl. Place the nest back in the bowl, over the plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use. For the eggs: Place the white chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until melted, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (Do not overheat.) Divide the melted chocolate into 2 bowls. Whisk 6 drops blue food coloring and 5 drops green food coloring into one bowl until a robin&#39;s egg blue color is created. Gently push the pointed end of a skewer into the bottom of each chocolate egg, slightly off-center (do not hit the seam of the egg, or the egg will split along the seam). Gently dip the egg into the blue chocolate and turn until the egg is evenly coated. Lift the egg out of the blue chocolate and hold above the bowl to allow excess to drip off. Push the flat end of the skewer into a foam block or container of sugar or salt to allow the egg to dry undisturbed. Repeat this process to dip 4 more eggs into the blue chocolate. Dip the remaining 5 eggs in the white chocolate in the same manner. (If at any point the melted chocolate becomes too thick, microwave for 30 seconds more to loosen.) Set the eggs aside to harden for 1 hour. Remove the eggs from the skewers and place on a paper towel-lined tray. Combine 4 drops green food coloring and 4 drops blue coloring with 1 tablespoon water in a small spray bottle. Lightly spritz the green mixture onto the eggs in a speckled pattern. Allow the eggs to dry again for 1 hour. For decorating: Spread 1 can of the cream cheese frosting into the nest, leaving the outer border unfrosted. Slice 1 1/2 to 2 inches off of the flat side of the cake so that it will fit well inside the nest. Using a spoon, remove some cake to hollow out a depression in the top (the flat side) of the cake, leaving a 2-inch border intact along the outer edge of the cake. Place the cake hollowed-side up into the frosted nest. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large tip with the remaining cream cheese frosting and frost the top of the cake; spread evenly using an offset spatula or a spoon. Sprinkle the toasted coconut over the top of the cake, making sure to coat completely. If not using immediately, refrigerate. (Let the refrigerated cake come to room temperature for 1 hour before serving.) Using the excess plastic wrap, pull the nest cake out of the bowl and place on a cake stand or platter. Arrange the eggs in the nest, then decorate with mint sprigs and edible flowers, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57853,&quot;IPA Mac and Cheese 3 cups heavy cream<br> 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 2 fresh bay leaves<br> 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar Hot sauce, such as Tapatio<br> Cracked black pepper<br> 3 cups elbow macaroni, cooked<br> 1 cup peas, cooked<br> 1/4 cup shredded braised ham hock 1/4 cup West-Coast style IPA<br> Salt 1 tablespoon chopped bacon 1/4 cup breadcrumbs<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Heat a small skillet over medium heat, add the pancetta or bacon, cook until the fat renders but is short of being crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions; form each into a ball. Roll a portion into a 12-inch disk on a floured surface (cover the other piece with a kitchen towel). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour and put the dough on the peel, drizzle lightly with oil and sprinkle with salt. Slip the dough onto the preheated stone and cook until just set, about 4 minutes. Using the peel, remove the dough from the oven and top with about half the sauce and toppings - pancetta, mozzarella, onion and garlic. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Return the pizza to the stone and cook until the crust is golden and the cheese melts, about 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove the pizza, top with half the grated Parmesan and scatter with some basil leaves and pepper flakes, if desired. Serve. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings. Whisk water and sugar in a bowl and scatter the yeast over the top. Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in olive oil. Whisk the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Gradually stir the dry ingredients into the liquid to make a rough, shaggy dough. Turn out onto a lightly-floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. If the dough seems wet, add just enough flour to prevent sticking. Brush a large bowl with olive oil.

Line a 9-by-13-inch broiler-proof baking dish with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on both sides. Butter the foil. Pulse 14 of the graham crackers into fine crumbs in a food processor. Combine the melted butter and graham cracker crumbs in a medium bowl with your hands (the mixture should hold together when squeezed). Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and press it into the bottom in an even layer, using the bottom of a measuring cup to help. Pour the sweetened condensed milk over the crumbs. Then sprinkle the chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and peanuts over the condensed milk. Break the remaining 4 graham crackers into chunks and sprinkle evenly over the top. Bake until the sides are golden brown and begin to pull away from the baking dish, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven, and turn the broiler on. Scatter the marshmallows over the top of the bars and put the dish under the broiler until the marshmallows are dark golden and toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool completely then refrigerate to set, about 1 hour. Using the foil liner as handles, pull the bars out of the baking dish; remove the foil.

Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high at 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until the chocolate is almost melted; remove and stir until smooth. Dip the strawberries in the melted chocolate; return to the parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until the chocolate hardens, about 15 minutes. Heat 4 to 6 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 330 degrees. While the oil heats, prepare the pancake and waffle mix as the label directs. Dip the chocolate-covered strawberries in the batter, turning to coat; let any excess drip off. (If the batter is too thin, add 1 to 3 more tablespoons dry mix.) Carefully place the berries in the hot oil (skewers and all); fry, turning as needed, until the batter is golden and just cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Remove with tongs and drain on paper towels or a rack. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the chocolate to re-harden. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Brachetto, Cava]&quot; 57922,&quot;Coconut Biscotti 1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut flakes 1 cup granulated sugar 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup coconut oil 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup salted macadamia nuts, chopped 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons coconut cream 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon coconut extract Coarse sugar, for decorating Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Spread 1 cup coconut flakes on a baking sheet and bake until toasted, about 3 minutes. Let cool completely. Transfer to a food processor; add the granulated sugar and pulse until finely ground. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the coconut-sugar mixture, the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Melt the coconut oil in the microwave; add to the flour mixture along with the vanilla and 1/3 cup water and mix with a wooden spoon until a stiff dough forms. Stir in the macadamia nuts and the remaining 1/2 cup coconut flakes; gently knead until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half and shape into two 9-by-2-inch logs; place 1 log on each baking sheet. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the logs are firm and golden, about 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Let the logs cool 10 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board; slice diagonally with a serrated knife into 3/4-inch-thick pieces. Arrange the slices cut-side down on the baking sheets. Bake, flipping halfway through, until just golden and the centers still have a little give, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. (The biscotti will crisp as they cool.) Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, coconut cream and coconut extract until smooth. Dip the biscotti in the glaze; sprinkle with coarse sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 57923,&quot;Fleur de Sel Caramels Vegetable oil 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/4 cup light corn syrup 1 cup heavy cream 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon fine fleur de sel, plus extra for sprinkling 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Prep the pan. Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with parchment paper, allowing it to drape over 2 sides, then brush the paper lightly with oil. Boil the sugar. In a deep saucepan (6 inches wide and 4 1/2 inches deep), combine 1/4 cup water, the sugar and corn syrup and bring them to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil until the mixture is a warm golden brown. Don&#39;t stir -- just swirl the pan. Heat the cream. In the meantime, in a small pot, bring the cream, butter and 1 teaspoon of fleur de sel to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off the heat and set aside. Finish the caramel. When the sugar mixture is done, turn off the heat and slowly add the cream mixture to the sugar mixture. Be careful -- it will bubble up violently. Stir in the vanilla with a wooden spoon and cook over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, until the mixture reaches 248 degrees F (firm ball) on a candy thermometer. Fill the pan. Very carefully (it&#39;s hot!) pour the caramel into the prepared pan and refrigerate for a few hours, until firm. Cut the caramel. When the caramel is cold, pry the sheet from the pan onto a cutting board. Cut the square in half. Roll it up. Starting with a long side, roll the caramel up tightly into an 8-inch-long log. Cut into pieces. Sprinkle the log with fleur de sel, trim the ends and cut into 8 pieces. (Start by cutting the log in half, then continue cutting each piece in half until you have 8 equal pieces.) It&#39;s easier to cut the caramels if you brush the knife with flavorless oil like corn oil. Wrap the candies. Cut glassine or parchment paper into 4-by-5-inch pieces and wrap each caramel individually, twisting the ends. Store in the refrigerator and serve the caramels chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 57924,&quot;Dairy-Free Hot Chocolate Mix 2 cups coconut milk powder (see Cook\u2019s Note) 2 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar (see Cook\u2019s Note) 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt Instructions: Whisk the coconut milk powder, confectioners\u2019 sugar, cocoa and salt together in a large bowl until fully combined.

Add the shortening in spoonfuls, then the butter, and pulse 12 to 15 times to combine. Add the ice water through the top and blend until the dough forms a loose ball, 15 to 30 seconds. Transfer the dough to a sheet of parchment or plastic wrap and sandwich it with another piece on top. Flatten the dough to a 6-inch disc and refrigerate for 20 minutes and up to 8 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a sheet tray with parchment paper. On a flat surface, spread a thin layer of flour and roll the dough out to about 1/8 inch thick. Use a knife to cut the dough into rectangles about 1 inch long and 3/4 inch wide. Ideally, you want between 25 and 30 rectangles (you can also cut small rounds, squares or any other shape). Transfer the dough pieces to the lined sheet tray. Brush the dough with the egg wash and par-bake the dough until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. For the filling: In a 10-inch heavy-bottomed saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, remove the pan from the heat and add half the strawberries. Return the pan to the heat and cook over high heat to allow some of the water to escape, for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the berries to a large bowl and return the pan to the heat. Heat the remaining tablespoon olive oil and add the rest of the strawberries. Cook in the same manner for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the other cooked strawberries. In the pan, whisk together the jam, sugar, honey and molasses and simmer over medium-high heat so all the ingredients meld together, 2 to 3 minutes. Squeeze the lemon juice into a small bowl and add the zest, then whisk in the cornstarch until smooth. Stir the slurry into the jam mixture and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently, stirring frequently, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour over the berries in the bowl and stir to coat. Transfer the berry mixture back to the pan. Arrange the pie dough rectangles directly on top of the filling in a circular pattern, each overlapping slightly, like shingles on a house. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake until the pie crust shingles are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. (If the pie shingles sink slightly, that&#39;s OK.) Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with sugar if desired and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57947,&quot;Sweet Potato Cupcake with Brown Sugar Glazed Chicken Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying liners 1 2/3 cups cake flour<br> 3 teaspoons cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> Salt<br> 4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 3/4 cup canned sweet potatoes, mashed (reserve 1 cup of the liquid)<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 eggs<br> 1/3 cup buttermilk<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 1 boneless skinless chicken breast<br> 2 cups dark brown sugar<br> 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 20 ounces confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Pinch salt<br> Instructions: For the cupcake batter and brown sugar glazed chicken: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line cupcake pans with cupcake liners (for a total of 24 cupcakes); lightly spray the liners with cooking spray. In a medium mixing bowl, sift together the cake flour, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, the baking powder, baking soda and a pinch salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar. Add the sweet potatoes and beat until smooth. Mix the vanilla extract and eggs into the sweet potato mixture, scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add the dry ingredients and buttermilk to the sweet potato mixture in three parts, alternating between the dry and wet ingredients. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat for 30 seconds between each addition. Scoop one scoop of the batter into each cupcake liner. Bake until the cupcakes bounce back from gentle pressure, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the pans and cool. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook until golden brown and caramelized, about 4 minutes, and then flip over to cook the other side. Continue cooking to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Set aside to cool slightly.<br> In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the reserved sweet potato liquid, brown sugar, the remaining 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Simmer until the mixture has the consistency of maple syrup, about 5 minutes. Finely dice the cooked chicken breast and place in a medium mixing bowl. Pour the syrup over the chicken and toss to coat. For the buttercream frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth and free of lumps. Slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar and cinnamon while mixing on the lowest speed. Add the vanilla and salt. Mix on medium speed until combined and smooth. To assemble: Using a pastry bag fitted with an open tip, ice the cooled cupcakes with two rings of buttercream to form a well. Fill the well with glazed chicken and some of the syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57948,&quot;Carbonara-ish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound dried penne pasta 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 pound bacon, pancetta or guanciale, small dice (about 1 cup) 4 large eggs 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Add the pasta and occasionally give it a stir so it doesn&#39;t stick together. Cook the pasta for 2 minutes less than the package directions. While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium high-heat. Add the cured meat and cook until it begins to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. When the meat is almost completely crispy, carefully add 1/2 cup of the pasta water and, using a wooden spoon, scrape all of the tasty bits off the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat. (If you would like to add a mix-in like peas or asparagus, add it here.) Whisk together the eggs in a small bowl until they are smooth. Add the Parmesan, parsley, the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil, lots of pepper and a pinch of salt. Add the egg mixture to the meat, stirring vigorously to incorporate without scrambling the eggs. Remove the pasta from the water and toss it with the sauce, making sure to coat the noodles well. Add more Parmesan if desired, stirring the pasta vigorously. If the pasta begins to seize up, add another splash of pasta water to loosen it. Divide the pasta into 4 bowls, topping each one with additional Parmesan and cracked black pepper.

Prepare a baking sheet fitted with kitchen towels and a slotted spoon to remove and place the doughnuts as they emerge from the hot oil. Mix the dry ingredients: in a large bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg. With your hand, make a hole in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the yeast in the center. Make the dough: Place the sour cream in a heatproof bowl and warm gently over a pot of simmering water, like a makeshift double boiler, 2-3 minutes. When warmed, remove the bowl from the heat. Pour the sour cream directly over the yeast and allow the sour cream and yeast to sit 2-3 minutes. Gently mix with a rubber spatula then add your eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla. Gently stir until combined. Cut the doughnuts: Sift a generous layer of flour onto 2 baking sheets. Flour a clean flat surface and turn the dough out. It will be sticky. Sift more flour on top of the dough, flour your hands and pat the dough until about 3/4 inch thick. Dip the cutter in flour so it won&#39;t stick. Cut a round and gently transfer to the floured baking sheets. Flour the cutter between each doughnut. Cut the rounds close together to avoid making too many scraps. Gather the scraps and roll into a ball. Finish: Dip the smaller cutter in flour and cut a round out of the center of each doughnut to make the \hole. Save the small dough holes. Let the doughnuts rest 8-10 minutes. Heat the oil: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the canola oil over medium low heat. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature until the oil reaches 350F. Fry and eat: Use a slotted spoon to submerge 5 doughnuts in a single layer in the hot oil. Fry until the bottoms are browned, 3-4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to carefully turn each doughnut on their second side and fry an additional 3-4 minutes until browned. Remove and drain on the sheet fitted with kitchen towels. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts. Take care to allow the oil to reheat between batches. Flatten and cut the scraps for a few additional doughnuts. Fry the doughnuts holes as well. Cool for at least 15 minutes then toss in the powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57972,&quot;Bagna Cauda Olive oil 8 cloves garlic, minced 6 anchovies, optional Large pinch chili flakes Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon minced parsley leaves Instructions: In a hot pan, pour a good amount of olive oil in. When the oil starts to warm up, add garlic and turn the flame down. Add the anchovies, if using (don&#39;t worry about mincing them as they will dissolve in the mixture). The anchovies should cook in the garlic oil until the garlic becomes brown and the anchovies dissolve. When the garlic gets light brown, about 5 minutes, add chili flakes until they toast up and then turn flame off. Add more olive oil and salt and pepper for flavor. Right before you heat the sauce in your fondue pot, add some minced parsley to cook in the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 57973,&quot;Carrot Bread 2 cups flour 1 1/2 cup of carrots, shredded 1 table spoon baking soda 1 cup vegetable oil 1 table spoon baking soda powder 1 table spoon vanilla 1 table spoon salt 3/4 cup crushed pineapple, from a can 2 eggs 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped 1 cup of sugar 1 table spoon cinnamon Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Remove from heat and let peppers steep in oil at least 1 hour. In a small bowl add the warm (this activates the yeast. If the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate) tap water add the dry yeast and the sugar and stir to combine. Let sit for 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty, this is what you want. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and the salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water mix. Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth clean work surface and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency. Return the dough to the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for at least 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.

Lay the racks of pork on a cutting board with the ribs curving upward. Cut 1/2-inch deep slits in the meat between each rib bone. Stand the racks up back to back, fat sides touching, with the meaty-sides down and the concave curve of the ribs facing upward. Thread a trussing needle with kitchen string and use it to pierce between the upper third of the two last rib bone ends and tie them together; repeat in the lower third of the last two rib bone ends to tie them together. Repeat on the other end of the racks. Shape the tied meat into an oval, bending where the slits are, to make a crown. Tie a string around the entire meaty bottom of the pork below the other two ties, securing the racks together so they hold their shape. Transfer the pork to a roasting pan or low-sided braiser. Rub the pork with the olive oil and season with the rosemary, salt and pepper. Fill the center of the roast with Chestnut and Sausage Stuffing, then transfer to the oven. Roast the pork until the internal temperature in the thickest part of the meat reads 140 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour 45 minutes,. Transfer to a cutting board or serving platter and let rest for 20 minutes. Pull out all the string ties, then carve into chops and serve with the stuffing. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the bread pieces in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast until lightly golden and dry, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.

Butter and flour a 12-cup bundt pan. Sift the flour and salt into a medium bowl. Whisk together the milk, vanilla, whole eggs and yolk in a second medium bowl until combined. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. With the mixer running, pour in the sugar 1/4 cup at a time; beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Turn the mixer off and scrape the sides of the bowl to insure the ingredients are incorporated. Turn the mixer to low, add the flour mixture 1/4 cup at a time and beat for about 30 seconds. Add the egg mixture gradually and beat until the batter is combined, about 3 minutes. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth over the top with a spatula. Put the pan in the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 1 hour. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack, 10 to 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, open 6 small resealable plastic bags. To the first bag, add 3/4 cup of the coconut and 10 drops red food coloring. To the second bag, add 3/4 cup coconut, 5 drops red food coloring and 5 drops yellow food coloring to make orange. To the third bag, add 3/4 cup coconut and 10 drops yellow food coloring. To the fourth bag, add 1/4 cup coconut and 5 drops green food coloring. To the fifth bag, add 1/4 cup coconut and 5 drops blue food coloring. To the sixth bag, add 1/4 cup coconut, 3 drops red food coloring and 2 drops blue food coloring to make purple. Seal all the bags, pressing out as much air as possible. Press and shake the sealed bags until all the coconut is coated in food coloring. Add more food coloring if you desire a richer color. Empty the bags into stripes on a baking sheet. Let stand, uncovered, for 1 hour to dry out slightly. If not using the coconut immediately, store in an airtight container until ready to use. Turn the cake over with the flat side facing up and trim it with a serrated knife to make level. Set the cake trimmed-side down on a work surface. Cut the cake in half from top to bottom so you have 2 semi-circles. Stand up the cake pieces like 2 arches and push them together back-to-back to make 1 arch. Trim as needed so they line up evenly and can stand on their own. Lay the cake pieces back down on their flat sides. Using a butter knife or offset spatula, cover the cake pieces with frosting on all sides except the bottoms. Press a stripe of purple coconut into the frosting on the inside curve of one of the cake semi-circles. Add a 1-inch stripe of blue coconut next to the purple stripe. Continue with the green, yellow and orange coconut, leaving an empty space on the outer edge of the semi-circle where the red coconut will go. Repeat with the other cake piece and colored coconut. Carefully stand up both cake pieces again. Spread the flat, cut side of one of the cake pieces with frosting and carefully push it together with the cut side of the second cake piece. Spread the remaining frosting over the seam where the pieces come together. Press a stripe of red coconut over the frosted seam, completing the rainbow. Using a metal spatula and your hands, carefully transfer the cake to a serving platter. Using scissors or kitchen shears, cut each marshmallow in half along the equator. Adhere the sticky cut sides to the platter and other marshmallows to build clouds on the sides of the cake. When ready to serve, separate the halves again and slice each half into wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 58010,&quot;Roasted Zucchini and Cippolini Onion with Hazelnut Romesco Sauce 2 pounds cippolini onions, peeled 3 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 4 medium zucchini, cut on the bias into 1/4-inch slices 3 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper Romesco Sauce, recipe follows Chopped parsley Spanish Antipasto, recipe follows Spanish Cheese Platter, recipe follows 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup peeled garlic cloves 1 red bell pepper, roasted, peeled, seeded 2 plum tomatoes 2 ancho chilies, soaked in boiling water until soft, seeded 1 slice white bread, crust removed cut into small cubes 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1/4 cup red wine 1/4 cup shelled hazelnuts 1 tablespoon honey Salt and freshly ground pepper Piquillo peppers, sliced Assorted Spanish olives Serrano ham, cut into chunks Farmer&#39;s cheese, cut into bite-sized pieces Extra-virgin Spanish olive oil Bread 1/2 pound wedges of assorted Spanish cheese.

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350 degrees F. Bring the quinoa, chicken stock and 2 teaspoons of the salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, stir, cover and cook for 15 minutes. When 5 minutes remain, add the broccoli right on top of the quinoa and replace the lid. Heat a large, straight-sided saute pan over high heat and add the mushrooms and 1/3 cup of water. Cook until the mushrooms collapse, 2 to 3 minutes, then add 2 tablespoons of the butter and cook until browned. Remove to a large bowl. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan along with the onions and the remaining teaspoon of salt. Reduce the heat to low and sweat the onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Then stir in the mustard, smoked paprika, black pepper, cayenne and white pepper and cook for 1 minute more. Add the half-and-half to the pan and heat until warm. Whisk the egg in a medium bowl and temper with 1 cup of the hot liquid, continuing to whisk to prevent curdling. Then whisk the egg mixture back into the saute pan and add the cheese, stirring until melted. Add the quinoa, broccoli, mayonnaise and the melted cheese mixture to the bowl with the mushrooms and stir to combine. Pour the quinoa mixture into an ungreased 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish (see Cook&#39;s Note). Bake until set and just beginning to brown, about 45 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 205 to 210 degrees F. Cool 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 58020,&quot;Homemade Paneer 1 liter whole milk 1/4 cup white vinegar Instructions: Pour the milk into a medium pot. Place on medium-high heat and, when it comes to a boil, turn the heat off and add the vinegar. Stir as the milk starts to curdle. Line a large sieve with cheesecloth and, holding it over the sink, pour the milk curds into it, letting the whey drain into the sink. Place the sieve over a bowl and fold the ends of the cheesecloth over the cheese. Set weights on top to press out excess liquid and refrigerate for several hours or overnight, until it&#39;s solid. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58021,&quot;Baby Ruth Candy Bar 1/4 cup whole milk 5 unwrapped caramels 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 teaspoon butter 1/4 teaspoon vanilla 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar 20 unwrapped caramels 1 1/2 teaspoons water 2 cups dry roasted peanuts 1 (12-ounce) bag milk chocolate chips Instructions: Combine all the ingredients for the centers, except for the powdered sugar, in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often as the caramel slowly melts. When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and stir. Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take 1 to 2 minutes. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don&#39;t let it sit too long-- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it. Take a teaspoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll with the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long. Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on waxed paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center rolls sit out for 1 to 2 hours to firm up. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and working quickly, \paint: a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn the center over, caramel side down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto waxed paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients. Place the bars into your refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours so that they firm up. Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the microwave for 2 minutes on 50 percent power. Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds. Don&#39;t over-cook the chips or the chocolate will burn and seize up on you. Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate. Cover the candy bar with chocolate using 2 forks, 1 in each hand. When the candy is covered with chocolate, balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off. Carefully place the candy bar onto waxed paper and remove the 2 forks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, and then chill the candy bars until firm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58022,&quot;Ricotta, Ham and Scallion Tart 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 13.8-ounce tube refrigerated pizza crust dough 1/2 cup ricotta cheese 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 large egg 2 to 3 bunches scallions 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or tarragon Freshly ground pepper 5 ounces deli-sliced ham, cut into 1/2-inch pieces Instructions: Place a baking sheet on the top rack of the oven; preheat to 425 degrees.

Whisk the ricotta, cream and egg in a medium bowl. Mince enough green scallion tops to make 2 tablespoons; add to the ricotta mixture along with the parsley and dill. Season with pepper. Slice the remaining scallions into 1/2- to 1/4-inch pieces. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over high heat. Add the sliced scallions and 2 tablespoons water; cook until the scallions are tender and start to sizzle, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the ham. Spread all but a few tablespoons of the scallion mixture on the prepared crust. Pour in the ricotta mixture, then scatter the remaining scallion mixture on top. Bake the tart on the preheated baking sheet for 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the filling is set. Rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove and slice.

(This sauce can be used in numerous dishes to add a complex sweet and spicy, full-bodied flavor.) For the larb: Lightly brown the chicken in a well-oiled heated pan with yellow onions, stirring, about 4 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Add 3/4 cup of the magic green cl sauce. Add ginger, red onion, Thai chiles, roasted red cl garlic paste, sriracha and lemongrass. Return this mixture of ground chicken and seasonings to heat for 1 minute so all the great flavors are melded together but the freshness of the ingredients is not lost. Cook longer if there is excessive moisture in your mix. Remove from heat. Tear 1 sprig mint into fine pieces and mix into the cooked and seasoned meat mixture. This should now be the consistency of sloppy joes. It is spooned onto the lettuce leaves and topped with some of the remaining fresh mint leaves. Consume with a large cold Thai tea or Thai beer. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 58025,&quot;Baked Apples 6 large red baking apples like Rome Beauty, Cortland, or Gala Juice and finely grated zest of 1 lemon 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 3 packed tablespoons dark brown sugar 1/4 cup dried currants 1/4 cup broken walnut pieces, toasted Six 3-inch whole cinnamon sticks 1/2 cup apple cider 1/2 cup dark rum, cider, or water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Butter a 13-by-9-inch metal baking pan, then line the bottom and sides with parchment paper; butter the parchment paper. Dust the inside of the pan with flour and knock out the excess. In a large microwavable bowl, microwave the butter until it melts, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add two-thirds of the white chocolate, then shake the bowl so that the butter covers the chocolate; let stand for 1 minute. Starting from the center of the bowl, whisk the butter and white chocolate together slowly until smooth. Add the matcha powder and whisk until smooth. In another large bowl, vigorously whisk together both sugars, the vanilla, salt and eggs until smooth, lightened in color and foamy, about 30 seconds. Scrape the matcha mixture into the bowl and whisk until smooth. Add the flour and use a rubber spatula to fold it in until just incorporated. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly, and smooth the top. Bake until light brown on top and a toothpick inserted halfway between the center and edges comes out clean, about 35 minutes.<br> Remove the baking pan from the oven and immediately sprinkle the remaining 4 ounces white chocolate evenly over the top of the \matchies; let stand for 1 minute.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of butter. Add the egg mixture and pulse until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is very dry, add up to 1 extra tablespoon cold water.) Remove the dough, gently pat it into a round, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. For the filling: Meanwhile, put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel and core the apples; cut each in half, and cut each half into 4 wedges. Add the apples and brown sugar to the bowl with the lemon juice, and toss. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the sugared apples and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes. Strain the apples in a colander set over a medium bowl to catch all the juices. Shake the colander to extract as much liquid as possible. Return the juice to the skillet and simmer over medium heat until it has thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Toss the apples with the thickened juice, cinnamon, salt, cloves, ginger and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Set aside to cool completely. (The cooled filling can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 6 months.) For the streusel topping: Whisk the flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the butter and rub it into the flour mixture with your fingers until it has been absorbed. Mix in the almonds. To assemble and bake the pie: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and place a baking sheet on it. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Layer it between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Ease the dough round into a 9-inch pie pan. Fold and crimp the edges as desired. Add the filling, and spread it out to make an even layer. Squeeze handfuls of the streusel topping, and drop clumps of it on top of the filling to completely cover it. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust and streusel are golden brown, about 1 hour. Let it cool on a cooling rack for at least 3 hours before serving. (The pie keeps well, covered, at room temperature for 24 hours or refrigerated for up to 4 days.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58030,&quot;Easter Egg Sugar Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/8 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 3 to 4 tablespoons whole milk Assorted food coloring Instructions: For the sugar dough: Whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Beat together the vanilla and egg in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl using a rubber spatula as needed. Reduce the speed to low again, slowly pour in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, beating until combined after each and increasing the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters as needed. Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide into 2 even pieces. Shape each piece into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Dust another sheet of parchment with flour and put 1 dough piece on top. Dust with more flour and top with another sheet of parchment. Roll the dough out between the parchment sheets into a square about 1/4 inch thick (and about 11 by 9 inches) and place in the freezer for 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough. Working with 1 dough sheet at a time, cut out cookies with a 2 1/2- by 2 2/4-inch Easter egg cookie cutter and arrange on the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Refrigerate while you cut the remaining cookies. Reroll any scraps of dough and repeat the freezing, cutting and refrigerating process until all the dough is used. Repeat with the remaining dough sheet. Bake, rotating the baking sheets front to back and bottom to top about halfway through, until cookies are golden brown around the edges, about 12 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets set on a wire rack, about 30 minutes. For the icing: Meanwhile, sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a large bowl. Add milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking until the icing is thick enough to show the line of the whisk that disappears within about 8 seconds. Place 3 tablespoons white icing in each of 3 separate bowls. Tint each a different color and cover with plastic wrap (see Cook&#39;s Note). Place 1/4 cup white icing in another bowl, covering the remaining white icing with plastic wrap so it does not dry out. Drizzle one of the colored icings (about 1 tablespoon) onto the 1/4 cup white icing and swirl with a toothpick. Next, dip the surface of a cookie in the swirled icing and remove slowly, allowing any excess to drip off. Shake the cookie over the bowl of icing to remove any excess. Gently smooth the icing with a toothpick to fill in any gaps, if necessary. Place the finished cookies on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Use the tip of the toothpick to pop any bubbles that appear. Drizzle more colored icing as needed. Repeat this process with the next 2 colors and the remaining white icing until all the cookies are decorated. Let set for 30 minutes. Store single layers of cookies, with parchment in between, in a tightly sealed container for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58031,&quot;Blueberries Foster 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/3 cup light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 1/4 cup spiced rum One 12-ounce bag frozen blueberries, thawed 4 scoops vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the butter.

Whisk in the olive oil until evenly blended. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Drain the beans, reserving the soaking water. In a very large castiron and enamel or other heavy casserole, heat the oil over low heat and cook the bacon for 3 to 4 minutes, or until most of the fat is rendered out. Remove 1 tablespoon of the fat and discard. Add the onions, paprika, leek, and carrot and continue cooking for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are very soft. Add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes more. Add the ham hocks, bay leaves, salt, pepper, and enough of the reserved soaking water to barely cover the ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil and skim off the scum and fat that rise to the surface. Reduce the heat and simmer over low heat, partially covered, for 1 hour. Add the sausages and the beans and cook for 1 1/2 hours more, or until the beans are tender (you may need to add a little more water to keep the stew moist and juicy). Remove the ham hocks, remove and discard the rind and fat, and shred the meat. Return the ham to the pan and discard the bay leaves.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the pastry into a rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Cut 2 (3/4-inch wide) strips from a long side. Cut remaining pastry into a 13 by 5-inch rectangle and place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush a 3/4-inch border down 1 long side with water and lay 1 narrow strip on top, pressing gently. Repeat on the other side. (The filling should be thick enough so you don&#39;t need pastry strips on the short sides of the tart to keep the filling from spilling out when the tart is assembled.) Trim any overhang, if necessary. Very lightly roll a pizza wheel along the inside of the strips to score halfway through the base. Brush the top of the strips with milk, taking care not to drip down the sides. Pierce the base all over with a fork, line it with a piece of aluminum foil that extends along the sides of the strips but not over, and weigh foil down with pie weights or dried beans. Use a paring knife to flute the outer edges of the tart by making small cuts an inch apart. Bake until set, about 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake until light golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Cool on a rack. Trim the strawberries&#39; broad tops and put the trimmings in a small saucepan with the rhubarb, sugar, and vanilla extract. Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fruit is thick and jam-like, about 15 minutes. Add butter and puree with an immersion blender or in a food processor until smooth. Cool. Halve the remainder of the strawberries lengthwise. To assemble the tart: Spread cooked mixture in the shell. Arrange strawberries in shingled rows down length of the tart. For the glaze: Stir together jelly and hot water. Brush warm glaze over strawberries. Dust the sides lightly with confectioners&#39; sugar, slice, and serve with whipped cream. Shop Smart: Buy strawberries of roughly the same size so that when they&#39;re \shingled\ on the tart, they fit together nicely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58047,&quot;Pot-roasted Pork in White Wine with Garlic, Fennel, and Rosemary 1 (3 pound/1.5 kilogram) pork loin, off the bone and skin removed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon fennel seeds 2 to 3 large knobs butter Olive oil 8 cloves garlic, skin left on 1 handful fresh rosemary, leaves picked 4 bay leaves 1 fennel bulb, sliced 1/2 (750 ml) bottle Chardonnay Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). With 2 or 3 bits of string, tie up your pork loin, do this any way you like. It doesn&#39;t have to be fussy, you just want to keep the meat in a snug shape while it&#39;s cooking. Season generously with salt and pepper, then roll the meat in the fennel seeds until covered. In a casserole pan or roasting tray, fry the meat for a couple of minutes in half the butter and a little olive oil, until nice and golden. Throw in the garlic, herbs, fennel, and wine, then cover the tray loosely with some wet greaseproof paper and cook until an inserted meat thermometer reaches 150 degrees F. As the pork loin is off the bone it cooks very quickly. Remove from the oven and allow the meat to rest on a plate. Then, without using any more heat, finish off your sauce in the pan, scraping any goodness off the bottom and adding the rest of the butter. Remove any large bits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58048,&quot;Edible Gift Boxes 4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 sticks (24 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 pound (about 3 1/2 cups) confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for thickening 2 tablespoons meringue powder 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: For the dough: Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat together the eggs and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar together, in a large bowl, with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium, and beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br> Reduce the speed to low again and slowly pour in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture, in 3 additions, increase the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters themselves as needed. Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide into 4 even pieces (about 11 ounces). Shape each piece into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight. To roll, cut and bake the cookies: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Dust another sheet of parchment paper with flour and put 1 piece of the dough on top. Dust with more flour and top with another sheet of parchment. Roll the dough out into a square about 1/4-inch thick and chill until firm, about 20 minutes. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough. From 1 piece of rolled dough, measure and cut 6 panels for a box: two 4- by 4-inch squares for the top and bottom, two 4- by 2-inch rectangles for the long sides and two 3 3/4- by 2-inch rectangles for the slightly shorter sides. Arrange on the prepared baking sheets, cover and refrigerate. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough. If you find you can&#39;t get all the box parts from a piece then gather the scraps, reroll and cut panels from that.<br> Bake, rotating the baking sheets front to back and bottom to top about halfway through, until golden brown around the edges, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes. Nice, straight sides make the boxes easier to assemble, so after cooling, use a fine kitchen rasp to file the edges until squared and straight. Meanwhile, make the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons water and the vanilla and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes (adding up to 1 tablespoon more water, if needed). Remove 2 cups to thicken and transfer the rest into an airtight container with plastic wrap pressed on to the surface of the icing.<br> Thicken the royal icing: Thicken the 2 cups of the royal icing by beating in tablespoons of extra confectioners&#39; sugar until the mixture is the consistency of caulk. Fit a pastry bag with a medium round tip and fill it with the thickened icing. Build the boxes: Put a 4- by 4-inch panel flat-side up on a work surface and pipe the thickened icing around the perimeter. Push a long edge of a 4- by 2-inch side panel into the icing on any side you&#39;d like (make sure the golden top is facing out). You can use a can to help prop the panel up. Push the other 4- by 2-inch side panel directly opposite of the first. Now do the same with the remaining 3 3/4-inch by 2-inch side panels. Pipe more thickened royal icing up the 4 corners to help the side panels adhere to one another. Then pipe some around the top perimeter of the box. Let the boxes dry for 24 hours before adding the decorations. When dry, use a paring knife to trim off excess overflowing icing so the outside of the box has a clean finish. Decorate: Fit small round tips into piping bags. Divide the remaining royal icing into batches and color as desired. Fill bags with icing and pipe neat lines along the seams of the box first. Then go back and pipe little dots along the piped lines to create more interest. At this point, you can decorate the box and lid however you want. Do some pencil sketches on paper first to get an idea of what you might like. Then go for it. Let the icing dry thoroughly for at least 24 hours. Fill with treats of your choosing, tie with a ribbon and present. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58049,&quot;The Red Bell 1/2 red bell pepper 4 fresh basil leaves<br> 1 teaspoon simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water) 4 ounces gin Juice of 2 limes Ice, for shaking Small mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: Roughly chop the pepper.

(In combination with the fish and egg whites, the mirepoix will form the clarification to make the consomme crystal clear. This combination of ingredients will form what is referred to as a raft that essentially coagulates as the consomme clarifies.) Mix the chilled mirepoix, ginger root, fish scraps, shrimp shells, and egg white and add to a stockpot. Pour in the chilled fish stock. Add the lemon juice. Bring to a simmer (just below a boil in classical cooking) over low heat, stirring frequently so that the clarification ingredients remain free floating. Please note that the heat must be kept at a simmer, low enough so that the raft which is forming does not break apart from the action of cooking and high enough to cook out the impurities so that they can be collected in the raft. Once the raft forms and rises to the surface, cease stirring. However, gather some broth from the edge of the pot and baste the raft to keep it from breaking apart. After 60 to 90 minutes at the correct simmer, the raft will begin to sink, at which point the consomme is finished. For the edamame, add soybeans in their pods to a pot and cover with water. Boil until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove soybeans from their pods and set aside until needed. In a food processor blend shrimp, egg whites, scallions, salt and pepper to a paste. Spoon some of this mixture into a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe tiny dumplings into the consomme and poach. Spoon 1/4 cup edamame into bowls, and ladle soup over. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 58072,&quot;Marbleized Almond Pound Cake Butter and flour for loaf pans 1 1/2 sticks softened unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 2/3 cups sugar 1/2 cup almond paste 5 egg yolks 1 teaspoon vanilla 12 large egg whites Pinch salt 3 cups sifted flour 3 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, melted Instructions: Butter and flour 2 (9 x 5 x 3-inch) loaf pans and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. With an electric mixer cream the butter with 1/4 cup of the sugar and beat until it looks light and fluffy. Add the almond paste a bit at a time and continue to beat until the mixture looks light and fluffy. Add the yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in the vanilla. Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Add the remaining sugar, a tablespoonful at a time, until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Fold one quarter of the beaten whites into the butter/almond paste mixture, then fold that lightened mixture back into the remaining egg whites, sprinkling and adding in flour as you fold. Add melted chocolate, cutting through the batter with rubber spatula to marble the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the middle of the cake; the cakes should be golden brown and pull away from sides of the pan.

Heat up the chocolate and shortening for 30 seconds in the microwave in a bowl. Remove and stir. If any lumps remain, heat in 10-second increments until fully melted. Place the banana pieces on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Using two forks, place a banana piece on one fork and dip it into the chocolate. Make sure the banana piece is covered completely. Remove the banana piece from the chocolate and, using the other fork, gently move the banana piece onto the cookie sheet. When completed, place the chocolate-covered banana pieces in the freezer for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight. For the chocolate cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Mix together with a wooden spoon, then set aside. In a small bowl, combine the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla. Beat well with a hand mixer. Slowly add the boiling water and mix. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and fold and stir until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the cake from the pan and cool on a rack. For the whipped cream: Beat the cream and vanilla in a chilled nonreactive bowl with a whisk or an electric mixer just until the mixture holds a loose peak. (Lift the beater from the cream and look at the shape of the peak at the end of the whisk; it should hold a lazy curve.) Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar over the cream and continue to beat just until it holds a soft peak. Take care not to overbeat the cream or it will be curdy. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 4 hours. To assemble: When the cake is cool, cut in half with a long serrated knife. Place one half of the chocolate cake on a serving platter or cake stand. Cover the cake with strawberry pie filling (about 1 cup; you will have some left over, which can be refrigerated). Set the other half of the cake on top. Try to match up the ends that have been cut when stacking. With a pastry bag fitted with a large open star decorating tip, pipe whipped cream mounds on top of the cake. Add sprinkles. Cut the frozen banana bites in half and set on top of the whipped cream. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 58093,&quot;Shrimp and Vegetable Steamed Dumplings 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 pound raw shrimp, peeled deveined and roughly chopped 1/2 cup chopped white onion 1 large carrot finely chopped (about 1/3 cup) 1 cup chopped green cabbage 1/2 cup shiitake mushroom caps, thinly sliced and chopped 1/2 teaspoon dry chili pepper flakes 2 tablespoons sesame oil 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 3 tablespoons sugar Salt and pepper to taste 1 pack wonton wrappers, preferably round</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/garlic cloves.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Fry%20the%20wings.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Fry the wings</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/green%20bell%20pepper.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>green bell pepper</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
