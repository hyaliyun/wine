Add the shrimp, onion, carrot, cabbage and mushrooms and quickly stir fry while combining the ingredients. Add the pepper flakes, sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar, adjust the seasoning and pour out onto a cookie sheet to cool. When the mixture is cool begin making the dumplings by laying out one wonton, brush the edge with water, put 1 teaspoon of the filling into the middle and fold the edge over on the diagonal to from a packet. Trim the edges to eliminate the square corners. Dust the finished dumplings with a light coating of cornstarch to prevent sticking before cooking. Refrigerate until ready to cook. To cook the finished dumplings, bring water to a boil in a large skillet in which a steamer basket may be nestled. When the water is boiling, insert the basket with the dumplings and steam for 6 minutes or until fully cooked. The dough will change color and texture when cooked. Serve with sweet mustard dip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 58094,&quot;Panna Cotta 4 ounces heavy cream 10 ounces milk 1/2 cup sugar 1 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise, scrape inside 2/3 cup fresh ricotta, recipe follows 2 1/2 gelatin leaves or 1 1/4 teaspoons gelatin powder, bloomed in a bowl of tap water 1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped 2 tablespoons minced Sweet Preserved Lemons, recipe follows 1 pound assorted fresh berries 2 cups Fresh Raspberry Puree, recipe follows 6 cups whole milk 6 ounces yogurt 6 ounces heavy cream Pinch of salt 10 lemons, preferably Meyers, halved crosswise, juice and pith removed Water, for blanching 1 pound sugar 2 baskets raspberries 1/2 cup sugar Lemon juice, to taste Instructions: In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla bean. Bring to a boil. Turn off heat and whisk in ricotta. Strain into a bowl over ice. Drain the gelatin and slowly whisk into the cooling mixture. Allow to cool to room temperature. Slowly fold in the whipped cream. Lastly, fold in the minced Sweet Preserved Lemons. Arrange 1/4 cup of mixed berries in the bottom of a chilled martini glass. Repeat the process to 7 more glasses. Divide the cream evenly among the 8 glasses. Smooth the top and allow to chill at least 1 hour. Pour about 2 ounces of the Fresh Raspberry Puree or enough to cover the surface of the panna cotta. Chill at least 1 hour to allow to set completely. Serve chilled. In a pot, whisk together all above ingredients. Over medium heat, slowly bring the mixture to a boil. Once the mixture comes to a boil, turn off heat, stir once and allow to set for 2 minutes. Line a colander with a double thickness of cheesecloth. Slowly pour the mixture into it and let it drain for about 15 minutes, or until the cheese is thick. Transfer fresh ricotta into a non-reactive container. Keep refrigerated until needed. Yield: 1 1/2 cups Bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the cleaned lemon halves for 1 minute. Drain. Repeat the process 2 more times, making sure that you use fresh water each time. After the final blanching, drain the peels. In a saucepan, bring sugar and water to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Add the blanched peels and cook for 5 minutes. Turn off heat and transfer to a covered container. Allow to cool in the refrigerator. This will keep for months in the refrigerator. Use as needed.

Turn leftovers into Ham Jambalaya &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 58098,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Meat and Potatoes Bundt Loaf 1 large russet potato, peeled and sliced on a mandoline into paper-thin, lengthwise slices 4 tablespoons salted butter, melted<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the bundt pan 3/4 cup Italian seasoning breadcrumbs<br> 1/2 cup finely chopped white onion 1/2 cup basil pesto<br> 1/2 cup ketchup<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 large eggs, beaten<br> 2 pounds meatloaf blend (ground beef, pork, veal)<br> 1 cup ketchup Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons hot sauce<br> 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> Instructions: For the potatoes: In a large bowl of cold water, add the potato slices and rest at room temperature, draining, rinsing and changing the water halfway through, for 30 minutes. For the loaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside bottom and sides of a nonstick bundt pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, add the breadcrumbs, onion, pesto, ketchup, 2 teaspoons salt and plenty of black pepper. Stir to combine and whisk in the eggs. Add the meatloaf blend and gently mix to distribute the ingredients. Press the meatloaf into the prepared bundt pan and bake for 30 minutes. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Remove the bundt pan and, using a medium bowl or liquid measure cup, gently tilt the pan and drain out the juices, reserving 1/2 cup. Place the foil-lined baking sheet on top of the bundt and, holding them together, flip them to unmold the loaf onto the baking sheet. Turn the oven up to 375 degrees F. Drain, rinse and dry the potatoes on a paper towel-lined plate. Wipe out the bowl and place the potatoes back in along with the melted butter, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Gently mix to coat. Begin to layer the curved top of the loaf with the potato slices, overlapping them slightly around the loaf, covering the top and about one-third of the way down the side of the loaf all around. Return to the oven and continue to bake until the potatoes begin to curl and become slightly golden on the edges, about 30 minutes more. Rest 10 minutes, then transfer to a serving dish. For the glaze: In a medium saucepot on medium-high heat, add the 1/2 cup pan drippings, the ketchup, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat to medium and cook until the sauce thickens and reduces, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the hot sauce and stir in the parsley. Pour over the loaf and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 58099,&quot;Savory Cheese Palmiers 6 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese, divided 1/2 box (17.3-ounce) frozen puff pastry, thawed (recommended: Pepperidge Farms) 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 tablespoon water 1/4 cup shredded Italian cheese blend 1 teaspoon paprika Instructions: Sprinkle work surface with 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan..

Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 58100,&quot;Chocolate Espresso Shortbread 2 cups (1 pound) unsalted butter at room temperature 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, beat the butter with the flat paddle attachment on the medium speed until creamy. Add the sugar gradually and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. In another bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa, espresso powder and salt. Add to the creamed mixture and beat on low speed until incorporated. Scrape the soft dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap and gather together into a ball. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, or until firm enough to roll out. You may chill it overnight; just let it soften a bit at room temperature before proceeding. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out cookies with a cookie cutter of your choice. These baking instructions are for 3-inch cookies. If you make small cookies, reduce the baking time, larger cookies will require a longer baking time. Reroll any extra dough and cut out as many cookies as possible. Transfer the cookies to the prepared pans, keeping them at least 1-inch apart. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the pans front to back halfway through the baking time. These cookies are so dark that it is impossible to see if they are beginning to color. Use the time suggested and check to see if the edges and bottoms are completely dry. You should be able to lift a cookie up with a spatula to peek at the bottom; the cookie should be baked enough to remain stiff and not break. Set the pans directly on a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes. Then remove the cookies to the rack and cool completely. The sheet pans must be cooled completely between uses, but you will probably be able to reuse the parchment. The cookies are best eaten within 1 week; store them at room temperature in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 58101,&quot;Jambalaya Sandwich 1/4 pound thick-cut bacon, diced 1 pound pork butt / pork loin, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 pound smoked sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices 1/2 pound andouille sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices 1 red onion, chopped 1 cup thinly julienned red bell peppers 1 pound boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 celery stalks, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves 3/4 cup plus 1/4 cup chopped green onions 2 teaspoons cayenne, or to taste Salt and pepper 1/2 cup water 2 sourdough bread loaves 1 pound Havarti cheese, thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. In a large cast iron pot or heavy-bottomed braising pan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crisp and fat is rendered. Remove bacon and drain on paper towel. Set aside. Add pork to the pan with the bacon fat and cook on medium to high heat until pork is browned on all sides, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the sausage, onions, and bell pepper. Cook until onions are translucent. Next add the chicken, celery, and garlic, parsley, and 3/4 cup chopped green onions. Cook until chicken is cooked through, about 5 to 7 more minutes. Add the cayenne and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the water, cover and let sit for 1 hour. Cut bread lengthwise and place in oven to toast lightly. Spoon some of the pork mixture on the bread bottoms, top each with slices of cheese, the reserved bacon and the remaining green onions and finish with the bread tops. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]</p><p>&quot; 58102,&quot;Lobster Bisque 4 (1 1/2-pound) lobsters 1 1/2 cups tomato paste 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped onion 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped celery, including leaves 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped carrot 1 sprig thyme 3 sprigs flat-leaf parsley, plus extra, for garnish 1/2 teaspoon saffron 6 cups heavy cream 1 cup cream sherry 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup cornstarch Instructions: Fill large stockpot with water and bring to a boil. There should be enough water to cover lobsters completely when immersed. Place live lobsters in boiling water head first to minimize splashing. When water re-boils, turn down the heat, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not overcook lobsters. Remove lobsters from the pot using tongs; save all the water in stockpot as this is now a flavorful stock to be re-used. Place 10 cups of stock in a clean stockpot and put on low heat. Clean claws and tails of lobsters and reserve meat, legs, and swimmerets. After lobsters are cleaned, place shells in stockpot with 10 cups of stock. Cut bodies in quarters and place in stockpot, making sure to include all roe and tomalley in pot. Add 1 cup tomato paste and simmer on low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Be careful not to have heat so high as to burn stock. Pour entire contents of pot through sieve into clean stockpot; this should now be 8 cups of glorious red stock. Place onions, celery, carrots, thyme, parsley and saffron in a large saute pan, add 4 cups stock from original stock pot and put on high heat for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup tomato paste and black pepper. Turn down heat and simmer 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Press entire contents of saute pan through sieve into stockpot of 8 cups previously made stock. To finish Bisque, put pot on medium heat. Add heavy cream slowly, using whisk to blend. Add sherry. Simmer on low heat for 20 minutes; bisque will thicken slightly. Mix cornstarch with 1/4 cup water and slowly add to bisque with whisk. Simmer on low heat for another 20 minutes. If you prefer your bisque to be thicker, you may add more cornstarch, or perhaps, flour, but have found the bisque thickens nicely over low heat, and additional cornstarch or flour takes away from the wonderful flavor. Place pieces of previous cleaned lobster meat in bowl and add 1 cup of bisque. Garnish with legs and swimmerets around the bowl and one parsley leaf in center, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58103,&quot;Black Bean Quesadillas 1 cup GOYA?

Cover, place over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the meat is very tender and falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove the meat from the water to a cutting board, and set aside to cool. Leave the cooking liquid in the pot. Once the turkey legs are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bone and shred, discarding any skin or cartilage. Place a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Once shimmering, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are semi-translucent, approximately 2 minutes. Add the garlic and chili and continue to cook for another minute. Add the meat and 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking liquid and cook until heated through and the liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside until ready to assemble. While the meat is cooking, place the husks in a large bowl or container and submerge completely in hot water. Soak the husks until they are soft and pliable, at least 45 minutes and up to 2 hours. If you have an electric kettle, place the husks in the kettle, fill with water and turn on. Once the kettle turns off, allow the husks to sit for 1 hour in the hot water. Place the masa, salt, and baking powder into a large mixing bowl and combine. Add the lard and using your hands, knead together until the lard is well incorporated into the dry mixture. Gradually add enough of the reserved cooking liquid, 2 to 4 cups to create a dough that is like thick mashed potatoes. The dough should be moist but not wet. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and set aside until ready to use. To assemble the tamales: Remove a corn husk from the water and pat to remove excess water. Working in batches of 6, lay the husks on a towel and spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough in an even layer across the wide end of the husk to within 1/2-inch of the edges. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the meat mixture in a line down the center of the dough. Roll the husk so the dough surrounds the meat and fold the bottom under to finish creating the tamale. Repeat until all the husks, dough and filling are used. Tie the tamales, around the center, individually or in groups of 3, with kitchen twine. To steam the tamales: Place a steamer basket in the bottom of an 11-quart pot and add enough water to come to the bottom of the basket. Stand the tamales close together on their folded ends and lean them in towards the center, away from the sides of the pot. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat, then cover and reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Check the water level every 15 to 20 minutes, and add boiling water by pouring down the side of the pot, if necessary. Steam until the dough is firm and pulls away from the husk easily, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Serve warm. Store leftover tamales, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, in the freezer, for up to a month. To reheat, remove the plastic wrap and steam until heated through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 58207,&quot;Kielbasa and Sauerkraut Sheet Pan Dinner 3/4 pound (about 3 cups) fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound smoked kielbasa, cut on the bias into eight 2-inch long pieces 1 cup prepared sauerkraut 1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn up four edges of a large piece of foil to make a rectangular tray (about 12 by 5 inches) for the sauerkraut; set aside On one side of the baking sheet, toss the potatoes with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and sprinkle with some salt and pepper; spread the potatoes into an even layer. Place the kielbasa on the other side of the baking sheet, leaving an empty place in the center for the foil tray. Brush the kielbasa with the remaining olive oil. Roast until the kielbasa begins to brown in spots and the potatoes are almost completely tender, about 15 minutes.<br> Toss the sauerkraut with the caraway seeds and spread into an even layer in the prepared foil baking tray.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add olive oil to lightly coat a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the red onion and cook until just translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and jalapeno and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Add the corn, cilantro and crab and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt and crushed red pepper. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly until cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, roll out each dough into 11-inch rounds, using flour as needed to avoid sticking. Cut the dough using a cookie cutter or lip of a glass into desired size, anywhere from 4 to 6 inches. Use all of the dough, putting scraps together and rolling out again. Divide filling equally among all of the dough, placing the filling in the center. Brush the sides of the dough lightly with the egg wash and fold to form a half moon. Press the edges together with a fork to seal. Place on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart and brush with the remaining egg wash. Using a fork, poke a few holes in the top of each empanada to allow steam to escape while baking. Bake until the dough is golden brown and flaky, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve with the aioli. For the aioli: Add the garlic, vinegar, lime zest and juice and egg yolks to the bowl of a food processor. Turn the machine on. While the machine is running, begin adding the oil, drop by drop, until you see the mixture thicken. When the mixture begins to look like a smooth homogeneous mixture, the oil can be added in a slow thin stream. If the mixture is too thick, add a few drops of water to thin it down. Season with salt and taste to make sure it is delicious. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 58211,&quot;Broccoli, Mushroom, and Cheese Breakfast Strata 4 teaspoons olive oil 1 large onion, diced (about 2 cups) 3 garlic cloves, minced 3 cups (8 ounces) sliced mushrooms Nonstick cooking spray 1 whole wheat baguette, crusts removed, cubed (about 5 cups) 8 eggs and 8 egg whites 2 cups low-fat milk 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 10 ounces broccoli, steamed, cooled and chopped (or frozen, thawed) 1-ounce (1/3 cup) grated Parmesan 4-ounce (1 cup) part-skim mozzarella cheese 1/2 cup thinly sliced sun-dried tomatoes, reconstituted 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper Instructions: Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.

Toast the rice, then add the chopped onion and cook until light brown with a nutty aroma. Keep stirring to prevent sticking during this process. Deglaze with the white wine and add the porcini broth. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring the whole time to prevent sticking. Add more liquid as needed. Fold in the porcini at the end. For the veal chop cutlet: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Pound out the veal chop to about 3/8 inch thickness. Put the flour in one shallow bowl, the whisked eggs in another and the breadcrumbs in a third. Dust the veal in the flour first, then dip in the egg wash and finish in the breadcrumbs to coat. Pour the olive oil into an ovensafe pan. Add the veal chop to the pan and coat one side in the olive oil, then flip it over right away so there&#39;s olive oil on both sides. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for about 15 minutes, flipping the cutlet halfway through. For the Marsala wine sauce: Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for a few minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and add the Marsala and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until the sauce reduces to the desired consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with the salt and pepper, then finish with the butter and chopped parsley Remove the veal pan from the oven and place the prosciutto on top of the cutlet followed by the mozzarella. Return it to the oven until the cheese melts, 3 to 5 minutes For the spinach bed. Heat a saute pan over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the garlic and cook until beginning to brown, then add the spinach, salt and pepper. Cook until the spinach is just wilted, then transfer to a serving plate; do not overcook. Top the spinach with a serving of the risotto, followed by the veal chop and Marsala sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 58213,&quot;Crab &#39;n&#39; Shrimp Stuffed Tamales 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter 3/4 tablespoon salt 16 tamale husks 1 pound medium (21/25 count) shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 pint picked jumbo lump crabmeat 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon paprika Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Juice of 1/2 a lime 1 1/2 cups masa harina 1 dried New Mexico or California cl pepper Extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 fennel bulb, sliced 1/2 medium onion, diced 1 clove garlic, sliced 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 tablespoons ground cumin One 28-ounce can fire roasted tomatoes, such as Glen Muir Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: For the seafood stuffing: Roughly chop the shrimp up into chunky pieces. Set a large saute pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and garlic. Once the garlic begins to sizzle, add the shrimp. Saute until just pink, about 2 minutes, and then add the crabmeat. Season with the cumin, paprika and some salt and pepper. Gently fold the mixture together, and then shut off the heat and add the lime juice. Allow to cool. Divide the mixture; you will use one half to stuff the tamales, and one half for the seafood sauce.<br> For the tamales: Mix the masa, 1 1/4 cups water, butter and salt into a thick paste. To prepare the tamales, set a corn husk out on a flat surface (double up or shingle 2 husks if they are small or have tears). Add 5 tablespoons of the masa mix into the center of the corn husk. Push the mixture to 1 inch from the side of the husk. Add 2 tablespoons of seafood stuffing to the center. Fold one edge of the husk to the center, and then fold the other side to cover the entire tamale. Fold the ends over by 2 inches and tuck under to hold in place.<br> Place a colander in large pot of boiling water, but do not let the colander touch the water. Place the tamales in the colander, cover and steam the tamales for 30 to 40 minutes.<br> For the red seafood sauce: First, rehydrate the cl pepper. Place the dried cl in a cup of hot water and let sit for 10 minutes.<br> Set a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.

If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Prick the eggplants all over the surface with a fork. Place on the direct heat side of the grill or directly on to the coals, close the lid of the grill and char on all sides, turning once the skin begins to darken and crack, about 5 minutes per side. When the eggplants have softened through, remove to a resealable bag and allow to steam for a few minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel the eggplants and discard the skin and most of the seeds. In the meantime, make the tehina. Break up the garlic cloves into a blender or food processor, leaving them in their papery skins. Add the lemon juice and salt and blend into a pulpy pure. Press the mixture though a strainer set over a bowl containing the tahini. Whisk to combine; the mixture will thicken and seize up. Whisk in the ice water, smoothing out into a loose sauce. Add the cleaned eggplant to a blender or food processor while still warm. Pour in all the tehina and blend until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt and lemon juice if needed.

Whisk the eggs, half-and-half, vanilla, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl until combined. Line two 18-by-13-inch sheet pans with parchment paper or nonstick foil.<br> Brush one prepared pan with 2 tablespoons butter. Arrange the bread slices on it so the bottom is completely covered (2 rows of 4 slices lengthwise, and the remaining 2 slices cut in half and arranged at the bottom). Pour the egg mixture over each slice and let sit in the mixture for 5 minutes. Flip the slices and let soak until the batter is almost completely absorbed by the bread, about 5 minutes more. Brush the tops with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Remove 4 strips of zest from the orange using a vegetable peeler, avoiding as much of the white pith as possible. Toss together the cherries, orange zest, remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg in a small baking dish and place on the second sheet pan along one of the short ends (it will take up about a third of the pan). Toss the almonds, syrup and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until the almonds are coated. Spread the almonds on another third of the pan next to the baking dish. Arrange the sausage patties on the remaining third of the pan.<br> Bake the French toast on the bottom rack and the sausage, cherries and almonds on the top rack until the French toast is puffed and beginning to brown and the almonds are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the sheet pan with the sausage, cherries and almonds from the oven. Transfer the pan with the French toast to the top rack, increase the heat to high broil, and broil, rotating the pan halfway through, until the top of the toast is golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Check the toast every 30 seconds so that it doesn&#39;t get too dark! Serve the toast topped with the crumbled almond brittle, roasted cherries, a sprinkle of confectioners&#39; sugar and a drizzle of syrup, and sausage on the side.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58217,&quot;Italian Seafood Salad 1 tablespoon Old Bay seasoning Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds (16- to 20-count) peeled and deveined shrimp 1 1/2 cups dry white wine 1 pound sea scallops, halved crosswise<br> 1 pound cleaned fresh calamari, sliced crosswise in 1/2-inch-thick rings 2 pounds fresh mussels 1/2 cup good olive oil 4 teaspoons minced garlic (4 cloves) 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 3 plum tomatoes, seeds and pulp removed and medium-diced 1/3 cup limoncello liqueur Grated zest of 1 lemon 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 lemons) Freshly ground black pepper 1 small fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced crosswise 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, lightly packed 2 lemons<br> Instructions: Fill a large pot with 3 quarts of water and add the Old Bay seasoning and 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil, add the shrimp, lower the heat, and simmer for 3 minutes, until just firm. With a skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to a large bowl. Leave 2 cups of the poaching liquid in the pot and discard the rest.<br> Add the wine to the poaching liquid and bring to a boil. Add the scallops, lower the heat, and simmer for 2 minutes, until just cooked. With the skimmer, transfer the scallops to the bowl with the shrimp. Bring the poaching liquid back to a boil, add the calamari, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, until just cooked. Be careful not to overcook any of the seafood or it will be tough! With the skimmer, transfer the calamari to the bowl.<br> Bring the poaching liquid to a boil again, add the mussels, cover, and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes, until all the shells have opened, discarding any that don&#39;t open. Turn off the heat and set aside until the mussels in the broth are cool enough to handle. Remove the mussels from the shells and add to the bowl. Add 12 of the shells to the seafood and discard the rest. Set aside 1/2 cup of the poaching liquid, discarding the rest. Drain the seafood in a colander and put it all back into the bowl.<br> For the dressing, heat the olive oil in a medium (10-inch) saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute. (Be careful: Overcooked garlic will be bitter.) Add the tomatoes and cook over medium heat for 2 more minutes.

For the meat sauce: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until it shimmers. Add the whole cloves and cinnamon stick, and remove after a few minutes. Add the garlic and onions, sprinkle with a little salt and saute until softened but not browned. Add the sausage, breaking up the clumps with your spoon. Cook until the sausage is no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, basil, as well as some salt and pepper. Stir to combine and simmer uncovered, for about 15 minutes, stirring every now and then. Allow the meat sauce to cool, about 15 minutes, before building lasagna cupcakes. As the meat sauce is cooking, prepare the ricotta filling. For the ricotta filling: Stir together the mozzarella, Parmesan, ricotta and mango chutney. Season with salt and lots of pepper, about a teaspoon, and set aside. To assemble the cupcakes: Pull out your favorite cupcake pan. If your pan is not nonstick, spray the cups with cooking spray. Place a wonton wrapper in each cup. Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re using square ones. Drop about 1 teaspoon of meat sauce into the bottom of each cup. Then add 1 teaspoon of ricotta filling. Then cover with another wonton wrapper, rotating it about 90-degrees so that the corners of the first wrapper and the second wrapper aren&#39;t right on top of each other. Repeat this until you&#39;ve built three layers total. Top each with a small basil leaf, then another wonton wrapper. Finish each cupcake with a spoonful of meat sauce, a little shredded mozzarella and pinch of grated Parmesan. Pop them into the oven and bake for 20 minutes. When time&#39;s up, resist the temptation to eat them right away or else you&#39;ll burn your mouth!

Divide the bread crumbs between two medium bowls. Set one bowl aside and stir the milk into the bread crumbs in the other bowl.<br> Add half the chilled chicken and all of the bacon to the food processor and pulse to combine into a rough mixture. Add the milk-and-bread-crumb mixture to the food processor along with the egg, onion, garlic, and Parmesan and process until very well combined (the mixture will be almost creamy). Add the remaining chilled chicken cubes to the food processor and pulse just to combine. The mixture will be semi-smooth with small chunks of chicken. Using a 1-inch small scoop, divide the mixture into about 30 small meatballs. Place the meatballs on a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and freeze for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the freezer and roll the meatballs through the reserved bread crumbs to lightly and evenly coat the surface.

Add the butter and pulse 12 to 15 times, until the butter is the size of peas. Add the egg yolks and pulse a few times to combine. With the motor running, add the ice water through the feed tube and pulse until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a floured board and roll it into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Meanwhile, place the tomatoes in a large bowl. Put the parsley, basil, garlic, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until finely minced. With the processor running, pour the olive oil down the feed tube and process until combined. Pour the mixture over the tomatoes and toss gently. Set aside. On a well-floured board, roll the dough out to an 11-by-17-inch rectangle and transfer it to the prepared sheet pan. Don?t worry if it doesn?t fit exactly; you want it to cover most of the bottom of the pan, but it can be a little rough on the sides. Place a second sheet pan directly on the pastry (be sure both sheet pans have flat bottoms) and bake for 15 minutes. (You can also line the pastry with foil and fill it with dried beans.) Remove the top sheet pan (or the beans and foil). Using a dinner fork, pierce the pastry in many places. Bake for another 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned. Check the pastry during baking; pierce any spots that bubble up. Allow the crust to cool for 15 minutes. Lower the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the mustard on the crust with a pastry brush. Sprinkle a thick even layer of Gruyre on the pastry, reserving 1/2 cup for the top, and sprinkle with the 1/2 cup of Parmesan. Place overlapping tomatoes in rows on top. If there is a little garlic and herb mixture in the bowl, sprinkle it over the tomatoes, but if there is liquid in the bowl, strain it through a very-fine-mesh strainer, discard the liquid, and sprinkle the garlic and herb mixture on the tomatoes. Sprinkle the reserved 1/2 cup of Gruyre and the remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan on top. Bake for 30 minutes. Cool slightly, cut into squares and serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58255,&quot;Homemade Fudge Brownies 1 cup butter, melted 3 cups white sugar 1 TBSP vanilla extract 4 eggs 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 tsp. salt 1 cup semisweet chocolate morsels Fresh raspberries or cherries &amp; powdered sugar, garnish Instructions: 1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and beat until completely combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture slowly, about 1/2 cup at a time until finished, mixing until just combined. Form the dough into 2 disks and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until slightly firm, about 1 hour, or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, or spray with cooking spray. Roll the dough out onto a floured work surface and use cookie cutters to cut out shapes, then transfer to the prepared baking sheets, leaving about a 2-inch space between each cookie. Chill the cut-out cookies on the baking sheets for about 15 minutes before baking for a more precise shape. Bake until just starting to become crisp and golden around the edges, about 15 minutes. Remove the cookies to a rack and let cool completely. Use food coloring to tint Royal Icing into different colors. To decorate, cover the cookies with the Royal Icing, then sprinkle on decorations while the icing is still wet. Let the icing set completely. Add the meringue powder to 1/2 cup water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip for about 30 seconds. Slowly add the confectioner&#39;s sugar, and continue to beat until medium peaks form. If the icing is too stiff, add water a tablespoon at a time. Keep covered until ready to use.

Bring the oil to 325 degrees F. Regulate the temperature with a candy thermometer. Keep the potato sticks in a bowl of water to prevent browning before frying. Remove to paper towels and dry well before placing in oil. Working in batches, fry the potatoes until they are cooked through and tender but have no color, about 4 to 5 minutes. Be sure the fries have plenty of room and gently swish them around as they are cooking. Remove them from the oil and put them immediately on a paper towel lined baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and raise the temperature of the cooking oil to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, seafood seasoning, baking soda and pinch of salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and gently stir in the cold beer. Mix until just combined. When the oil is preheated to the correct temperature, dip the fish fillets in the batter mixture. Coat the fish generously. When adding the fish to the oil, dip about 1/3 to 1/2 of the fillet into the oil and allow the batter to start puffing and then gently slide it into the oil. Fry the fish until they are golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes turning the fish over during the cooking time. When the fish are done, remove from the oil and put immediately on paper towels to blot the excess oil. Arrange the fish on a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack. Hold the fish in the preheated oven until serving. Work in batches and be sure not to crowd the oil. Again, working in batches, fry the fries a second time at 375 degrees F, until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove them from the oil, immediately put them on paper towels and toss with kosher salt. Transfer the fish to a serving platter and serve with the fries.

Slowly add the boiling water and stir in 1 direction with a wooden spoon. When the flour absorbs the water and cools, knead the dough into a ball and then place it on a work surface dusted with flour. Knead for about 2 minutes, until the dough is thoroughly smooth. Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rest for 30 minutes. On a flour-dusted work surface roll the dough into a 12-inch sausage and divide into 12 (1-inch) pieces. Flatten each piece with your palm, using more flour to dust if the dough is sticky. While working, cover the dough not in use with plastic wrap. Working with 2 pieces of dough at a time, wipe 1 side of each piece gently with sesame oil and place 1 flattened, oiled piece atop another. Roll them together into 7-inch rounds. The result is a 2-layer pancake. Repeat until 6 (2-layer) pancakes are made. Heat a wok over low to medium heat for 1 minute. Place a double pancake in the dry wok and cook for a minute, until it begins to bubble up. (The heat in the dry wok must be carefully controlled. If it is too high, the pancakes will burn.) Turn the pancake over and cook until a few brown spots appear. Remove from the wok and separate into 2 layers. You will have 2 pancakes, each browned lightly on 1 side and white on the other. Repeat until all the dough is used and you have 12 pancakes. Before serving, steam the pancakes in a stack for 5 to 7 minutes, until soft and hot. Brush the pancake with hoisin sauce, place the chicken slice in the pancake, add some scallion, and fold up the bottom to create an envelope closed on 3 sides but open at the top. Serve immediately. 1/3 cup sauce 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon Shao-Hsing wine or sherry Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Combine the poaching ingredients in a large pot (preferably an oval Dutch oven) and bring to a boil. Cover the pot, lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Raise the heat to high and return to a boil. Place the chicken in the pot, breast side-up. Cover. When the pot begins to boil, lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn the chicken over and repeat the process. Turn off the heat and allow the chicken to sit in the liquid, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the chicken to a rack that has been set into a platter and allow to drain. Pierce the skin with a fork to help the draining. Discard all the ingredients from the pot. Reserve poaching liquid for later use. Mix the coating ingredients, and with a pastry brush, coat the chicken thoroughly with the mixture. Allow the chicken to dry completely, about 6 hours. During this time, turn the chicken, taking care not to mar the coating. (An electric fan can reduce the drying time by half.) Heat a wok over high heat for a minute. Add the peanut oil and heat it to 375 degrees F. Using a large Chinese strainer, lower the chicken into the oil, breast side up, and deep-fry for 3 minutes. Use a ladle to pour oil over the chicken to ensure uniformity in frying. Turn the chicken over by inserting a wooden spoon in its cavity, and deep-fry for another 3 minutes, ladling the oil as before. Repeat until the chicken is golden brown. Turn off the heat. Remove the chicken and allow it to drain. Place the chicken on a chopping board and slice the meat and skin together into pieces 1 by 2 inches. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 58287,&quot;Ricotta Cappuccino 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 vanilla bean 1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese 1/2 tablespoon instant espresso powder 1 (3-inch) biscotti, crushed Pinch ground cinnamon Pinch cocoa powder Instructions: Place the sugar in a food processor.

Discard tops and freeze empty orange shells. NOTE: For easier scooping, roll the oranges by hand before cutting the tops, using a firm downward pressure to loosen the pulp. In a colander, fine mesh strainer, or food mill, mash the orange pulp to remove as much juice as possible. Add additional juice, if necessary, to make 1 1/2 cups. Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. When the sugar is totally dissolved, remove from heat and allow to cool. Add orange juice and orange liqueur. Pour the mixture into a shallow glass dish and place level in the freezer for 2 to 3 hours, mixing gently with a fork every 20 minutes until it forms ice crystals and thickens. The frequent mixing will keep the granita from freezing into a solid block. Fill orange shells with frozen granita mixture and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 58302,&quot;Go-To Chocolate Chip Cookies 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

When you are ready to grill, prepare a charcoal fire so that you have areas of higher and lower heat.<br> Drain off any excess oil from the steak. Sear the steak over the high-heat area of the grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the grill rack and sprinkle 2 cups soaked hickory or oak chips on the low-heat part of the fire. Replace the grill and place the steak over the low-heat area. Cover the grill, but turn the steak frequently; this should take 10 to 20 minutes more, depending on the thickness of the steak and the heat of the fire. Check the interior of the meat with an instant-read thermometer, and remove the steaks at 5 to 7 degrees below the desired degree of doneness. Let the steak rest, covered loosely with foil, for 10 minutes or so before carving.<br> To carve, cut the loin meat and the fillet meat away from the bone. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Whisk in the eggs, vanilla, maple extract, orange zest, cinnamon and nutmeg. Gently pour the pumpkin mixture into the pan with the caramel so they don?t combine. Place the pan in a roasting pan large enough to hold the cake pan flat and fill the roasting pan with enough of the hottest tap water to come halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Bake in the center of the oven for 70 to 75 minutes, until the custard is just set. It will be firm but still jiggle slightly in the middle; a knife inserted into the center of the flan will come out clean. Remove the flan from the water bath, place on a cooling rack and cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Don?t tilt the pan or the caramel will run out! Run a small knife around the edge of the flan. Turn a flat serving plate with a slight lip over the cake pan and flip them, turning the flan out onto the plate. The caramel should run out over the flan. Cut into wedges and serve with the caramel spooned over each slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 58311,&quot;Summer Chicken Salad 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil, for drizzling<br> 4 ears fresh corn (or use 2 if on the large side)<br> 3 tablespoons minced fresh dill, plus more for serving 3 stalks celery (inner light green stalks and leaves), finely diced 3 stalks celery (inner light green stalks and leaves), finely diced<br> 1 medium red onion, finely diced<br> 1 1/2 cups blueberries<br> 3/4 cup crumbled feta, plus more for serving 1/4 cup half-and-half<br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/4 cup sour cream<br> 1 teaspoon sugar Juice of 1 lemon<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 head butter lettuce, leaves separated Instructions: For the salad: Put the chicken breasts into a large plastic storage bag. Pound with a mallet or rolling pin to flatten to 1/4-inch uniform thickness. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a grill and drizzle with the olive oil. Grill the chicken on both sides until done, about 7 minutes per side. (Rotate halfway during grilling each side to ensure pretty grill marks.) Set aside to cool. Grill the corn for a few minutes, until still crunchy but colored. With a very sharp knife, shave the kernels off each corn cob. Combine with the dill, celery and onions in a large bowl. Set aside. For the dressing: Mix together the feta, half-and-half, mayonnaise and sour cream in a bowl. Stir in the sugar, lemon juice and some salt and pepper. Stir, and then taste. Add more salt if necessary; do not undersalt! Slice the chicken on the bias to create flat, randomly shaped pieces. Throw into the bowl with the celery, onions and corn. Stir to combine. Pour half of the dressing over the ingredients and toss gently. Add more as desired, but don&#39;t overcoat the salad; it should be light! At the end, toss in the blueberries to lightly coat them in the dressing. Spoon the salad into butter lettuce cups and then sprinkle individual helpings with feta and extra dill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 58312,&quot;Grilled Sweet Potato and Green Onion Salad 4 large sweet potatoes, do not peel 4 scallion, used both parts, green and white 1/2 cup canola oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup cider vinegar 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 heaping tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons honey 1/2 cup olive oil 1/4 cup fresh flat leaf parsley, coarsely chopped Instructions: Place potatoes in a large saucepan, cover by an inch with cold water, add 1 tablespoon of salt and bring to a boil over high heat.

When hot, add the onions, celery and bell pepper. Stir mixture until onions begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 1 minute. Slowly pour in stock, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Add the browned sausage, bay leaves, Worcestershire, hot sauce, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Bring gumbo to a boil, reduce heat to medium and simmer until gumbo is slightly reduced, about 50 minutes. (Gumbo should cook long enough for the roux flavor to mellow and for any floury taste to dissipate.) Season the shrimp with the Essence in a small bowl. Stir in the seasoned shrimp, crabmeat, green onions, parsley, thyme and basil. Cook until shrimp are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Sprinkle in file powder and cook, stirring, 2 minutes more, or pass file at the table for guests to thicken as desired. Remove bay leaves before serving. Serve in warmed soup bowls over steamed white rice. Place a heavy, iron Dutch oven, (or iron skillet with deep sides) over medium heat and heat the oil until just smoking. Whisk in flour, a little at a time and cook, whisking constantly, until roux becomes smooth and thick. Continue to cook, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon and reaching all over bottom of pan, until roux darkens to desired color. Be careful not to produce specs of black. The roux must remain an even color throughout process. If specs appear you must start over. For a Light Brown Roux, cook the mixture, over medium heat for 1 1/2 hours, or until the color of peanut butter. Remove about 1 cup of the light colored roux, cool completely, and set aside for the Delmonico&#39;s Seafood Okra Gumbo. For a Medium Brown Roux, cook the mixture, over medium heat for an additional 30 minutes, or until the color of a copper penny when ready. Remove about 13/4 cups of the medium colored roux, cool completely, and set aside for Emeril&#39;s Country File Gumbo. For a Dark Brown Roux, cook the mixture an additional 35 to 45 minutes. The color should resemble dark chocolate when ready. Remove all of the remaining dark roux from the pan and cool completely. Set aside for the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo.

The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this point you have two options:<br> If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse. This may take from 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of the sponge, the temperature of the room, and the strength of the yeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough. It&#39;s best if you have already weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much. If you&#39;re not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85 to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours)-but don&#39;t let it collapse to much before you use it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58335,&quot;Sweet-and-Sour Shrimp Puffs 3 tablespoons cream cheese spread (from 8-oz. container) 1 teaspoon soy sauce 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 1 can (8 oz.)

Add the tofu and, with a rubber spatula, gently toss it with the marinade. Let sit 30 minutes. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the tablespoon of oil over high heat until it is very hot but not smoking. Add the marinated tofu and spread it out so that it is in one layer. Fry it, shaking the pan often to prevent sticking, until it is a rich golden color all over. With a spatula, flip it over occasionally so it gets evenly browned. Place the tofu in a large bowl. Set the skillet aside. Combine all the ingredients for the dressing in a jar with a tightfitting lid and shake vigorously. Pour half the dressing on the hot tofu and toss well. Chill the tofu until it is very cold, about 2 hours. Meanwhile place the broccoli in the skillet, add a little water, and cover the pan. Cook until it is crisp yet tender, about 4 minutes. Immerse it in a bowl of cold water to stop any further cooking. Drain the broccoli thoroughly, then place it on a cotton or linen kitchen towel and pat it very dry. In a large bowl mix the broccoli, scallions, red pepper with half of the remaining dressing and toss well. Let sit at least 30 minutes to marinate. Just before serving mix in the tofu.

Spray a muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray. Add the goat cheese and dill into a small bowl and mix to combine. Place roughly a teaspoon of olive oil into the bottom of each muffin tin. Add 2 slices of the potato into the bottom of the muffin tin and season with kosher salt. Add a few crumbles of the dill goat cheese, another layer of potato and drizzle of olive oil. Repeat this process with potato, kosher salt, dill goat cheese and olive oil until the muffin tins are filled to the top. Place into the oven and bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes, turning the pan halfway through. Add the golden raisins, white wine vinegar and sugar to a small bowl. Stir to combine, then let steep for 20 minutes to plump the raisins. Drain and set aside. Set up a pot of boiling water and season generously with kosher salt; it should be as salty as the sea. Prepare an ice bath and season generously with kosher salt. Add the haricots verts to the boiling water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bright green and tender, but still slightly crisp. Remove the haricots verts and immediately plunge into the ice bath and set aside. Add the radishes to a large bowl with a large drizzle of olive oil and kosher salt to taste. Spread the radishes onto a sheet tray, arranging them flat side down. Transfer into the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Mix the cumin and fennel pollen in a small bowl. Sprinkle the lamb chops liberally with the seasoning mix (reserving a small amount) and kosher salt on both sides. Heat a large saut pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear the lamb chops, in batches, until browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer the lamb chops onto a sheet tray and place into the oven to finish cooking for 5 to 6 minutes, or until they reach an internal temperature of 135 degrees F for medium-rare. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the smashed garlic to a large high-sided pan. Turn on the heat to medium and swirl the pan to infuse the oil with the garlic. Add the fennel, anchovies, shallot, lemon segments, kalamata olives and kosher salt to taste. Cook for 5 minutes, then remove the garlic. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until the fennel begins to soften. Then add the white wine and cook until reduced by half. Add 1/4 cup of the chicken stock and a pinch of the reserved seasoning mix. Stir to combine, then add the plumped raisins and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup chicken stock and 1 tablespoon of the butter. Swirl to melt, then add the remaining tablespoon butter. Stir in half of the pine nuts. Heat a large saut pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the blanched haricots verts, roasted radishes and kosher salt to taste. Toss to warm through, 2 to 3 minutes. Set up a fryer with vegetable oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry the capers until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Be careful because they will pop in the oil. Remove the capers onto a paper-towel-lined sheet tray. To serve, plate the scalloped potato cakes, followed by the haricots verts and radishes. Lay the lamb chops over the top, and then the sauce.

Fold the right side of the dough over one-third of the way to the center, and do the same with the left side to tri-fold the dough. Roll the dough back out to a 6-by-10-inch rectangle about 3/8 inch thick. Using a 3-inch donut cutter or 3-inch round cutter with a 1-inch round hole, cut out 4 donut shapes from the dough. Pour enough oil in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven to come 3 inches up the sides. Heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 340 degrees F. Fry the donuts in batches until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Drain on a wire rack-lined baking sheet. In a small bowl, mix together the Dijon mustard and honey until well combined. Use a pastry brush to brush the tops of the donuts with the honey mustard and sprinkle with the chopped bacon.

Lightly butter 2 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment. Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl and set aside. Bring 1 1/4 cups water and the milk to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat and keep warm. Beat the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add the sugar, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add the cocoa and vanilla, and beat at medium speed for 1 minute. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add the eggs, one at a time, and beat for 1 minute between each addition. Reduce the mixer to low and beat in the flour in four additions. Carefully pour the hot milk mixture into the batter. Use a rubber spatula to stir until smooth. Evenly divide batter between the prepared pans and lightly tap the pans on the counter. Bake until the cakes begin to pull away from sides of the pan and the centers spring back to the touch, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert onto the rack and cool completely. For the frosting: Bring about 1-inch of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Put the milk and semisweet chocolates in a heatproof bowl that sits comfortably in the saucepan without touching the water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate completely melts and is smooth. Let cool slightly and then stir in the sour cream, coffee and vanilla until smooth. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until the frosting is silky and fluffy. (Use the frosting right away as it will become firm as it sits.) Put one cake layer on a serving plate or platter spread about one-third of the frosting all the way to the edge of the cake. Put the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 58350,&quot;Gravad Lax 1 tablespoon fennel seeds 1 tablespoon dill seeds<br> 2 tablespoons black peppercorns<br> 3 tablespoons coriander seeds<br> 1/3 cup kosher salt<br> 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 2 pounds skin-on raw salmon, no bones or belly fat<br> 1 1/2 cups fresh dill, chopped<br> 1 bulb fennel with fronds 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 3 tablespoons grainy mustard 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1 cup fresh dill, chopped<br> 2 ounces rye bread 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 cup baby watercress, for serving<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: For the salmon: Place the salmon in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, skin side down.

Mix carefully into the egg/butter mixture until well combined. Add the quick-cooking oats and mix well again. Add the finely chopped pecans and mix well to combine. Divide the dough in half and place each half of the dough on a sheet of waxed paper. Roll the dough into a log and wrap it tightly in the waxed paper. Now you can either chill or freeze the dough until later, or you can go ahead and slice and bake the dough. When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Slice the dough 3/4-inch-thick, then place on a cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake until they are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool on the cookie sheets. Add the butter to a medium skillet over medium heat. Allow it to melt and bubble up, swirling the pan to keep the butter moving around, for 3 to 4 minutes. When the butter is a medium golden brown, remove the pan from the heat (it will continue browning in the pan over the next 30 seconds or so!).

Bring water to a boil then reduce heat to medium. In 10 minutes or so the water will cook off and the casings will begin to brown and crisp in the oil. Cook until casings are evenly browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. While the franks are working, heat a large skillet over medium high to high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and the apples, onions and cabbage. Sear and toss the cabbage, wilting it down as the mixture cooks. Season the cabbage with nutmeg, cumin and grill seasoning and cook until the cabbage and onions are tender, 15 minutes. Pour in the vinegar. Lean back when you add the vinegar - the fumes can burn your nasal passages a little. (Trust me on this.) Scatter in the brown sugar and toss to combine. Cook the vinegar off, 1 minute, and allow the sugar to coat the cabbage evenly. Taste to adjust seasonings.

Add the chives, thyme, salt and pepper, whisking together. Next, in a nonstick omelet pan over medium-high heat, add the oil and allow the pan to heat until hot. Turn the heat off, add the spinach and toss: This step should be done quickly, being careful not overcook or wilt the spinach. Next, place the same pan over high heat, allow the pan to get hot, reduce the heat to medium, and add the whisked eggs. Once the eggs have been added, continue to cook over medium heat, folding the exterior towards the middle of the pan. This folding and blending will ensure that the eggs cook evenly and do not brown. Once the eggs are almost fully cooked, after 2 to 3 minutes, add the spinach and cheese to the center of the eggs. Then fold one side over the spinach with a spatula and repeat with the other side. Finally, flip the filled omelet over and plate. For the vinaigrette: In a large bowl, whisk together the cl paste, vinegar, salt, and honey until well mixed, 1 minute. Next, slowly pour in the grapeseed oil, whisking constantly to emulsify. Be sure not add the oil too quickly as this will cause the dressing to break. Taste for seasoning.

Place the puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Lightly dust the top of the puff pastry with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll the puff pastry into a rectangle 1/4-inch. Use a 4-inch fluted cutter to cut 8 circles from the puff pastry. Remove the scraps and space the circles 2 inches apart on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Combine the corn syrup and water in a small mixing bowl and mix well. Use a pastry brush to coat the top of each circle a nice, shiny glaze; it will also enhance the flavor of the baked puff pastry. Place the puff pastry circles in the oven until well risen and evenly browned 20 to 25 minutes. To keep the circles from rising unevenly, I place six 3-inch-high timbale molds (one in each corner and two in the center) on the baking sheet with the circles. Then, I place a wire rack on top of the molds. As the puff pastry rises, the rack will keep it level. You can also place another sheet of parchment paper directly on top of the puff pastry circles and bake. The slight weight of the parchment paper will keep the puff pastry even as it bakes and rises.

If using a pizza stone, position it on the center rack in the oven. Flatten and form the pizza dough into a circle and place in an ovenproof nonstick pan. Bake or cook on the grill or put the dough directly on the grill grates over indirect heat. Cook until the dough becomes rigid and slightly golden, about 10 minutes. Remove and set aside. Break up the bacon into small bite-size pieces into a small bowl. Mix in the marinara sauce, sambal and maple syrup. Add the sauce to the partially baked pizza round, then add the cheese, making a bit of a well in the center. Crack and add the eggs to the well. Place back on the grill over the indirect heat or in the oven and cook until the eggs are set, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the grill or oven and season the yolks with fresh black pepper and a pinch of salt.

Meanwhile, combine the pancake mix, cornmeal and egg in a large bowl. Add 3 cups of water and stir until a thick batter forms. The batter should be thick but pourable; thin with a little more water if needed. Pour the batter into a glass tall enough to completely immerse the length of the cheese. Skewer each piece of cheese on a bamboo or wooden chopstick. To fry: In batches of three, dip the skewered cheese into the batter, ensuring each piece is covered completely. Slowly lower the cheese into the hot oil. Very quickly, flip the cheese over so all parts of the batter have a chance to set and begin cooking. Cook, flipping frequently, until golden and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve warm with warm marinara sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58429,&quot;Caipirinha 1 teaspoon raw sugar 1/2 lime, sliced into chunks Crushed ice Cachaca (Brazilian liquor made of sugar cane) Instructions: Add the sugar and limes to a cocktail shaker and smash a few times with a muddler.

Grease a 9 by 13-inch jelly roll pan with softened butter or cooking spray. Beat your butter in the bowl of a stand mixer until it is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the brown and granulated sugars a little bit at a time, pouring them in on the side of the bowl. While you&#39;re adding your sugars, stop the mixer occasionally and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure that everything is fully mixed. Cream the butter and sugar mixture until it is light and fluffy, about 8 minutes. (Creaming creates air pockets in the dough, and therefore these blondies have a light and delicate texture.) Whisk your flour, baking soda and sea salt, if using, in a bowl. (Add the salt only if desired because there is plenty on top of the finished brownies.) Add your eggs 1 at a time, adding the second only after the first is fully incorporated. Once the second egg is fully incorporated, add your vanilla. Turn your mixer down to low speed and slowly add the flour mixture. Once the dry ingredients are fully incorporated into the wet ingredients, add in all those chocolate chips. Your machine will seem to be struggling to mix in the chocolate chips because there are so many of them, but don&#39;t turn it up, leave it on low and allow it to fully mix the chips in. Spread your cookie dough into the prepared jelly roll. Evenly sprinkle the top of the dough with the fleur de sel. Pop the blondies in the oven until they are golden brown on top and not wobbly in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the blondies to cool in the pan on a wire rack or on a dishtowel on your counter. Cut the blondies, still in the pan, with a sharp knife into bars, about 48 pieces. Remove with a spatula and serve.

Spray each cake pan with non-stick cooking spray, line with parchment paper and spray again. Follow directions on cake mix boxes to create 3 cakes of each size, but substitute grape juice for water in cake recipes. Bake each cake as per directions on box or until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Cool cakes in pans on cooling racks and cool completely. After removing cakes from pans and parchment paper, cut each cake in half horizontally and level off tops of each section by slicing thin layer off top. Filling and Frosting Preparations: In a large bowl, combine frosting with a few drops of Champagne extract, stirring well. For each size cake, place bottom layer atop cardboard round of matching diameter. Pipe a ring of lemon frosting around top edges of bottom layer. Fill in center with raspberry jam. Stack next layer of cake atop this and repeat ring of frosting. Fill in center with lemon curd. Stack top layer of cake atop this with smooth edges facing upward. Spread icing over entirety of cake. Repeat this process to create a 14-inch cake, a 10-inch cake, and a 6-inch cake, which will make up finished wedding cake. Stack layered cakes atop one another from largest to smallest. To Assemble: Without removing the cardboard rounds from underneath the cakes, place the 14 inch cake onto serving platter. Cut dowel rods into 5 sections the height of the 14 inch cake, and 5 sections the height of the 10 inch cake. Carefully insert 4 dowel rods around the middle perimeter of the 14-inch cake and 1 in the middle. Stack the 10-inch cake atop the 14-inch cake. Repeat dowel insertion process for the10-inch cake. Stack the 6-inch cake atop the 10-inch cake. Cover up cardboard by piping icing around perimeter base of each cake. Dust mini green grapes liberally with powdered sugar and adorn cakes with them. Further adorn cake with white ribbon.

Cut each rope into 1-inch pieces and gently roll along the tines on the back of a fork to create a ribbed appearance. Cover with a cloth until ready to cook. For the mushrooms: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it begins to foam, add the onions and saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garam masala and stir. Add the mushrooms and continue to saute until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour in the wine and stir and cook until it has reduced slightly. Pour in the cream, stir well and season with salt. Allow to reduce until the cream has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the arugula and let it wilt. Keep warm until ready to serve. To finish the dish: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add some of the gnocchi. Avoid crowding by cooking them in batches. When they float to the surface, remove then with a slotted spoon and drain. Spoon the gnocchi into shallow bowls and ladle some sauce over them. Garnish with shavings of Parmesan and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 58476,&quot;Royal Icing 1 large egg white* 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar 1/2 lemon, juiced and strained How to make a cornet, method follows Instructions: To make royal icing: Combine the egg white and powdered sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until opaque and shiny, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and continue whipping until completely incorporated, about 3 minutes. The lemon juice whitens the royal icing. The royal icing should be light, fluffy, and slightly stiff. You may need to adjust the consistency by adding more egg whites if the icing is too dry or more powdered sugar if it is too wet. Place the royal icing in a small piping bag or paper cornet. The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations. Cut an 8-by-12-by-14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling Wine]&quot; 58477,&quot;Burned Peach Ice Cream 2 cups half-n-half 1 cup whipping cream 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup peach preserves (not jelly) 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped Pinch kosher salt 4 medium peaches, halved, seeded and grilled or broiled until brown Instructions: Combine all ingredients (including the bean and its pulp) in a large sauce pan and place over medium heat.

Drain and reserve the liquid. When pears are cool, place them in a blender with just enough reserved liquid to make a thick puree. Heat 1/2 cup of the leftover pear liquid in a saucepan. Stir in 1/2 cup of the sugar and cook for about 5 minutes, until the sugar begins to caramelize. Add the pear puree, 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon and cloves, stirring well. Remove from heat and cool. In a small bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Set mixture aside. Prepare dough: In a large bowl, combine the flour with the lard, butter and salt. Mix lightly with your fingertips until the dough forms grapesized pieces. You should still be able to see chunks of fat. Stir in the iced water. Lightly knead, handling dough as little as possible, until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more iced water if necessary. Transfer to a plastic bag and shape into a log. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, and chill 1 hour or as long as 3 days. The dough can be frozen for as long as a week. On a lightly floured board, roll out dough to 1/8inch thickness and cut 4inch circles. Brush the edge of each circle with the beaten egg mixture and place 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center.

Remove to a rack and let cool completely in the pan. Spread the frosting over the top of the cake and sprinkle with the cookies to resemble dirt.<br> For the bunnies and carrots: Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with parchment. Cut the stems off half of the strawberries. Divide the white chocolate evenly between into 2 medium microwave-safe bowls. Add the coconut oil and orange food coloring to one of the bowls. Microwave each separately in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until the chocolate is melted and silky smooth.<br> For the carrots: Dip the strawberries with the stems into the orange chocolate, lifting and twisting to coat completely and letting any excess drip back into the bowl. Place the strawberries on their sides on the prepared baking sheet. Transfer the remaining orange chocolate into a small resealable plastic bag. Snip a very small piece from a corner of the bag and drizzle the chocolate back and forth across the width of each carrot to create horizontal lines.<br> For the bunnies: Dip the stemmed strawberries into the white chocolate, turning them with a fork to coat completely. Use the fork to scoop the fruit out of the chocolate, letting any excess drip back into the bowl. Place on the prepared baking sheet cut-side down. Refrigerate until hardened completely, about 30 minutes. Transfer all but 3 tablespoons of the remaining white chocolate to a small resealable plastic bag. Add the red food coloring to the reserved white chocolate in the bowl and stir until completely smooth and light pink, then transfer to another small resealable plastic bag.<br> For the bunny ears: Snip a very small piece from a corner of the white and pink chocolate bags. Use the white chocolate to pipe 2-inch skinny hearts on the parchment that the strawberries are on. Pipe as many hearts as you have white strawberries. Fill in the hearts with the white chocolate. Pipe a small pink heart on each white heart to create the inner ears. While the chocolate is still wet, lay the pointy end of a white strawberry flat against the bottom point of a heart; this will be the ears on the bunny&#39;s head. Repeat with the remaining white strawberries and hearts. Pipe 2 tiny dots of white chocolate in the middle of each strawberry and adhere the mini chocolate chips for eyes.

Add water to the beans to cover by 2 inches and set over high heat. Bring to a boil for 2 minutes, remove from the heat, cover and let stand 1 hour.* Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the duck sausage on a baking sheet and place it in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and let cool. The sausage will not be fully cooked through. Add the whole onion, whole carrot, 2 of the thyme sprigs and 3 of the bay leaves to the beans. Add more water to the pot to cover again by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and let simmer until the beans are mostly tender but with still a little bite to them, about 50 to 60 minutes. The beans will have soaked up all most all of the liquid you cooked them in. Meanwhile, pour the olive oil into a large skillet and place over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook stirring every now and then until crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon remove the crispy bacon pieces to a paper towel lined plate and reserve. To the same skillet, add the diced onion, sliced carrots and garlic and sweat the mixture for 20 minutes, until the onion begins to turn translucent. Slice the duck sausage on the bias into 1/2-inch thick pieces and add them to the vegetable mix. Add the remaining bay leaves, thyme sprigs and sliced kielbasa and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Next add the wine, beef broth, tomato paste and salt and pepper. Raise the heat to high, bringing the mixture to a boil. Stir well to dissolve the tomato paste and lower the heat. Allow to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the whole onion and carrot from the beans, add the vegetable sausage mixture to the stockpot and return to a low heat. Stir well and cover. Let the cassoulet simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until most of the wine mixture has been absorbed by the beans. Spoon into a casserole dish, sprinkle the top of each serving with some of the reserved crispy bacon and serve with a crusty baguette on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 58498,&quot;Empanada Dough 1/2 cup flour 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon Southwest seasonings 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 1 tablespoon lard 1 cup warm water 1 cup masa harina Instructions: In a mixing bowl combine the masa harina, flour, cornmeal, baking powder, Southwest seasoning, salt, and pepper, mix thoroughly.

Cut the pork into 1-inch cubes and place in a large bowl. Combine the coriander, paprika, cumin and 2 tablespoons salt in a small bowl. Coat the pork with the dry rub. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large Dutch oven. Working in batches, add the pork and cook until browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Saute the onion and garlic in the oil until softened, 6 to 8 minutes, being careful not to burn the garlic. Add the pork back to the pot. Stir in the dried chiles de arbol and cover with the Mexican lager. Bring to a boil and reduce to a rolling simmer. Cook until all the liquid evaporates, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the tomatillos, Anaheim peppers and poblano peppers with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and 1 tablespoon salt on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven, turning once halfway through, until the tomatillos have browned and the peppers are charred, about 30 minutes. Let cool, about 25 minutes. When cool enough to handle, place the tomatillos in a blender. Remove the skin and stems from the peppers (keeping the seeds intact) and add them to the blender with the tomatillos. Add the cilantro, lime juice and 2 teaspoons salt. Blend until completely smooth. Hold the sauce at room temperature until the pork finishes cooking. When the liquid from the Dutch oven has reduced completely, check the pork to make sure it is tender but still holds its shape. Remove and discard the chiles de arbol. Top the pork with the tomatillo sauce and cook over medium heat just until it begins to simmer, about 10 minutes. Serve the chili verde with roasted pepitas, tortilla chips, Pickled Red Onions and Fresno Chiles, crema and cilantro leaves. Combine the vinegar, lime juice, orange juice, sugar and 2 teaspoons salt in a small saucepan. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Pour the hot mixture over the Fresno chiles and onions in a heat-proof bowl and allow to cool at least 10 minutes before serving, or allow to cool completely and refrigerate until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 58500,&quot;Filet of Beef Roasted with Coffee Beans, Pasilla cl Broth and Creamy White Grits with Greens and Wild Mushrooms 2 pound filet of beef (preferably cut from the large end of the whole filet) 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons finely ground coffee beans 1 tablespoon cocoa powder 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon Creamy White Grits with Bitter Greens and Wild Mushrooms, recipe follows Pasilla cl Broth, recipe follows Watercress sprigs, cleaned and rinsed 4 cups water 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 4 cups coarse white grits 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 yellow onion, minced 2 garlic cloves, minced 3/4 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, and caps cut into quarters 4 ounces arugula or other bitter greens, roughly chopped Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 large white onion, roughly chopped (8 ounces) 4 to 8 garlic whole cloves, peeled 2 pasilla chiles (approximately 1/2-ounce), stemmed, seeded, and torn into large pieces 1 thick white corn tortilla (approximately 3/4-ounce) 2 1/2 cups chicken stock 1/4 cup cream 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1 teaspoon brown sugar Instructions: Tie the filet of beef with butcher twine at 1/2-inch intervals. Rub the filet well with salt and pepper. Rub the filet with the olive oil. Combine the ground coffee, cocoa powder and cinnamon and mix well. Spread the mixture over a work surface and roll the filet in the mixture to evenly coat the beef. Allow to marinate approximately 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 Degrees F. Place the filet on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast the filet for 10 minutes. Immediately lower the heat to 250 degrees F. After 20 minutes, check the internal temperature of the filet (125 degrees F for medium rare or 135 degrees F for medium). If further cooking is necessary, return the beef to the oven (still set at 250 degrees F) and slowly roast to the desired temperature. Remove the filet from the oven and keep warm. Before carving, remove the string. Slice the filet into 1/4-inch thick slices. Spoon some of the Creamy White Grits with Bitter Greens and Wild Mushrooms in the center of each dinner plate. Arrange the slices of filet around the grits. Ladle some of the Pasilla cl Broth over the filet. Garnish with watercress sprigs. In a heavy bottomed 2 quart pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the salt. Add the grits while stirring. Bring the water back to a boil. Lower the heat to a very low simmer. Cover the pot but stir every 2 to 3 minutes until the grits are thick. The grits will take approximately 20 minutes to cook. If the grits become to thick, add a little water to adjust the consistency. In a skillet over medium high heat, melt the butter until foaming. Add the chopped onions and garlic. Saute until the onion is translucent. Add the shiitake mushrooms and saute until lightly cooked. Add the greens and briefly saute until wilted. Remove from the heat. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. When the grits are cooked and ready to serve, stir the greens and mushroom mixture into the grits and keep warm. Heat a saucepan over medium high heat. Add the butter and saute the onion and garlic cloves until nicely browned. Add the pieces of pasilla cl and tortilla pieces and slowly saute until the ingredients are golden brown. Lower the heat to medium low if necessary. Add the chicken stock. Bring the stock to a boil, then simmer, lightly covered, for approximately10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Transfer the ingredients to blender and puree for approximately 1 minute or until smooth. Pass the sauce through a sieve to remove any chunky pieces. Add the cream, salt and brown sugar and blend. The sauce should not be too thick. If too thick, add some addition chicken stock or water to correct to a light consistency.

Set aside at room temperature while you prepare the adobo. Set a dry skillet or comal over medium heat. Add the guajillos, allspice, garlic, anchos, moritas, cloves and cinnamon and toast until the chiles are dark in spots and the spices are fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. When cool enough to handle, peel the garlic. Add the toasted chiles to a small saucepan with enough water to cover them by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, pressing on the chiles to submerge them. Remove from the heat, cover and let stand until the chiles are fully softened and pulpy, 15 to 20 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chiles to a blender (discard the soaking water). Add the reserved toasted spices and peeled garlic, broth, vinegar, oregano, thyme, onion and 2 teaspoons salt. Puree until completely smooth. Reserve 1/2 cup adobo in a container and refrigerate. Pour the rest of the adobo all over the lamb until completely coated. Cover the bowl or seal the bag and marinate, refrigerated, for at least 6 hours and up to overnight. When ready to cook, lay out six 12-by-16-inch parchment rectangles. Place a piece of lamb on each and top with a spoonful of reserved adobo and 1 avocado leaf (or 1 bay leaf and 1 mint sprig). Carefully fold each corner of one of the parchment rectangles towards the center, tie it tightly with twine and trim any excess parchment. Repeat with the remaining parchment rectangles. Set up a steamer pot with water in the bottom and a steamer basket above the water level and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once the water is boiling and steam is coming out, place the lamb packets in the steamer basket in a single layer. Cover tightly, lower the heat to medium and steam, checking occasionally to make sure there&#39;s enough water in the bottom, until the lamb is tender and nearly falling apart, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Serve the packets directly on a plate with sliced limes, a side of rice pilaf and warm tortillas. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 58512,&quot;Black and White Angel Food Cake 2 cups sifted superfine sugar (about 1 pound) 1 1/3 cups sifted cake flour (not self-rising) 1 1/2 cups egg whites at room temperature (10 to 12 eggs) 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup coarsely grated semisweet chocolate 1/2 pound semisweet chocolate chips 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine 1/2 cup of the sugar with the flour and sift them together 4 times. Set aside. Place the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on high speed until the eggs form medium-firm peaks, about 1 minute. With the mixer on medium speed, add the remaining 1 1/2 cups of sugar by sprinkling it over the beaten egg whites. Beat on high speed for a few minutes until thick and shiny. Add the vanilla and continue to whisk until very thick, about 1 more minute. Scrape the beaten egg whites into a large bowl. Sift 1/4 of the flour mixture over the egg whites and fold it very carefully into the batter with a rubber spatula. Continue adding the flour in 3 equal additions, sifting and folding until it&#39;s all incorporated. Fold in the grated chocolate. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, smooth the top, and bake it for 35 to 45 minutes, until it springs back to the touch.

Thinly slice the 2 remaining sun-dried tomatoes. Gently toss them with the tuna, olives, roasted red peppers, the 2 remaining tablespoons oil, red pepper flakes and a few grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl, breaking up the tuna slightly. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. Brush one side of the pitas with oil, lay the oiled side on the griddle and cook until lightly charred in spots, about 1 minute. Transfer, charred-side up, to serving plates. Spread some of the bean mixture on each pita, and top with some of the tuna-olive salad. Drizzle each with oil, and sprinkle with black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 58519,&quot;Grilled Soft-Shell Crabs 6 to 8 soft-shell crabs Lemon Butter Sauce, recipe follows Sliced tomatoes Mozzarella cheese 1 pound butter 8 to 10 lemons, juiced 1 tablespoon cajun seasoning 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon minced garlic Salt Instructions: Clean crabs by removing gills and cutting off the eyes and mouth. Place crabs on pan or aluminum foil. Place on grill over a low fire. Baste the crabs with the Lemon Butter Sauce. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Continue to baste during cooking.

Allow to simmer for about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58520,&quot;Sweet Potato\u2013Sage Country Bread 4 1/4 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 1 3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 1/3 cups warm water (100 degrees F to 110 degrees F) 1 medium-large sweet potato (12 ounces) 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl 2 1/2 teaspoons plus a pinch of kosher salt 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage 1 teaspoon sugar Cornmeal, for dusting Instructions: Mix 1 cup bread flour, 1/4 teaspoon yeast and 2/3 cup warm water in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until it rises and looks very bubbly, 2 hours. Meanwhile, prick the sweet potato in a few places with a knife and microwave until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly. Peel the potato and transfer to a food processor along with the olive oil and pinch of salt; puree until very smooth. (You should have about 1 cup puree; if you have more than 1 cup, reserve the extra for another use.) Stir the yeast mixture with a spoon to deflate it, then add the remaining 2/3 cup warm water and 1 1/2 teaspoons yeast and stir. Add 2 1/2 more cups bread flour, the sage, sugar and remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons salt; mix until the dough is shaggy and there is no dry flour in the bowl. Let stand until the flour absorbs some of the liquid, 5 minutes. Put the remaining 3/4 cup flour in a small dish for kneading. Lightly dust a work surface with some of the flour and turn out the dough onto the surface. Lightly flour the top of the dough. Knead the dough, adding a little bit of the flour as needed, until very smooth, elastic and a little tacky, about 5 minutes. (Alternatively, you can knead the dough in a stand mixer with the dough hook on medium speed for about 5 minutes.) Generously flour the surface under the dough, then pat the dough into a rough square. Top with about half of the sweet potato puree. Pull and fold the edges of the dough over the puree and then begin to knead together (it will get messy at first but the dough will come together). Add more flour as needed to knead and swirl the puree into the dough, about 1 minute (use a dough scraper or butter knife to scrape up any puree that comes out and add it back to the dough). Pat the dough flat and add the remaining puree. Keep kneading the dough, using the remaining flour, until the puree is mixed in but not fully blended and the dough comes back into a ball, 2 to 5 minutes (it\u2019s OK if the surface is a little rough). Put smooth-side up in a lightly oiled large bowl, turning to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Gently turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently press the dough to deflate it. Stretch and pull the edges into the middle of the dough, starting with two sides, then two other sides; repeat until the dough looks like a round. Using a bench scraper, turn over the dough onto a spot with little to no flour. Cup your hands around the dough and gently pull the dough toward you about 1 inch. Rotate the dough a bit and gently pull toward you again. Continue with five to seven pulls. The dough should sit a bit taller than before and the top should feel taut. Line a large bowl with a clean towel and dust with flour. Add the dough seam-side up, dust with flour, then cover with plastic wrap. Set aside until it\u2019s puffy and rises by about 50 percent, about 1 hour. (If the temperature is higher than 75? F, let rise in the refrigerator.) Place a large Dutch oven on the middle oven rack; preheat to 450? F. Uncover the dough and brush off any excess flour from the bottom. Dust the top with cornmeal. Put a piece of parchment against the dough and then carefully flip it out onto the parchment. Trim the parchment so it fits inside the Dutch oven, leaving enough parchment around the dough for you to lift it. Carefully remove the Dutch oven from the oven and transfer the dough to the hot pot using the excess parchment. Cut a long slash in the top of the dough with a sharp knife, about 1/4 inch deep. Cover the pot and bake the bread 15 minutes. Uncover and bake until the bread is golden brown and feels hard and hollow when tapped, 15 to 20 more minutes. Let the bread cool in the pot, 5 to 10 minutes. Using a large metal spatula, transfer the bread to a rack to cool, at least 1 hour; the crust will soften slightly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58521,&quot;Lemon Coconut Roulade 2 eggs 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 3 to 4 lemons) 1/2 lemon, zest finely grated 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, slightly softened at room temperature 1/2 cup cream 3 eggs 1 yolk 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 cup shredded sweetened coconut 2 tablespoons clarified butter 1/2 cup raspberry jam (optional) 1/2 cup cream 1 tablespoon sugar Candied violets or rose petals Instructions: Make the Lemon Curd: Pour enough water into a saucepan to reach a depth of 2 inches and bring to a boil.<br> In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the eggs and sugar together until very light yellow and fluffy. Mix in the lemon juice and lemon zest. Rest the mixing bowl on the saucepan, with the bowl&#39;s base resting above ? not in ? the simmering water (pour out some water, if necessary). Cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is thickened and custard-y, about 10 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, half fill a large bowl with ice and cover with cold water. Remove the bowl of lemon curd from the hot water and whisk in the butter until melted. Rest the bottom of the bowl in the ice bath and let cool, folding the mixture occasionally to cool and thicken it.<br> In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the cream until stiff. Fold it into the cooled lemon custard. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. (The recipe can be made to this point and kept refrigerated up to 3 days in advance.) Make the Cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Butter the jelly roll pan and line it with parchment paper. Butter the paper to assure release. Have some water simmering in a saucepan. Place the eggs, yolk, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of a standing mixer (don&#39;t attach it to the mixer yet) and whisk briefly. Set the bowl over the simmering water and stir the mixture until warm and sugar looks dissolved. Attach the bowl to the mixer and whip until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, sift together the flour and baking powder 3 times. Sift it over the whipped egg mixture while folding it in; then fold in the coconut. Drizzle in the clarified butter, while folding the batter.<br> Immediately pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake until lightly browned and starting to pull away from the edges of the pan, about 14 to 16 minutes. Let the cake rest in the pan 1 minute. Run a knife along the edge to release the cake; then flip it out onto a tea towel or parchment paper. Brush the paper lining with water and let soak 2 minutes before peeling it off the cake. Trim dry edges from the cake. Roll the cake up tightly with the towel, rolling away from you; then cool seam-side down on a rack. Carefully unroll the cake and spread it with a thin layer of jam, followed by the lemon curd filling, leaving 1/2 inch empty at the far edge. Tightly re-roll the cake and place on a platter seam-side down. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar.<br> Whip the remaining 1/2 cup cream with the sugar until very stiff. Keep chilled. Using a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, pipe the whipped cream into rosettes down the center of the roulade. Place a candied violet on each rosette. Serve in 1-inch thick slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58522,&quot;The Best Gravy 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion or leek, thinly sliced Neck and giblets from your turkey (discard the liver) 8 cups low-sodium turkey or chicken broth Several sprigs thyme, parsley, rosemary and/or sage 1 bay leaf Turkey drippings (from the roasting pan) 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Dash of Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and turkey neck and giblets; cook, stirring, until browned, about 15 minutes. Add the broth, herb sprigs and bay leaf; cover and simmer about 2 hours (do this while the turkey roasts). Once your turkey is done, transfer it to a cutting board to rest and pour the pan drippings into a large fat separator cup. Strain the broth; save the giblets for chunky gravy, if desired. Put the roasting pan on the stovetop over low heat. Add a splash of the broth to the pan and scrape up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Transfer the liquid and bits to the fat separator. The fat will rise to the top of the degreasing cup. Spoon off 1/2 cup fat and transfer to a saucepan. (If you don&#39;t have enough turkey fat, add butter to measure 1/2 cup total.) Scatter in the flour and whisk to incorporate. Cook over medium heat, stirring in a figure-eight motion with a wooden spoon, until the flour mixture browns slightly, about 4 minutes. Gradually ladle the hot broth into the flour mixture, whisking constantly (this is key, or your gravy will be lumpy). Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the gravy simmers gently. Add the remaining turkey drippings to the gravy, leaving any extra fat behind in the fat separator. Simmer, whisking occasionally, until the gravy thickens, about 10 minutes. Add the Worcestershire sauce and season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58523,&quot;Cheesy Chicken with Kale Pasta Kosher salt 1 cup small pasta, such as farfalline (about 4 ounces) 4 small skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 6 ounces each) Freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 jarred roasted red peppers, halved 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano 3 ounces part-skim mozzarella, thinly sliced into 4 pieces 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 small bunch kale, stems removed, leaves chopped (8 cups) 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs; drain and set aside. Meanwhile, season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-highheat. Add the chicken and cook until golden and cooked through, 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet. Add the red peppers and oregano to the skillet; cook, flipping the peppers, until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Lay a pepper half on each piece of chicken. Top each with a slice of mozzarella. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil and the garlic to the skillet; cook until softened, 1 minute. Add the kale and cook until slightly wilted, 2 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a boil; cook until the kale is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the pasta and parmesan; season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing, until warmed through. Transfer the chicken to the broiler and broil until the cheese melts, about 1 minute. Serve with the kale pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 58524,&quot;Avocado Ice Cream 12 ounces avocado meat, approximately 3 small to medium 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup heavy cream Instructions: Peel and pit the avocados. Add the avocados, lemon juice, milk, and sugar to a blender and puree. Transfer the mixture to a medium mixing bowl, add the heavy cream and whisk to combine. Place the mixture into the refrigerator and chill until it reaches 40 degrees F or below, approximately 4 to 6 hours. Process the mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer&#39;s directions. However, this mixture sets up very fast, so count on it taking only 5 to 10 minutes to process. For soft ice cream, serve immediately. If desired, place in freezer for 3 to 4 hours for firmer texture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 58525,&quot;Bite-Size Antipast-Salad 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper 1/2 pound piece of sharp provolone, cut into pieces or crumbled into large pieces (sharp cheese like this can break up really easily) 1/2 pound bocconcini, bite sized pieces of mozzarella, plain or marinated, drained then halved with knife or kitchen scissors 2 whole roasted red peppers, drained and cut into pieces with knife or scissors 2 carrots, chopped 2 celery ribs, chopped 1 (14-ounce) can artichoke hearts in water, drained and quartered 24 slices pepperoni 1/3 pound deli sliced Genoa salami (not so thin on the cut) chopped with knife or scissors into bite size pieces 1 cup pitted fancy black and/or green pitted olives, like kalamata and Sicilian olives, located in bulk bins near the deli counter in your market 1/2 pint grape tomatoes, cut a few in 1/2 and leave a bunch whole 1 heart of romaine lettuce, cut into bite sized pieces with a knife or scissors 15 basil leaves, torn or snipped into slivers Instructions: Pour vinegar into bowl and whisk in extra-virgin olive oil and salt and pepper.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Toss the carrots with the olive oil; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Spread the carrots and sausages on the hot baking sheet and roast, tossing halfway through, until the carrots are tender and the sausages are browned, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, eggs, milk and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until smooth. Set a large-holed metal colander over the pot of boiling water (the colander should not touch the water). Add the batter to the colander and scrape with a rubber spatula, allowing small pieces to fall into the water. Simmer until the spaetzle floats to the top and is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and shake off the excess liquid. Melt the butter with the mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, a pinch of pepper and the nutmeg in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the spaetzle and cook, tossing, until lightly browned and crisp, about 2 minutes. Add the dill and toss to coat. Serve the sausages and carrots with the spaetzle. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 58529,&quot;No-Bake Cookie Dough Snowmen 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons plain yogurt 1/2 teaspoon alcohol-free vanilla extract 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons mini semisweet chocolate chips 2 1/2 cups white melting wafers 4 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil 14 medium nonpareils 14 chocolate-covered caramels, such as Rolos 7 orange jelly beans, halved crosswise 7 red or green striped sour gummy belt candies, halved lengthwise 1/4 teaspoon black gel food coloring Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment. Microwave the flour in a small microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute. Stir well, then microwave again until the temperature reaches 180 degrees F, about 1 minute more (see Cook&#39;s Note). Sift into a medium bowl, then whisk in the salt; set aside. Beat the brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, yogurt and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until well combined, about 2 minutes. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until well incorporated. (If needed, turn off the mixer and use your hands to help combine.) Fold in 1/3 cup of the chocolate chips with a rubber spatula, or mix them in with your hands. Scoop fourteen 1-tablespoon portions of dough and roll into smooth balls; scoop fourteen 1-teaspoon portions of dough and repeat. Put the balls on the prepared baking sheet and freeze until chilled, about 20 minutes. To make the coating, microwave the melting wafers and 4 teaspoons of the coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until melted. (Alternatively, melt in a double boiler.)<br> One at a time, drop the chilled balls into the coating and roll around with a fork to fully coat. Remove each ball with the fork, letting any excess coating drip off, and return to the baking sheet. Fill in any holes with extra coating.<br> To make the hats, put the nonpareils on a work surface white-side up. Dip the narrow end of the chocolate caramels into the coating and place one on each nonpareil. Put the hats on the baking sheet with the balls and refrigerate until the coating is set, about 5 minutes. Trim any excess coating around the balls with a paring knife. To make heads, dip the flat part of the small balls in the coating and stack one on top of each large ball. To make noses, dip the flat end of the jelly bean pieces in the coating and press one into the center of each head. Dip the bottoms of the hats in the remaining coating and attach one to each head. Refrigerate until the coating is set, about 5 minutes. Tie a sour belt strip around the neck of each snowman.

Add the leeks and garlic and cook until leeks begin to soften, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cabbage, vinegar, soy sauce, and ginger and cook, stirring, until cabbage is soft, about 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from the heat and stir in the carrot. Allow the filling to cool. Transfer cabbage mixture to a mixing bowl and work together until fully incorporated. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. To make the potstickers, lay a wonton wrapper on the work surface and put about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center. Dip your finger in a little water and wet the edges of the wonton wrapper; this will help the potsticker seal when cooking. Bring the outside edges of the wonton wrapper together over the filling and press it together to form a pouch. Continue with the remaining wrappers and filling. To cook the potstickers, heat the remaining oil in a very large skillet over high heat. Place all of the potstickers upright in the pan and cook, without disturbing them, until browned on the bottom, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water to the pan and immediately cover. Allow the potstickers to steam for about 3 minutes, then remove the skillet lid. Continue cooking until the water is completely evaporated. Transfer to a platter and serve with the dipping sauce.

Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 mins. Drain. Meanwhile, bring the lentils and 3 cups water to a boil in a pot. Cook until the lentils are tender but not disintegrating, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain. Place the potatoes in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix until mashed with no lumps. Add the berbere, tomato paste, onion powder, garlic powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Continue to mix until combined. Check the dough for consistency; it should be moist and pliable but not wet. To test, roll a bit of dough between your palms: If it crumbles, add some vegetable oil until it holds together. If it&#39;s sticky and clings to your hands, add instant potato flakes until it holds together. Finally, taste for salt. The filling should be slightly saltier than you prefer so that the flavor stands up to the dough. To assemble the pierogi: On a well-floured surface, roll out a ball of Vegan Pierogi Dough the size of a large orange into a rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Cut out 3-inch rounds of dough (a pint glass will do). Place 2 tablespoons of filling into the center of each round and fold the rounds in half. Take care to make sure all the air pockets are pressed out of the pierogi. Crimp the edges with a fork or your fingers. Boil the pierogi for 3 minutes, then brown in a skillet. Serve with caramelized onions and sour cream. Add the flax seeds and 2 cups water to a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. (Keep an eye on the pan: Once the mixture starts boiling, it will foam up and boil over quickly!) As soon it starts to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Strain the resulting gel through a nut-milk bag or fine-mesh sieve. Discard the seeds and refrigerate the gel until cool. Mix the instant mashed potatoes with 1/2 cup water and let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour, water, baking powder, salt, 1 cup flax gel and 3/4 cup of the instant potatoes to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on low speed until the dough is smooth, elastic and slightly tacky, about 8 minutes. Turn the dough out into a bowl and cover with a clean, damp kitchen towel. Let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58544,&quot;Raspberry Fool 2 pints raspberries (hold 6 raspberries back for topping) 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 3 tablespoons raspberry liqueur<br> 2 cups (1 pint) heavy cream<br> 1/4 cup powdered sugar<br> 6 ladyfingers 6 sprigs fresh mint, to decorate Instructions: Add the raspberries to a bowl, sprinkle over the granulated sugar and raspberry liqueur and let steep 10 minutes.

Add the butter, and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Sprinkle in 2 tablespoons of the ice water, and pulse until the dough begins to come together. Pinch the dough with your fingers; if it doesn&#39;t hold together, add up to 2 teaspoons more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time, pulsing and checking the dough after each addition. Wrap the dough tightly, and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or preferably overnight. Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 375 degrees F. Roll the dough into a disc 11 to 12 inches wide on a lightly floured surface. Sandwich the dough between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Lay the dough in an 8-inch pie pan so it extends about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Fold the outer edge of the dough up under itself, and crimp decoratively between your index finger and forefinger. Poke the dough all over with a fork, and refrigerate for 10 minutes more. Line the pie crust with parchment or foil, fill with pie weights or beans and bake until the dough appears dry to the touch, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights, and continue cooking the crust until it&#39;s light brown and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes more. Let the crust cool completely on a wire rack. For the filling: Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Whisk the heavy cream, granulated sugar, yolks, egg, bourbon, zest, cherry juice and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Place the cooled crust on a rimmed baking sheet, and pour the custard into the crust. To avoid overbrowning, cut 2 strips of aluminum foil to wrap over the crust edges. Carefully transfer the pie to the oven, and bake until the custard is set but still has a slight jiggle, 50 to 60 minutes. Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack, about 4 hours. If serving the next day, let cool completely, then wrap and refrigerate overnight. For the bourbon whipped cream: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar and bourbon in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Add the heavy cream, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until firm peaks form, about 1 minute. Put six 2-tablespoon dollops of the whipped cream around the pie, and top each with a cherry. Twist the orange slices, and place them in between the whipped cream dollops. Serve the pie with the remaining whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58549,&quot;Strawberries Filled with \Clotted\ Cream 1 cup mascarpone cheese 1/2 cup heavy cream, very cold 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped 16 large fresh strawberries Instructions: Combine the mascarpone, heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract and vanilla seeds in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip until soft peaks form.

Let this set for about 30 minutes until the Elastack hardens.<br> When the molds are complete, gently remove the molded item. Now you are ready to fill the cavity with either white or dark chocolate. I used white chocolate for the taxi, plate, phantom mask and 1 of the drama masks. I used dark chocolate for the other drama mask. Use a ladle or spoon to fill the mold with chocolate. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. When the chocolate sets, carefully remove the chocolate from the mold by peeling away the molding material. Repeat this process with all of the molds you have made. Make the statue: Use a ladle to fill a mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold.<br> If you want to paint the statue, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to apply color where you are inspired to do so. I also used the copper luster dust to give the statue a realistic look.<br> If you want to paint the plate, use a dry paintbrush to apply the copper luster dust to the face of the plate.<br> Make the dark chocolate apple outline: Use a food safe rubber tube that is 6-feet long and 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Position it on a parchment paper lined flat surface. I used heavy cans of fruits and vegetables to shape the tube into the form of an apple. Place the tempered chocolate in a large pastry bag. Use the bag to fill the tube with chocolate. Prop 1 end up so you can see when the tube is full. When the entire tube is full, seal the ends and allow the chocolate to harden. When the chocolate has set completely, carefully use an X-acto knife to cut through the center of the tube. Carefully peel the tubing from the chocolate.<br> Make the apple stem: Use the same technique as described above to make the apple stem. My finished stem is about 12 inches long.<br> I used vegetable oil to glaze my chocolate apple and stem to give it a nice shine. Use any oil and apply it with a pastry brush.<br> Make a base: Use flexible aluminum strips or very large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 15-inches in diameter. Place it on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. Make a support pole: Roll a piece of 32-inch long piece of parchment paper into a cone that has a bottom diameter of 21/2 inches and tapers to a point. Tape it closed. This piece will support the mold so make sure it is long enough and thick enough to support the centerpiece you are making. Set the cone on end and fill with dark chocolate. When it is full, invert the cone over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Spin the cone so the chocolate inside is evenly coated. Let set. When the chocolate has set, repeat this step a few more times. You want the cone to be quite sturdy as the rest of the centerpiece will rest on this cone. Allow the chocolate cone to set until hard. Remove the parchment paper. Use a hot knife to trim the base of the cone so it is flat. Then use the knife to scar the bottom of the cone and the base. You want to make it somewhat textured so it will form a better seal to the base. Use tempered chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it.<br> Make the theatre tickets: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. If you are using the silkscreen, it will be easier if you cut the ticket after you have transferred the design to it. Melt the dark chocolate over a double boiler. Hold the silkscreen over the chocolate. Use a plastic scraper with a straight edge. Apply about a teaspoon of chocolate to the scraper and gently pull the chocolate across the design. Carefully lift off the silkscreen. It will dry almost immediately. Use the tip of a hot paring knife to cut the ticket with the centered design. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate.<br> Make the signs and logo decorations: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to cut the shape of the decoration you would like to make. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. If you want to paint the chocolate, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to apply color where you are inspired to do so. I made signs for NYFD and NYPD and logos for The Mets and The New York Yankees.<br> If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate, as you are inspired.<br> Assemble: Use tempered chocolate and chocolate cold spray to \glue\ the molded pieces and decorations onto the centerpiece. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 58553,&quot;Campfire S&#39;mores Strawberries Three 1.5-ounce milk chocolate bars, broken into pieces 1 sleeve graham crackers, left in the sleeve 1 quart strawberries, green tops removed, thoroughly dried One 7-ounce container marshmallow crme Instructions: Build a campfire. Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl or pot and set near the fire so it melts but doesn\u2019t scorch, stirring occasionally if needed. Crush the graham crackers by massaging them in their sleeve, being careful not to puncture it. Once the crumbs are a fine as you can get them, open the sleeve along the lengthwise seam and place on a flat surface near the campfire. Skewer a strawberry through the hull so it is firmly on the stick and dip half of the strawberry in the marshmallow crme. Place over the fire and cook until the marshmallow is golden.

Make the ganache: Place the cream in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and use a whisk to mix. The hot cream will melt the chocolate. Continue to whisk until the ganache is smooth. Set aside and allow them to cool. Place the butter, salt, sugar, egg and almond flour in a medium-size mixing bowl. The almond flour will add flavor to the dough. Use an electric mixer set on medium speed to beat the mixture just until combined. Add the cake flour and cocoa powder and mix just until the dough is smooth and holds together, about 30 seconds. Remove the dough from the bowl and pat into a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before using. When you are ready to use the dough, remove it from the refrigerator and give it 4 or 5 quick raps with a rolling pin. This softens the cold butter. Roll the dough to the desired size on a lightly floured work surface. Use a 2-inch plain cutter to cut the tart shells from the dough. Use a 11/2-inch fluted cutter to cut the \gears\ for the top of each tart. Place each tart shell in a flexible mini-pan and use a fork to dock the dough. Place the gear pieces on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Bake each pan of dough for 10 minutes. Assemble the tarts: Place the ganache in a piping bag (no tip). The ganache should be slightly softer than the consistency of toothpaste. Pipe ganache into each tart.

Fit a sheet tray with a wire rack and spray with nonstick cooking spray. In a pie plate or shallow bowl, whisk the eggs, mustard, honey, hot sauce, and salt and pepper, to taste, together until thoroughly combined. Add the panko, salt and pepper, to taste, the paprika, cayenne, and garlic powder to another pie plate and whisk to combine. Dredge the chicken through the wet mixture, then the dry mixture, patting the breading on so it adheres. Arrange on a wire rack lined sheet tray, making sure there is ample space between each piece of chicken. Give the chicken a spritz of the olive cooking spray. This will help brown and crisp up the coating. Put on the upper rack of the oven and bake until the chicken is golden and crisp. The temperature should register 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part of the chicken, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 58575,&quot;Fulton Fish Market Cioppino with Sourdough Croutons 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 shallots, thinly sliced 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 cups dry white wine 1 1/2 pounds red snapper, cut into 2-inch squares 1 1/2 pounds wild striped bass, cut into 2-inch squares 16 large shrimp or head-on prawns 2 cups shrimp stock or vegetable stock 2 cups canned plum tomatoes, pureed 1 tablespoon honey Few dashes hot sauce (recommended: Bobby Flay Hot Sauce) 1 bay leaf 3 sprigs fresh thyme Salt and freshly ground pepper 32 littleneck clams 1 lobster, steamed 3/4 of the way 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter 1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves Sourdough Croutons, recipe follows 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 loaf sourdough, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves Instructions: Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat.

Beat together the vanilla and egg in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed, until the mixture is slightly creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> Reduce the speed to low, then slowly pour in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions; increase the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters as needed. Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Shape into a square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. To roll, cut and bake the cookies: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Generously dust a work surface with flour, then roll the dough out into a square just slightly thicker than 1/8 inch. Use a 4-inch champagne flute cookie cutter to cut out 30 cookies, re-rolling the dough scraps as needed. Divide the champagne flutes between the baking sheets. Refrigerate the cookies on the baking sheets until chilled, about 30 minutes.<br> On 10 of the cookies, cut a 1/2-by-1 1/2-inch rectangle out of the top half (the bowl part, not the stem) of the champagne flutes with a sharp paring knife.<br> Bake, rotating the baking sheets from front to back and top to bottom about halfway through baking, until the cookies are golden brown around the edges in spots, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes.<br> For the royal icing and decorations: Meanwhile, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add the vanilla and 5 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed, until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes. Fit 2 pastry bags with 1/16-inch round tips and fill one with half of the white royal icing.<br> Stir in drops of the gold gel food coloring to the remaining royal icing until you achieve a nice golden hue. Thin the icing with water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until the consistency of honey; if you drizzle a little bit of the icing back into the bowl, it should smooth out and sink back into the icing within 8 to 10 seconds. Scoop the gold icing into the second prepared pastry bag.<br> Cut a sheet of parchment into 10 small strips, each about 2 inches by 1/2 inch. Write New Year&#39;s reflections on one side of each strip with a fine-tip pen.<br> Place the 20 cookies without cut-outs on a work surface covered with parchment. Pipe white royal icing around the outer edge of each cookie, following the pattern of the champagne flutes. Fill in the bottom of the stems with white icing and fill the top 1/4 inch of each champagne flute with white icing. Fill the remainder of each champagne flute with the gold royal icing. Pipe 3 small white dots (to mimic bubbles) on the top right or left corner of the gold icing. Allow the cookies to dry completely, 3 to 4 hours. Once the icing is set and completely dry, use the black food color marker to write \Pop Me Open!\ on the gold portion of 10 of the cookies; set aside. Turn the remaining 10 decorated cookies over so the decorated sides are facing down. Pipe white royal icing around the outer edge of each cookie. Place a cookie with a hollow center on top of each iced cookie, making sure the cookie bottoms align as closely as possible. Fill the hollow centers with white and gold decorative sprinkles. Pipe white royal icing around the outer edges of the hollow cookies. Roll the New Year&#39;s reflection notes so the ink side is on the inside and will not touch the cookies. Insert a rolled note into each hollow center and top with the reserved decorated cookies decorated-side up, making sure the cookie bottoms align as closely as possible. (You want to be able to stand the cookies up on their stems when you serve them.) Allow the cookies to set completely, 2 to 3 hours. To serve, fill a small decorated rimmed tray with a thick layer of white sanding sugar. Arrange the cookies so they are standing up in the sugar.

Place the remaining bread slices on top, butter side up and cook on the griddle until golden brown on both sides and the brie has melted. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58594,&quot;Asparagus Soup 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 shallot, minced Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3 bunches pencil asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup thawed, frozen peas or 1 cup shelled fresh English peas (about 1 pound unshelled) 1/4 cup dry white wine 2 cups lightly packed baby spinach Four 1/8-inch slices day-old sourdough bread (about 3 ounces) Olive oil, for drizzling 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper One 3-ounce wedge Parmesan Creme fraiche Finely chopped fresh chives Fresh cilantro leaves Lime wedges Good-quality extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. For the soup: In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, bring the oil to medium heat. Add the shallot and salt and pepper to taste. Sweat until translucent, about 1 minute, being careful not to brown. Add the asparagus to the pot and sweat until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the peas and sweat another minute. Pour in the white wine and deglaze the pot. Add 5 cups water and continue simmering until crisp-tender, another 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Working in batches (and carefully as the liquid will be hot), puree the soup until smooth in a blender. In the last batch, add the baby spinach and puree; this will give the soup a vibrant green color. Strain back into the pot through a fine mesh sieve. Return to a simmer until slightly thickened, 4 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. For the Parmesan breadcrumbs: While the soup simmers, pulse the bread in a food processor until you have very coarse crumbs. Once processed, transfer the breadcrumbs to a medium mixing bowl. Drizzle with a generous amount of olive oil. Toss with the thyme. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Transfer to a parchment-lined sheet tray. Using a grater, finely grate a few tablespoons of Parmesan over the breadcrumbs. Place into the oven and bake until golden and crispy, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. To serve: Ladle the soup into shallow serving bowls. Sprinkle evenly with a few teaspoons of Parmesan breadcrumbs and top with a dollop of creme fraiche. Garnish with chopped chives, cilantro leaves, a squeeze of a lime wedge and a splash of extra-virgin olive oil. Serve immediately.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 58595,&quot;Citrus Pavlova 6 large egg yolks, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup fresh orange juice (2 oranges)<br> 1 tablespoon orange zest<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (1 lemon)<br> 6 large egg whites, at room temperature<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste<br> 4 clementines, peeled and cut into wheels 2 ruby red grapefruit, cut into wheels<br> 1 lime, zested<br> Instructions: For the orange curd: In a medium saucepot, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar together until pale yellow and slightly thickened and the whisk leaves lines behind it. Next, whisk in the orange juice and zest. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, just until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and holds its shape when you drag your finger through it, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the butter until completely combined. Pour the curd into a bowl and let cool to room temperature. If any of the curd got slightly overcooked, put it through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any set egg yolk. Cover the curd with plastic wrap pressed directly to the surface and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. (The curd will hold well for up to 4 days.) For the meringue: Position a rack in the middle of the oven; preheat to 300 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Stir together the cornstarch and lemon juice in a small bowl until the cornstarch completely dissolves. Set aside. Place the egg whites and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on medium-high speed until the egg whites are frothy. With the machine running, slowly stream in the granulated sugar. Increase the speed to high and whip the egg whites until you see ribbons left in the meringue by the whip attachment. Pour in the cornstarch mixture and whip a few seconds more, until stiff peaks form and the meringue becomes very glossy. Mound the meringue in the middle of the baking mat and spread it into a 10-inch round using a small offset spatula -- the shape needn&#39;t be perfect, but make sure to spread the meringue in an even layer. Bake for 10 minutes, then drop the oven temperature down to 200 degrees F. Bake for an additional 45 to 50 minutes. The meringue is done when the top is set and not tacky to the touch, and when a small offset spatula can be slid underneath and come out clean or with very little meringue attached. Turn off the oven, crack the door, and let the meringue sit for an additional 30 minutes. Remove the meringue from the oven; run a large offset spatula around the circumference to release it from the baking mat. Set a serving platter beside the baking sheet and gently slide the meringue onto the platter. Let sit at room temperature until ready to assemble. For the vanilla whipped cream: Combine the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla paste in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment. Beat on high speed until soft peaks form. Refrigerate for up to 30 minutes before serving. To assemble: Spoon the curd into the center of the meringue and spread it in an even layer, leaving a 1-inch border. Spread the whipped cream over the curd. Top decoratively with the clementine and grapefruit wheels. Garnish the entire pavlova with the lime zest and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58596,&quot;Skillet-Fried Oysters 3 tablespoons butter or margarine 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 dozen shucked large raw oysters, drained 2 eggs, beaten 3 cups cracker crumbs 3/4 to 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper Snipped parsley or paprika Lemon wedges Instructions: Heat the butter and oil in a skillet.

Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven. Add the bacon and cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove the bacon to a plate with a slotted spoon. Meanwhile, lay the chicken out on paper towels and pat dry. Liberally sprinkle the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. When the bacon is removed, brown the chicken pieces in batches in a single layer for about 5 minutes, turning to brown evenly. Remove the chicken to the plate with the bacon and continue to brown until all the chicken is done. Set aside. Add the carrots, onions, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper to the pan and cook over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add the Cognac and put the bacon, chicken, and any juices that collected on the plate into the pot. Add the wine, chicken stock, and thyme and bring to a simmer. Cover the pot with a tight fitting lid and place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is just not pink. Remove from the oven and place on top of the stove. Mash 1 tablespoon of butter and the flour together and stir into the stew. Add the frozen onions. In a medium saute pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and cook the mushrooms over medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until browned. Add to the stew. Bring the stew to a simmer and cook for another 10 minutes. Season to taste. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58598,&quot;Almond-Orange Flan for Passover 1 1/4 cups of sugar, divided 1 1/2 cups unsweetened plain almond milk 1/2 cup orange juice 1/2 cup sliced raw almonds 4 large egg yolks 2 large whole eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Zest from 1 large orange<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour 3/4 cups of sugar into round metal flan mold. Place over medium heat and carefully move the pan frequently, without stirring, until it takes on an amber hue. Off heat, swirl the caramel so that the bottom and sides are lightly covered. The caramel will be very hot. Set aside to cool. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, almond milk, orange juice, sliced almonds, egg yolks, eggs, vanilla, salt, and zest to a blender and mix on lowest setting until blended. Carefully pour the custard into prepared mold and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Place the prepared mold in a larger roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan so that it comes halfway up the sides of the mold. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 60 to 75 minutes until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean though it may still appear wobbly. Allow to cool completely inside the water bath then refrigerate covered at least 4 hours or overnight. To un-mold the flan, run a thin knife along the side of mold. Gently shake to loosen. Invert a large plate over the flan and quickly invert the mold in one motion. The flan will gently drop onto the plate and the caramel will flow out so allow extra space around the flan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 58599,&quot;Heinz 57 Pulled Pork 1/2 cup Heinz 57? 1/4 cup Lea &amp; Perrins?

Butter six 3/4-cup souffle dishes or custard cups.<br> Stir the butter and chocolate in a heavy, medium saucepan over low heat until melted. Cool slightly.<br> Whisk the eggs and egg yolks in a large bowl to blend. Whisk in the confectioners&#39; sugar, and then the melted chocolate and the flour. Pour the batter into the prepared dishes, dividing equally. Bake the cakes until the sides are set but the center remains soft and runny, about 11 minutes (or up to 14 minutes for batter that was refrigerated).<br> Run a small knife around the cakes to loosen. Immediately turn the cakes out onto plates. Spoon Raspberry Sauce around the cakes. Top with Vanilla Sweet Cream and Chocolate Truffles. Cook the raspberries, confectioners&#39; sugar and lemon juice over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Strain through a fine sieve to remove any seeds and chill. In chilled bowl, whisk the cream until it begins to foam and thicken. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla and continue to whisk just until soft peaks form. Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Make sure that you have chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once; the shock of the temperature extremes would cause the fat in the chocolate to separate.<br> Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature.<br> When the ganache has cooled to the consistency of a thick paste, scrape it into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe 1-inch-diameter mounds spaced 1-inch apart on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. To pipe the mounds, hold the pastry bag at a slight angle and allow the tip to touch the parchment as you begin to pipe. Once you have formed the mound, stop squeezing and lift the tip straight up, leaving a small tail on the top of each mound. You can also use a spoon and drop small mounds of ganache onto the baking sheet. Let the truffles harden in the refrigerator for 15 minutes, until they are hard enough to roll with your hands.<br> To roll the mound into a ball, place a truffle between both palms, squeeze slightly and roll between your hands. The truffles will look nicer if they are as round as possible.<br> When all the truffles are rolled into balls, they are ready to be coated. If they have become too soft, place them in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours until they are firm enough to coat. Roll in cocoa powder or chopped walnuts, one at a time. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 58618,&quot;Hairy Daddy Longlegs Cupcakes Chocolate cupcake Canned chocolate icing Chocolate sprinkles (hair) 2 pieces eye-type candy (for example, a liquorice dot candy) Clean scissors Ruler 1 package black string lace licorice (legs) Instructions: Frost the cupcake with chocolate icing and cover with sprinkles.

To assemble dough: Heat the milk with the butter and pour it into a large mixing bowl. Add 1/2 cup warm water and the shortening. Add the sugar, salt, egg and yolk. Mix well. Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water with a pinch of sugar. When the yeast is dissolved, add it to the mixing bowl, along with enough of the sifted flour to create a dough that is not easily stirred. Turn dough out on to a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding only as much flour as needed to keep dough from sticking to your hands and work surface. When correct texture has been reached, place dough into the greased bowl. Cover the bowl with greased plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draftfree spot for 2 hours.<br> Note: You will not need all of the flour. Save the remaining flour as your dusting flour when shaping your buns.<br> To rise dough twice: After 2 hours has elapsed, uncover dough and punch it down several times. Turn over in the bowl. Recover bowl and let rise 1 hour more.<br> To set up to bake: Line 2 shallow baking sheets with parchment paper and sprinkle paper with cornmeal.<br> To shape buns: After the second rise has been completed, uncover dough and punch down once more. Turn dough out on to a lightly floured surface. Knead briefly and gently. Divide dough into 10 equal pieces and cover all while you work with one. Shape each piece of dough into a smooth ball by first making it round with your hands. Then pull the dough up, pinching at the top of the dough ball. Keep pulling and pinching up at the top until you have a tight ball. Turn ball on its side on the lightly floured surface. With a pastry cutter, cut ball of dough directly in half through the waist of the ball (not through the pinched end). Take one half and place it on top of the other, meeting the cut sides in the middle. Pinch around the circumference of the circle of dough to seal. Flatten the circle gently, but firmly. Shove the pinched seam gently under the bun as you flatten. Lay the buns on the two prepared baking sheets and cover with kitchen towels. Let rise for 30 minutes. Begin timing the rising period after the last bun has been formed.<br> If topping buns: If you will be topping the buns before baking, immediately after shaping, brush tops of unrisen buns with 1 egg white mixed with 1 teaspoon water. Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds or top with either of the onion toppings listed with the ingredients.<br> To bake: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F for the last fifteen minutes of the rise. Meanwhile melt some butter in a small saucepan. After the rise, uncover buns and brush the tops with melted butter (brush over topping, if using).<br> Bake buns in the center of a preheated 375 F oven until golden, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush once more with melted butter. Remove the buns to wire racks to cool thoroughly before slicing and enjoying.<br> To store: Store cooled buns in a large heavy duty plastic bag. If you want to freeze them, double the bag before placing in the freezer. To thaw, let sit on the counter in its original bags until soft.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58620,&quot;Pan Seared Pistachio Encrusted Scallops over Papaya and Tangerine Risotto with a Triple Pepper Sprout Hash 1 tablespoon olive oil 6 (10/20 or colossal) scallops 1 cup fine and roughly chopped pistachios Salt and freshly ground black pepper Papaya and Tangerine Risotto, recipe follows Triple Pepper Sprout Hash, recipe follows 2 cups vegetable stock 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons butter 1/3 cup diced onion 1 cup arborio rice Pinch diced garlic 1 papaya, peeled and diced 2 tangerines, peeled and diced Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon oil 1 each red, yellow, and green pepper, cored, seeded, and julienned Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup alfalfa sprout Instructions: In a flat-bottomed saute pan, add the oil and heat.

Prepare the artichokes by trimming away all the tough, inedible portions. Cut the trimmed artichokes lengthwise into wedges about 1/2-inch thick. Drop the wedges into the bowl containing the water and lemon juice. If any shelled fava bean is more than 1-inch in length, cut away the thick green skin that sheaths it. Detach the leaves from the lettuce head, discarding any bruised, wilted, or discolored ones. Soak the leaves in two or three changes of water, drain, and shred them fine. You should have approximately 4 cups, but a bit more or less won=t matter too much. If using fresh spring onions, cut off all the green tops and the root ends, then slice them very thin. Choose a saucepan that can subsequently accommodate all the ingredients. Put in the sliced onions, the olive oil, and a large pinch of salt, and turn on the heat to low. Cook the onions, turning them over from time to time, until they have become completely wilted. Drain the artichokes, rinse them in cold water, and put them in the pot, together with the shelled peas, fava beans, and shredded romaine lettuce. Sprinkle liberally with salt and turn over all ingredients several times to coat them well. Put a lid on the pot and cook, always at low heat, turning the contents of the pot over from time to time, until the artichokes, peas, and beans are tender. It may take up to 2 hours, depending on the freshness and youth of the vegetables. Add 1/3 cup water whenever the cooking juices appear to be insufficient to keep the vegetables from sticking to the pot. You should need no more than 2 cups of water all together. Taste and correct for salt, and serve warm, but not piping hot, from a shallow bowl or deep platter. Ahead of time note: You may cook the dish 2 or 3 days in advance, refrigerating it in an airtight container. Reheat gently but thoroughly before serving, adding a tablespoon or two of water if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 58659,&quot;Neely&#39;s Maple Glazed Donuts Vegetable oil, for frying 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 cups sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 egg yolk 1/3 cup buttermilk 3/4 cup canned pumpkin puree 3 tablespoons melted salted butter 1/2 teaspoon almond extract Cinnamon sugar Maple Syrup Glaze, recipe follows 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 teaspoon maple extract 1/2 cup milk Instructions: Preheat oil in a large Dutch oven to 375 degrees F.

Be sure to measure your hearth height and width before cutting the plank. Oil the plank thoroughly with olive oil, rubbing well into the pores of the wood. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. To season the wood, place in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove and allow to cool. Build a roaring fire in your fireplace using 4 to 5 pieces of firewood in order to achieve a large coal bed. Remember that you cook on reflective heat in a fireplace, not the fire itself, so coals are important. Once a coal bed has been established, keep 1 log burning on the back of the fireplace to sustain the coals. Completely scale the fish, leaving the head and tail intact. Remove the gills and rinse the inside cavity. Using a sharp paring knife, cut 3 slits on each side of the fish to the bone. These slits will be used for seasoning and to ensure proper cooking. Rub the fish with olive oil and season inside and out with salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Place chopped herbs in a small mixing bowl and blend thoroughly. Rub herb mixture in each of the 6 slits and on the outside of the fish. Fill the belly cavity with whole mixed herbs. Using heavy butcher&#39;s twine, tie the fish to the board in a criss-cross fashion and tie a knot underneath the board to secure it. The twine will guarantee that the fish stays in place and flat against the board during the baking process. Using a fireplace shovel, remove the hot coals from the right or left side of the fireplace approximately 1 foot from the edge. Place the fish head-side up against the side of the fireplace. Be careful that the plank does not get near an open flame, as the board will ignite. Turn the fish every 30 minutes, first head up and then tail up. The fish will need to cook about 1 hour, depending on heat. Test the flesh for doneness with a kitchen fork. The underside of the fish will cook at the same rate since the plank is picking up the heat of the hearth. Remove from fireplace and serve on the plank for a unique presentation. Cooking Instructions for a Conventional Oven: Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Cure the plank as described above and then follow seasoning instructions for fish. Place the fish lengthwise on the hot plank and place on a cookie sheet to catch any drippings that may run off during cooking. Bake on the center rack of the oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until fish is flaky. There is no need to turn the fish during the cooking process. Remove and serve on the plank for a unique presentation. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 58667,&quot;Sweet Potato Tot Casserole 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound ground beef 2 cups peeled, diced butternut squash 1 medium onion, chopped 1 orange bell pepper, chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 teaspoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt One 8-ounce can tomato sauce 1 cup low-sodium beef stock One 15.5-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 cups shredded yellow Cheddar 1 1/2 pounds frozen sweet potato tots Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Crumble in the beef and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink and begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the squash, onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion begins to wilt, about 4 minutes. Make a space in the center of the skillet and add the garlic, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sizzling, about 1 minute, then stir into the beef and vegetables. Add the tomato sauce, stock and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a simmer then stir in the black beans and vinegar. Simmer, stirring often, until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the Cheddar. Arrange the tots in neat rows on top, spacing them apart so they can crisp. Bake until the tots are crisp on top, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup Cheddar. Bake until the cheese is melted and the filling is bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58668,&quot;Arroz Con Pollo 4 pieces chicken thighs, bone-in, skin on 4 chicken drumsticks Salt and freshly ground black pepper Paprika or smoked sweet paprika 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 cup 2-inch pieces vermicelli pasta Generous pinch saffron threads 2 cups chicken stock 5 ounces thick-cut speck, smoky ham or Serrano ham, diced 1 large onion or 2 medium onions, chopped 2 to 3 ribs celery, chopped 2 bell peppers, 1 red and 1 green 2 cl peppers, red or green, seeded and finely chopped 3 to 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 bay leaf 1 large ripe heirloom or organic beefsteak tomato, cored and chopped 1 slightly mounded cup long grain rice Instructions: Season the chicken liberally with salt, pepper, and paprika, add to a pre-heated large, shallow pot with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil. Once browned, remove the chicken to a plate and drain off the fat. Add butter to the pot and melt. Brown the pasta 2 minutes or until golden, remove to plate and reserve. Place the saffron and chicken stock in a small pot and warm it up to steep the saffron threads. Once the pasta is browned and has been removed from the pot, add the remaining tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan, and brown the ham, about 2 minutes. Add the onions, celery, bell peppers, hot peppers, garlic and bay leaf to the pan. Cook 5 to 6 minutes to soften up a bit, then add the tomatoes, rice. Stir in the pasta and warm saffron stock. Add the chicken and cover the pot, cook 18 minutes, until rice is tender. Serve or cool completely and store for make-ahead meal. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the dish in the oven until heated through. To reheat: Add 1/2 cup stock or water, sprinkled around the pan. If made-ahead and reheated, the rice will become crunchy on top and at the edges, but this can be a plus in the texture of the dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Rioja, Barbera, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 58669,&quot;Herby Provencal Baked Pasta with Sopressata 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes One 28-ounce can whole plum tomatoes, crushed by hand One 15-ounce can whole plum tomatoes, crushed by hand 4 large sprigs fresh basil, plus 1 cup chopped fresh basil 1 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound dried rigatoni 10 ounces frozen artichoke hearts, thawed 1 cup sliced jarred roasted red peppers 1/2 cup halved and thinly sliced sopressata 1/4 cup pitted nicoise or Kalamata olives, coarsely chopped 3 cups shredded mozzarella 1 cup grated Parmesan or ricotta salata Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add both cans of tomatoes and 1 cup of water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat slightly, add the basil sprigs and simmer rapidly, uncovered, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard the basil sprigs and stir in the chopped basil and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Cook the rigatoni in the salted boiling water until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than the package directions. Drain the pasta and transfer it to a large bowl. Add the tomato sauce, artichokes, red peppers, sopressata, olives, half of the mozzarella and half of the Parmesan to the bowl and stir well to combine.

Beat together the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer starting on low and increasing speed, scraping the sides of the bowl down as needed, until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the molasses and vanilla until combined, then beat in the egg. (The mixture will look curdled.) Turn to low speed and beat in the flour mixture, a little at a time, until the mixture comes together, then increase speed and beat until all the ingredients are well incorporated and you have a sticky dough. Divide the dough in half, flatten into 2 discs and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Position 2 racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Keeping the other disc refrigerated, roll 1 disc on a well-floured surface to a thickness of just over 1/8-inch, sprinkling flour on and under the dough as needed and sliding a spatula underneath every so often to prevent sticking. (If the dough looks crackly or breaks apart, press it back together from the outside-edge in.) Dust off the excess flour. Cut out gingerbread people using a 3-inch gingerbread cookie cutter, cutting as close together on the dough as possible. Pull away the extra dough around each cookie and use a small spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets about 1/2 inch apart, placed in 3 rows of 4. Gather together the scraps, leaving behind the excess flour, then knead them a few times to form a smooth dough again. Reroll them in the same way. If the dough gets too sticky, put it back in the refrigerator, wrapped in plastic, for a few minutes. (If there are any pieces of dough stuck to the work surface, scrape them away with a spatula, flour the surface again and then continue to roll the dough.) Freeze the cookies on the baking sheets to firm them, about 5 minutes.<br> While the cookies chill, roll the dough scraps together into a long 1/4-inch rope and cut into 1-inch pieces. Remove the chilled cookies from the freezer and extend the left arm of each man with the 1-inch dough pieces by pressing the dough piece onto the tip of each person&#39;s arm. (This will reinforce them and double their length.) Make sure the gingerbread people are lined up evenly.<br> Wrap eight 12-inch-long and 1/4-inch-diameter wooden dowels tightly with foil (keep them smooth), then spray them liberally with cooking spray. Line up 4 gingerbread people head-to-toe and wrap their left arms around the dowel, so that 4 people can hold one dowel at a time with 1/4 inch of space in between them. Repeat with the remaining groups of 4 and chill the cookies on the baking sheet in the freezer for 15 minutes. Repeat with the second disc of dough on the second baking sheet.<br> Bake the cookies, rotating and switching the position of the baking sheets halfway through, until they are slightly firm to the touch but not browned, 12 to 15 minutes.<br> Cool the cookies 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack and give the dowels a gentle twist to loosen them. Let the cookies cool completely, then slowly slide the cookies off the dowels one at a time, being careful not to break their arms. (The cookies will continue to firm as they cool.)<br> For the icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 4 tablespoons water and beat with a hand mixer on low speed until the frosting thickens and becomes pure white. Separate the icing into bowls and color as desired.<br> Put the icing into piping bags or resealable plastic bags and snip the corners to the desired size. Use the icing to decorate the cookies, then allow to dry, about 1 hour.<br> Carefully slide the candy canes in place, with the hook facing behind each head, and pipe a small amount of icing in the holes to lock them in place.

Remove lid and pull out insides of bread from both base and lid, creating a bread ?shell?. (Reserve pulled-out bread for breadcrumbs or to feed the birds!). Spread about 2/3 of the pesto sauce over the inside of the bread base, covering as evenly as possible. Spread the remaining pesto on the underside of the bread lid. Layer 1/3 of the sliced meat in the bottom of the bread base, tucking it into the sides. Top with 1/2 of the sliced cheese, then 1/2 of the peppers, then half the tomato slices. Repeat layers, ending with the final 1/3 of the meat on top. Be sure to tuck meat, cheese, and vegetables into the sides of the bread base as well as in the center. Replace the bread lid so it lines up with the cut marks. Wrap the sandwich in plastic or a bandana, sealing tightly so it holds together. To serve, cut the sandwich into 4 wedges with a sharp knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 58676,&quot;Mojito Champagne Cocktail 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves, plus more for garnish 2 to 3 tablespoons sugar 1 lime, cut into wedges 1 cup rum 1 bottle very cold cava</p><p>Instructions: Put the mint, sugar and lime wedges into a small pitcher and muddle together.

Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Prepare the cake mix as directed; pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, combine the butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer). Mix on medium-high speed until combined and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until fluffy and combined, about 2 minutes.<br> Crumble the cake into a large bowl. Add 1/4 cup of the frosting and mix with your hands until smooth and combined.<br> Line a 15 1/2-by-10 1/2-inch jelly roll pan with plastic wrap. Put the cake \dough\ on top. Cover with another sheet of plastic wrap and pat the mixture into an even rectangle that fills the pan. Transfer the mixture in the plastic to a work surface (the shorter side facing you) and roll out just enough so that the surface is smooth. This helps make the dough even and not patchy. Press the flat side of a ruler against all the sides of the dough so they are straight. The dough should be about 10-by-15 inches.<br> Put the freeze-dried strawberries in a spice grinder and pulse until finely ground. Add to the bowl with the remaining frosting and beat until combined.<br> Remove the top sheet of plastic wrap from the dough. Add the strawberry frosting and spread out evenly with a small offset spatula, leaving about a 1 1/2 inch border on the short side furthest away from you.<br> Roll the dough away from you into a jelly roll shape, using the plastic to roll tightly until it&#39;s covered by the plastic. Place it on a baking sheet. Freeze while you make the chocolate coating.<br> Combine the dark chocolate and coconut oil in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir until melted and smooth, about 6 minutes. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and set aside until cooled and thickened slightly, about 7 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, unwrap the jelly roll cake and place on a rack set over a baking sheet.<br> Pour the chocolate over the cake until completely covered. Decorate the top with freeze-dried strawberries. Freeze until the chocolate is set, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and cut into slices. Serve chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 58679,&quot;Sopa Seca de Fideos 3 to 4 chiles in adobo 4 garlic cloves, unpeeled 2 1/2 pounds (5 medium-large round, 15 to 17 plum) ripe tomatoes About 1/2 cup vegetable oil 3/4 cup (about 6 ounces) chorizo sausage, casing removed, optional 1 (10-ounce) package dried fideo (vermicelli) noodles, preferably angel hair 1 cup beef or chicken broth 1 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, preferably freshly ground Salt, about a scant teaspoon 2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch dice 1/4 to 1/2 cup thick cream, whipping cream, or creme fraiche, optional 2/3 cup finely grated Mexican queso anejo or Parmesan A few tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro, for garnish Instructions: For dried chiles, toast them on an ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat, turning regularly and pressing flat with a spatula, until very aromatic, about 30 seconds. In a small bowl, cover the chiles with hot water and re-hydrate 30 minutes, stirring frequently to ensure even soaking. Drain and discard the water. (Canned chiles need only be removed from their sauce.) Roast the unpeeled garlic on the griddle or skillet, turning occasionally, until soft, about 15 minutes; cool and peel. Roast 1 1/2 pounds of the tomatoes on a baking sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler until blackened on 1 side, about 6 minutes, then flip and roast the other side. Cool, then peel, collecting all the juices with the tomatoes. In a food processor or blender, process the roasted tomatoes, rehydrated or canned chiles, and garlic to a medium-fine puree. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in medium-size (4-quart) pot (such as a Dutch oven or Mexican cazuela) over medium-high. Add the puree and stir for about 5 minutes as it sears and thickens. Set aside. If using chorizo, cook in a little oil over medium heat, breaking up large lumps as you go, until thoroughly cooked, about 10 minutes. Scoop it out with a slotted spoon, draining as much oil as possible back into the skillet. Pour 6 tablespoons of the remaining oil into the skillet and return to the heat. When quite hot (drop a stray noodle in ? it should sizzle but not brown immediately), lay in about 1/3 of the noodle nests to fry until noticeably browned, about 1 minute, then flip and brown the other side. Remove with a slotted spoon, draining as much oil as possible back into the skillet, and drain on paper towels. Continue until all have been browned. Add the broth, oregano, and pepper to the tomato sauce. Core the remaining 1 pound of tomatoes and chop into 1/4-inch bits. Add and simmer briskly until the sauce thickens to the consistency of a juicy tomato sauce, about 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt. Add the noodles. In about 2 minutes pull the \nests\ apart (they&#39;ll have softened enough to do it at this point), then add the zucchini and the chorizo (if you&#39;re using it). Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender but still firm, about 2 minutes. If using the cream, add it now, raise the heat to medium-high and boil quickly until the sauce returns to its previous consistency. Taste again and readjust the salt, if necessary. Stir in half of the grated cheese, scoop into a warm serving dish, sprinkle on the remaining cheese and the cilantro garnish, and it&#39;s ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 58680,&quot;Vanilla Pudding with Fresh Berries and Gingersnaps 4 1/2 cups whole milk 1 cup sugar 1/3 cup cornstarch Kosher salt 5 large egg yolks, beaten 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 heaping cups of blueberries, raspberries and/or sliced strawberries 3 ounces gingersnap cookies, finely crushed (about 12) Instructions: Heat 4 cups of the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat until steaming. Whisk the sugar, cornstarch and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup milk. Whisk half of the hot milk into the egg mixture until smooth, then gradually whisk the egg-milk mixture into the saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until it has thickened to a puddinglike consistency, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool slightly, stirring a few times to prevent a skin from forming. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding and refrigerate until completely cooled and thickened, about 4 hours. Before serving, whisk the pudding vigorously until smooth and creamy. Gently fold in the berries. Spoon the pudding into six to eight individual cups and top with the crushed gingersnaps. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 58681,&quot;Lime Curd Tart 3/4 cup unsalted butter at room temperature 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour Pinch salt 4 limes at room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/4 pound unsalted butter at room temperature 4 extra-large eggs at room temperature 1/8 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar together until they are just combined. Add the vanilla. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt, then add them to the butter-and-sugar mixture. Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat disk. Press the dough into a 10-inch-round or 9-inch-square false-bottom tart pan, making sure that the finished edge is flat. Chill until firm. Butter 1 side of a square of aluminum foil to fit inside the tart and place it, buttered side down, on the pastry. Fill with beans or rice. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and beans, prick the tart all over with the tines of a fork, and bake again for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool to room temperature. Remove the zest of 4 limes with a vegetable peeler or zester, being careful to avoid the white pith. Squeeze the limes to make 1/2 cup of juice and set the juice aside. Put the zest in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the sugar and process for 2 to 3 minutes, until the zest is very finely minced. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter with the sugar and lime zest. Add-- the eggs, 1 at a time, and then add the lime juice and salt. Mix until combined. Pour the mixture into a 2-quart saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 10 minutes. The lime curd will thicken at about 175 degrees F, or just below a simmer. Remove from the heat and set aside. Fill the tart shell with warm lime curd and allow to set at room temperature. Once set, serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 58682,&quot;White Night Cocktail 2 cups low-fat milk 1 cup Irish cream liqueur, such as Carolans<br> 1/4 cup white chocolate liqueur, such as Godiva<br> 1/4 cup hazelnut liqueur, such as Frangelico<br> Instructions: In a medium pitcher, mix together the milk, Irish cream liqueur, white chocolate liqueur and hazelnut liqueur and chill up to several hours.

Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and the cubed butter. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until it resembles a coarse meal. Stir in the baking powder, salt, sugar and baking soda. Form a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk. Mix with a fork until all of the ingredients are incorporated and the dough begins to come together into a ball. (The dough will be slightly dry.) Dust a clean work surface with flour, coat your palms and rub some on a rolling pin. Turn out the dough onto the work surface. Knead the dough for 1 to 2 minutes, folding it over onto itself each time. Roll out the dough until about 1/2 inch thick. Dip a 3-inch biscuit cutter or the rim of a 3-inch-wide glass in flour and then cut out the biscuits. Reshape the leftover dough into a ball, roll it out again and cut out more biscuits. Repeat until the dough is gone. Place the biscuits on the baking sheet and bake until the tops are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. While the biscuits are still hot, brush with the melted butter. Make the molasses butter: Stir the butter and molasses together to combine. Serve the warm biscuits with the molasses butter.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 58702,&quot;Dry-Rubbed Rib-Eye 3 tablespoons salt* 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 teaspoon pulverized crushed red pepper 2 teaspoons pimenton (Smoked Spanish Paprika) 1 teaspoon garlic powder Oil, for brushing grill 2 (22 to 24-ounce) bone-in rib-eye steaks Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Combine all of the dry ingredients in a bowl. Use your fingers to make sure that all of the ingredients are evenly distributed. Rub the outside of each steak generously with the rub. Wrap each steak in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, 2 to 3 days is better. This will make the steak taste like it has been aged. Preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Brush and oil the grill to loosen and remove any crud. Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 20 to 30 minutes before cooking. Right before cooking remove the plastic wrap and lightly oil the steaks. Place the steaks on a very hot grill to put a char on both sides of the steak. When both sides of the steak have become well charred move the steak to a cooler part of the grill to continue cooking for 6 to 7 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove the steak from the grill and let rest in a warm spot for 7 to 8 minutes. Cut the steak off the bone and slice on the bias across the grain. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 58703,&quot;Prosciutto Wrapped Figs 4 large whole figs (or 16 small mission figs), quartered Goat cheese 1 (3-ounce) package prosciutto 3 tablespoons honey 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until fork tender. Drain the potatoes, saving 1/2 cup of the cooking water for thinning out if needed. Pass the potatoes through a food mill into a large bowl. Add the butter and heavy cream, and fold together with a spatula until combined. Fold in the shredded cheese. If the potatoes get too thick, thin them out with a little of the cooking water. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve garnished with chives and a drizzle of olive oil. For the onion confit: Heat a large enameled cast-iron pot over medium heat. Add the butter; when it begins to foam, add the red onions, marjoram, thyme, bay leaves and sugar, and sprinkle liberally with salt. When the onions begin to caramelize, add the red wine and balsamic vinegar and reduce to dry. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add 1 cup of the beef stock; cook until reduced to a glaze. Repeat until all the beef stock has been used. Turn off the heat and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. For the rib-eye: Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat; add the oil. Pat the steak dry with paper towels, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. When the oil is just below smoking, place the steak into the pan.
