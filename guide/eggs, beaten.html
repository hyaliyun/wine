powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Preheat the fryer to 365 degrees. In a mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, hot sauce, onions, and jalapenos, together. Stir in the eggs and milk. Mix until fully incorporated. Fry 1 tablespoon of the batter at a time. Fry the hushpuppies for 2-3 minutes or until they are golden brown. Stirring constantly will ensure over-all browning. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with Essence. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 16197,&quot;Rossinis 1 pint (2 cups) ripe strawberries, hulled 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar syrup 1 teaspoon Grand Marnier liqueur 6 orange zest strips, for garnish 1 (750-ml) bottle Prosecco, chilled Instructions: Place the strawberries in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and puree until completely smooth. Pour the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve and press to make a seedless puree. Discard the seeds. Add the sugar syrup and Grand Marnier to the puree and refrigerate until very cold. When ready to serve, rub the rim of each Champagne glass with the orange zest. Pour the cold Prosecco into Champagne glasses until they&#39;re each three-quarters full. Carefully stir 2 tablespoons of the puree into each glass and serve very cold.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Cava, Vinho Verde]&quot; 16198,&quot;Lasagne with Bolognese Sauce: Lasagne Alla Bolognese Butter, for the pan 1/2 batch Bolognese Sauce, recipe follows 1 1/2 (9-ounce) boxes no-boil lasagne noodles Besciamella, recipe follows 3/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving 5 tablespoons olive oil 1 red onion, medium chop 3 carrots, medium chop 3 celery stalks, medium chop 5 ounces pancetta, cut into small cubes 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and chopped 1 pound ground beef 1 pound ground pork 1 pound ground veal 1 cup red wine 3 (28-ounce) cans pelati tomatoes* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup whole milk 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 4 1/2 cups whole milk Pinch freshly grated nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter the lasagne pan well and add a very thin layer of meat sauce. Add the first layer of lasagne noodles and in order, cover with meat sauce, about 3 ladles besciamella, and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Repeat the same process until you reach the top of the dish. Make sure the lasagne noodles are soaking into the sauce. When done layering the ingredients, top the lasagne with a final ladle of meat sauce and some besciamella, add a few thin slices of butter and finish with some grated Parmesan. Bake for about 30 minutes. Heat a broiler. When your fantastic lasagne alla bolognese is cooked, give it a nice crisp top by broiling it for about 5 minutes. Always serve this dish with extra-virgin olive oil and some grated parmesan, to taste. Saute the onion, carrots, and celery in about 5 tablespoons olive oil in a large rondeau until soft. Add the pancetta to the soffritto (onion mixture). Cook on a medium-high flame for about 7 to 10 minutes, then add the meat; break it up well with a wooden spoon. Cook&#39;s Note: You can jack up the heat a bit, and keep stirring until all the ground meat is browned. Add the red pepper flakes and the parsley and cook for just 1 minute. Add the wine now and cook until the alcohol is completely evaporated, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.<br> Pulse the tomatoes smooth in a food processor and add them to the meat, season generously with salt and pepper, lower the flame to medium and cook for about 2 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Finish the sauce by adding the whole milk, stir well and set aside, to cool off.; *Cook&#39;s Note: Pelati tomatoes are whole canned tomatoes. Melt the 1/2 cup butter in a pan over medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon.<br> Warm up the milk and gradually ladle into the pot with the butter-flour mixture, whisking constantly while bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer for about 15 minutes. Season the sauce with freshly grated nutmeg, salt, and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 16199,&quot;Braised Beef Short Ribs in a Pomegranate Barbeque Sauce 1/2 gallon pomegranate juice 1/2 gallon barbeque sauce, your choice Agave nectar 6 oranges, sliced 6 (6-ounce) beef short ribs Instructions: In a saucepan, combine half the barbeque sauce with half the pomegranate juice and add the agave, to taste. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and reduce until thick, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line the bottom of a braising or roasting pan with the orange slices. Brush the reduced sauce onto the short ribs and sear in a saute pan over high heat until the sugars are nice and caramelized. Place the meat into the braising pan with the orange slices. Pour in the remaining barbeque sauce and pomegranate juice and enough water to cover the meat completely. Cover with aluminum foil and cook until the meat is tender and falling off the bone, up to 4 hours, checking often. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 16200,&quot;Smothered Meatloaf 4 cups Potatoes O&#39;Brien (recommended: Ore-Ida) 1 pound lean ground beef 1 1/4 pounds ground pork 1 (5.29-ounce) box Garlic Herb Shake and Bake (recommended: Kraft) 1 (1.1-ounce) envelope Beefy Onion Soup Mix (recommended: Lipton) 1 (4.5-ounce) jar Sliced Mushrooms, drained (recommended: Green Giant) 1 egg 1 (12-ounce) can condensed Cheddar soup, divided 1/2 cup evaporated milk 1 (10-ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup 1 onion, sliced thin 1 (8-ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms Instructions: Place potatoes in the bottom of a 5-quart slow cooker. In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, shake and bake, onion soup mix, sliced jarred mushrooms, and egg. Set aside. In a small bowl, stir together 1/2 cup Cheddar soup and evaporated milk. Add to meat mixture. Using a wooden spoon or clean hands mix thoroughly and form into a loaf. Place in slow cooker on top of the potatoes. Make sure meatloaf does not touch the sides of the slow cooker. Stir together remaining cheddar soup with cream of mushroom soup. Pour over meatloaf. Top with onions and sliced fresh mushrooms. Cover and cook on HIGH setting for 1 hour. Reduce the temperature to LOW setting and cook for an additional 5 to 6 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 16201,&quot;Stuffed Potato Skin Skillet Hash with Fried Eggs 2 russet potatoes Olive oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Homemade Maple Sausage, recipe follows 8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced 1 red bell pepper, diced 1 green bell pepper, diced 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced 4 scallions, white and light green parts, reserving dark green tops for garnish 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter 4 large eggs 1 cup grated mild Cheddar Chive Sour Cream, recipe follows 1 pound ground pork 2 tablespoons maple syrup 2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon granulated onion 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1 cup sour cream 1/4 cup chopped chives Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Microwave the potatoes following your microwave&#39;s instructions until the potatoes are tender to the touch, 5 to 6 minutes. (Alternatively, bake in a 400 degree F oven until tender , about 45 minutes.) Set the potatoes aside to cool until you can handle them. Once cooled, cut the potatoes in half and gently scrape out 1 or 2 tablespoons of flesh, creating a bowl. Place the potato skins flesh-side up on a baking sheet. Drizzle the potatoes liberally with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until golden and crispy, about 10 minutes, and set aside. In a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil and add the Homemade Maple Sausage. Brown the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or potato masher as it cooks. Once the sausage has started to brown, add in the mushrooms. Saute the mushrooms until they have softened and any liquid they release cooks off, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the peppers and the white and light green parts of the scallion to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, add the butter to a large nonstick skillet and place over medium-low heat until the butter melts and begins to foam. Gently crack the eggs into the skillet, being sure to crack them as close to the surface of the pan as possible. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper. For sunny-side up eggs with runny yolks, cook the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes. While the egg cooks, stir the Cheddar into the hash and allow it to begin to melt, 1 to 2 minutes. To assemble, take a heaping spoonful of the Chive Sour Cream and spoon it over the bottom of the potato skin. Divide the sausage mixture evenly among the crisped potato skins. Top each skin with a sunny-side up egg and top with a dollop of the Chive Sour Cream and a sprinkling of scallion greens. Cook&#39;s Note: You can always make this with pre-made sausage. A potato masher is a great tool to break up sausage and insure a great sear. In a large bowl mix the pork, maple syrup, sage, salt, fennel seeds, garlic, onion and red pepper. Cook the sausage however you like - make patties and sear, or crumble and cook in a skillet like hash. Cook&#39;s Notes: You can use all different types of meats and spices to make the sausage your own!

For the crust: Brush a 10-inch springform pan with some of the melted butter. Stir together the remaining butter with the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of the pan. Use the back of a measuring cup or a drinking glass to pack the crust firmly and evenly into the edges of the pan. Bake until browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool completely, then set the pan on top of a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap the foil around the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Place the pan on a baking sheet. For the filling: Beat the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sour cream, and mix until just combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the cream and vanilla extract, and mix until just combined. Beat in the eggs one at time, beating the mixture after the last egg until just combined (take care not to overmix or the cake will turn into a souffle). Pour the filling in to the crust. Bake until the cheesecake is slightly golden and barely set in the middle when the pan is tapped, about 1 hour and 20 minutes (the cake might puff up slightly while in the oven, but that is okay; it will deflate as it cools). Turn off the oven, and leave the cake inside with the door shut for 1 hour. It will continue to set and color slightly in the oven. Run a thin knife or spatula around the cake to release it from the sides (this also helps reduce cracks in the top of the cake as it chills). Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. For the cranberry compote: Stir the sugar, dried cranberries and 1 cup water together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then add the fresh cranberries. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the fresh cranberries have burst and the sauce is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the compote to a heat-safe bowl and let it cool slightly before covering the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerating until it is completely chilled. The cranberry sauce will thicken as it cools. (This can be made up to one day in advance.) For serving: Spread the cranberry compote in an even layer on top of the chilled cheesecake. The cheesecake will sink a bit in the center as it cools so it creates a perfect well for the cranberry compote. Run a thin knife or spatula between the cake and the sides again, then release the sides of the springform pan and remove the ring from the cheesecake base. Set the base on a cake platter, slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 16244,&quot;BBQ Chicken Flatbread 1 cup shredded rotisserie chicken 1/4 cup BBQ sauce<br> 2 store-bought flatbreads<br> 1/2 cup shredded provolone<br> 1/2 small red onion, cut into half-moons<br> 1/4 cup jarred jalapeno slices<br> 1 habanero pepper, thinly sliced<br> 2 tablespoons ranch dressing, or to taste 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Remove the shrimp from the marinade, shake dry and place onto the grill. Cook until slightly charred and pink on the outside, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove the shrimp from the grill and set aside to cool slightly. Slice in half lengthwise and set aside until ready to plate. Grill the bread on both sides until grill marks form, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove the bread from the grill and rub with the whole garlic cloves. Spread about 1 tablespoon of the edamame-goat cheese spread on each crostino. Top with 2 pieces of the shrimp. Garnish with the green portion of the scallions and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 16246,&quot;Mixed Vegetable Inari Sushi 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar 1 cup short-grained sushi rice 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon water 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 medium-small carrot, diced 3 ounces shiitake mushrooms (about 9), stemmed and diced 1/2 teaspoon dark sesame oil 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted 1/2 kirby cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced 1 ounce Japanese yellow pickled daikon (about a 2-inch-long piece), diced 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lime juice 1/4 teaspoon finely grated lime zest 12 prepared deep-fried tofu pockets (inari-age), patted dry on paper towels and opened Daikon radish sprouts, for garnish, optional Ground sasho pepper, as needed (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Whisk the vinegar and sugar together in a small bowl and set aside. Combine the rice, water, and 1 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Wrap the pan&#39;s lid tightly with a small kitchen towel and cover the saucepan. (Make sure the towel&#39;s edges are folded up well away from the heat.) Bring to a boil, lower the heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Remove the rice from the heat (don&#39;t uncover) and set aside for 10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and transfer it to a large bowl. Add the vinegar mixture and toss with the rice, using a wooden spoon. Spread it out on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Fan the rice continuously with a fan or magazine until cooled. Cover the rice with a damp towel. Pour about 1 inch of water into a large saucepan and set up a collapsible steamer inside. Bring the water to boil, put the carrots and mushrooms in the steamer, cover, and steam until tender, about 6 minutes. Transfer the carrots and mushrooms to a large bowl, add the remaining 2 teaspoons salt, sesame oil, and sesame seeds, and stir to combine. Let cool. When the vegetable mixture has cooled, add the cucumber, pickled daikon, lime juice, and lime zest and toss to combine. Add the rice and, using a rubber spatula, lightly mix with the vegetable mixture. Set a small bowl of water beside you. Lightly wet your hands and form the vegetable rice into 12 small football-like shapes. Stuff the rice into the tofu pockets and press the sides together.

Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream. Add sliced mushrooms and let them brown. While the mushrooms begin to cook, cut the peppers in half and pull out the seeds and connective membranes and throw them into your garbage bowl. Cut peppers in quarters lengthwise, then slice across. Cut onion in half and peel it. Cut off ends and cut the half onion in half-again lengthwise, then slice the onions across. Add peppers and onions to mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook veggies another 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often, until the veggies are just tender but still have a little crunch left to them and lots of bright color. Remove veggies from the heat and add 2 tablespoons of cilantro-lime butter. Toss veggies to melt butter then serve. Cut butter into chunks. Place butter in a bowl. Place bowl in microwave and cook on high for 15 seconds. To chop herbs super-fine, hold the tip of your knife on a cutting board and move the back of your knife up and down very fast going over the herbs again and again. Stir in chopped cilantro and lime zest and juice into the butter using a rubber spatula. Transfer the butter onto a large strip of plastic wrap. Gather the ends of the plastic wrap in on 1 hand and use a straight edge, like a small cookie sheet pan, to push the butter back and away from your body making the butter take on a log shape. Gently roll the log wrapped in plastic back and forth on the countertop to evenly round out the shape. Twist up the extra wrap on the ends and place the compound butter log into the freezer to make the butter cold enough to slice again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 16249,&quot;Wasabi-Saki-Tini Powdered wasabi Ice 1 1/4 ounces favorite vodka 1 1/4 ounces sake (if you don&#39;t have access to sake, just add more vodka and pray) Ginger-stuffed olives (take out pimento add pickled ginger) Instructions: Rim a small portion of a chilled martini glass with powdered wasabi.

Season with salt and pepper. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. To make the Tempura Shrimp Maki Roll: Preheat a fryer to 360 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the rice flour, all-purpose flour and salt. Add the club soda until the consistency of pancake batter is achieved. Butterfly the shrimp by slicing lengthwise down the back. Dip the shrimp in the tempura batter and then place in the fryer and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oil to a paper towel-lined plate. On a sushi mat, lay down 1 piece of the nori, shiny side down. Spread the sushi rice on one half of the nori, about 1/4-inch thick. Spread about 1 tablespoon of the sambal aioli over the rice. In the center of the rice, lay down 1/4 cup of the cucumber and a few strip of red bell pepper in a line that reaches from one side of the nori to the other. Top the cucumber with 3 pieces of the tempura shrimp. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the wasabi tobbiko over the shrimp. Roll the sushi up, using the sushi mat. To seal the roll, use a little water along the edge of the nori. Cut the roll into 6 pieces. Repeat this procedure 3 more times to create 4 rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 16258,&quot;Chef 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup spring water Pinch moist yeast or dry yeast 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup spring water 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons 20% bran wheat flour 1/2 cup spring water Instructions: Day 1: Combine the flour, water and yeast in a tall 2 or 3-quart clear plastic container with a lid. Stir well to make a thick, soft dough. The exact consistency of the dough will vary with the brand of flour, but don&#39;t add more flour or water at this point to adjust the texture. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, cover tightly with lid, and let stand in a moderate (about 70 degrees) place for about 24 hours. Day 2: The chef will now have almost doubled in volume. You will see tiny bubbles on the surface, and you might notice a slight musty smell. Add the flour and water to the mixture and stir vigorously to distribute the fresh ingredients and add fresh oxygen to the chef. The texture will still be like a soft dough. You may add a little more flour or water to make this texture, if necessary. Scrape down the sides, cover and place in a moderate (70 degrees), draft-free place for 24 hours. Day 3: The chef will now have the texture of a thick batter. It will have almost doubled in volume and be quite bubbly. Taste it! It will have a pronounced musty, but not bitter, flavor. The scent will be aggressively vinegary -- that&#39;s fine.<br> Hold the container and notice the network of tiny bubbles throughout the chef. Add the flour and water, and stir well to make a thick batter. (You may have to add a little more water if your flour&#39;s absorption level is high.) Lift up the spoon slowly and notice the texture of the chef. It will attach itself to the spoon in sticky, gummy strands. With a marker pen, mark the level of the chef on the side of the container. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly, and let stand in a moderate (70 degrees) draft-free place for 24 hours. The chef may rise and fall, but as long as It doubles at some point during this period, it&#39;s fine. The chef is now ready to transform into levain. If you don&#39;t want to make the levain immediately, the chef can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.

Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until the butter melts. Remove from the heat and cool to about 110 degrees F. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the milk. Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Set aside. Pour the yeast mixture into the bowl of flour and mix until a soft, ragged mixture is formed. Transfer the flour mixture to a well-floured work surface and knead by hand until an elastic dough is formed, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and place in the warm spot, until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Transfer the dough to the work surface and, using your hands, gently flatten into a 10-inch-long oval shape. Fold the dough into thirds lengthwise, overlapping the sides in the center. Press down on the overlapping sides to seal and make a seam. Place seam side-down in a buttered 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, cover with a kitchen towel, and return to the warm spot until the dough has risen about 1 1/2 inches over the top of the pan, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Brush the top of the dough lightly with warm water and, using a sharp knife, make 1/4-inch-deep slit down the center. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes.

Top with sliced ham and cover with the biscuit tops. Adjust the oven racks to accommodate a large covered roasting pan. Fit the pan with a shallow rack. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Unwrap the ham and rinse it in cold water. Place it on the rack in the roasting pan. Cover the pan with the lid and bake for half the estimated cooking time (total cooking time is about 20 minutes per pound, so 6 hours to 6 hours 40 minutes total). Halfway through the estimated cooking time, add the sugar and honey to a saucepan, cooking over medium heat until smooth and the sugar is dissolved. Pour the mixture over the ham and continue baking the ham, basting occasionally with the drippings in the roaster. Check for doneness at the end of the estimated cooking time by inserting a meat thermometer at a meaty point (not into fat or touching the bone). It should register 160 degrees F. Allow the ham to stand for 15 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 16287,&quot;Bourbon Brown Sugar Sundae 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream 1 1/2 cups sweetened condensed milk 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons bourbon 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Store-bought caramel sauce Crushed gingersnap cookies Maple Whipped Cream, recipe follows 1 cup chilled heavy whipped cream 1/4 cup powdered sugar 2 tablespoons real maple syrup Instructions: Place the ice cream insert in the freezer a full 24 hours before making your ice cream.<br> Whisk together the cream, milk, brown sugar, bourbon and cinnamon together in a large liquid measuring cup and refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.<br> Turn your ice cream machine on and pour in the cream mixture.

Whisk the lemon zest and juice, vinegar, honey, oregano and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a large bowl. Whisk in 1/2 cup of the oil in a slow, steady stream until emulsified. Peel the cucumbers , leaving alternating strips of green peel. Trim the ends, halve the cucumbers lengthwise and slice them crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Add them to the bowl with the dressing. Add the chickpeas. Brush the pitas on both sides with 2 tablespoons of the oil, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Thread 6 or 7 tomatoes on each skewer. (If using wooden skewers, leave just 1/2 inch sticking out on each end so you do not have to soak them.) Brush the remaining 2 tablespoons oil on the tomatoes and the onions, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place the pitas, skewered tomatoes and onions on the grill. Grill the pitas, flipping and rotating frequently, until charred in spots on both sides and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Grill the onions, turning as needed, until charred and tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Grill the tomatoes, turning occasionally, until lightly charred in spots and starting to burst, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the pitas and vegetables to a large cutting board when done cooking. When cool enough to handle, cut the pitas into 1-inch pieces and roughly chop the onions into bite-size pieces. Add them to the bowl with the cucumbers, chickpeas and dressing. Add the tomatoes, feta, kalamata olives and dill. Gently toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper if needed. (Be careful with seasoning at this point, because the feta and olives are very salty.)

Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and heat for 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms to the pan and cook, stirring often, until golden brown and all of the water cooks out, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the mushrooms to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the leeks. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the leeks, stirring often, until soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and salt and cook 1 more minute. Add the farro to the pan and stir to coat the grains in the oil and toast slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Deglaze with the wine and stir. Cook the farro, stirring occasionally, until the wine evaporates almost completely, about 8 minutes. Add the broth in 1-cup increments, cooking until the liquid almost completely evaporates before adding the next increment; this will take about 45 minutes to complete. Remember to stir often to create a creamy texture. When the farro is tender and absorbs almost all of the liquid, stir in the mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Pecorino Romano and butter.

Use one to fill the hole on the top of the cake. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Dye the coconut: Have ready resealable plastic bags or plastic containers. Add the coconut to the bag along with 20 to 25 drops of food coloring. Seal and shake vigorously until the coconut is evenly dyed. Add more food coloring, one drop at a time, as needed to get bright, vibrant colors. Fill the piping bags or resealable bags with royal icing. Pipe small flower petals or flower outlines onto the vanilla wafer cookies with white royal icing, then pipe circles of yellow royal icing in the centers of the flowers to create daisies. Let dry thoroughly before using. Press the remaining 1 1/2 cups crushed chocolate wafer cookie \dirt\ onto the sides of the cake to evenly coat. (It&#39;s alright if some of the chocolate frosting shows through.) Sprinkle the top only with the dyed coconut so that it looks like grass.

Sprinkle 4 of the patties with 2 tablespoons each of roasted red peppers and cheese, and top with remaining patties working the turkey around the edges to seal burgers closed. Season with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Grill or broil until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 16313,&quot;Scallion Pancakes 10 to 12 scallions (about 230 grams) 1 cup (240 grams) neutral cooking oil, such as canola or peanut<br> 2 cups (280 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for shaping the dough 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 2/3 cup (158 ml) boiling water<br> Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: Thinly slice the scallions, separating the tender greens from the whites and light greens. Measure out 1 packed cup (about 60 grams) of the tender greens and set aside for the pancakes. Add the remaining tender greens, along with the whites and light greens, to a small saucepan with the oil and place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil begins to rapidly bubble, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue to fry, stirring more frequently now, until the bubbling begins to subside and the scallions turn golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. They\u2019ll burn quickly at this point, so watch carefully. Strain scallions through a fine-mesh sieve set over a pint-size heatproof glass measuring cup or jar, then cool to room temperature, reserving the fried scallions to use as a garnish on fried rice, omelets, etc. When cool, measure out 1/2 cup of the scallion oil, then save the remainder for another use. (I like to stir fry with it, but swirling it into mashed potatoes isn\u2019t a bad idea either.) The scallion oil will keep for about 1 month refrigerated in an airtight container. For the dough, mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Pour in the boiling water all at once and stir with a spatula or chopsticks until just cool enough to handle, then knead by hand, in the bowl, until the dough comes together. Transfer to a clean counter and keep kneading until the dough is soft and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Lube the bowl with nonstick spray. Add the dough, then toss to lightly coat, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Divide the dough into four 100- to 110-gram pieces (about 3 3/4-ounces), roll into smooth balls, and cover with a kitchen towel. Working with one at a time, roll each ball into an 8- to 9-inch circle measuring less than 1/8-inch thick. Brush with 1 teaspoon of the cooled scallion oil and then sprinkle with 1/4 cup (about 15 grams) of the scallion greens. Roll into a tight snake, being sure to avoid creating any air bubbles inside. Wrap the snake into a tight pinwheel with the seam facing inward. Tuck the end under and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining balls. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest again for 30 minutes at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. (If chilling, bring to room temperature before proceeding with the next step.) Lightly brush your work surface with a small amount of the scallion oil. Then, one at a time, roll the spirals into 7- to 8-inch pancakes. Return to the baking sheet, top with a piece of parchment, and repeat with the remaining dough spirals, oiling the counter as needed. Place a piece of parchment between each pancake. Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. (If you\u2019re measuring, the pan should be between 380 and 400 degrees F.) Line a baking sheet with paper towels and top with an upside-down wire rack. (See Cook\u2019s Note.) Stash it by the cooktop. Add 2 tablespoons of the scallion oil to the hot skillet, followed by one of the pancakes. Fry, flipping every 30 to 45 seconds, until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes total. Transfer to the prepared rack. Repeat with the remaining pancakes, adding an additional tablespoon of oil to the pan in between each batch. Slice the pancakes into wedges and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 16314,&quot;Asparagus and Lemon Chicken with Rice 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 whole boneless and skinless chicken breast, cut into 1/2 inch slices Salt and pepper 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 red pepper, seeded and diced 1/2 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-2 inch pieces 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1/2 cup water, white wine or chicken stock 3 cups cooked rice Instructions: In a large non-stick skillet heat the oil over medium high heat.

In a small pot, combine the prunes and wine and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook gently until the wine clings to the prunes, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast until dark golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a clean kitchen towel, gather up the sides to make a pouch, and roll them on the counter to rub off the skins. Unfurl the cloth, and roll the nuts to the edge and into a dish. When the nuts are cool, crush them to a medium grade, using a knife, a mortar and pestle, or a small food processor. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat and add 3 tablespoons of the butter, the onions, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Cook uncovered, stirring often, until dark golden and sweet, about 20 minutes. Scrape onto a plate to cool. Bring a 2-quart saucepot of well-salted water to a boil. Blanch the cabbage leaves in the boiling water until wilted, about 1 minute each. Run the leaves under cold water to cool; shake off excess water. Cut away the thickest part of the stems. Dry the leaves and set them aside on a plate until ready to use.

It should not be frozen solid, but have milk ice floating on top and attached to the sides. The colder it is, the better your egg cream will come out.<br> Spoon the chocolate syrup into the bottom of a tall 10-ounce glass. Pour in the milk (it should only come about halfway up to leave room for the seltzer). Slide a long spoon into the glass, and then bounce the spoon up and down and stir just slightly to agitate the chocolate syrup at the bottom of the glass. Pour in the seltzer water while continuing the bounce the spoon. This method combines the syrup and seltzer and creates the frothy milk on top. The more you bounce the more bubbles you&#39;ll get. This is the old school method, and how those fountain shops got that amazing froth on top. If it&#39;s not working for you - abandon ship and use an electric frother or a blender.

Toss the cherry tomatoes, slab bacon, onions and bread cubes separately with a bit of oil, salt and pepper, and thread them on their own skewers so that they can cook at their own rate. You will have multiple skewers of each. Grill the skewers over medium-high heat until lightly charred; keep warm while you make the fondue. Shred the Cheddar and toss with 2 teaspoons of the cornstarch. Separately, shred the Gruyere and toss with the remaining 4 teaspoons cornstarch. In a medium heatproof saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat. (You can easily cook this over a campfire or on a camp grill as well.) When the butter melts, add the garlic and let it sizzle for 30 seconds. Add the white wine and bring to a simmer. Add the Gruyere and whisk until smooth. Add the Cheddar and whisk until smooth and no lumps of cheese remain. Heat until the cheese bubbles slightly at the edges. Remove from the heat and stir in the sherry, lots of black pepper and the nutmeg. Serve with the skewers of tomatoes, onions, bacon and bread for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 16357,&quot;Brown Chicken Stock 6 pounds assorted chicken bones, ideally a mixture of backs, necks, wings and legs 3 medium onions, peeled and halved horizontally 3 stalks celery, cut into chunks 3 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks 1 head garlic, cut in half horizontally 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1/2 cup dry white or red wine Several sprigs of parsley Several sprigs of thyme 2 bay leaves 10 peppercorns Contents of your stock bag, optional, explained above. Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place chicken bones in single layer in one or two roasting pans. Place in oven and roast 40 to 60 minutes until well browned. Remove from oven and place bones in large stockpot. Add onion, celery, carrots and garlic to one roasting pan. Stir to coat with chicken juices, and return to oven. Roast 20 minutes until beginning to caramelize. Stir in tomato paste and roast another 15 minutes. Remove from oven and remove vegetables to stockpot. Add wine to roasting pan and scrape up browned bits. placing over a burner if necessary to loosen caramelized bits. Pour into stockpot. If you used 2 roasting pans for the bones, pour a little water or wine into the second one and scrape up caramelized juices; add to stockpot. Add herbs and peppercorns to stockpot, along with the contents of your stock bag, if using, then add enough cold water to generously cover the contents by 3 inches or so. Bring to a simmer over high heat then skim foam, reduce heat to very low, and simmer very gently 4 to 6 hours until all cartilage has melted off the bones. Strain through a coarse strainer into a large metal bowl, cool at room temperature 2 hours, then place in fridge uncovered until chilled thoroughly, then cover. Will keep for 2 days until made into soup or reduced and frozen as above to have on hand. Strain through fine mesh strainer before using or freezing. IMPROVISED SOUPS Basic formula for enough soup for 2 people (generous portions): 4 cups white or brown chicken stock, thawed chicken meat from making the white stock if you have it, shredded; 12 cups of any vegetables, herbs and spices you may have around the house that are quick-cooking, or already-cooked ingredients such as leftover rice or beans. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 16358,&quot;Turkey Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes 1 head garlic Nonstick cooking spray 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 2 ribs celery, chopped 1 apple, peeled, cored, and chopped 2 pounds ground turkey breast 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 cup cornbread stuffing cubes 1 cup low-fat plain yogurt 2 egg whites 1 tablespoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, whole with skin, scrubbed *see Cook&#39;s note 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2/3 cup buttermilk, at room temperature Freshly ground white pepper Orange segments, from 2 large oranges 1 cup whole cranberry sauce 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1/8 teaspoon cayenne Instructions: To make the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the ring mold pan with the nonstick cooking spray, set aside. Slice off the top 1/3 of the head of garlic. Place on a piece of aluminum foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Place in the oven and roast for 45 minutes. While the garlic is in the oven, start the meatloaf: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, and apples, cook until softened, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl. Add the remaining meatloaf ingredients and mix well. Place the meatloaf mixture in the prepared ring mold. Bake until cooked through, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile: make the mashed potatoes: In a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water and add 1 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until fork tender, about 30 to 60 minutes depending upon the size of the potatoes. We&#39;ve found that boiling the potatoes whole, with the skin on gives the potatoes more potato flavor. Halve the potatoes crosswise. Put the halves in a ricer cut-side down, and press the potato through the ricer into a bowl. The flesh should easily pass through the holes and the skins remain in the ricer. Discard the skin, and repeat with the remaining potatoes. (Alternatively, peel the cooked potatoes and put through a food mill or mash with a hand-held potato masher.) Immediately add the buttermilk and roasted garlic, to taste, and combine well. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper, to taste. When the meatloaf is done, turn on the broiler. Invert the ring mold onto an ovenproof platter, or, if a baking sheet was used, carefully transfer meatloaf to the platter using a large spatula. Using a spatula, cover the meatloaf on all sides with mashed potatoes, as if frosting a cake. If using a pastry bag, add decorative swirls to the top. Place the platter under the broiler until potatoes are nicely browned, about 12 minutes. To make the chutney: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Special Equipment: large ring mold pan, pastry bag and tip (optional) . *Cooks Note: Yukon gold potatoes have a great buttery appearance when mashed which is a great way to fool the eye when cooking and eating lower fat foods. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 16359,&quot;Beignets with Raspberry Sauce 1 (10-ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed 1/2 cup powdered sugar 2 teaspoons lemon juice 2 (24-ounce) bottles canola, vegetable or safflower oil, for frying 2 packages or 10 biscuits buttermilk biscuit dough Powdered sugar, for garnish Instructions: In a blender, add raspberries, powdered sugar and lemon juice.

Let the seeds soak and rehydrate for at least 6 hours, and preferably overnight. Rinse the lotus seeds under cold water, then split them in half to remove and discard the green sprout in the center (they are very bitter). Transfer the seeds to a large pot and fill with plenty of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium-low and simmer until the seeds are tender enough to smash with a fork, about 1 hour. Drain well, then transfer the seeds to a food processor while they are still warm, add 3/4 cup sugar and puree until very smooth. (Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water if necessary to get a very smooth texture). Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium bowl.<br> Melt 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, then cook until caramelized and deep golden, about 5 minutes. Add the lotus puree and cook, stirring continuously, until most of the moisture has been cooked out and the puree is similar in texture to thick mashed potatoes, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the remaining 1/3 cup vegetable shortening, then continue to cook, stirring continuously, until all of the shortening has fully incorporated and the paste is very thick, glossy and pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 6 minutes more. (The final lotus paste should be amber brown in color and almost stretchy in texture.) Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool completely.<br> For the mooncake dough: Meanwhile, whisk together the golden syrup, alkaline water and vegetable oil in a large bowl until combined. Add the cake and all-purpose flours, then stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Gently knead the dough until it comes together completely, then wrap in plastic wrap and set aside to rest, about 45 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Divide the lotus paste into 12 equal pieces (each about 2 1/2 tablespoons) and roll into golf ball-size balls. Place on a plate and chill in the refrigerator, 20 to 30 minutes. The colder the balls, the easier it will be to shape the mooncakes.<br> Roll about 1 tablespoon of the mooncake dough into a ball, then place between 2 pieces of parchment paper that have been lightly dusted with flour. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough to about 1/8 inch thick and 3 1/2 to 4 inches wide. Place one of the lotus paste balls in the center of the dough, and shape the dough around it, pinching the edges to seal. Roll the ball in your hands to smooth the exterior.<br> Place the assembled ball in a plastic 2-inch wide miniature mooncake press mold, then turn the press upright on your work surface. Press the plunger down until you feel resistance, then lift the mooncake mold off the table and use the plunger to carefully press the mooncake out. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, then refrigerate while you make the remaining mooncakes in the same manner.<br> Bake the mooncakes until the tops are no longer shiny and the dough has just set, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes. Whisk the egg together with a splash of water in a small bowl, then brush over the tops and sides of each mooncake. Return to the oven and bake until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool on the baking sheet 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

Add the vanilla. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt, then add them to the butter-and-sugar mixture. Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat disk. Press the dough into a 10-inch-round or 9-inch-square false-bottom tart pan, making sure that the finished edge is flat. Chill until firm. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 1 side of a square of aluminum foil to fit inside the chilled tart and place it, buttered side down, on the pastry. Fill with beans or rice. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and beans, prick the tart all over with the tines of a fork, and bake again for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool to room temperature. Remove the zest of the lemons with a vegetable peeler or zester, being careful to avoid the white pith. Squeeze the lemons to make 1/2 cup of juice and set the juice aside. Put the zest in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the sugar and process for 2 to 3 minutes, until the zest is very finely minced. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter with the sugar and lemon zest. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and then add the lemon juice and salt. Mix until combined. Pour the mixture into a 2-quart saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 10 minutes. The lemon curd will thicken at about 175 degrees F, or just below a simmer. Remove from the heat.

Remove and reserve the giblets and discard the liver. Break down the duck and score the breasts. Puree the shallots, ginger and coriander in a mini food processor. Season the duck legs and the meat side of the breasts with salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons of the ginger mixture. Cover and refrigerate the duck and the remaining ginger mixture while you make the stock. Make the duck stock: Trim the excess fat from the duck bones and chop into 6 to 8 pieces. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat; add the bones, reserved wings and giblets and brown, turning occasionally, about 25 minutes. Add the broth and enough water to cover the bones. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, about 3 hours, skimming as needed. Strain the duck stock and skim off any excess fat from the surface. (The stock can be made a day ahead. Just cover and refrigerate.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the duck legs on a rack in a roasting pan with 1/4 inch water. Roast until brown and crisp, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; add the reserved ginger mixture and cook, stirring, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the port and scrape up any browned bits from the pan with a wooden spoon. Boil until the mixture looks like wet sand. Add 3 cups of the duck stock and the bay leaf and simmer until the liquid reduces by about three-quarters, about 45 minutes. Strain into a separate saucepan. Add the figs and heat until plump, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the butter, season generously with salt and pepper and add the vinegar. Keep the sauce warm over low heat but do not boil. Scrape the ginger mixture off the breasts. Heat a medium skillet over high heat. Place the breasts, skin-side down, in the skillet and cook until the fat begins to render and the skin is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour off the fat. Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking, removing the fat as it renders, until the skin is tight and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high, flip the breasts and cook until the meat is lightly browned but still medium-rare, 1 to 2 more minutes. Thinly slice the breasts and cut the legs in half. Divide the meat among plates and top with the sauce and figs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 16401,&quot;Crescents 1 stick butter 4 tablespoons powdered sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/2 cups finely chopped nuts Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and gently simmer, turning the chicken as needed, until cooked through, about 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate to cool. Discard the bay leaves and cilantro and reserve the broth and garlic. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. Put the tomatoes and chiles on a foil-lined baking sheet and broil, turning, until charred, about 12 minutes. Wrap in the foil to catch any juices, then cool slightly. Peel the chiles and transfer to a blender with the tomatoes and collected juices. Remove the garlic from the broth, add to the blender and puree until smooth. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high and stir in the tomato-cl puree and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until the sauce is thick, about 15 minutes. Stir in 3 cups of the reserved broth and bring to a simmer. Partially cover and cook about 20 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon salt; keep the sauce warm. Discard the chicken skin and shred the meat. Toss the chicken with the crema and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Soak the sliced onion in a bowl of cold water while you prepare the enchiladas. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spread 1 cup of the tomato-cl sauce in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Heat 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry a tortilla until puffed, about 15 seconds per side, turning with tongs. Quickly spoon 2 tablespoons chicken onto the tortilla, roll it up and put seam-side down in the baking dish. Fry and fill the remaining tortillas, arranging them side by side in the dish. Pour 2 cups of the tomato-cl sauce over the enchiladas and top with the queso fresco. Bake until warmed through, about 20 minutes. Drain the sliced onion and scatter over the enchiladas. Divide among plates and top with more cilantro, sauce and crema, if desired.

Fill the pot with cold water to about 1 inch above the chicken and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. While waiting for the water to boil, cut the ginger into very thin rounds, peel and quarter 1 of the onions and add them and 1 tablespoon salt to the pot. Once the water reaches a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, skimming and discarding any scum that floats to the surface of the poaching liquid, until an instant-read thermometer inserted between the breast and thigh of the chicken reads 165 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes. (To take the temperature, use a pair of sturdy tongs to carefully lift the chicken out of the hot poaching liquid and insert the thermometer between the breast and thigh.) While the chicken is cooking, core the white and purple cabbages, very thinly slice them into ribbonlike strands and place the sliced cabbage in a large bowl; set aside. Fill a second large bowl a little more than halfway with equal parts ice and water, and use the tongs to add the cooked chicken to it; reserve the pot and poaching liquid. Leave the chicken in the ice water to cool completely, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, peel, halve and very thinly slice the remaining onion, and place it in a small bowl. Add the vinegar, oil, 1 teaspoon of the sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Use your hands to gently massage the vinegar mixture into the onions until they begin to wilt slightly. Let the marinated onions sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes and up to overnight. Discard the ice water, but keep the chicken in the bowl. Remove and discard the skin. Shred the chicken into large bite-size pieces; set aside. Add the chicken carcass to the poaching liquid, and return it to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, skimming off any fat and/or scum that floats to the surface. Strain the poaching liquid over a large bowl; discard the solids. Let this flavorful broth cool completely, and reserve it for another purpose. (It can be frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months.) While the broth is cooking, make the dressing: Cook the remaining sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove to a small bowl and let cool slightly. While the sugar mixture is cooling, finely grate the garlic, halve and juice the limes (about 1/2 cup of juice total) and slice the chiles into thin rounds. Whisk the fish sauce into the cooled sugar mixture; add the garlic, lime juice and chiles. To assemble the salad, add the chicken, marinated onions (and any residual liquid) and lime dressing to the cabbage bowl. Tear the mint and basil leaves into the bowl, and gently toss to combine. Season with additional fish sauce if needed. Let the salad sit for 15 minutes so the flavors can marry, then transfer to a large platter. Place the peanuts and fried shallots in separate piles beside the salad. Just before serving, gently toss together the salad, peanuts and fried shallots and any liquid that has accumulated at the bottom of the platter (the liquid has a lot of great flavor). Serve with the fried shrimp chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 16405,&quot;Homestyle Chicken and Biscuits 1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell&#39;s?

Add the cocoa powder to the milk and bring to a boil; switch off the heat. Pour the milk in a slow stream onto the egg mixture, whisking vigorously all the time. (Pour slowly to avoid scrambling the eggs.) Return the mixture to a clean pot over a medium heat and whisk continuously. Make sure to scrape the sides and the bottom, otherwise it will burn. The cream will start to thicken. Once it releases a bubble or two, take it off the heat. Pour into a shallow bowl. Cover with cling film (pat the cling film so it sticks directly onto the cream) and refrigerate for at least an hour before using. For the meringue: Put half the egg whites into a clean glass or metal bowl. Add the sugar, lemon juice and salt and whisk until white. Add the rest of the egg whites and continue whisking until the meringue forms stiff peaks when the whisk is removed. Melt the chocolate in a bain marie (a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water) or in the microwave on a low setting. Whip the cream until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. To make the mousse, beat the chilled creme patissiere to remove any lumps before stirring in the melted chocolate. Mix in one third of the meringue, and then gently fold in the rest followed by the whipped cream. To serve, brush 4 to 6 glasses or ramekins with butter. Add some cocoa nibs and roll them around the sides and bottom of the glasses until evenly coated. Divide the mousse among the glasses and chill for at least an hour, but ideally 4 hours. Serve chilled, sprinkled with cocoa nibs. The mousse is best eaten the same day and should not be kept for more than 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 16408,&quot;Salt and Pepper Spare Ribs with Romesco Two 3 1/2-pound slabs pork spare ribs 3 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons smoked paprika 4 limes, halved Extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 cups large-cubed sourdough bread, crusts removed Kosher salt 1/2 cup blanched almond slivers 4 cloves garlic, bashed One 12-ounce jar fire-roasted red peppers, drained One 14.5-ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 cup sherry vinegar Instructions: For the ribs: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F and get the ribs started first.<br> Mix together the salt, pepper and paprika. Remove the thin membrane from the bone side of the ribs and discard. Lightly sprinkle the seasoning over both sides of the ribs then place the racks, rib-side down on a baking tray. Place in the oven and bake until the ribs have a nice crust (also known as \bark) on the outside and the meat will be pulling away from the bone, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.<br> Meanwhile, prepare the romesco sauce: Set a large saucepan over medium heat and coat with a generous amount of olive oil. Add the bread cubes and toast until golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with some salt and toss the bread cubes as they cook so they brown evenly all over. When done, remove from the pan and set aside. Add the almond slivers to the dry pan and toast until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. Coat the pan with more olive oil and add the garlic and saute until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the drained red peppers and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the tomatoes. Season with more salt and the cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid has slightly reduced, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. To a food processor, add the almonds and the tomato and bell pepper mixture. Pulse until well chopped, and then add the bread cubes and continue to process. Add the sherry vinegar and, while the processor is running, drizzle in 1/2 cup olive oil. Continue to blend until the sauce has emulsified. Taste the sauce and season once more with salt if needed. Remove the ribs from the oven, and while still hot, squeeze some fresh lime juice all over the racks. The ribs will absorb the lime juice and this will complement the rich, fatty spare ribs perfectly. Cut the ribs at every second bone and serve with the romesco sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 16409,&quot;Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookie Bars Nonstick cooking spray 4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) unsalted butter, softened 2 cups sugar<br> 3 large eggs<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1 cup creamy peanut butter<br> 1 cup smooth strawberry jam<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Sprinkle the yeast over the water, and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, Cajun seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl. Add the flour mixture and the butter to the yeast, and mix with a fork until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a flour-dusted surface, and knead by hand until smooth, about 5 minutes, using more flour as needed. Coat the inside of a medium bowl with cooking spray; add the dough to the bowl, and cover. Let the dough rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Make a slit down the length of each andouille link, cutting about halfway through, and stuff each with 1 tablespoon shredded cheese. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into an 8-by-18-inch rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. Cut lengthwise into 8 strips. Discard the 2 outer strips with the most uneven edges. Wrap a strip of dough around an andouille link, coiling the strip from 1 end of the link to the other, leaving a 1/4-inch space between dough turns and leaving the ends of the sausage slightly exposed. Set on the prepared baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining dough and andouille. Brush the tops and sides with the beaten egg. Bake until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes. For the remoulade sauce: Meanwhile, stir together the mayonnaise, cornichons, mustard, ketchup, scallions and hot sauce in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve. To serve: Cut each pig in a blanket into 4 pieces with a serrated knife. Serve with the remoulade sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 16418,&quot;\Hopped- Up\ On Caffeine Rich Chocolate Cake 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 cup (packed) cocoa powder 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 8 ounces French roast coffee, freshly brewed and cooled 2 cups granulated sugar 4 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature 1 cup buttermilk 3 whole eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan. Sift the flour, salt, cocoa powder, baking soda and baking powder together. Reserve. Brew a fresh pot of French roast coffee. Cool and reserve. In a bowl of an electric mixer combine the sugar, and butter. Mix on medium speed until combined well. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add in the brewed coffee and combine on low speed. Once combined, add in the buttermilk and then the eggs, 1 at a time.. Continue to mix on low speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Gently fold in the sifted dry ingredients. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan and fill half way up. Use any excess batter for cupcakes. Bake for approximately 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Serve with your favorite ice cream or a yummy chocolate icing. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petite Sirah]&quot; 16419,&quot;Berry Bagel Puffs 1 1/2 cups warm water 2 tablespoons sugar, plus 2 teaspoons 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sugar 4 1/4 to 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading One 1/4-ounce package dry active yeast 2 teaspoons kosher salt 8 ounces fresh strawberries, chopped 6 ounces fresh blueberries 8 ounces cream cheese, softened 2 tablespoons strawberry jam 1 large egg 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar For filling variations, see recipe below Four 6-ounce packages blackberries, divided 3/4 cup sugar 3 tablespoons instant tapioca 1 tablespoon water Instructions: Combine the water, sugar and yeast iIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Allow to stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, the salt, and mix on low speed until well combined, about 2 minutes. Switch to the dough hook attachment. Add the remaining flour gradually and mix on low speed until fully incorporated, about 4 minutes. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until the dough is heavy, smooth, and not sticky, about 5 minutes. Lightly oil a bowl, place the dough in the bowl, cover loosely and set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. In a medium bowl, combine the strawberries and blueberries. Add the softened cream cheese and strawberry jam and mix until well combined. Set aside. Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Divide dough into 12 pieces. Cook Tip: To portion the dough evenly roll the dough into a log shape. Cut the log shaped dough in half, then cut the two halves in half leaving you with 4 equal pieces. Cut those pieces into thirds which will give you 12 even portions. Take one piece of dough and flatten it into a 4 inch circle. Place 2 1/2 tablespoons cream cheese mixture (or filling variation - see below) in the center. Fold up the ends of the dough and pinch closed like an empanada or potsticker. Tuck the ends into the center and twist to form a nice ball. Be careful not to make the bottom of the roll a lot thicker than the top to keep the dough even around the filling. Place the roll, seam side down, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining rolls. Beat the egg in a small bowl with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the rolls with the egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Bake in the preheated 375 degrees F oven until golden brown, 20 to 22 minutes.

The size of the chocolate pieces is key. Make sure the chocolate is in small pieces so that the heat from the boiled cream can melt all of the chocolate. Place chopped chocolate in a large non-reactive bowl. In a medium saucepan, bring cream, salt, and vanilla bean to a boil. Once mixture has boiled and foamed up, immediately remove the pan from the heat and pour it over the chocolate. Let chocolate and cream mixture sit for 3 minutes. With a wooden spoon, begin stirring small circles in the middle of the bowl. As the smooth mixture begins to form in the middle, slowly expand the size of the circle until the cream and chocolate is fully incorporated. Remove vanilla bean and stir in butter. Cover mixture and let sit until firm. Fill a piping bag or zip top freezer bag with the truffle mixture and pipe into 1 tablespoon size dollops. Allow dollops to set up until they are firm. Roll dollops into round truffles. Truffles can be coated in powdered sugar, cocoa powder, ground nuts, coconut, etc. Optional: Add 1-ounce distilled liquor or liqueurs (i.e. brandy, Kirsch, etc.) to butter for additional flavor variations. Distilled liquors or liqueurs add flavor without adding extra sweetness. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 16421,&quot;Grilled Zinfandel Peaches 1 cup Zinfandel wine 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar 8 ripe firm, but not overly soft, halved peaches 2 tablespooons extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing and drizzling 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 16 thinly shaved (2 by 2-inch) pieces sheep&#39;s cheese Instructions: Turn on grill to high heat.

Add the chicken and return the pot to a simmer. Place a plate on top of the chicken to keep it submerged and then cover the pot with a lid. Lower the heat and simmer until the chicken is done, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the chicken from the pot, then pull the meat off and shred it. Discard the skin and bones. Strain the soup into a heatproof bowl. Skim off the fat and return the soup to the pot. For the matzo balls: In a large bowl, combine the matzo meal, salt, baking powder, baking soda and granulated garlic. In a medium bowl, whisk the 2 whole eggs and 3 egg yolks, the chicken fat and the onion. In a separate bowl, beat the 3 egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Stir the chicken fat mixture into the dry ingredients, then stir in one-third of the beaten egg whites until incorporated. Gently fold in the remaining whites until there are no remaining streaks. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the batter and refrigerate for about 20 minutes or overnight, until firm. Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. Combine the vegetable oil with some water in a small bowl to keep your hands moist. Scoop 1 heaping tablespoon of the matzo ball mixture into your hands and form into a mound. Place the mound on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining matzo ball mixture. Use the oil and water mixture to keep your hands moist while you roll each scoop of batter into a ball. Handle the balls as gently as possible. For the finishing touches: Return the chicken stock to a simmer and add the celery, carrot, onion, rutabaga, dill, parsley and a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the matzo balls. Cover and cook over moderate heat, turning the matzo balls a few times, until they are plumped and cooked thoroughly, about 25 minutes. Stir in the shredded chicken and cook until the chicken is heated, about 2 minutes. Remove the dill and parsley sprigs. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 16441,&quot;Italian Fried Chicken 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cloves garlic, grated Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3/4 cup milk 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts (3 pounds), halved crosswise 1 bulb fennel, cored and thinly sliced, plus 1 tablespoon chopped fronds 1 romaine heart, thinly sliced 1 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil Juice of 1 lemon 1 1/2 cups peanut oil, for frying Instructions: Combine the flour, half of the garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl; set aside.

Pulse the pancetta, onion, carrot, celery, thyme and sage in a food processor to make a chunky paste.<br> Pat the duck legs dry and season with salt. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add the duck legs, skin-side down, and cook until brown on both sides, about 7 minutes per side. Transfer the duck legs to a plate and pour off all but a thin layer of oil from the pot.<br> Drain the mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid, then finely chop. Add the pancetta paste to the pot, season with salt and cook, stirring, until the paste is dry and sticks to the pot, 5 to 7 minutes. Clear a space in the pot and add the tomato paste; cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes, then add the bay leaves and mushrooms and stir all the ingredients together. Add the wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Cook until the wine thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the duck legs to the pot along with 4 cups water and the reserved mushroom soaking liquid.

Soak overnight (or at least 8 hours) in the refrigerator. Drain the beans and rinse. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery and leeks and season with 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook and stir until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and thyme and stir to coat the vegetables. Let the tomato paste toast for 1 minute, stirring, then add the bay leaves and 12 cups of water. Add the beans and nestle the ham bone in. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the beans are almost tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Add the escarole, another 2 cups of water and 1 teaspoon salt. Return the soup to a simmer and cook until thickened and the beans and escarole are very tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and ham bone from the soup and let cool until you can handle the bone. Shred any useable meat left on the bone and stir back into the soup. Season with salt and pepper before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 16445,&quot;Sugar-Topped Cherry Pie 1 pound and 10 ounces sour cherries, pre-pitted weight; or 6 cups frozen or jarred 1 to 2 tablespoons kirsch 1/2 cup raw sugar 4 tablespoons cornstarch Shortcrust pastry dough made with 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour and 2/3 cup unsalted butter, recipe follows Beaten egg, for glaze 1 tablespoon demerara sugar Instructions: Pit the cherries, then macerate them in a large bowl with the kirsch and sugar for 1 hour or so. If using jarred cherries, strain and reserve 1/4 cup juice to mix with the cornstarch. Pour off the juice that has collected into a smaller bowl and stir in the sifted cornstarch to thicken it. Return the thickened juice to the cherries. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Divide the dough into roughly 2/3 and 1/3. Roll out the larger piece for the bottom of the pie and drop it into a greased pie pan. Pour in the cherry mixture. Roll out the second piece of dough and place it over the cherries, crimping the edges together well with the tines of a fork. Brush the top with beaten egg, then sprinkle the demerara. Make a couple of slashes in the crust for the steam to escape and bake the pie for about 40 minutes or until the top has browned. Serve warm or at room temperature with clotted or whipped cream, or a la mode with homemade vanilla ice cream. Use approximately twice the weight of all purpose flour (preferably organic) to unsalted butter. Some recipes call for half butter, half lard. Sift the flour and a pinch of sea salt into a food processor, then cut the cold butter into small pieces on top of it. I process it for 20 to 30 seconds, then add ice-cold water through the top, a tablespoon at a time, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes should be enough for about 10 ounces of dough, with the machine running. If the paste is still in crumbly little bits after 1 or 2 minutes, add a tablespoon more water, but remember, the more water you use, the more the crust will shrink if you bake it blind. One solution is to use a bit of cream or egg yolk instead of water. The moment the dough has cohered into a single ball, stop, remove it, wrap it in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. If you&#39;re making pastry dough by hand, sift the flour into a large bowl with the salt, add the chopped butter, and work as briskly as you can to rub the fat into the flour. Use the tip of your fingers only, rather like running grains of hot sand through your fingers. Add the water bit by bit as above; wrap and chill the dough. If you&#39;re making a double crust pie, divide the dough into roughly 2/3 and 1/3. Then scatter a bit of flour on your work surface, roll your rolling pin in it, dust the palms of your hands, and start rolling. Always roll away from yourself, tuning the dough as you go, and keep the rolling pin and work surface floured to prevent sticking. Preheat the oven to 375 to 400 degrees F. Line your greased pie pan with dough. Never stretch it; it will stretch back. Try to leave at least 30 minutes for the unbaked dough to commune with the inside of your fridge. Or put it in the night before you need it. Tear off a piece of waxed paper a little larger than the pie pan and place it over the dough. Cover the paper with a layer of dried beans; the idea is to prevent the pastry from rising up in the oven. When the dough is nearly cooked (the timing depends on the rest of the recipe), remove the paper and beans and prick the bottom of the pie shell to let out trapped air that would otherwise bubble up. Return the tart to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes to dry the bottom. Brushing the partly baked pie shell with a light coating of beaten egg or egg white ensure a crisp finished tart. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16446,&quot;Dressed Up Grilled Cheese Sandwiches Mayonnaise, for spreading 8 slices country white bread<br> 8 slices Monterey Jack cheese 1 medium vine-ripened tomato, sliced<br> 1 small red onion, thinly sliced<br> 1 avocado, sliced<br> Instructions: Preheat a griddle over low heat.

Put the bacon on a baking sheet and roast until crisp, about 15 minutes. Set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. For the cranberry Dijon mayo: Whisk the cranberry relish together with the mayonnaise and mustard in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. For the cornbread waffles: Preheat a waffle maker. Put a rack on a baking sheet. In a large bowl, stir together the leftover stuffing, eggs, parsley and sage. Add 1/4 cup of the chicken broth and mix until well combined. Continue adding chicken broth as needed until the mixture is well moistened--it should just hold together in your hand. Season with salt and pepper. Using about 1/2 cup per waffle, shape the stuffing mixture into fat round patties; they should be smaller than the waffle grids. Spray the waffle maker with some nonstick spray, then add the stuffing patties and close the lid. Let the waffles cook until golden brown, crispy and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. (The waffle maker should stop steaming when the waffles are cooked through.) Remove the waffles to the rack on the baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining waffle mixture. Put a few slices of Brie on each waffle, transfer to the oven, and warm just to melt the cheese a bit, about 5 minutes. For the turkey: Meanwhile, bring about 1 cup of broth to a simmer in a large skillet. Add the turkey and heat until just warmed through, about 5 minutes. For the eggs: Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the eggs and fry until the whites are set and the yolks still runny, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble: Dollop some of the cranberry Dijon mayonnaise on top of each waffle. Top with some warm turkey, then some bacon, and finally an egg.

Note from Alton: Those of you who watched this program on the 17th or 18th will want to disregard one particular suggestion I made regarding lentils: don&#39;t feed the left over onions to your dog. It turns out onions are not good for dogs in any shape or form. I&#39;m grateful to the fans who emailed me after the airing for setting me straight on this nutritional peculiarity.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke. Place the sirloin block in the skillet in one piece and let it sear until it really browns and caramelizes, 3 to 5 minutes. Then flip it and repeat, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Let it do its thing.<br> Once the block of sirloin is well seared, chop it up in the pan with a metal spatula to sear the inside bits. Add the black pepper, cumin, and cayenne and stir well. Cook for a minute. Add the beer to deglaze the pan, and cook 1 minute longer, scraping up any browned bits. Remove from the heat and set aside. At this point, you could freeze the meat.<br> Make the gravy: In a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat, make a dark roux using the oil and flour, about 45 minutes. Once it&#39;s the color of milk chocolate, add the onion, bell pepper, and celery and stir together. Cook for a minute. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute longer. Add the beer and mix well. In 1/3-cup increments, add the stock, stirring well between each addition. Stir frequently, but not continuously, until you have a well emulsified gravy, thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Once the gravy is done, add the cooked beef. Add a splash of stock to the meat pan to deglaze to get the remaining \junk\ out -- the delicious extra bits that stick to the pan -- and add to the gravy and meat. Bring the meat and gravy mixture back to a bare simmer. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours, or until the raw flour has all cooked out and the sauce has no chalky or floury flavor.<br> To serve: Add the cooked rice, butter, and green onions to the meat gravy in the pot.

Store in airtight container at room temperature.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Merlot]&quot; 16482,&quot;Dough Basket 7 1/2 cups unbleached, unbromated flour 2 cups water 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon vegetable shortening 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup water Instructions: To make the dough: Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle. Mix until well combined. The dough will be sticky but you will be able to form it into a ball. Use additional flour for your hands and work surface to keep the dough from sticking.<br> To prepare the basket weaving structure: This recipe will make enough dough to yield a basket that is about 10 inches in diameter. Use a piece styrofoam as a base. I used an 11 by 14-inch rectangular piece, which was about 2 inches thick. Using a pen, draw a 9-inch diameter circle in the center of the rectangular styrofoam. Insert 21 wooden skewers in a circle following the pen line of the 9-inch diameter circle. Space the skewers somewhat evenly apart. When inserting the skewers, tilt them slightly outward. This will be the outside shape of the basket.<br> To make the basket: Roll a piece of dough into a long rope that is at least 20 inches long and about 1/2-inch in diameter. Place the end of this rope inside the basket leaving a 1 1/2-inch long tail resting in what will be the interior of the basket. Weave the rest of the dough in and out of the skewers. This should make one complete layer and may give you enough to continue into the second row. When you are coming to the end of your rope (no pun intended) and you need to stop, make sure you leave a tail inside the basket. This will help the dough stay in place and avoid any unraveling later on. Roll out another dough rope and start the second layer in a different spot than the first one so the starts and ends are staggered throughout the basket. This will help develop a stable structure to the basket. When you have completed 4 full rows, put it in the oven at 200 degrees F (if the oven temperature is higher, the Styrofoam will melt) for about 30 minutes. This is just long enough for the dough to dry slightly and will provide a strong base for the weight of additional layers. Remove from the oven and let cool. Repeat the same process adding another 4 layers to the basket. Put it back in the oven for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.<br> To make the decorative braids for the top rim of the basket: Using 3 ropes of raw dough approximately 28 inches long, weave the dough ropes into a long braid. Place the braid on the top rim of the basket, gently pressing it down to make it secure. This is now the final row on the basket.<br> To make the bottom of the basket: Make a long rope of dough approximately 1/2-inch in diameter. Tightly coil it starting at the center of the inside of the basket. This will be the bottom of the basket. If the rope you made is not long enough, you can roll out another rope and connect the 2 ropes by squeezing it securely to the end of the already coiled rope. Make the coil disk slightly bigger than the base and push the coil into place so it fits snugly.<br> To make the handles for the basket: I used a 1/4-inch thick wooden dowel as a base and wrapped a long rope of raw dough, by spiraling around the dowel from top to bottom. I used 3 pieces of dowel to give my basket handle an artistic shape. The length of the dowels depends on 2 things. How tall the side of your basket is and what you want the handles to look like. Cut dowels to desired size. Lay the raw dough wrapped dowels on the baking sheet and bake along with the rest of the basket. The handles will be attached after all the parts have been baked.<br> Place the entire basket and the handles in the oven for the final time. I put mine in the oven for about 1 hour, then turned off the heat and left it in the oven overnight. Remove the basket from the oven (it should be cool or room temperature for final assembly). To assemble and finish the basket: Make the caramel for painting the basket: Place the sugar and water in a saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Stir only until it is combined. Let the caramel cook until it burns. You will see white smoke and the caramel will be very dark. Remove from the heat. Add a little water and stir. You will need to keep adding small amounts of water until the caramel is a consistency liquid enough to use as paint. Use a pastry brush to apply the caramel to the basket and the handle. Allow it to dry completely before filling the basket with your pastries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16483,&quot;Sauteed Green Beans with Lemon and Blue Cheese 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 8 ounces green beans, trimmed<br> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 tablespoon sriracha or other hot sauce<br> Fresh lemon juice, as needed 2 ounces crumbled blue cheese Instructions: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the butter and oil.

Cook, gently swirling the skillet occasionally but not stirring, until amber, 8 to 10 minutes. Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the skillet with a wet pastry brush. Remove from the heat and whisk in 3 tablespoons butter and the vinegar (the mixture will bubble). Add the apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 12 minutes. Strain the apples and transfer to a bowl; set the caramel aside. Toss 1 tablespoon gingersnap crumbs and the cinnamon with the apples; let cool completely. Melt the remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Let cool, then skim off the foam and discard. Spoon the melted butter into a bowl, leaving any solids in the pan. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a sheet of phyllo on a clean kitchen towel or piece of parchment with a long side in front of you. (Keep the remaining phyllo covered with a damp towel.) Lightly brush the phyllo with some of the melted butter and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Layer another sheet of phyllo on top; brush with more butter and sprinkle with more sugar. Repeat with the remaining 4 sheets of phyllo. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons gingersnap crumbs on top. Spoon the apple filling onto the phyllo in a strip along the bottom edge, leaving a 1-inch border. Use the towel or parchment to help roll the phyllo into a log, starting at the bottom edge. Place seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with more butter and sprinkle with more granulated sugar. Make a few slits on top with a knife to vent. Bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Beat the heavy cream in a bowl with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, then gently fold in some of the reserved caramel (you may need to whisk the caramel first to loosen). Dust the strudel with confectioners&#39; sugar and cut into pieces.

Grease a 9-by-13-inch casserole pan with cooking spray. Set a medium pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula, until cooked through and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove to a bowl and set aside. Add the onion to the pan and saute until translucent and the browned bits of sausage in the pan have been picked up by the onion, about 5 minutes -- this will add lots of flavor! Once the onions are cooked, add the potatoes. Cook until they are tender and just beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. If necessary, add more olive oil so the potatoes don&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. Remove the potatoes and onions to the bowl of sausage. Coat the pan with a bit of olive oil and add the broccoli. Saute until just tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the sausage bowl. Add the milk, cream, eggs and some salt and pepper to a separate medium bowl and whisk to combine. Transfer the sausage and vegetable mixture to the prepared casserole pan. Toss and distribute evenly on the bottom of the pan. Gently pour the egg mixture over the top. Bake until the frittata is puffed and beginning to brown and the egg is set in the middle, about 30 minutes. Allow to set for 5 minutes before slicing. Garnish with the dill and serve.

With sharp knife, score the top of pork butt through the fat until you reach the meat. Rub meat generously all over with seasoning rub, reserving a few tablespoons for the sauce. Place meat in a smoker, keeping temperature between 225 and 250 degrees F, it&#39;s important to maintain this temperature throughout the cooking process. Remove the pork when internal temperature reaches 175 degrees F. At that point, the bone should feel loose. Immediately wrap pork in double sheets of aluminum foil taking care not to squeeze juices from the pork. Place wrapped butt back in the smoker for an additional 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the pit and allow the meat to rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Prior to serving, open foil, pull bone out, and use 2 forks to pull the meat apart.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until easily pierced with a knife, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly. Peel the potatoes and pass through a ricer onto a clean surface in a thin layer (do not mound the riced potatoes). Let cool completely, at least 10 minutes. Combine 1 teaspoon salt, the finely ground pepper and the nutmeg in a small bowl; sprinkle over the riced potatoes. Drizzle the beaten egg over the potatoes, then sprinkle with 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup pecorino. Chop the potato mixture with a bench scraper, turning the mixture onto itself until it just starts to come together. Lightly dust the dough with flour and knead, adding up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed, until the dough is almost smooth and slightly wet but not sticky. Form the dough into a ball. Cut the dough into 4 pieces using the bench scraper; keep covered with a kitchen towel until ready to use. Cut 1 piece of dough in half; dust with flour and gently roll each half into a 1/2-inch-thick rope. Cut each rope into 1/2-inch pieces with the bench scraper or a sharp knife and dust with flour. Repeat with the remaining dough. Line 2 baking sheets with clean kitchen towels; dust with flour. Lightly flour your hands and roll each piece of dough between your palms to make a small ball. One at a time, place each dough ball on the tines of a fork closest to the handle and hold it in place with a floured thumb. In one gentle motion, quickly press and roll the dough along the tines toward the tip of the fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheets. (The uncooked gnocchi can be frozen at this point. Freeze on the baking sheets until firm, then transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze up to 3 weeks.) Preheat the broiler and bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Melt the butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Stir in the coarsely ground pepper and cook until toasted, about 30 seconds. Add 3/4 cup of the boiling water. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Working in batches, shake the gnocchi in a colander to remove any excess flour, then add to the pot of boiling water and cook until the gnocchi float to the top, about 2 minutes. Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon or spider and transfer to the skillet with the butter sauce, off the heat. Once all the gnocchi are in the skillet, stir to coat and return the skillet to medium heat. Bring the sauce to a boil, adding up to 1/4 cup of the cooking water if the gnocchi seem dry. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 cup each pecorino and parmesan. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup each pecorino and parmesan over the top. Transfer the skillet to the broiler and broil until browned and bubbling, 1 to 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 16510,&quot;Black Bean Swamp Dip 3 poblano cl peppers 1 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed 1/2 cup fresh cilantro 1/2 cup chopped scallions 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 2 limes) Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin Blue corn tortilla chips, for serving Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

In a heavy saute pan, add chicken stock, chopped sage, and butter. Boil until mixture emulsifies. Season with salt and pepper. Cook the agnolotti in the water until al dente, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and toss gently in the sage butter. Serve in soup plates and shave white truffles on top. To take advantage of the wonderful truffle aroma, cover each individual bowl of agnolotti with another plate. When brought to the table, remove the top plate so that the truffle aroma escapes just as the guest takes the first bite. In a medium saute pan, bring the cream to a boil. Reduce until only 1/3 cup remains. Stir in the grated corn, salt, pepper and sugar. Bring the mixture to a slow boil, stirring constantly. Continue to cook until the mixture reduces and thickly coats the back of a spoon. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. Stir in the cheeses and thyme and mix until well blended. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Place bowl over ice bath to allow filling to set. Make the agnolotti: Roll out the dough very thin. Brush with eggwash. Mound little heaps of filling about 1-inch apart. Fold over and squeeze dough together in between filling mounds. With a serrated pasta cutter, cut agnolotti. Cut away excess dough lengthwise; there should be no more than 1/4-inch around the edges. Yield: about 2 cups of filling, makes about 100 agnolotti In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of the water. Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine and pinch the dough to test it. If it&#39;s too dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball. Turn out onto a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, until a smooth ball is formed. Loosely wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the other pieces covered in plastic while you roll out one piece at a time, by hand with a rolling pin or through the rollers of a pasta machine, stretching the dough to the desired thickness. If using a pasta machine, set the rollers at the widest opening. Flatten the first piece of dough into a thick strip no wider than the machine, to enable it to pass through the rollers. If necessary, dust the pasta very lightly with flour. Run the pasta through the machine. Fold in thirds, crosswise, and run through the machine again. Repeat this procedure 2 more times, until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic. Set the machine to the next smaller opening and run the dough through the rollers. Continue rolling and stretching the dough, using the smaller opening each time, until the next to the last or the last opening is reached, dusting lightly with flour only as necessary. (The strip of dough will be long. If you don&#39;t have enough space on your worktable, halfway through the rolling process, cut the strip of dough in half and continue to work with each piece separately, keeping the unused dough covered). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barolo]&quot; 16526,&quot;Hockaday Chess Pie 3 cups sugar 1 1/2 ounces cornmeal 1/2 pound (2 sticks) margarine or butter, melted 6 eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 2 teaspoons vinegar 2 unbaked pie shells in pie pans Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Crush the cookies in a food processor along with the butter. Spray a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and line it with waxed paper so that the paper covers sides and is taller than pan. The paper should fall over the sides of pan. Press the crushed cookies into the bottom of the pan to make a thick layer. Do not allow the cookies to go up the sides. Layer the ice cream in the order you prefer. (I usually do coffee, chocolate, and then the vanilla.) Smooth out each layer before pouring in the next flavor of ice cream to make a level surface for the next layer. Fill the pan with the last layer so that the ice cream is level with the sides of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer until the ice cream is firm and solid, at least 5 to 6 hours. (I usually start this in the morning to serve as a dessert after dinner.) Once the ice cream is firm and solid remove the plastic wrap. Dip pan into warm water to make it easy to remove, but do not let water get inside the pan. Invert onto a decorative plate, using the waxed paper to ease the cake out of the pan. Remove the waxed paper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 16550,&quot;Mashed Sweet Potatoes 3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks 1/2 stick butter 1 banana, sliced 1 orange, zested and juiced 1 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg Salt and pepper Instructions: Boil potatoes until tender, drain and reserve.

If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Set up a breading station for the cube steak. Add 1/2 cup flour to a dish, then season with salt and pepper and set aside. Add the beaten eggs to a separate dish, then season with salt and pepper and set aside. Mix together the rice flour, instant coffee, crushed BBQ chips and 1 cup flour in a third dish and season with salt and pepper; set aside. Place a large cast-iron skillet over the direct-heat side of the grill. Add enough olive oil to come 1 inch up the side of the skillet. Preheat the oil to 350 degrees F. Dredge each piece of cube steak in the flour, egg and then flour/chips mixture, shaking off any excess in between. Add the steaks to the oil in batches and cook until golden brown and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove to a cooling rack and set aside. Pour out the leftover oil from the skillet and discard it. Be careful to keep all the brown bits on the bottom of the skillet\u2014they have all the flavor! Place the skillet back on the grill over direct heat and add the butter. Cook until melted, then whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons flour, creating a roux that looks like wet sand. Cook the roux, whisking, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Whisk in the milk a third at a time, continuing to whisk so no lumps form. Whisk in the buttermilk and season with salt and pepper. Cook, whisking, until luscious and thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the parsley and chives. Move to the indirect side to keep warm. To serve: Place a piece of chicken fried steak on a plate.

In a mixer, cream together the butter and sugar. Add the eggs and yolk one by one, then add the vanilla. Add the dry ingredients and mix until a firm dough forms. Divide the dough in half, place each piece onto a piece of parchment or wax paper, and shape the dough into a rough log about 2 inches in diameter, dusting with cornmeal as needed to prevent sticking. Roll up in the paper, twisting the ends to seal, and roll back and forth a few times to smooth out the shape. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. (At this point, the dough can be frozen for up to 2 months.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. With a sharp knife, cut the cookies into 1/2-inch slices, and place on the prepared cookie sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake, rotating halfway through, until cookies are just golden, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.

Add the kombu and bring to a boil over medium-low heat, carefully skimming off and discarding any white foam that might bubble up using a large spoon or ladle, about 15 minutes. Once at a boil, turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Remove the kombu and bring the liquid back to a boil over medium heat. Turn off the heat and add the bonito flakes. Let the bonito flakes soak for 15 minutes. Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing down with a rubber spatula to extract all the liquid. Discard the bonito flakes. (The dashi can be used immediately or cooled completely before storing in an airtight container for up to 5 days.) Heat the vegetable oil in a large donabe over medium heat. Add the ginger and scallions and saut until the scallion whites are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups of the dashi and the napa cabbage. Raise the heat to medium high and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, mix the mirin and soy sauce in a small bowl. Set aside. Once the dashi is at a simmer, add the udon in an even layer. Carefully arrange the mushrooms, snapper, shrimp, clams and garlic chives in an even layer on top of the udon. You may need to nestle in and overlap some of the ingredients, such as the garlic chives and mushrooms, but take care not to overlap the snapper pieces too much or they may not cook evenly. Pour in the mirin-soy mixture and remaining dashi. Bring to a full simmer. Cover and let cook until the shrimp are pink, the clams are open and everything is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes more. Carefully remove the lid and drizzle in the sesame oil. Transfer to the donabe to a trivet on the table. Divide among bowls and enjoy while warm.

Mix with the olive oil and rub the venison. Cover and let stand in the refrigerator for 4 to 12 hours. Remove the venison from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to come to room temperature. To make the spaetzle: In a small saucepan, heat the milk over low heat just until it simmers. Remove from heat, stir in the ground mushrooms, and let stand for 15 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the milk mixture, flour, egg, herbs, salt and pepper. Mix the batter until smooth, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Place a colander or perforated pan over (not touching) the boiling water. Pour the batter into the colander or pan. Using a rubber spatula or your hand, quickly press the batter through the holes into the boiling water. Once all of the batter has been forced through the holes, remove the colander or pan. Stir the spaetzle and cook for 1 minute. Drain well and toss with a little olive oil; set aside. To make the cabbage: In a spice mill, grind the cloves, fennel, and juniper; set aside. In a 4-quart pot, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. And the onion and saute for 3 minutes, or until translucent. Mix in the cabbage, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1 teaspoon of the pepper, and cook until the cabbage begins to wilt. Stir in the brandy, cider, and spices. Add the diced pear, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender. Cover and keep warm until serving. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and brown the venison on all sides. Place on a rack in a roasting pan and roast in the oven for 15 minutes for medium rare. For medium done, roast 6 to 7 minutes longer. Remove the venison from the oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let stand for 5 minutes before slicing. Using a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium high heat. Add the chanterelle mushrooms and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until they begin to brown lightly and then add the spaetzle, season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and cook until brown and crispy. To serve, portion the braised cabbage and spaetzle onto each plate.

Using a whisk, stir the mixture to incorporate all the ingredients. Cream the butter in a stand mixer until it lightens up. Slowly add in the sugars and continue to cream until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each egg. Stir in the vanilla. On low speed, add the flour mixture. Once incorporated, fold in the chocolate chips by hand. Take 2 teaspoons dough, or if using a spoon, take a good scoop and roll it into balls. I use my hands, it&#39;s faster and a whole lot easier. Put the cookie dough balls onto a baking sheet and pop them into the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes. Chilling the dough will help the batter stick to the cookie balls. For the batter: Combine the flour, sugar and baking powder in a large bowl. Take a whisk and give the mixture a few swirls to incorporate the ingredients and break up any lumps. Whisk in the egg and the seltzer, making sure to combine well. You want the batter to have the consistency of heavy cream, so add more seltzer, if needed, to achieve this. In a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Working in batches, add 3 chilled dough balls to the batter and turn to coat completely. Using a fork or slotted spoon, remove each cookie dough ball from the batter, letting the excess batter drip back into the bowl, then very carefully slip it into the hot oil and repeat. Fry no more than 3 at a time, since you do not want the temperature of the oil to drop. Using a slotted spoon, turn them over a few times until they are golden brown, about 3 minutes total. Remove the crispy cookie dough balls from the oil to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with a generous pinch of fleur de sel and serve warm.

Grease a 9-inch square cake pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter. For the cake: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or an electric hand mixer, or by hand), cream the 1 stick of butter and granulated sugar together until smooth, 5 to 8 minutes. As you are creaming the butter and sugar, scrape the sides down with a rubber spatula so you are sure to be combining the butter and sugar as it mixes. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. When the butter and sugar are integrated, blend in the yogurt. Add the eggs, one by one. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla. Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the dry ingredients. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake, undisturbed, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Allow the cake to cool for 10 minutes before inverting it on to a plate and allowing it to cool for an additional 20 minutes. For the frosting: In a small saucepan, combine the water and granulated sugar and bring to a simmer. Stir to make sure all of the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Stir to blend. Set the syrup aside to cool. In a small saucepan, heat the cream. Place the chocolate chips in a medium bowl. When the cream simmers, pour it over the chocolate chips. Whisk to blend. Set aside to cool. In the bowl of the food processor, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter, and almond extract. Pulse to blend. Continue blending for about 30 seconds until the ingredients are mixed together. Use a rubber spatula to scrape every bit of the chocolate mixture into the processor and mix again to blend. Transfer the frosting to a bowl and allow it to sit a little before frosting the cake. Transfer cake to a serving platter. Use a pastry brush (or spoon) to put some of the syrup on the cake. Do not make too wet or the cake will be soggy and fall apart, use just a little bit here and there. Carefully spread the frosting over the cake starting in the center and working it to and around the edges. Make sure there is enough frosting to coat the top and sides of the cake.

Place the sliced cheese in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes so it gets nice and cold. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear all sides of the hot dogs until crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. While the hot dogs are cooking, heat the oil in another medium cast-iron or stainless steel pan over medium-high heat. Dredge the cold cheese slices in the flour. If the flour doesn\u2019t stick to the cheese, you can sprinkle it first with a little water and then dredge in the flour. Shake off excess flour and gently place in the skillet. Sear the cheese, without moving, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully flip the cheese and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute. If the cheese starts to melt in the pan, it\u2019s ok. Remove the pan from the heat. While the cheese is still sizzling, pour the brandy on the cheese and ignite with a lighter for that Opah! moment. Let the brandy burn for about 10 seconds, then squeeze the fresh lemon over to extinguish. Smear some Feta-Mint Tzatziki in each steamed bun, then top with a hot dog.

Toss the squash with 2 tablespoons of the oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread on a baking sheet and roast until tender and golden brown in spots, about 40 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Meanwhile, combine the broth and 2 cups water in a saucepan and heat until just barely simmering. Tie together the sage with kitchen twine and add to the stock. Reserve for a later use. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a low-sided stockpot set over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until translucent and soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the oats, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and stir until coated. Add the wine and simmer, stirring constantly, until absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups of the warm broth to the oats, then simmer, stirring constantly, until most of the liquid is absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 2 more cups of the broth and simmer, stirring constantly, until the oats are tender but still have a slight bite, 10 to 12 minutes. (There will be a fair amount of liquid in the pot at this time, similar to the texture of a thin gravy. It will thicken once the cheese is added.) Remove from the heat and stir in half of the cheese and half of the parsley. Adjust the consistency of the risotto by adding more stock as needed. Divide the hot risotto among four warm serving bowls, and top each with some butternut squash. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and parsley to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 16635,&quot;Potted Beef and Mushrooms 1 ounce dried porcinis, a handful 4 cups beef stock 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed 2 1/2 to 3 pounds cubed beef chuck, room temp, pat dry Kosher salt and coarse black pepper 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped 4 large or 5 to 6 medium portabella mushrooms, gilled and cut into 1-inch dice 4 cloves garlic, crushed 1 onion, chopped 1/2 cup dry red wine 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley tops, coarsely chopped 4 ribs celery, thinly sliced on an angle 1/2 lemon, juiced EVOO for drizzling 1/2 cup shaved pecorino cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; beat on medium speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and increase the speed to medium high. Beat in the granulated sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, adding a couple drops of black food coloring with the final tablespoon of sugar to tint the mixture light gray. Beat in the vanilla if using. Continue beating until the meringue is thick and glossy and holds stiff peaks, 6 minutes more.<br> Spray a 3-tablespoon (#20) cookie scoop with nonstick spray and scoop balls of the meringue onto the prepared baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Lightly dust the tops with cocoa powder--you should see meringue underneath. Bake the meringues until set, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, turn off the oven and keep the oven door closed. Let the meringues sit until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Then, hollow them out this way: Hold a meringue flat-side up in one hand. With the edge of a metal teaspoon, gently carve a hole in the center of the meringue&#39;s base, leaving some lip around the opening. Press your thumb into the hole and push the inside of the meringue up against the walls to hollow out the interior (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> Return the meringues to the baking sheet and place them in the turned-off oven until completely dried out, at least 3 hours and up to 8 hours.<br> With a wooden spoon, smash the rock candy sticks in their bags to break the sugar off the sticks and into smaller crystals.

Put a jelly roll pan or half sheet pan in the oven. In a large mixing bowl, combine the fingerling potatoes, onion, bacon, and rosemary leaves. Add 1/4 cup of olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Toss together to coat with olive oil. Take the preheated jelly roll pan out of the oven and drizzle some olive oil over entire surface. Cut the dough into 2 pieces and reserve 1 piece for another use. Stretch the pizza dough out so it is just bigger than the pan, then lay it inside the pan so the dough comes up the sides to form a crust on the rim. Pour the potato mixture onto the pizza dough, then sprinkle with shredded fontina. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until crispy and golden, about 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish with arugula and drizzle the lemon juice over the top. Serve immediately. In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes. If you&#39;re using a stand mixer, combine the salt and flour to the bowl and pulse a few times to mix. Add the yeast mixture, at the lowest speed, until the flour incorporates. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 2 minutes. Add the olive oil and pulse a few more times. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you&#39;re making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water, if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. If you&#39;re making the dough by hand, add the yeast mixture to a large bowl and stir in the salt and the 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then begin stirring in the flour. When the mixture becomes too stiff to stir with a spoon, knead in the rest of the flour by hand, adding just enough so that the dough is soft but not too sticky. As you work, squeeze a small amount of dough together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 16644,&quot;Emeril&#39;s New Orleans&#39; Asian-Style Braised Pork Belly 2 (2 1/2 pounds each) slabs pork belly 2 cups fresh squeezed orange juice 1 cup soy sauce 1 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice 1/2 cup fresh squeezed lime juice 1/3 cup minced garlic 1/4 cup minced ginger 1/4 cup minced green onion bottoms (white part only) 1/4 cup sambal oelek 4 cups chicken stock 12 ounces frisee lettuce, cleaned, rinsed and spun dry 1/3 cup rice wine vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place each portion of pork belly in a 1-gallon re-sealable plastic bag.

Lightly coat an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray, then line with parchment paper. Beat the egg yolks, brown sugar and vanilla and almond extracts in a medium bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until thick and pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold one-quarter of the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture with a rubber spatula. Gently fold the egg yolk mixture into the remaining egg whites until there are no more white streaks. Whisk the two flours in a medium bowl and gently fold into the egg mixture until combined. Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 13 to 15 minutes. As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Loosen the edges with a paring knife. Place another baking sheet on top of the cake and invert the cake onto it. Remove the top baking sheet and parchment. Dust more confectioners\u2019 sugar on the exposed cake. Cover with a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and place the baking sheet on top. Invert the cake again so it is on the towel and remove the top baking sheet. Starting at a long end, roll up the cake and the towel together to form a log. Place seam-side down on a rack and let cool, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Beat the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Reduce the speed to medium and beat in the mascarpone and vanilla until thickened, about 30 seconds (do not overbeat). Refrigerate the frosting until the cake has cooled. Gently unroll the cake with a long side facing you. Spread 1 1/2 cups frosting over the cake, leaving a 1/4-inch border on the two short sides and a 1-inch border on the far long side. Dollop the cherry jam on top and gently spread to cover the frosting. Reroll the cake (without the towel) and place seam-side down on a platter. Trim both ends, then cut off one 3/4-inch-thick slice. Unroll the slice slightly to cut off 3 inches of the spiral; reroll the slice into a spiral (this will be the knot of the log). Frost the cake with all but 1/2 cup of the frosting, using a small offset spatula to create a bark-like texture. Place the small cake slice on the side to look like a tree knot; cover with the remaining frosting. Put the chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Let cool, then transfer to a small resealable plastic bag and snip a corner. Pipe thin lines of chocolate onto the cake, pressing it into the frosting with the tip of the bag.

Pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the dough becomes crumbly. Add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time and pulse after each addition until the dough holds together but isn&#39;t wet. (Add additional tablespoons of water as needed.) Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and form into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a 12-by-1-inch pizza or tart pan with a removable bottom. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Flour a rolling pin and work surface. Roll the pie dough, starting from the center and working outward, into a 14-inch circle, about 1/4 inch thick. Lay the dough in the prepared pan and press it into the bottom and sides. Fold the excess dough inward and crimp. Dock the dough with a fork. Put a piece of parchment paper on top of the dough and weigh it down with pie weights, a butter knife or dried beans. Blind-bake on the center rack of the oven until the crust is pale golden and just firm, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool. For the cheesecake filling: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, granulated sugar, eggs and lemon zest and juice. Pour into the cooled pie crust and spread evenly with an offset spatula. Bake until the cheesecake is set and the middle barely jiggles, 50 to 60 minutes. Set aside to cool. For the cherry compote: Combine the cherries with their juices, granulated sugar, vanilla bean and lemon zest and juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the compote is thickened and syrupy, about 20 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Pour the compote over the cooled cheesecake filling, and spread evenly over the top. For the whipped cream: In a large mixing bowl using a hand mixer or whisk, or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and lemon zest until medium to firm peaks form. In a medium skillet over medium heat, toast the almonds, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. To serve the cheesecake pizza pie, top each slice with whipped cream and toasted almonds.

Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels and season on both sides with salt and pepper. Place a heavy saute pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add the oil and 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and swirl to coat the pan evenly. Add the pork chop to the pan and sear for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side. The chops will turn golden brown as the natural sugars in the pork caramelize and create a nice crust. Turn the chops and sear on the second side for 1 minute. Transfer to the oven and cook to desired doneness. It should take about 10 to 12 minutes in the oven for the pork to be just cooked through and juicy. Remove the pork from the oven and place the pork chops on a plate to rest while you make the sauce. Loosely cover with foil. Remove the excess fat from the pan and return the pan to the burner. Turn the heat to medium high. Carefully deglaze the pan with the sherry vinegar and sherry and scrape up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the veal stock and barbecue sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and reduce until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Whisk in the Dijon mustard and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and whisk to combine. Garnish with chopped tomatoes and minced chives. Serve the pork with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 16674,&quot;Frozen Lemon Whip with Blueberry Sauce 6 large egg yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 3 lemons, zested, plus thin slices for serving 2 cups heavy cream Blueberry Sauce, recipe follows Blueberries, for garnish 2 cups fresh blueberries 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 lemon, zested Instructions: Line a 6-cup jumbo muffin tin with paper muffin liners. Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl until well combined, then add the lemon juice and zest. Pour into a heavy bottomed saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens to the consistency of gravy, 8 to 10 minutes, (it should cling to the spoon when you stop stirring). Pour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve placed over a glass bowl. Stir the mixture occasionally to help release some of the heat. Once cooled to room temperature, put plastic wrap directly on the surface of the lemon curd to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until firm. In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks. Whisk the chilled lemon curd to loosen it and fold half the cream into it to lighten. Gently fold in the remaining whipped cream until just blended. Divide the lemon whip between the muffin cups, smoothing the tops. Put the pan on a sheet tray, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 4 hours. To serve, remove muffin tray from freezer and let stand 10 minutes. Serve immediately by placing thin lemon slices on a plate and inverting the lemon whip directly on top of the lemon slices (this prevents sliding on the plate). Drizzle berry sauce over the top and around the frozen lemon whip. Garnish with a few fresh blueberries and enjoy your refreshing cold treat!!! Put the blueberries in a small saucepan with the sugar, lemon juice and zest. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves and berries begin to burst.

For the filling: In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil. Sprinkle the short ribs generously with salt and pepper. When the oil is hot, add the short ribs and cook on each side until brown, about 3 minutes per side. When browned, remove the short ribs to a plate. Add in the apricots, capers and shallots, and stir, cooking until the shallots caramelize, about 2 minutes. Pour in the red wine and, using a wooden spoon, scrape up all brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Return the short ribs to the pan, transfer to the oven and cook until knife tender, about 2 hours 30 minutes. Halfway through the cooking process, check your short ribs and make sure there is enough liquid in the pot still, adding more red wine if necessary. When the short ribs have finished cooking, remove them from the oven and let the mixture cool slightly, enough to handle. Transfer the short ribs to a large mixing bowl, and with two forks, shred the meat from the bones, discarding the bones. Meanwhile, there should be about 1 cup of cooking liquid left in the pot. If there is more than 1 cup, place back on the stovetop over medium heat and reduce the liquid to 1 cup. Add your cooking liquid to the bowl with the shredded short ribs. Then add the tallegio and heavy cream, stirring all to combine. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper if necessary. For the crust: In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, salt, sugar and cinnamon. Add the shortening and butter and mix until it looks like wet sand. Mix in the raisins and walnuts. Slowly add 1 cup water, adding more as needed, until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into 5 even balls. On a floured surface, roll 2 balls out to 1/4-inch thickness. Save the remaining dough for other use. Transfer one crust to line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan. Fill your crust with the cooled short rib mixture, and then top with the second crust. Cut 3 1-inch-long vents into the top crust and brush with melted butter. Transfer the pie to the oven and bake until golden brown and the gravy bubbles through the vents, 45 to 55 minutes. Pull out of the oven and let sit for approximately 15 minutes. Slice and serve with a small side of arugula salad.

Add the cream, lemon juice and ghee. Use your hands to make mix lightly into a stiff and slightly sticky dough. Add more cream if too dry or more flour if too wet. The dough should be smooth(ish). Try not to over knead the dough as that will make the balls dense. Cover the bowl and let it rest while you make the simple syrup. For the syrup: Combine the sugar, 1 1/2 cups water, cardamom seeds and saffron in a medium saucepan. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the alcohol, if using, rosewater and lemon juice, bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the consistency of a light syrup, 15 to 20 minutes. If using whole cardamom, remove the pod from the water.<br> Fill a large Dutch oven halfway with oil, attach a deep-fry thermometer to the side of the pot and heat over medium-high heat to 280 to 285 degrees F. (It is important that the oil be kept at this temperature, if too hot the gulab jamun balls will brown on the outside but remain uncooked inside.)<br> Meanwhile, grease your hands with ghee or oil. Roll the dough into sixteen 1-tablespoon size balls (walnut-sized balls), making sure there are no cracks. (The dough will double in size when fried and will grow some more when soaked in the simple syrup.)<br> Once the oil is at the right temperature, gently add one ball at a time to the hot oil, making sure there is enough space for the balls to expand in size and not stick to each other. Gently stir the balls to make sure they are not sticking to the bottom of the pot or to each other. Fry the balls, turning every minute or so, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove and transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet or plate. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.<br> Put the warm gulab jamun in a glass baking dish large enough to hold all the balls with a little space around them and pour the warm syrup over them.<br> It&#39;s better to make the gulab jamun 1 to 2 hours before to let them soak the syrup. I like to zap or warm the jamuns before serving, but they can be had cold or at room temperature also. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container.

Do this while they are still warm from cooking so they absorb the marinade as they cool. It is best to prepare these the day before so they fully take on the flavor of the marinade. Toss the artichoke halves, roasted red pepper, basil leaves, feta cheese and Gigante beans together with 3/4-ounce of the vinaigrette. Season with a pinch of pepper, as the feta is already salty. Place on a chilled dinner plate, making sure all elements are exposed, in a croissant- shaped mound, leaving the void on the plate at the two &#39;o clock position. Dress the arugula with the remaining 1/4-ounce vinaigrette and place in a tight bundle in the void on the plate. Garnish the edge of the salad with basil oil. Toast sliced garlic in 2 tablespoons canola oil. Whisk together the toasted garlic and all other ingredients except the remaining oils. Slowly whisk the oil into the vinegar mixture to emulsify.

Heat the butter and olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken breast pieces and pan-fry them on both sides until they&#39;re done. Get as much golden brown color on the chicken as you can. When done, remove the chicken from the skillet and pour off any excess fat or oil (but don&#39;t clean the pan). Return the chicken to the skillet and pour over the hot sauce. Turn the chicken to coat it on both sides and let it sit in the sauce while you prepare the other ingredients. (The heat should not be on under the skillet.) Toss the salad greens in a large bowl with just enough Fast Blue Cheese Dressing to lightly coat (thin the dressing with a little milk if it&#39;s too gloopy). Heap some tossed salad into two individual bowls. Sprinkle blue cheese crumbles over the top. Slice the chicken into thin slices (on the bias) and arrange them over the top of each salad. (Dip the slices back into the sauce if necessary to really coat them.) Top the whole thing with more blue cheese crumbles, and serve with celery hearts.

Knead the dough for 5 minutes in the mixer. The dough should form a ball and be climbing up the dough hook. Add in 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and 1/2 a ladle of lukewarm water and mix until well combined. Remove the dough from the mixer, cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. Roll out with a pasta machine. Squeeze the lemons into a bowl of cold water. Peel and clean the artichokes and plunge them in water and lemon so they don&#39;t brown. One by one, slice the artichokes very thinly (you can do this on a mandoline if you prefer), returning to the ice water as you finish. Julienne the strips and return to the acidulated water. Brown the garlic in extra-virgin olive oil. Drain the artichokes and add them with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook on high heat for 8 minutes, then pour in the fresh cream and reduce it all for about 10 minutes. Perfume with fresh marjoram. Wash the tomatoes and plunge them into boiling water for 10 seconds, then plunge them in ice water. Peel them, seed them, and dice them. (Set aside a few tablespoons of diced tomato for garnish.) Get 2 sheets of egg pasta, boil them in salt water, let them cool and cut them with the help of a circular pasta cutter until you have 24 little disks. In an oiled cake pan arrange 4 individual pasta disks and put the artichokes, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and tomatoes on top. Repeat the procedure 5 times, making 6 layers. Preheat the oven to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Bake for 8 minutes. Arrange portions of the lasagna in the center of 4 plates and garnish with diced tomatoes, marjoram leaves and drizzle everything with extra-virgin olive oil. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 16715,&quot;Cherry Polenta Cake 3 large eggs 1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1/2 cup fine cornmeal 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 cups whole milk 2 teaspoons almond extract 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 cups pitted fresh cherries Confectioners&#39; sugar, for serving Instructions: Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Vigorously whisk together the eggs and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cornmeal, flour and salt, smoothing out any lumps. Whisk in the milk and almond extract. Add the butter to a 10- to 12-inch cast-iron skillet over direct heat. When the butter has melted, swirl it around to coat the bottom of the skillet. Right before you are ready to pour the batter into the pan, give the batter another whisk. (Cornmeal tends to sink to the bottom so re-whisking right before pouring it in is important.) Pour the batter into the cast-iron and cook until the batter begins to set, about 5 minutes. Every few minutes, using a rubber spatula, move some of the batter from the edges to the middle, like making scrambled eggs, to help it cook. Remove the skillet from the grill and distribute the cherries evenly over the surface of the cake. Place the cast-iron over indirect heat, close the grill and bake until puffed and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the cake from the grill and immediately sprinkle it with the remaining teaspoon of granulated sugar. Allow to cool slightly before loosening and sliding it onto a plate. Slice and serve dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar. (Alternatively, you can begin to bake the cake over medium-high heat on a stovetop, then finish it in a 375 degrees F oven for 30 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 16716,&quot;Radicchio-Pasta Salad Salt 1/2 pound orecchiette, cooked to al dente 2 tablespoons orange marmalade 1 small clove garlic, grated or very finely chopped 1 teaspoon finely chopped oregano leaves, from 2 sprigs 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 small red onion, chopped 1 head radicchio Instructions: Bring water to a boil, salt it and cook pasta to al dente.

Place fennel seeds in a small frying pan and toast over medium heat until fragrant. Place seeds in a small bowl and combine with olives, juice, zest, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside to marinate, at least 15 minutes. Heat a large ovenproof 12-inch frying pan over medium heat. Rub chicken with remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add chicken to the pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip chicken over with tongs and put it in the oven to finish cooking. (If you&#39;re not using an ovenproof frying pan, transfer the chicken to a baking dish first). Roast chicken for about 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature registers 160 to 165 degrees on a meat thermometer. Take the chicken out and let it rest for 5 minutes so that the juices settle. Transfer to a serving plate and top with reserved olive mixture.

Add the sliced onions, thyme, salt, and pepper and continue to cook, stirring occasionally until the onions become a deep golden brown and very soft, about 30 minutes. Add the flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the white wine and scrape up any dry bits on the bottom of the pan, increasing the heat to a boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the beef stock, and the chicken stock, and allow the soup to simmer for an additional 30 minutes as the flavors develop. Season the soup generously with salt, and pepper, to taste. Preheat the oven to broil, or turn on the broiler. Arrange the ciabatta cubes on a baking sheet and toast until crispy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the thyme sprigs and pour the soup into 4 to 6 oven-safe crocks or bowls. Top with the toasted ciabatta cubes and a generous amount of grated Gruyere. Place the crocks or bowls under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and begins to brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16721,&quot;Homestyle Jerk Chicken 6 chicken breasts, without skin or bone (or chicken supreme joints, with the wing bones still attached) 2 teaspoons ground allspice 2 teaspoons dried thyme 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons ground ginger 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 cloves garlic, peeled 1 1 3/4 piece gingerroot, peeled and cut into chunks 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1/4 cup dark rum 1/4 cup lime juice 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/2 cup cider vinegar 2 fresh red chiles, whole 1 onion, peeled and quartered Rice and Peas, recipe follows 1 (1-ounce) can gungo peas or black-eyed 1 tablespoon vegetable or peanut oil 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 red cl, seeded and finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped 2 cups long grain rice 1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk 2 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves Salt, to taste Instructions: I should start this by saying my home version of Jerk Chicken is different from the street-food, hot and crisp, that I&#39;ve eaten in Jamaica straight out of what looks like a metal barrel on its side. Well, it would be different, wouldn&#39;t it? It&#39;s not that I haven&#39;t tried to replicate the recipe, using whole quarters of chicken, with the bone still in and the skin still on, but it hasn&#39;t felt right. A domestic oven just doesn&#39;t get hot enough, and so although the spiced chili crust gets gratifyingly crisp, the skin doesn&#39;t - it can&#39;t - and flabby skin is just not to be countenanced. Thus, although the vinegary, limey, rum and spiced marinade makes the meat lusciously tender, you have to jettison its outer casing entirely. This seems too much of a waste to me. Now, you will rarely find me suggesting breast meat, let alone a breast fillet, so you have to believe me when I say that the heat of the marinade, and the meat&#39;s edible carapace work best when offset against the meltingly tender white meat within. And, in turn, I must say that I have never managed to make, or find, white meat that turns out so luscious and succulent. It&#39;s a miracle all round. I&#39;m stunned, but grateful. I have nothing to add, save the suggestion that you could consider working the same magic with some lean pork tenderloin as well. Don&#39;t cook this, though, unless you like it hot. And I mean hot. There&#39;s no point choosing to cook this and then trying to find a way to tame it, say by taking out the seeds from the chili (though you could if you must). Besides, although it packs a major punch, the sweet, creamy, coconutty rice that just must be served with it, offers the perfect counterbalancing salve. Slash the chicken breasts, 3 slashes a breast, each cut about 3/4-inch deep on the diagonal. Put in a rectangular dish, slashed-side down. Put all the other ingredients in the processor and blitz to a dark, earthy paste and pour and spread over the chicken pieces and leave to marinate out of the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours or in the refrigerator, (covered), overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Double-line a shallow roasting pan with aluminium foil. Tip into it the chicken with its marinade, slashed side up and roast for 30 minutes. Take the pan out of the oven, just to pour off excess watery juices. Use a pastry brush and spoon to place any paste back on the chicken and cook for a further 30 minutes, by which time the chicken will be cooked through and tender with a thick fiery crust. You could get started on the Rice and Peas once the chicken&#39;s back in the oven for its final stint. For serving: Pile up each dinner plate with coconutty rice and sit a piece of hot-crusted chicken proudly on top. Make Ahead Note: Jerk paste can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to non-metallic bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface. Cover bowl tightly with second layer of plastic wrap and refrigerate. The chicken can be marinated up to 24 hours in advance. Cover dish tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator. Freeze Note: The chicken in its marinade can be frozen, in a resealable bag, for up to 1 month. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator - put the bag in a bowl to catch any leaks. Making leftovers right: Should you have leftovers - and don&#39;t count on it if you&#39;re 6 round the table - refrigerate as soon as cooled and within 1 to 2 days you can simply snip some chicken into the rice and reheat until piping hot. However, I love this in a new form: a thick, coconutty soup punctured by fiery bursts of tender meat. Add some coconut milk and chicken broth to the leftover rice, along with some freshly grated gingerroot and a spritz of lime juice, and heat up, adding the chicken, cut into small strips or small chunks, once it starts bubbling. When the meat&#39;s piping hot, season to taste then pour your soup into a bowl (or bowls) and scatter with freshly chopped cilantro and slurp gratefully. Drain and rinse the gungo peas, and heat the oil in a heavy based saucepan that has a lid. Fry the onion for about 5 minutes, stirring every now and again, letting it soften and brown a little. Then add the chopped cl and garlic, and give everything a good stir around. Now stir in the rice, making sure it is all slicked with oil, then pour in the coconut milk and chicken or vegetable broth and stir in the drained gungo peas. Bring to a bubble, clamp on the lid, and turn down the heat to very low and let it cook gently for 15 minutes. Check the rice is cooked through and the liquid is all absorbed - give the rice another 5 minutes if it needs it. Sprinkle with the freshly chopped thyme and season with salt if desired, forking it through. &quot;,&quot;[Grenache, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah]&quot; 16722,&quot;Leboo&#39;s Buffalo Poppers - Semi-Homemaker Recipe 1 pound chicken tenders 1 (2.25-ounce) package seasoned bread coating mix (recommended: Shake &#39;N Bake Crispy Version) 1 cup buffalo wing sauce 1 tablespoon honey 1 cup lowfat ranch or lowfat blue cheese dressing Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Using an immersion blender, puree the marinade until smooth. Transfer to a re-sealable plastic bag and add the steak, seal and shake to coat. Refrigerate the beef for 2 to 4 hours to tenderize and flavor the beef. Preheat a ridged grill pan on high heat. Drain the marinade from the beef. Lightly oil the grill or grill pan. Season liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Grill the steak over medium-high heat and cook for 4 minutes on each side and then transfer to a cutting board and let rest. Depending on the size of your grill pan you may need to cook in batches. For the fajitas: Once the beef is off the grill pan and resting, add the bell peppers and onions tossed with lime juice and olive oil, if using. Grill the mixture for 7 to 8 minutes until the vegetables are just barely limp. While the peppers and onions are cooking, heat up the tortillas. Turn any free burners on a medium low flame. Place a tortilla on each flame and let it char about 30 seconds to 1 minute, flip the tortilla and repeat on the second side. Once heated and charred remove the tortilla to a clean tea towel and wrap to keep warm. Repeat until you have warmed all of your tortillas. You can also heat your tortillas in a microwave, lightly dampen a tea towel with some water, wrap the tortillas in the damp towel and heat in the microwave for about 1 minute. Check to see if they are warm, if not repeat the heating at 1 minute intervals until they are warm and pliable. Thinly slice the steak against the grain on a diagonal.

Blend thoroughly with an immersion blender and strain if needed. This is your \batter.<br> Tint the batter your desired color and flavor with your desired flavoring. Squirt the batter into the calcium chloride firming solution using a syringe, dragging to create \intestines\ and dropping drips to create \platelets.\ Lift out the pieces of batter with a strainer and rinse carefully with clean water. Set the pieces aside. For the edible glassware (if making): Preheat the oven or a toaster oven to 275 degrees F. Melt the isomalt in a 4-cup heatsafe glass liquid measuring cup in the microwave on high for 3 minutes. Stir, then melt in 1-minute increments until the isomalt is completely liquid. Hold in the heated oven or toaster oven for 10 minutes to release all the bubbles. Pour the isomalt into a food grade silicone glassware mold, then pour out any excess into the measuring cup. Let the mold cool completely. Unmold the glassware, then spray the inside with the food lacquer until completely covered. Drain upside-down on a cooling rack (to let any excess food lacquer drip out) until completely dry. Repeat for as many edible glasses as you need to make. For the zombie drink: Put some \intestines\ and \platelets\ into each edible glass or regular glass. Pour 1 tablespoon grenadine syrup into each glass, then add enough mineral water to fill. If serving in the isomalt glasses, serve immediately, as the drink will slowly dissolve the glasses; they won&#39;t last more than 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 16747,&quot;Whole Duck with Green Peppercorn Glaze 1 5 1/2-pound whole Long Island duck Kosher salt 1 cup light soy sauce 1/3 cup plus 1/4 cup honey 1 3/4-ounce jar or can green peppercorns in brine (about 2 tablespoons)<br> 1/4 cup champagne vinegar 2 tablespoons dry Marsala<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500? and arrange the oven rack in the center. Remove the innards of the duck and reserve them for another use or discard. Remove any loose pockets of fat surrounding the cavity. Season the inside of the duck with salt. In a pot large enough to hold the duck, combine 6 cups water, 3/4 cup of the soy sauce and 1/3 cup of honey. Bring the mixture to a simmer over low heat. Add in the brine from the green peppercorns, lower the heat and submerge the duck, breast-side down, in the pot. Let it simmer 30 seconds, basting the top with the liquid. Remove the duck and arrange it, breast-side down, in a roasting pan fitted with a rack that elevates it off the bottom of the pan. The rack will allow hot air to circulate around the duck as it cooks. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine.<br> Put the roasting pan in the oven and turn the temperature down to 400?. Cook for 30 to 35 minutes, until the duck is well browned. Remove the pan from the oven, then flip the duck. Using a turkey baster, remove the excess fat from the bottom of the roasting pan and transfer it to a heatproof liquid measuring cup.<br> Return the duck to the oven and cook for another 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size of your duck, or until well browned all over. When the duck is almost done, in a medium pot, combine the vinegar with the remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup honey, the Marsala and the green peppercorns. Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and simmer gently, allowing the glaze to reduce to a thin syrup and the flavors to blend, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Remove the duck from the oven and baste it with the drippings in the bottom of the pan. The duck should register about 150? when an instant-read thermometer is inserted into the thigh meat. Transfer the duck to a platter and pour half of the glaze over the breast and thigh meat. Reserve the remaining glaze for plating. Allow the bird to rest for about 15 minutes. Carve the duck and arrange on a serving platter.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until it is al dente, about 6 minutes. Strain, reserving 1 3/4 cups of the pasta water. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until lightly browned, breaking up the meat with the back of a wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. Transfer the browned meat to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add the onions, 1 tablespoon water and a pinch of salt to the saucepan and cook until just starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes, scraping up any browned bits with the wooden spoon. Add the bell peppers and cook until lightly browned and softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the onion and green bell pepper to the plate with the browned sausage. Carefully wipe out the saucepan (or give it a quick rinse if it is really dirty). Add the half-and-half and cayenne and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes. Add the cream cheese and stir until melted. Whisk in the Cheddar and Gruyere until all the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Add the macaroni and reserved pasta water to the saucepan and stir to combine. (The mixture will look very loose, but the pasta will suck up a lot of the sauce as it bakes.) Gently fold in the browned meat and vegetables and season with more salt if needed. Pour into a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Toss the hash browns with the melted butter and a pinch of salt and scatter over the macaroni and cheese.

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone sheet. Pulse the granulated sugar and lemon zest in a food processor until fine and fragrant. Lay 1 of the puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured work surface. Brush the sheet with about half of the butter and sprinkle with half of the lemon-sugar. Lightly press sugar into the pastry with a rolling pin. Place the other pastry sheet on top, brush with the remaining butter and sprinkle with remaining sugar. Carefully roll the pastry out into a 12-inch square, about 1 1/8-inch thick. Trim uneven edges with a pizza cutter or a knife to make a perfect square. Starting on the closest edge, roll the pastry up into a cylinder but stop at the mid point of the dough. Roll the pastry up on the opposite side so it looks like an old-fashioned scroll. Adjust the rolls so they are even and meet in the center. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 20 minutes. Slice the roll, crosswise, with a serrated knife into 1/4-inch thick pieces and lay on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the cookies soften, about 10 minutes. Working quickly and efficiently, remove the cookies from the oven--if they have lost their shape, gently roll them back together. Let cool on the pan for a minute to set. Turn them with a spatula (take care to keep the shape) sprinkle with the yellow sugar and return to the oven. Continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 more minutes. Transfer cookies to a rack, sugary sides up, to cool. Serve.

Add the carrots, celery, onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt and about 10 grinds black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables just begin to soften but don&#39;t take on any color, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the wine and simmer until completely evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the butter until completely melted. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir until it is completely incorporated and a sandy paste forms. Pour in the milk and stir until the flour has been smoothly incorporated into the liquid. Add the chicken and the chicken stock to the pot and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the parsley and peas and remove from the heat. For the dumplings: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, garlic salt, 1/2 teaspoon salt and about 10 grinds black pepper in a medium bowl. Stir in the melted butter until just combined, then add the milk and stir until a ball of dough forms. Use a small ice cream scoop or measuring cup to scoop 10 balls of dough into the pot (about 2 tablespoons each). Cover the pot and simmer over medium-low until the dumplings have puffed up and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes. Divide among bowls and sprinkle with more parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 16765,&quot;Profiteroles with Bourbon Ice Cream 2 cups whole milk 6 extra-large egg yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons bourbon 1 tablespoon dark rum 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 5 extra-large whole eggs 1 cup water 1 stick (1/4 pound) unsalted butter 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar 1 cup sifted unbleached flour 1 recipe Fudge Sauce (recipe follows) 1 egg combined with 1 tablespoon water Instructions: Special Equipment: Ice Cream Maker Pastry bag with a straight medium tip (optional) Bakers&#39; parchment To make the ice cream, pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring the milk gently to a boil over medium heat, being careful not to scorch it or allow it to boil over. Lower the heat and simmer 10 minutes, uncovered. Remove from heat. Meanwhile, in the large bowl of an electric mixer, bet the egg yolks and sugar together at medium speed 5 minutes. Then add several tablespoons of the hot milk to the egg/sugar mixture to temper the eggs. Return the pot of milk to the stove and, over low heat, add the egg yolk/sugar mixture in a slow, steady stream, stirring with a wooden spoon. Continue to cook 7 or 8 minutes, stirring constantly, until the custard has thickened and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and cool completely in an ice water bath. Stir in the bourbon, rum, and nutmeg. When the custard has cooled completely, add the heavy cream and freeze according to the directions for your ice cream maker. While the ice cream is freezing, begin the pate a choux, the classic French pastry from which cream puff shells (profiteroles) are made. Being careful not to break the yolks, break the eggs into a measuring cup or another container from which they can be poured one at a time, and set the container beside the stove. In a heavy-bottomed pot, bring the water, butter, salt, and sugar to a boil. When the liquid boils, stir in the flour all at once, using a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat to low and stir continuously 3 to 4 minutes, until the mixture pulls together and away from the sides of the pot. Chefs call this \cooking the flour out. What you are doing is coking away the raw flour flavor. Still over low heat, add the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each egg individually until it is completely absorbed by the flour before adding the next one. During this process, the mixture will take on a shiny gloss and become very elastic. When all of the eggs have been incorporated, remove from heat, place the mixture in a stainless-steel bowl and cool completely. To make the profiteroles, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Using a pastry bag with a straight medium tip, pipe out approximately 1 rounded tablespoon batter for each profiterole onto a cookie sheet lined with lightly buttered bakers parchment, spacing them approximately 1 inch apart. If a bag and tip are unavailable, use a tablespoon to mound the batter on the bakers paper. Brush each profiterole lightly with the egg wash, place in the preheated oven and bake 15 minutes before reducing the temperature to 350 degrees. Bake until the puffs are golden brown, about 12 minutes more. Remove from oven and allow to cool. When they have cooled completely, cut open and fill with a small scoop of ice cream. As you fill each profiterole, place it in the freezer to keep the ice cream frozen until you are ready to serve. To serve, place 1 profiterole on each plate, top with Fudge Sauce, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 16766,&quot;Instant Pot Thanksgiving Turkey Breast with Gravy 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary 1 clove garlic, finely grated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 skin-on, boneless turkey breasts (about 2 1/2 pounds each) 7 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 cups turkey stock or low-sodium chicken broth Instructions: Whisk the sugar, sage, thyme, rosemary, garlic, 5 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl until combined. Starting on the top edge of one turkey breast, gently lift the skin to separate it from the meat, but leave a 1/2-inch border around the perimeter where it&#39;s still attached to the breast. (You want to make a pocket to hold all the herbs and seasonings.) Stuff half of the herb mixture underneath the skin, massaging it into the flesh and evenly distributing it over the surface of the meat. Repeat with the remaining turkey breast and herb mixture. Let sit uncovered at room temperature for at least 1 hour or wrapped tightly in plastic and chilled for up to 3 days.<br> Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a 6- or 8-quart Instant Pot? set to the high saute setting (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the roux is deep golden brown and smells nutty, 4 to 6 minutes; scrape into a heatproof bowl and set aside (the roux will continue to darken as it sits). Add the remaining tablespoon butter and, working one breast at a time, cook skin-side down, undisturbed, until deep golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes; transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining breast. Add the wine to the pot to deglaze, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom, and cook until you can&#39;t smell alcohol and the wine smells fruity and sweet, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the stock, place the rack in the pot and position both breasts on the rack side by side to evenly cook.<br> Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on the high pressure setting for 15 minutes. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid.<br> Transfer the turkey to a baking sheet and let sit uncovered while you make the gravy.<br> Set the Instant Pot? to the high saute setting and bring the cooking liquid to a boil.

Set aside and let cool to warm. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit on the milk mixture for 1 minute. Add 4 cups of the flour. Stir until just combined, then cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside in a relatively warm place for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove the towel and add the salt, baking powder, baking soda and remaining 1/2 cup flour. Stir thoroughly to combine. Use the dough right away or place in a mixing bowl and refrigerate for up to 3 days, punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl. (The dough is easier to work with if it&#39;s been chilled for at least an hour or so beforehand.) To assemble the rolls: On a floured baking surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 30 inches by 10 inches. The dough should be very thin. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. For the filling: Pour the melted butter over the surface of the dough. Use your fingers to spread the butter evenly. Sprinkle over the granulated sugar and cinnamon. Don&#39;t be afraid to drizzle on more butter or more sugar! Gooey is the goal. Now, beginning at the end farthest from you, roll the rectangle tightly towards you. Use both hands and work slowly, being careful to keep the roll tight. Don&#39;t worry if the filling oozes as you work; that just means the rolls are going to be divine. When you reach the end, pinch the seam together and flip the roll so that the seam is face down. You&#39;ll wind up with one long buttery, cinnamony, sugary, gooey log. Slip a cutting board underneath the log and, with a sharp knife, make 16 equal slices. For the smear and base: Cream together the brown sugar, butter, honey and salt until lightened, then slowly add the whiskey and vanilla while mixing. Butter a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, layer the bottom with the pecan pieces and then scoop 5 large scoops of the smear on top. Heat in the oven until the smear is slightly foamy and bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and place the sliced rolls on top of the melted smear (it&#39;s fine to put them on the hot smear). Allow the rolls to rise for 20 minutes. Return the skillet to the oven and bake until the rolls are golden brown and the smear is brown and sticky, 20 to 30 minutes. Take another 12-inch skillet and place it on top of the hot skillet. Flip over quickly and carefully. All of the caramelly, boozy goodness will be on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 16768,&quot;Turkey-Vegetable Stew with Egg Noodles 6 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth 2 reserved turkey burgers, cut into bite-sized pieces 1 cup chopped onion 1 cup chopped celery 1 cup chopped carrots 2 bay leaves Salt and ground black pepper 8 ounces egg noodles 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: In a large stock pot or saucepan, combine broth, turkey burger pieces, onion, celery, carrots, and bay leaves.

Sprinkle the yeast over the top and stir gently. Let stand until the yeast begins to soften and turn foamy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the pumpkin puree, brown sugar and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Stir the yeast mixture into the pumpkin mixture. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until combined. Mix in the flour in three or four batches on low speed until just combined. Increase the speed to medium and beat in the butter, a few pieces at a time, until fully combined. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until the dough is smooth but still sticky, 4 to 6 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl and add the dough, turning to coat in the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Punch down the dough, cover again and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Make the cream cheese filling: Beat the cream cheese, egg yolks, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl and beat with a mixer until combined. Set aside. Make the pecan filling: Stir together the brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice and pecans in a medium bowl. Add the melted butter and mix until the pecans are coated and the sugar looks like wet sand. Transfer 1/2 cup of the pecan filling to a small bowl and combine with the flour (this is the topping). Set both bowls aside. Preheat the oven to 350? F. Lightly butter two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans. Line each pan with parchment paper, leaving at least a 2-inch overhang on the long sides. Butter the paper and place the pans on a large rimmed baking sheet.<br> Punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll out each piece into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread each rectangle with half of the cream cheese filling and sprinkle each with half of the pecan filling. Starting at a long side, roll up the dough into a tight log. Pinch the ends to seal in the filling. (If the dough becomes too soft, refrigerate the logs on a baking sheet until firm.) Fold the dough in half into a horseshoe shape, then cross the right half over the left, twisting into a figure-eight shape. Twist once or twice more, then fit into the prepared pans. Loosely cover each pan with plastic wrap. Set aside until slightly risen, about 20 minutes. Brush the tops of the dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the pecan topping. Bake the babkas, rotating the pans halfway through, until dark golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes. (If the tops begin to brown too quickly, tent with foil and reduce the oven temperature to 325? F.)

Use the lid to press against the tomatoes to extract as much juice as possible. Then use your hand to squeeze the tomatoes to a pulp. Reserve the juice and pulp separately and set the empty can aside. Heat the olive oil in a heavy saucepan over medium high heat until hot. If using the jalapeno, tilt the pan to collect the oil in a little pool against the side and drop the jalapeno into the oil. Cook until lightly brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the jalapeno and reserve. Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook briefly until light gold. Add the tomato juice and bring to a boil. Simmer rapidly for several minutes. Add the crushed tomato pulp. Then rinse the remaining pulp out of the can by filling it halfway with water and add that to the pan. Add the bay leaf, jalapeno, if using, and salt and pepper, to taste, and return to a boil. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and stir. Lower the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until the mixture thickens and the tomatoes have turned an orange red versus the pale blue red they were straight from the can, about 30 minutes. Add the oregano halfway through the cooking. Discard the bay leaf. Peel, seed and mash the jalapeno with a spoonful of the sauce and pass at the table so diners can add as much heat s they like to their plates. Variation for quick tomato sauce: substitute 2 pounds vine ripened tomatoes for the canned tomatoes. Peel the tomatoes, cut in 1/2 crosswise, and squeeze out the juice and seeds over a sieve suspended over a bowl. Chop the tomatoes. Proceed as directed, omitting the dried tomatoes and using jalapeno, if desired. The recipe may be increased proportionately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 16777,&quot;Sweet Potato and Star Fruit Chaat 1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 star fruit, sliced 1 to 3 jalapenos or other green cl peppers (depending on desired heat), finely chopped with seeds Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 teaspoon chaat masala spice mix 1/2 teaspoon roasted ground cumin (or 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground) 1/2 teaspoon chili powder Kosher salt Tamarind and/or mint-cilantro chutney, chopped fresh cilantro and pomegranate seeds, for topping Instructions: Place the sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water.

Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and reduce the cola down until one-quarter of the liquid remains, about 30 minutes. Chill to room temperature.<br> For the ice cream: While the cola is reducing on the stove, take the milk and sugar and bring to a simmer in medium saucepan to dissolve the sugar. Once the milk is warm, combine with the heavy cream and whiskey; this is your ice cream base. Pour the base into an ice cream machine and blend until a thick consistency is reached. Place in a freezable container and freeze for additional hour to firm the ice cream.<br> For the bread pudding: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. While the ice cream is finishing, place the yolks in a medium mixing bowl. Add the sugar to the yolks and beat until fully incorporated. Slowly pour the cream into the egg mixture, stirring constantly, and when all the cream is mixed together add half of your cola reduction, saving the other half for garnishing. Cut the bread into bite-size pieces and evenly distribute in a 9- by 12-inch nonstick pan. Pour the cream mixture over the bread and press down so that the bread absorbs the cream. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, uncover and bake for additional 15 minutes. The pudding should have firm consistency and slight browning on top. Remove from the oven.<br> While the bread pudding is still warm to the touch, cut out circles with a round cookie cutter and place in serving bowls.

Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the duck sauce, vinegar and garlic powder. Set aside. Prepare the vegetables: Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over medium heat. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath with cold water and ice cubes in a large bowl. Place a colander in the middle of the ice bath, not allowing any ice cubes in the colander. Add a generous sprinkle of salt to the boiling water. Drop the carrots, celery, scallions and cabbage into the water. Cook for 30 seconds. Using a spider, transfer the vegetables to the colander in the ice bath. Let them cool in the ice bath for 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a thick kitchen towel and wrap them up like a burrito. Wring the vegetables to remove excess water, then transfer to a large bowl. Make the filling: To the bowl of vegetables, add the sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, pepper, 1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder and some salt and stir to combine. In a second bowl, toss the Pork with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder and mix in 3 to 4 tablespoons of the duck sauce dipping sauce. Add the pork mixture and shrimp to the vegetable mixture and toss to combine. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Assemble: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and dust it with flour or cornstarch. Set aside. Place an egg roll wrapper on a flat surface with one of the corners facing you so it\u2019s oriented like a diamond. Brush the edges with the egg wash. Spoon about 1/2 cup filling in a line in the center, leaving about 1 inch on either side of the wrapper empty. Fold either side into the center, then cover the filling with the bottom edge of the wrapper, rolling away from you and rolling as tightly as you can around the filling. (Gaps, air bubbles or hanging pieces of wrapper will ruin the roll when you fry it.) Seal the edge closed with another brush of the egg wash. Place the roll, seam-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all of the filling and wrappers are used up. (You should yield 16 to 18 egg rolls.) You can also wrap tightly in plastic and freeze them at this point for a later date, but don\u2019t keep them frozen for more than 4 to 5 weeks. Fry the rolls: Pour the oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pot and heat to around 350 degrees F over medium heat. Fit a baking sheet with a wire rack. Working in batches, add several egg rolls to the oil and gently swirl the oil as they fry. This swirling will assure that they fry more evenly on all sides. Fry until they are light to medium brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer the egg rolls to the wire rack. Sprinkle with salt. Keep warm in the oven. Repeat until all are cooked, allowing the oil to return to 350 degrees F between batches. To serve: Let the egg rolls cool down slightly, then serve with the duck sauce and spicy hot mustard on the side for dunking. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking sheet on the center rack to preheat for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper. Remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and place on top of the stove. Drizzle it with the oil. Using tongs, place the pork loin or chops in a single layer on the hot baking sheet. (It will sizzle!) Place the baking sheet back in the oven. Lower the temperature to 375 degrees F and roast until the pork is cooked through with an internal temperature of 140 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes for a pork loin and 16 to 20 minutes for pork chops. Let rest for at least 10 minutes or until at room temperature, then cut into 1/4-inch dice. You can also wrap and refrigerate the pork overnight before dicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 16783,&quot;Neelys Short Ribs 1/4 cup olive oil, divided 6 pounds beef short ribs Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 large onion, coarsely chopped 1 carrot, chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 celery ribs, chopped 1 tablespoon tomato paste 2 cups dry red wine 3 cups low-sodium chicken stock 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes, in thick puree 3 thyme sprigs 1 bay leaf 1 orange, zested 1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat about 2-tablespoons of the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season the short ribs well with salt and pepper. Over medium heat, brown ribs for 6 minutes on each side. You will need to do this in batches. Remove the browned short ribs to a plate and repeat with remaining ribs and oil. Add onion, carrots, garlic, celery, and salt and pepper to the Dutch oven and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and wine to the vegetables and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Add the stock, diced tomatoes, thyme, and bay leaf. Return the browned short ribs and any juices that have accumulated back into the Dutch oven. Add orange zest. Cover with a heavy lid and place in the oven and braise for 3 hours or until the meat is very tender. Once the ribs are tender, remove the ribs to a platter. Taste for seasoning. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Serve the short ribs over the stone ground grits, if desired.

Put the milk, butter, salt and sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the flour all at once into the pan, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon or spatula. Cook this until the paste comes away from the side of the pan and forms a lump, then take the pan off the heat and let it cool a little. Put the paste into a bowl and stir in one egg, which must be completely blended in before the next egg is added, and so on until all the eggs have been incorporated. The paste is ready when it has a silky sheen and is supple and easy to pipe. When preparing swan shapes which need volume, preheat oven with steam to ensure an excellent rise and bake for 15 minutes to 20 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit. To Shape Swan: Fill the piping bag with choux paste and pipe 6 large cream puff, the size of a small egg, then 6 very thin 5-inch long \S\ shape which will form the head and the neck of the swan. When it is cooked and cooled, cut the top of the cream puff one-fourth of the way down. Fill the cream puff with chantilly cream (whipped cream). Cut the top of cream puff in two, placing the two pieces on either side of the cream to form the wings of the swan. Then place the bottom of the \S\ shape in the chantilly cream. The swan is ready.

Gradually stir in the milk and cook until mixture thickens, about 7 to 8 minutes. Be careful not to cook for too long. Cornstarch loses its thickening ability if it is cooked for too long. Remove pan from heat and whisk in the extract, salt and egg yolks until smooth. Place the pan back over heat, bring back to a simmer and stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, cook for 1 more minute. Be sure wooden spoon touches the bottom of the pan when stirring. Remove from heat; stir in butter. Slice 2 bananas and line the bottom of the prebaked pie shell with 1/2 the slices. Spoon 1/2 the filling on top, smooth with a spatula. Lay down another layer of banana slices, followed by remaining filling. Chill for at least 3 hours. Top with Chantilly Cream, then decorate with remaining banana, sliced. Serve immediately. Chill a mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer for 10 minutes before beginning. Beat heavy cream in the chilled bowl until it begins to foam and thicken up. Add the powdered sugar and continue to beat until the cream barely mounds. Do not overwhip. Cut the marshmallow in half and microwave for 10 seconds until soft and almost melted. Now, whip it into the cream to form soft peaks. Aside from adding a hint of vanilla flavor, the gelatin in the marshmallow will stabilize the cream. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 16789,&quot;Fish with Sweet-and-Sour Caponata 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 eggplant (about 1 pound), cut into 3/4-inch cubes 4 ribs celery, thinly sliced 1 small red onion, diced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 14.5-ounce can no-salt-added diced tomatoes 3 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar 4 teaspoons honey 4 skinless hake or cod fillets (about 6 ounces each) 1 cup packed fresh parsley, large leaves torn 1/2 baguette, sliced and toasted Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Grease the bottom and sides of a deep 13-by-9-inch baking dish with the butter. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, sour cream, maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt until smooth. Whisk in the eggs, one by one, until the custard is smooth. Stir in the bread cubes and let soak for at least 10 minutes. Pour the custard-bread mixture into the prepared baking dish and bake until golden brown on top and the custard is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely. Leave the oven on. For the meringue: Whisk the egg whites and salt until light and frothy in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add the cream of tartar. Slowly add the granulated sugar, a little at a time, whisking until the egg whites have quadrupled in size and are stiff and shiny. Finish the bread pudding: When the bread pudding is cool to the touch, stir to break it apart and then stir in the butterscotch and chocolate chips to evenly distribute them. Transfer one-third of the meringue to the bread pudding and fold it in until incorporated. Using the back of a spoon, spread the pudding into an even layer in the baking dish. Pipe the rest of the meringue on top in decorative peaks. Bake until golden brown and cooked through, another 30 to 35 minutes. For the bourbon sauce: Melt the ice cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the bourbon and nutmeg. Pour into a sauce dish and ladle over each serving of bread pudding. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Port, Tawny Port, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 16792,&quot;Pot De Creme 14 ounces milk 4 egg yolks 2.5 ounces sugar 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place the milk and vanilla bean in a saucepan, over medium flame, bring to boil. In separate bowl, beat the yolks with sugar. Pour the hot vanilla-milk into the yolk/sugar mixture, and stir.

Add the pork belly, cover, and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or up to 6 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Remove the belly from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Coat the pan with the vegetable oil and carefully sear on both sides until well browned. Remove the belly and reserve. Add the celery, bay leaves, carrots, garlic, onions and reserved marinade into the pan and cook until the vegetables are lightly browned. Pour in the wine to deglaze, followed by the ginger beer, and then scrape the pan to release the browned bits. Add the stock and the belly, cover, and braise in the oven until fork tender, about 3 hours (time will vary depending on the size of the belly). For the grits: Combine the milk and stock in a pot. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer and slowly whisk in the grits. Simmer, stirring often, until tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in the butter, and season with salt and pepper. Remove the pork belly from the braising liquid. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve into a saucepan. Skim all the fat from the surface, and then cook over medium-high heat until reduced by 40 percent. Before serving, gently reheat the pork belly in the jus. Serve over the grits and pour a little jus over. Toss the arugula with a little lemon juice and olive oil and place on top.

Remove from heat and steep for 2 hours. Preheat grill to high. In large bowl, combine the vinegar, oil, garlic, and parsley. Mix well, add the mushroom to the bowl, and marinate mushrooms for 15 minutes. On hot grill, cook the mushroom for 5 minutes on each side. Remove the mushrooms from the heat and julienne. Put the mushrooms in a bowl and toss with a little of the cl oil. Serve with cheese sprinkled on top. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 16815,&quot;Hawaiian Steamed Beef Buns 3/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees F) 3 tablespoons honey One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting if necessary 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for greasing 2 teaspoons canola oil, plus more for greasing 8 ounces 80/20 ground beef Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 small yellow onion, small dice 2 cloves garlic, minced 3/4 teaspoon Chinese five spice blend 3 tablespoons dry sherry 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce Instructions: For the dough: Whisk together the warm water and honey in a small bowl. Sprinkle in the yeast. Let the mixture rest until it bubbles, 4 to 6 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture and sesame oil and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. If the dough seems a little dry, sprinkle in a little bit of water. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface. If the dough is a little sticky, lightly dust the surface with flour. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.<br> Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with sesame oil. Form the dough into a ball and place it in the bowl, gently turning to coat. Cover with a damp clean dishtowel and let rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.<br> For the filling: Heat the canola oil over medium-high heat in a medium skillet. Add the beef and a sprinkle of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until lightly browned and no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer the beef to a plate.<br> Lower the heat to medium. Add the onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Return the beef to the skillet. Stir in the Chinese five spice powder and cook until very fragrant, about 20 seconds. Add the sherry and cook until the skillet is almost dry. Add the soy sauce, hoisin sauce and 1/4 cup water. Stir to combine and cook until the sauce has reduced and thickened, about 3 minutes. Cool completely.<br> To make the steamed buns: Cut the wax paper into eight 3-inch squares. Lightly brush a baking sheet with canola oil. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface. Punch it down and divide it into 8 equal balls. Roll out each to a 5-inch disc, working from the center to the outer edge and turning it often to keep the middle twice as thick as the outer edge. Cup the disc of dough in one hand and mound 2 tablespoons of filling in the center. Pinch the edges of the dough together with your other hand to seal the bun, Flip the bun over so that it is seam-side down and reshape it into a smooth round dome. Place it on a square of wax paper to keep it from sticking. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Arrange the buns (and wax paper) on the prepared baking sheet 2 inches apart and cover with a damp towel. Set the buns in a warm place to rise until plumped and puffy, 45 to 60 minutes.<br> Fill a large pot with at least 3 inches of water and bring it to a strong simmer over medium-high heat. Put 4 buns in the steamer insert, leaving 1 inch between them to expand. Drape a clean dishcloth across the top of the pot to prevent condensation from dripping from the lid onto the buns. (This step isn&#39;t necessary if you are using a bamboo steamer.) Cover the steamer and cook for 20 minutes. Repeat with the remaining buns. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16816,&quot;Online Round 2 Recipe - Potato and Shrimp Salad with Sour Cream and Bacon Dressing 3 tablespoons sour cream 1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard 1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves Reserved 2 pieces of bacon from Crispy Baby Potato Bites with Sour Cream and Bacon recipe, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Reserved potatoes from Crispy Baby Potato Bites with Sour Cream and Bacon recipe Reserved shrimp from Shrimp Stuffed Cucumber Cups, chopped 1 stalk celery, diced 1 1/2 pounds baby potatoes Kosher salt 1/4 cup canola oil 2 tablespoons chopped rosemary leaves Freshly ground black pepper 8 strips bacon 1 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard 2 tablespoons chopped chives, divided 2 standard cucumbers 3/4 pound medium shrimp, thawed, deveined and shells on 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish 1 teaspoon lemon juice Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 (15-ounce) can chopped tomatoes, drained 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, divided Instructions: In a serving bowl, whisk together the sour cream, mustard, parsley, bacon, and salt and pepper, to taste. Add the potato, shrimp, and celery. Toss everything together until it is all coated with the dressing and serve. Put the potatoes into a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over medium heat and add a generous pinch of salt. Cook for 8 minutes so they are tender but still slightly firm. Strain and let them cool. When they are cool, cut them in half and carefully scoop out the insides using a teaspoon or melon baller to form a cup. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the potato cups into a large bowl, add the oil, rosemary and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Carefully toss the potato cups to coat them with the oil. Arrange the potatoes, cut side up, on a baking sheet and bake until the cups are browned and crisp, about 15 to 20 minutes. While the potatoes are baking, put the bacon into a cold skillet and cook over medium heat until crisp. Drain the bacon well on a baking sheet lined with a brown paper bag. (Reserve 2 pieces of bacon for Round 2 Recipe Shrimp and Potato Salad with Sour Cream and Bacon Dressing.) Chop the remaining 6 pieces. In a bowl stir together the sour cream, mustard, 1 tablespoon chives, the chopped bacon, and salt and pepper, to taste. Arrange the potatoes onto a serving plate and fill each with a spoonful of the sour cream and bacon mixture. Garnish with the remaining chives and serve immediately. Peel the length of each cucumber to form alternating stripes of unpeeled and peeled. Cut the cucumbers into 12 (3/4-inch) pieces. Scoop out the center using a teaspoon or a melon baller, leaving the bottom and sides intact to form a cup. (Reserve the centers for the Round 2 Recipe Chicken Tacos with Cucumber Salsa.) Turn them upside down onto a towel and let them drain while you make the filling. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the shrimp and cook until bright pink, about 3 to 4 minutes. Strain and rinse in cold water. Remove the shells and discard. (Reserve 12 shrimp for the Round 2 Recipe Shrimp and Potato Salad with Sour Cream and Bacon Dressing.) Chop the shrimp into small pieces and put them into a bowl. Add the horseradish, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste, half the can of tomatoes (reserve the remaining half for the Round 2 Recipe Chicken Tacos with Cucumber Salsa) and 1 tablespoon of parsley. Evenly divide the shrimp mixture between the cucumber cups. Arrange them on a serving platter and garnish with remaining parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 16817,&quot;Toasted Coconut Gilded Macarons 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup blanched almond flour<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3 large egg whites, at room temperature<br> 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> 3 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> Red gel food coloring, for the batter<br> 1/3 cup desiccated coconut 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips or finely chopped chocolate<br> 5 sheets edible gold leaf Instructions: For the macaron shells: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using a 1 3/4-inch round cutter as a guide, draw 15 evenly spaced circles on each of two sheets of parchment paper (for a total of 30 circles). Flip the parchment over and line 2 baking sheets with the parchment paper.\u202f<br> Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, almond flour and salt in a large bowl and set aside.\u202f<br> Put the egg whites and cream of tartar in the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.\u202fBeat on medium speed until the mixture is opaque and foamy, about 30 seconds.\u202fIncrease the mixer speed to medium-high and continue to beat until the egg whites are white in color and hold the lines of the whisk, about 1 minute.\u202fContinue to beat while slowly adding the granulated sugar, then the vanilla, until the peaks are stiff and the whites are shiny, about 1 minute more. (Do not overbeat.) Transfer the meringue to a large bowl.\u202f<br> Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the dry mixture into the meringue, using 60 to 75 strokes (the batter should fold back on itself).\u202fJust before you are finished folding, add some red gel food coloring to the batter and continue to fold until the color is even and the desired consistency is reached. Spoon half the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain round tip.\u202fPipe the batter onto the parchment using the circles as a guide, refilling the bag as necessary. Tap the baking sheet hard on a table to flatten the batter out, then let sit at room temperature until the tops are no longer sticky when you lightly touch them, at least 20 minutes.\u202fRepeat with the remaining batter on the second lined baking sheet.<br> Bake the cookies 1 sheet at a time, rotating the baking sheet once halfway through baking, until they have formed a &#39;foot&#39; along the base and the tops are smooth and dry looking, about 14 minutes.\u202fLet cool completely on the baking sheets. (Leave the oven on.)<br> For the filling: Place the coconut on a baking sheet in a single layer and bake for 2 minutes. Stir the coconut, then\u202fbake for an additional 2 minutes. Stir again and bake for another 2 minutes. Continue in the same manner,\u202fkeeping an eye on it because it can go from toasted to burned very quickly, until the coconut is toasted to a medium-brown color, about 6 minutes more. Let cool completely.\u202f<br> Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling the pan a few times, until bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan but the cream is not yet boiling, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour over the chocolate in a bowl. Let sit for 30 seconds, then slowly whisk the mixture until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.\u202fFold in the toasted coconut. Let the ganache cool to room temperature.\u202f\u202f<br> Place the ganache in a disposable pastry bag. Snip about 1/3-inch from the tip and pipe about 1 tablespoon onto the flat side of a macaron shell. Place a second shell on top, pressing very gently to sandwich the filling. Repeat with the remaining macaron shells and filling.\u202f\u202f<br> To decorate: Place a gold leaf sheet face-down on a macaron shell, handling the gold leaf very gently, and rub gently with your finger or a brush so that the gold leaf separates from its baking paper and adheres to the macaron shell.\u202fRepeat with the remaining macarons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16818,&quot;Janette&#39;s Healthy TV Dinners Janette&#39;s Lasagna Roll-Ups, recipe follows Janette&#39;s Meatless Meatballs, recipe follows 1 (10-ounce) box frozen peas Butter-flavor cooking spray, for seasoning peas 8 canned peach halves, drained 1/4 cup lowfat granola Ground cloves, for sprinkling over peaches Ground cinnamon, for sprinkling over peaches 8 whole wheat lasagna noodles, or regular 2 cups fat-free pasta sauce 1 cup lowfat ricotta 1 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper</li></ol></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/eggs, beaten.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/drained%20and%20finely%20chopped.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>drained and finely chopped</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/For%20Meringue%20Cloud%20Cookies.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>For Meringue Cloud Cookies</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
