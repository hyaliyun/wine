Ragu, recipe follows 1 (10-ounce) box chopped frozen spinach, defrosted and drained Olive oil flavored cooking spray 1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese 1 1/2 cups Portobello Ragout, recipe follows 2 tablespoons ground toasted almonds 1 egg white 1 teaspoon garlic salt Olive oil flavored cooking spray Nonstick cooking spray 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 large onions, chopped 3 large cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 pounds portobello mushrooms, chopped and stems removed (about 8 cups) 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons dry nonfat milk 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves 2 tablespoons lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: If using a disposable baking pan, fold up several layers of heavy-duty foil to create 2-inch wide strips. Fit the strips into the baking pan to form 1 large and 2 smaller compartments. Spoon 1/4 cup of the Lasagna Roll-Up sauce into the large compartment of each tray. Put 2 roll-ups and 3 \meatballs\ over the sauce in each tray. Spoon remaining sauce over the top and sprinkle with Parmesan. Divide the frozen peas among 1 of the remaining compartments in each tray and spray a little \butter\ over the top. Put 2 peach halves in the remaining compartment of each tray. Sprinkle with granola, cloves and cinnamon. Cover the trays tightly with aluminum foil and freeze until ready to use, up to 3 months. To cook: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Let dinners stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Bake dinners until heated through, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a shallow baking dish with the cooking spray and set aside. Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and pat dry. Spread 1 cup of the pasta sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. In a small bowl, combine the ricotta, kosher salt, pepper, cayenne, nutmeg, and 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan. Spread 2 tablespoons of ricotta mixture across 1 end of a lasagna noodle, about 1-inch from the edge. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the ragu over the ricotta and top with 2 tablespoons of spinach. Roll up the noodle around the filling. Repeat with remaining noodles and filling. Place the roll-ups in the prepared pan as you make them. Spoon the remaining sauce over the roll-ups and sprinkle with the remaining 5 teaspoons Parmesan. Bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Reserve 1/4 cup of the bread crumbs and mix with the Parmesan cheese. Set aside. Combine all remaining ingredients in a medium bowl. Form the mixture into 12 (1-inch) balls. Roll the meatballs in the bread crumb/cheese mixture to coat evenly. Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat until hot. Add meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned on all sides, about 2 minutes. Lightly spray the top with olive oil spray and shake pan to coat the balls. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 12 minutes to ensure that the egg is fully cooked Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray, add the olive oil, and place over medium heat until hot. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more. Add the mushrooms and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes. The salt will help to pull the moisture out of the mushrooms and create a nice, dry texture. Stir in Parmesan and dry milk and cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in parsley and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 16819,&quot;Bacon-Wrapped Pork Kebabs 1 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup sugar 2 bay leaves 4 sprigs fresh thyme 3 garlic cloves, smashed 4 cups ice cubes 16 to 20-ounce trimmed pork tenderloin or pork loin, cut into 24 1-inch cubes 1 pound whole slab apple-wood smoked bacon, chilled 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning 1 tablespoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon paprika 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Canola oil, for brushing grill Orange Honey Mustard Sauce, recipe follows 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 small shallot, finely diced 1 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons orange blossom honey 1/4 cup country Dijon mustard Instructions: For the brine: Combine salt, sugar, bay leaves, thyme, and garlic in a pot with 2 cups water. Bring to a boil and once everything has dissolved remove from heat. Add ice cubes to cool down and set aside. For the pork: Place the pork cubes in the cooled brine and set in the fridge for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the bacon into six 1/2-inch-thick slices, about 2 1/2-ounces each. Set a large pot of cold water over high heat and add the bacon slices. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the Italian seasoning, granulated garlic, paprika, salt and pepper. Drain pork from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Working with one skewer at a time, thread the bacon at one end followed by a piece of pork. Loop the bacon over the pork so it forms an \S\ shape around the pork and continue to thread the bacon and pork together so each skewer has 4 pieces of pork and one thick strip of bacon on it. Sprinkle all with the seasoning mixture. Heat a grill to medium and wipe down grates with oil. Place pork kebabs across grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each of four sides until bacon is crisped around edges and pork is a tender medium. Once the pieces have been seared, glaze the kebabs with the Orange Honey Mustard. Heat the oil in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the shallots and saute until softened. Add the orange juice, honey and mustard, whisking to thoroughly combine. Bring to a simmer and reduce for 8 to 10 minutes. Stir well, remove from heat, and keep warm until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 16820,&quot;Cornbread Stuffing with Sausage and Apples 1/2 pound bulk pork sausage 1 cup small diced onions 1 cup small diced celery 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon fresh, chopped sage 1 tablespoon fresh, chopped rosemary 1 tablespoon fresh, chopped thyme 3 cups crumbled cornbread 3 cups cubed stale bread 1 cup chicken stock 1 large peeled, cored and diced apple 2 tablespoons chopped parsley 1 tablespoon poultry seasoning 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 cup chopped red pepper 1/2 cup raisins (optional) Instructions: Saute sausage until brown. Remove from pan and place in a large mixing bowl. Saute onions and celery in butter. Add sage, rosemary and thyme. When the mixture is softened, about 3 minutes, put into bowl with sausage. Add the remaining ingredients to the mixing bowl. It mixture is too dry add more stock. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Zinfandel]&quot; 16821,&quot;Fricasse of Rabbit with &#39;Reisling&#39; 8 Rabbit rear legs Salt Pepper 1 cup super-fine flour 1 tablespoon butter 2 rabbit bones 1 carrot 1 onion 1 celery stalk 2 heads garlic 15 juniper berries 10 peppercorns 10 branches thyme 10 branches rosemary 1 bottle Riesling 1 quart chicken stock 3 egg yolks 1/2 cup flour 3 ounces fromage blanc Pinch nutmeg Salt Pepper 1 cup milk 1/2 gallon boiling, salted water 1 tablespoon vegetable oil White truffle oil Instructions: Blanquette: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Season rear legs with salt and pepper, dust with super-fine flour. Lightly brown in butter. In a large rondeau over medium heat, lightly brown bones, all vegetables and aromatics and sweat slowly. Place rabbit legs on top of vegetables and deglaze with Riesling. Bring to a slow simmer and reduce until all of the liquid has nearly evaporated. Add the chicken stock 2/3 of the way up the meat. Cover and braise in oven until tender, approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Spaetzle: In a small mixer, blend egg yolks, flour, fromage blanc, nutmeg and salt and pepper. Whisk slowly to form a paste. Whisk in milk slowly until mixture is slightly heavier than a pancake batter. Pass through a small colander into the boiling water until the spaetzle comes to the surface. Remove spaetzle to a baking sheet lined with a paper towel. Once spaetzle is dry, heat vegetable oil in a saute pan until hot. Add the spetzele and cook until crisp. Remove spaetzle from pan onto a paper towel lined baking sheet. Drizzle with white truffle oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay]&quot; 16822,&quot;Maple-Walnut Cream Pie 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 4 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 3/4 cup finely chopped walnuts 1 1/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin powder 1/2 cup pure maple syrup (preferably grade B) 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 cups cold heavy cream 2 large eggs 1/4 teaspoon maple extract 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Make the crust: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor to combine. Add the shortening and pulse until the mixture looks like cornmeal. Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Add the vinegar and 2 tablespoons ice water; pulse until the dough just comes together but is still crumbly. Turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap; shape into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9 1/2 -inch deep-dish pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers or a fork. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the crust with foil, then fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until lightly golden around the edge, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue baking until golden all over, about 15 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Spread the walnuts on a baking sheet; bake until toasted, about 7 minutes. Let cool completely. Dissolve the gelatin in 1/4 cup warm water.

Stir often as the caramel slowly melts. When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and stir. Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take 1 to 2 minutes. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don&#39;t let it sit too long-- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it. Take a teaspoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll with the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long. Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on waxed paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center rolls sit out for 1 to 2 hours to firm up. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and working quickly, \paint: a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn the center over, caramel side down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto waxed paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients. Place the bars into your refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours so that they firm up. Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the microwave for 2 minutes on 50 percent power. Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds. Don&#39;t over-cook the chips or the chocolate will burn and seize up on you. Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate. Cover the candy bar with chocolate using 2 forks, 1 in each hand. When the candy is covered with chocolate, balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off. Carefully place the candy bar onto waxed paper and remove the 2 forks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, and then chill the candy bars until firm. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 16836,&quot;Provencal Tuna Sandwiches 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup red wine vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 4 8-inch-long pieces French or Italian bread, split open 1 clove garlic, halved 3 large plum tomatoes, cored (1 halved, 2 thinly sliced) 2 6-ounce jars tuna in olive oil (preferably Italian), lightly drained 1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips 1/2 English cucumber, thinly sliced 1/4 cup packed fresh parsley 2 tablespoons capers, drained Instructions: Whisk the olive oil, vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl.

Whisk well, until the dough is soft and sticky. Heat the butter and oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. When the butter begins to foam, add the garlic, chives, parsley and marjoram. Cook until the butter begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add the white wine and allow to reduce for a minute. Keep warm. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Transfer the spaetzle batter to a colander with small holes. Set the colander above the boiling water and, using a spatula or bench scraper, press the batter through the holes and directly into the water. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the spaetzle float to the surface. Drain and immediately add the spaetzle to the pan with the butter sauce. Over high heat, toss the spaetzle and the sauce together for 30 to 40 seconds, or until the spaetzle sizzles.

Use a 8 by 8-inch baking dish or one of similar size, and butter the bottom and sides with 1 tablespoon butter. Wash potatoes and thinly slice them, using a mandolin, to approximately 1/16-inch thick. Layer 1/5 of the sliced potatoes into the baking dish, making 2 thin layers of potatoes overlapping. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of the Parmesan cheese. Top with 1/2-cup fruit, salt, pepper and 1/2 cup cream. Repeat this step 4 more times, ending with the potatoes. Top the potatoes with the remaining cream and the 3 tablespoons of the butter cut into small pieces. Sprinkle with the rest of the cheese. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 2 hours.

Add just enough water to give the sugar a wet sand consistency. Cook until caramelized. Add the hazelnuts and the almonds and mix with a wooden spoon until coated. Cook until everything is nicely coated and caramelized (dark in color). Remove from the heat and pour onto a sheet of parchment paper. Allow the mixture to cool for a few hours. When cooled, use a food processor to break up the caramelized nuts. Add the peanuts to the food processor and grind until the nuts release their oils and form a paste with the consistency of smooth, old-fashioned peanut butter. Using a double boiler, melt the cocoa butter until completely smooth. Combine the cocoa butter with the chopped bittersweet chocolate until tempered. Mix the chocolate cocoa butter into the nut paste. Add the salt and mix until combined. Pour the mixture onto a plastic wrap-lined sheet pan. Allow to set for a few hours or overnight. When cooled, use an offset spatula to coat the top of the mixture with the milk chocolate. This will be the top of the finished candy so make this layer of milk chocolate a little thicker than you will on the bottom layer. When the chocolate has set, cover with parchment paper and flip over to expose the uncoated side. Using an offset spatula, coat this side of the mixture with milk chocolate. When the chocolate has set, use a sharp chef&#39;s knife or a rolling cutter to cut into the desired sized pieces. Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.

Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Add butter to work bowl and pulse about 15 times until mixture is fine and powdery and resembles coarse ground cornmeal and no large pieces remain. Add the eggs and pulse ten times or so, until the dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. Press the dough into 2 equal disks. Sandwich the disks of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press into a 6-inch circle. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour. To make the filling, pit the cherries over a bowl. Slash the side of each one with a stainless steel paring knife and squeeze gently to extract the pits. Put the cherries in the bowl as they are pitted. When all the cherries have been pitted drain the juices from the bowl into a non-reactive saucepan and add 1 cup of the cherries and the sugar. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is very liquid--about 5 minutes. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and whisk the cherry and sugar mixture into it. Return to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over low heat, until it comes to a boil thickens and becomes clear. If it does not become clear, continue to cook over low heat an additional few minutes until it does. Pour into a large bowl and stir in the remaining filling ingredients, except the cherries then add the remaining cherries. Set racks at the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in pan. Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Prepare a diagonal lattice top crust. Flute the edge of the pie and carefully brush it with egg wash. If you wish, sprinkle the top the pie with sugar. Place the pie in the oven an and lower the temperature to 375 degrees. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is baked through and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently bubbling. If the top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30 minutes, move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10 minutes. Cool the pie on a rack. Serve wedges of pie alone or with ice cream. Keep the pie at room temperature on the day it is baked. For longer storage, refrigerate the pie well wrapped in plastic. To reheat remove the plastic and bake the pie at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 16853,&quot;Bamya 1 pound boneless lamb stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 teaspoons Lebanese seven spice<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 medium onion, finely chopped<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 cup lightly packed fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, chopped<br> One 14-ounce bag frozen small okra (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> Kosher salt<br> One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes<br> 2 tablespoons tomato paste<br> Juice of 1 lemon<br> Instructions: Mix the lamb with 1 teaspoon seven spice blend in a large bowl, tossing to coat, and set it aside.

In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat, add the sliced onion and minced garlic, saute for about 2 minutes. Then add the chicken slices and cook until chicken is a nice golden brown. Turn the heat up a touch and add the bell pepper slices and dried chili flakes. Once chicken is no longer pink remove from the heat and place the mixture into a bowl. In a small skillet add 1 cup oil. When oil is warm submerge a tortilla for 10 to 15 seconds or until soft. This will soften them and make rolling a lot easier. Drain on paper towels and repeat this process until all tortillas have been softened. Pour 1 cup of Green Sauce on bottom of the baking dish to cover. Divide the chicken mixture evenly among the tortillas, roll them up. Place seam side down on top of the sauce in the baking dish. Pour the remaining green sauce over them and spread the cheese mix evenly over the top. Bake for about 20 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve with long-grain rice. For the Green Sauce: Pulse all ingredients in a food processor until a nice salsa consistency is reached. For the Rice: Pour 3 cups of hot water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Rinse the rice well in a bowl under cold water and drain. This will remove surface starch and will be less sticky. Place the rinsed and drained rice into the saucepan, cover and cook until al dente, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Microwave the dissolved gelatin, stirring every 10 seconds, until melted.<br> Combine the cream cheese, buttermilk, brown sugar, vanilla, salt and melted gelatin in the food processor and process until smooth and the sugar has dissolved. Rub a little of the mixture between your fingers, if it is still gritty then continue to process.<br> Pour the cream cheese mixture into the crust and spread evenly with an offset spatula. Wrap the pan loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the cheesecake layer is set, about 2 hours. For the topping: Put the chocolate chips in a small microwave-safe bowl. When you are ready to assemble the pie, microwave the dulce de leche in a second small microwave-safe bowl until it is loose enough to drizzle, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Microwave the heavy cream in a third small microwave-safe bowl until hot but not boiling, about 30 seconds. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and allow to sit for 1 minute. Stir until completely smooth. The sauce will thicken as it cools slightly. Use a serrated knife to cut the remaining cookies in half cross-wise. Drizzle the chocolate sauce and caramel sauce on the cheesecake. Decorate with the cookies halves.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 16888,&quot;Sweet Irish Soda Bread 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter 2 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening 1 egg, beaten 1 cup buttermilk 1 cup currants 2 tablespoons toasted caraway seeds 1 tablespoon melted butter 1 tablespoon sanding sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Add the brown sugar, cinnamon and apples and cook until the apples are caramelized and have started to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool, then keep in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). For the turnover: Roll out the puff pastry to 10 by 10-inch square with a 1/8-inch (3mm) thickness on a lightly floured surface. Transfer to a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spoon the apple filling over half the pastry, leaving a border around the edge. Beat the eggs with 1 teaspoon water for the egg wash. Brush the edges of the pastry lightly with some of the egg wash. Fold the pastry over the filling to form a triangle. Press the edges to seal and enclose the filling completely, then press with the back of a fork to make a tight seal. Using a small knife, cut two 1/2-inch-long slits in the top of the crust. Brush the top with the egg wash. Bake the turnover until the crust is puffed and golden and the juices are bubbling through the slits in the crust, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle the turnover with the confectioners&#39; sugar. Turn the oven to broil, and cook until the sugar is caramelized, watching it closely so it doesn&#39;t burn. This will give the turnover a browned crust. Carefully run a metal spatula under the turnover to loosen and transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly. To serve, cut the turnover into wedges and serve warm with a dollop of cheese, yogurt or ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 16898,&quot;Clotted Cream 2 cups pasteurized (not ultra-pasteurized) cream Instructions: Set a coffee filter basket, lined with a filter, in a strainer, over a bowl.

Put the tray in the center of the oven and bake for 8 minutes, then raise the temperature to 375 degrees F and bake until the cookies are golden brown around the edges and form a nice shell-like exterior, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes before gingerly removing them from the tray with an offset spatula. Take care! They can stick to the paper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 16911,&quot;Strawberry Couscous Breakfast Bowl 3/4 cup almond milk, plus more if needed 1/2 cup whole wheat couscous 1 teaspoon pure maple syrup, plus more if needed 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more if needed 2 tablespoons pecans 4 strawberries, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons 2-percent Greek yogurt, optional Instructions: Pour the milk into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.

Dip the top and bottom of the beef into the coffee beans. Place the beef, espresso-crusted end down, in super-hot, ovenproof cast iron pan. Sear all sides of the beef, saving the other espresso-crusted side for last. Place the un-seared side down in the pan and move into a 500-degree oven. Cook until desired temperature, 2 minutes being rare and 8 being well done (times will vary). Allow meat rest for a few minutes after cooking, as it allows the juices to spread out from the center where they&#39;ve contracted during the cooking process. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 16913,&quot;Confit of Brussels Sprouts 1 pound Brussels sprouts, cleaned and trimmed (if large, halve them) Salted water 1/2 cup butter melted Salt and pepper Instructions: Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, add sprouts, and cook them 2 minutes to blanch them.

Put sweet potatoes in a glass or stainless steel bowl. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in brown sugar and lemon juice. When sugar is completely melted, stir in Toasted Spice Rub and gray salt. Pour mixture over sweet potatoes. Toss well. Arrange sweet potatoes in a baking dish, cut side up. With rubber spatula, scrape all the butter and spice mixture over the top of the sweet potatoes, and then add a sprinkling of Toasted Spice Rub on top of each one. Cover with foil and bake at 375 degrees F until easily pierced with a knife. Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes.

For the pastry: Roll the pastry to 1/4-inch thickness and cut into 6 (6-inch) rounds. Place the pastry in 6 (4-inch) tart molds. With a knife trim the excess pastry. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Line each tart shell with a piece of parchment paper and fill to the rim with pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Remove the pie weights and parchment from the tart shells and bake for 10 minutes. For the filling: Whisk together the lemon juice, eggs, yolks, sugar, and vanilla extract. Pour the lemon mixture into a medium pot. Place over medium heat and stir with a spatula for about 5 minutes, until the mixture begins to thicken. Pour the lemon mixture onto a baking sheet and cool completely. Spoon the cooled lemon mixture or curd into the baked tart shells. For the meringue: Beat the egg whites with the vanilla extract and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Continue beating while adding the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. The finished meringue should have stiff glossy peaks. Mound the meringue on top of the tarts. Make sure there is a good seal between the meringue and the edge of the crust. Bake the tarts in a preheated 350 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the meringue is golden. Let cool for 15 minutes before removing from the molds. Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Using a cheese grater, grate the butter and shortening into the flour. Combine the mixture with your fingers until it resembles cornmeal. Add the ice cold water and mix with a spoon, pulling the water into the flour until a dough forms. With your hands, shape the dough into 2 balls and flatten them into disks. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days and in the freezer for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 16922,&quot;Cubano Sandwiches with Mojo-Braised Pork Shoulder 4 pounds boneless pork shoulder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as necessary<br> 2 small yellow onions, finely chopped<br> 2 teaspoons dried oregano<br> 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 2 dried chiles de arbol, crumbled<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 3 cups low-sodium chicken stock or water, plus more if necessary<br> 1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed lime juice<br> 1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice<br> 1 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/3 cup honey mustard<br> 8 sandwich rolls, such as Portuguese rolls<br> 1 pound Swiss cheese, thinly sliced<br> Pickled red onions, for serving<br> 16 thin slices Black Forest ham<br> Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the pork shoulder on a parchment-lined baking sheet or plate and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Preheat a medium Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and swirl to coat. Add the pork shoulder and brown on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pot and add the remaining tablespoon olive oil. Add the onions, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until softened, 3 minutes. Add the dried oregano, garlic, chiles de arbol and bay leaf and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the pork shoulder back to the pot fat-side up, then add the chicken stock, lime juice and orange juice, adding more stock or water if necessary to reach halfway up the meat. Bring to a simmer and cover the pot. Transfer to the oven and braise, basting with liquid every hour, until the pork shoulder is very tender and falling apart, 4 to 6 hours. Remove the pork from the braising liquid and shred into large bite-sized pieces. Skim the fat from the braising liquid, then cook to reduce over medium-high heat to about 1 1/2 cups. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper. Return the pork to the liquid, toss to combine, and keep warm. Combine the mayonnaise and honey mustard in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Split the rolls, then spread each with a scant 3 tablespoons of the mayonnaise mixture. Divide the Swiss cheese among the top and bottom rolls. Top the bottom rolls with the pickled red onions, pulled pork and ham. Close the sandwiches. Heat a cast-iron skillet over low heat. In batches, transfer the rolls to the skillet and place another skillet on top. Cook until the bottom portions of cheese are melted, then flip the sandwiches and continue to cook until heated through and the cheese has melted.

Toss the mushrooms with some oil and salt and spread them out on two baking sheets. Roast until slightly shriveled but still tender, 15 to 17 minutes. Sprinkle with crumbled nori. Add the rice to a pot; cover with water by 1/4 inch. Bring to a boil and cook uncovered until small holes appear on the surface of the rice. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot and steam for another 12 to 15 minutes, until the rice is fluffy and all the water is evaporated. While the rice is cooking, saute the lap cheong in a skillet until the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Mix the sausage into the cooked rice. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a wok. Add the garlic and ginger and saute until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and saute briefly just to brown the shells, another minute or two. Add the ketchup, oyster sauce, Worcestershire, tamari and black pepper. Cook until the sauce is reduced and the shrimp are cooked through, about 3 minutes more.

Pulse several times until all ingredients have been finely diced. Once finely diced, slowly drizzle olive oil into food processor, while pulsing. Taste, add salt and pepper, as needed. Remove puree from processor and add to a large skillet over medium heat. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to low. Scallops: Pat and dry scallops with paper towels; lightly season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Heat olive oil and butter in large skillet over very high heat.

Place the almonds in the food processor and grind until coarse. Remove the boiling sugar from the heat and pour over the coarse almonds. Blend until smooth. This may take 10 minutes or more, depending on the strength of the food processor. Remember, food processors are not usually strong enough to yield the same consistency as the almond paste that you can buy. If your mixture is too thick and the food processor is straining, you can add a little Kirsch or simple syrup to the processor. Add the liquid slowly and stop when the processor is moving more freely. The quality of almond paste is determined by how smooth the consistency is. Wrap the almond paste in plastic wrap and allow it to cool. When you are ready to use it, knead in the butter. The butter makes it smooth and not so sticky. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16933,&quot;Mozzarella, Cherry Tomato and Basil Skewers 1 clove garlic, smashed 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 12 bocconcini (small mozzarella balls), about 8 ounces 1 pint mixed red and yellow cherry or pear tomatoes 12 basil leaves, preferably large Instructions: Combine the garlic, salt, pepper flakes, and olive oil in a medium glass bowl.

If you are purchasing a pre-cooked confit of duck, skip the instructions in this paragraph and follow the directions on the package of the product. In any event, you will need to shred the duck for use in this recipe. For your own confit of duck, mix the salt, pepper and garlic together and coat the duck with the seasonings rubbing into the surface of the duck. On the stovetop, heat the oil or lard in a deep roasting pan (if you will be using the oven) or in a large Dutch oven (if you will be cooking on the range). (Note: you will be poaching the duck, not frying it, so, it is important to avoid making the oil too hot.) Add the duck to the warm oil. If you are using the oven, put the duck in a preheated 200 degree F oven for about 6 to 8 hours. If you are using the stovetop, cook the duck at a simmer. In either case, the duck must be cooked until it falls away from the bone. Remove all the duck meat from the bones and reserve meat until needed. Cut the endive in half and remove the core. Lightly sear the cut sides of the endive in olive oil over medium heat in a nonstick pan. Sprinkle in the sugar, salt, pepper, and butter - cover and continue to cook until al dente - about 10 minutes. You want the endive to be slightly tender, but firm enough to support the duck filling. Season with salt and pepper, remove from heat, and let cool. Prepare the mango/berry puree by adding the mango and strawberries to a blender or food processor and blending until smooth. If duck is cold, heat or re-heat it, depending on whether you have made your own confit, or have purchased it prepared. Shred the duck with 2 forks. Fill each endive-half with duck, spoon mango berry puree on top and garnish with a raspberry. Serve slightly warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 16935,&quot;Coconut Hot Chocolate 3 cups milk 1 cup heavy cream 1 1/2 teaspoons coconut extract 6 ounces white chocolate, chopped Coconut liqueur Whipped topping, for garnish Shaved dark chocolate for garnish Shredded sweetened coconut, for garnish Instructions: Bring the milk, cream, and coconut extract to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Core the larger tomatoes and cut them into slices or wedges. For the vinaigrette, macerate the shallot in the vinegar with the garlic and a little salt. Whisk in the oil. Taste and adjust the acidity and salt as necessary. Put the tomatoes in a shallow salad bowl or on a platter. Season with salt and pepper, strew on the chopped basil leaves, and carefully dress with the vinaigrette. Thin slices of peeled lemon cucumber and torpedo onion are wonderful additions to the salad.

Be careful not to overwork the mixture; you don&#39;t want to compact the meat too much or the meatballs will be tough. Put a little oil on your hands and form loosely into golf ball size meatballs. You should have about 25. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Gently add the meatballs and brown thoroughly on all sides; this will take about 15 minutes. Transfer the meatballs to a plate, and refrigerate until you are ready to cook them in the sugo. For the gravy: In the same pan you used to cook the meatballs, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the celery, onions and carrots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and bay leaves and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Push the veggies to one side and add the tomato paste, toasting it on the bottom of the pan for 1 minute. Stir into the vegetables. Add the tomatoes, chicken stock and thyme, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer very gently, partially covered, until thick and significantly reduced, about an hour. Carefully add the meatballs, a few at a time, and simmer, stirring very gently now and then - don&#39;t break-a-ya bawls! - until cooked through, 40 minutes. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Add most of the basil and stir, reserving a little to sprinkle over the top for serving. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a pot of salted boiling water until al dente, about 8 minutes. To serve, put the pasta into a large serving bowl. Immediately ladle sauce on top and then the meatballs. Garnish with chopped fresh basil and freshly grated Parmesan.

Remove the bands from the claws. Twist off the tails, and carefully split lengthwise. Twist the claws and knuckles off the bodies; separate the claws from the knuckles. Crack the claws a little using a sharp blow with the back of a knife. Split the bodies. Remove the intestinal tract from the tail meats. Arrange the lobsters in a single layer in an ovenproof baking dish, tail and body shells down. Sprinkle sea salt (preferably from Maine) and black pepper over the lobster meat, followed by a generous dressing with the olive oil. Preheat the oven to its hottest temperature setting. (Chef&#39;s Note: Our wood-burning oven achieves intensities of over 800 degrees F, but most home ovens don&#39;t exceed 500 degrees F.) In a non-reacting skillet filmed with a little melted butter, saute the mushrooms over high heat for 2 or 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Place the lobsters in the oven, and roast until the shells are almost uniformly red and the meat is opaque, as long as 7 or 8 minutes in a home oven. Remove the lobsters from the oven. Add the mushrooms and shallots. Pour the hard cider over the lobsters, and scatter the butter pieces around the dish. Place the lobsters back in the oven, and continue roasting, checking frequently, until the butter has completely melted, about 2 or 3 minutes. Swirl the pan to combine the liquid ingredients into a saucy emulsion. Check the seasonings and adjust with more sea salt and pepper if necessary. Serve the lobsters on dinner plates and spoon the sauce over them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 16955,&quot;Gorgonzola and Grape Salad 1/2 cup aged red wine vinegar 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 tablespoon salt 5 cloves garlic 1 1/2 small shallots, minced 2 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 20 cloves garlic 1 1/2 cups water 1/4 cup sugar 2 cups seedless green and red grapes, halved 1 cup Gorgonzola, crumbled 3 heads frissee lettuce, or other hearty green Instructions: Dressing: Place red wine vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and garlic cloves in a blender and pulse on high speed. Add the shallots and slowly incorporate the extra-virgin olive oil while blender is on high speed. Finish seasoning with black pepper and allow the dressing to sit for 24 hours, refrigerated, before using.<br> For the candied garlic: Coat a sheet pan with oil for the finished garlic. Place the garlic and water in a large saute pan over medium to high heat. Boil the cloves until they are cooked through but still firm to the touch and still maintain their shape. This takes about 8 minutes. By this time the water should be all the way or close to being evaporated. At this point, add the sugar in with the garlic cloves and continue to cook over medium heat while stirring occasionally. After a couple of minutes the sugar will begin to caramelize. At this point it is important that the garlic be stirred constantly so they become evenly coated with the caramelized sugar. Continue to caramelize the garlic until golden to dark golden brown. This process happens very quickly so stay alert. Turn the garlic out onto the greased sheet pan and cool.<br> For the salad: Place the grapes, Gorgonzola and candied garlic in a large mixing bowl. Add 3/4 cup of dressing. You want enough dressing in the bowl to fully saturate the cheese and grape mixture. Add the lettuce and toss your salad.

Divide the greensequally onto 4 chilled salad plates. Sprinkle the pecans evenlyover each salad and thinly shave 1/2 of each artichoke over eachsalad using a Japanese mandoline. In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Thinly slice the shallot and saute it in the pan until it begins to brown slightly. Remove the pan from the heat and place the cooked shallot in a blender. Add the white wine vinegar and puree the mixture. Slowly drizzle in the remaining olive oil in a steady stream while the blender is running. When all of the oil is incorporated, season with salt and pepper. Yield: 1 cup Start by preparing the braising liquid. Combine the flour, lemon juice, oil and salt in a medium saucepan. Add the water and whisk vigorously to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat and cover. To prepare the artichokes: take each artichoke and starting from the bottom, tear off the leaves until you come halfway up the artichoke, rubbing the exposed areas with the cut lemon as you go to prevent it from oxidizing. At this point turn the artichoke on its side and cut off the remaining top inch of leaves with a serrated knife. Cut the artichoke in half lengthwise and scrape out all of the fuzz that sits on top of the heart. Keep rubbing the artichoke with lemon as you work. Finally trim off any more tough leaves and green spots anywhere else on the artichoke. Drop them into the simmering braising liquid. Simmer covered for about 20 minutes or until a paring knife easily slides into the artichoke heart. Cool the heart in the cooking liquid and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 16957,&quot;The El Scorcho 6 ounces grilled chicken strips 5 ounces hot sauce (recommended: Cholula) 2 ounces spicy pork chorizo 2 ounces mild beef chorizo 4 ounces baby red potatoes Olive oil, for sauteing Sea salt and black pepper 2 ounces poblano chiles 2 ounces Anaheim chiles 2 ounces Serrano chiles 1 (17-ounce) pizza dough ball 3 ounces caramelized shallots 8 ounces shredded provolone 10 dried arbol chiles Instructions: Preparation for Toppings: Marinate the grilled chicken in the hot sauce for at least 24 hours refrigerated.

Bring the mixture just to a simmer, stirring occasionally, and remove from the heat. In a medium mixing bowl whisk the egg yolks until they lighten in color. Gradually add the sugar and whisk to combine. Temper the cream mixture into the eggs and sugar by gradually adding small amounts, until about a third of the cream mixture has been added. Pour in the remainder and return the entire mixture to the saucepan and place over low heat. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon and reaches 170 to 175 degrees F. Pour the mixture into a container and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Stir in the vanilla extract. Place the mixture into the refrigerator and once it is cool enough not to form condensation on the lid, cover and store for 4 to 8 hours or until the temperature reaches 40 degrees F or below. Pour into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. This should take approximately 25 to 35 minutes. Serve as is for soft serve or freeze for another 3 to 4 hours to allow the ice cream to harden. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 16963,&quot;Chocolate Hazelnut Panna Cotta 4 sheets gelatin 1 quart heavy cream 1 (13-ounce) jar chocolate hazelnut spread (recommended: Nutella) Chopped roasted hazelnuts, for garnish Grated semisweet chocolate, for garnish Instructions: Put the gelatin sheets into a bowl of cold water and let them soak while you heat the cream.

Sweet! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 16964,&quot;Jerk Swordfish Served with Mango Filets and Pineapple and Red Onion Salsa 1 (8-ounce) swordfish steak 4 sprigs fresh cilantro, plus 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves 4 tablespoons jerk seasoning, pre-packaged 1 mango 1/2 cup ripe pineapple, diced 1 tablespoon red onion, sliced 1 teaspoon jalapeno, diced small 1/4 cup orange juice 1 lime, juiced Kosher salt Yellow Wax and Blue Lake Beans in Chipotle Butter, recipe follows 5 yellow wax beans 5 blue lake beans 1/4 pound unsalted butter 1 tablespoon chipotle, canned in adobo sauce 2 cloves garlic 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: To prepare the swordfish, remove the skin and trim away any blemishes from the swordfish. Cut it into 2 even portions. Garnish each portion by pressing a sprig of cilantro into the meat. Generously rub the fish in the jerk mixture. Lightly oil a hot griddle or medium saute pan. Cook the fish for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Peel the mango, and using the seed to guide you, slice off the meat on both sides. Slice each 1/2 into 3 fillets, lengthwise. Sear the mango on the griddle or pan, alongside the swordfish.<br> In a small bowl, combine the pineapple, onion, chopped cilantro, jalapeno, orange juice, and lime juice. Mix all ingredients together, and season with salt, to taste.<br> To plate, place the beans in the center of the plate. Arrange the mango fillets and the swordfish neatly on top. Garnish the fish with the pineapple salsa and a sprig of cilantro. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Remove the ends of the beans and slice the beans in half on the bias. Blanch the beans in the boiling water for a couple minutes. When tender, shock the beans in iced water to stop them from cooking further. Reserve the boiling water. Place the butter, chipotle, garlic cloves, and salt in a medium stainless steel bowl over the boiling water. Allow the butter to melt. Pour contents into a blender, and blend on high speed until smooth. Refrigerate.<br> To plate the beans, heat 1 tablespoon of the chipotle butter in a saute pan on medium heat. Add the beans and toss in the butter. Cook until the beans are hot and the butter is slightly browned. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 16965,&quot;Prosciutto, Cantaloupe and Butter Sandwich with Basil Drizzle 2 cups loosely packed fresh basil leaves 1 cup fresh parsley leaves<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1 clove garlic, crushed and peeled<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon (about 2 tablespoons)<br> 1 Calabrian cl<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 8 tablespoons good-quality salted butter, softened One 16- to 18-inch baguette, split and warmed<br> 6 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto<br> 1/4 peeled and seeded ripe cantaloupe, very thinly sliced (a vegetable peeler works well)<br> Instructions: For the basil drizzle: Combine the basil, parsley, salt, red pepper flakes, garlic, lemon juice and cl in a mini food processor and pulse to make a chunky paste. Add the olive oil and process until smooth and bright green. For the prosciutto, cantaloupe and butter sandwich: Spread the butter on both cut sides of the baguette. Drizzle the bottom piece with a tablespoon or so of the basil drizzle. Layer the prosciutto and cantaloupe on the bottom piece of the baguette, ruffling and folding the prosciutto as you go. Drizzle a tablespoon of the basil drizzle over the top. Drizzle the cut side of the top piece with 1/4 cup or so of the basil drizzle. Place the top piece of baguette on the prosciutto and cantaloupe and cut into 2 sandwiches using a serrated knife. Serve the extra basil drizzle on the side or reserve for another use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 16966,&quot;Salt and Pepper Squid Approximately 2 cups peanut oil (to come about 1/2-inch up in a frying pan) 2 tablespoons Maldon or other sea salt 2 tablespoons black peppercorns 1/3 cup cornstarch 18 ounces baby squid, cut into rings, tentacles left unchopped Lemon, for squeezing Instructions: Put the oil in a frying pan over high heat. Bash the salt and peppercorns in a mortar and pestle until a bit more than bruised but not quite pulverized, and combine this mixture in a freezer bag with cornstarch, adding the squid and tossing to coat well but not heavily. When the oil&#39;s very hot - not quite smoking, but nearly - fry the squid (knocking any excess cornstarch back in the bag first) in batches (about 4, probably) and cook each batch for about 1 minute or so until just crisp on the outside and still sweet and tender within. You probably won&#39;t need to turn the squid since the oil should bubble up and cook both sides at once, but do if you feel better. Remove to plates lined with a paper towel. After the squid&#39;s sat for about half a minute, remove the greasy towel - though sometimes, I dispense with this stage - squeeze lemon over and eat with your fingers, quickly. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 16967,&quot;Manchego and Ham Croquetas 1 1/2 teaspoons finely diced onion 1 1/2 teaspoons finely diced red bell pepper 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 5 ounces serrano ham, finely diced (about 1 cup) 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dredging 2 cups whole milk Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup grated manchego cheese (about 4 ounces) 1 1/4-ounce packet unflavored gelatin powder 3 large eggs 1 cup breadcrumbs Canola oil, for frying Instructions: Cook the onion and bell pepper in the olive oil in a saucepan over low heat, stirring, until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the ham and cook, stirring, 10 more minutes. Add the butter and let melt, then add the smoked paprika and flour and cook, stirring, about 5 minutes. Whisk in 1 3/4 cups milk and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring, until thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the manchego until melted. Scatter the gelatin over the remaining 1/4 cup milk in a bowl and set aside, 5 minutes. Whisk the gelatin mixture until smooth, then stir into the cheese mixture. Transfer to a shallow baking dish and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put some flour in a shallow bowl. Beat the eggs in another bowl and put the breadcrumbs in a third bowl. Scoop out about 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture and form into a football shape. Dredge in the flour, then dip in the eggs and roll in the breadcrumbs. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat to make about 40 croquetas. Refrigerate until ready to fry. Heat about 2 inches of canola oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the croquetas until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 16968,&quot;Traditional Beef Rouladen 4 long, thin slices top round Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup spicy brown mustard<br> 2 dill pickles, sliced in thin spears<br> 1 large onion, thinly sliced<br> 1/2 cup chopped browned bacon<br> One 32-ounce carton beef stock 2 potatoes, sliced<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup butter, melted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place each top round slice between wax paper and pound to tenderize; add salt and pepper and generously spread each with the spicy mustard. On the wide part of each piece of meat, place about 5 pieces of the dill pickle spears, some onion and a heaping tablespoon of the browned bacon. Fold in the edges and roll up like a burrito. Carefully brown the rolls on all sides in a frying pan. Place in a large pot with the beef stock. Put a slice of the raw potatoes between each rolled roulade, making sure the pot is packed tight; the potato slices will hold the roulade together without having to use a string. Cover and bake for about 45 minutes. Make your gravy from the drippings by mixing the flour and butter and adding it slowly into the beef stock until it reaches the desired consistency. Serve with red cabbage and potatoes or spaetzle. You can also serve the potatoes that have soaked up all the delicious juices and held together the rouladen. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 16969,&quot;Funnel Cake Bites with Strawberry Sauce 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Canola oil, for frying<br> Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting<br> Strawberry Sauce, for serving, recipe follows Chocolate hazelnut spread, warmed, for serving 2 pints strawberries, hulled and halved 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 teaspoons lemon juice<br> Instructions: Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, eggs, granulated sugar and vanilla. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir together until the mixture resembles a slightly lumpy pancake batter. Pour enough oil into a large Dutch oven to come 2 inches up the side. Clip a deep-fry thermometer to the pot and heat over medium-high heat until the thermometer reaches 370 degrees F. Working in batches, use a small cookie scoop (about 2 tablespoons) to gently drop the batter into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 1/2 minutes, flipping once halfway through and adjusting the heat to maintain temperature. Transfer to a clean wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet to drain. Let cool slightly before dusting with confectioners\u2019 sugar. Serve the funnel cake bites drizzled with Strawberry Sauce and with chocolate hazelnut spread for dipping. Combine the strawberries, sugar and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the berries break down, about 10 minutes. Put the mixture in a blender and blend until smooth.

Meanwhile blanch your asparagus in a separate pan of salted boiling water for 4 minutes, and drain in a colander. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Get an ovenproof dish - I&#39;ve used many different shapes and sizes. Layer the sheets of filo pastry in the dish, brushing them with melted butter as you go and letting about 1-inch hang over the edge. You want to get the pastry about 5 layers thick. Put a clean, damp kitchen towel over the top and put aside. When the potatoes are done, mash them with the cheeses. In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs and cream and stir into your cheesy mashed potato. Grate in the nutmeg, season well with pepper and mix together. Spread the mashed potato over the filo pastry, then bring up the sides of the filo and scrunch them together to form a rim. Take your blanched asparagus and line them up across the filling, making sure you cover it all. Brush all over with the remaining melted butter and pop into the preheated oven for around 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Serve just as you would a quiche for a quick lunch or supper, with a salad. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Scrub the potatoes and pat them dry. Place 2 chopsticks along either long side of a potato. Using a long paring or chef&#39;s knife, score the potato down to the chopsticks (the chopsticks act as a stopgap, keeping you from cutting all the way through the potato). Cut slits 1/8 inch apart all the way down the length of the potato. Repeat with the second potato. Place the potatoes on a baking dish and brush with half the butter and sprinkle with some of the thyme and salt and pepper. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, brush with the remaining butter and continue baking until cooked through, about 30 minutes more. Sprinkle with more thyme and the Parmesan and bake for 5 minutes more before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 16980,&quot;Cavatelli with Glazed Vegetables 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Kosher salt 1/4 pound (1 1/2 cups) ricotta cheese 1 large egg, lightly beaten 2 bunches scallions, cut into 2-inch lengths 6 to 8 small radishes, quartered lengthwise 8 ounces thin asparagus, cut into 2-inch pieces 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Combine the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center.

Trim the fat cap on the brisket to 1/4 inch, then trim out the top and bottom fat. Trim the lean flat edges so the meat is at least 1 1/2-inches thick. Stir together the salt and pepper in a bowl until well blended to make the rub. Shake an even layer of the rub on all surfaces of the brisket that will be exposed to the smoke. Do not pack the rub into folds or cracks, since that will turn the rub into a soggy paste. Place the brisket in the smoker with the fatty point closest to the firebox. Smoke for 2 hours, rotating the brisket occasionally for even coloring and to prevent the edges from drying out. Spritz the brisket liberally with apple juice and continue smoking the brisket, spritzing every 30 minutes, until the meat has a dark mahogany color and the internal temperature reaches 203 to 205 degrees F, another 10 to 12 hours. Wrap the brisket tightly in unwaxed butcher paper and let rest 45 minutes to 1 hour before slicing and chopping. Serve with Original BBQ Sauce if using.

Combine the butter, confectioners\u2019 sugar and granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on high speed until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Mix in the vanilla, lemon zest and egg for about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low. Add the dry ingredients and mix just until a smooth dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and bring it together. Transfer a third of the dough to a small bowl and the remaining dough to a medium bowl. Knead enough yellow gel coloring into the dough in the small bowl to tint it bright yellow (we used about 1/4 teaspoon). Knead enough orange gel coloring into the dough in the medium bowl to tint it bright orange (we used about 1/4 teaspoon). Place a double layer of plastic wrap on a work surface. Working on top of the plastic wrap, roll the yellow dough into a log about 9 inches long. Slightly flatten the log with your hands. Repeat the rolling with the orange dough then stack it on top of the yellow dough. Gently press the 2 opposing long sides to form a triangular log, with the orange dough at the tip. Wrap the dough in the plastic. Smooth the flat side of a ruler over the dough to better define the sides, creating a triangular log that\u2019s 11 to 12 inches long. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours, up to 1 day (or freeze for up to 3 months). Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

Bring to medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the anchovies dissolve, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken livers, turn the heat to high and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the wine and cook until the wine has reduced by half, 4 to 5 more minutes; the mix will still be pretty soupy. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth. Season with a little salt and loosen with a little olive oil if needed. Set aside to cool completely. Put into a pastry bag. For the game hens: Place the game hens on a clean work surface. Loosen the skin under the breast, legs and thighs and, using the pastry bag, stuff the chicken liver pate under the skin. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Drizzle the game hens with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the fennel pollen, crushed red pepper flakes and lemon zest. Place the whole shootin&#39; match in the oven for about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, turn on the broiler and place under the broiler. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven. Check the game hens for doneness; they should be cooked through but still succulent and juicy. Let rest for about 5 minutes.<br> Remove the game hens from the pan. Cut the game hens in half and separate the breasts from the dark meat. Each plate gets half a game hen. Reserve on a large platter. Remove the excess fat from the saute pan and add the chicken stock, white wine and rosemary. Cook over high heat until the liquid has reduced by more than half. Taste and season with salt. Finish the sauce with the butter. Spoon the juices over over the game hens. Garnish with the chives.

Using tongs, dip the corn tortillas, 1 at a time, into the oil for 5 seconds to soften. Remove the tortillas from the oil, letting the excess oil drip off. Put them on a paper-towel lined sheet tray to absorb the oil as they cool. Once they are cool enough to handle, take 1 tortilla at a time and build the enchiladas. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put a mound of the shredded meat (about 1/4 cup), a tablespoon of Jack cheese, a tablespoon of onions, and a pinch of chopped cilantro on each tortilla and roll up to enclose. In a shallow 3-quart baking dish, coat the bottom with 1 cup of the chili sauce. Arrange the tortillas, seam side down, in a single layer in the dish. Pour the remaining cup of sauce over the enchiladas and cover them with the remaining Jack cheese. Bake the enchiladas until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle the enchiladas with the remaining cilantro and serve with the Mexican crema and Cotija cheese. On a sheet tray or baking pan, arrange the onion, tomatillos, tomatoes and garlic and drizzle with olive oil. Place under a broiler and char the vegetables, about 5 to 7 minutes. Keep an eye on them; you want them charred but not burned. In a dry heavy bottomed skillet dry toast the chiles until soft and fragrant. Remove the chiles from the pan, discard the stem and seeds and plunge them into a bowl of hot water to soften. Add the soaked chiles, roasted vegetables and the chicken stock to a blender. Blend the mixture until very smooth. If the mixture is too thick you can always thin it with a little of the chili soaking water. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. In the same skillet you toasted the chiles, toast the spices until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes, and then grind them in a spice grinder. In a bowl, mix the ground spices with the 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil to form a paste. Rub this paste all over the flank steak and allow it to marinate for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, season the steak with salt and pepper, to taste. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Preheat a grill or a grill pan on medium-high. Grill the flank steak, for 3 minutes on each side, to char the steak. Put the steak in a roasting pan, pour the chili sauce over the steak, and cover the pan with foil. Put the pan in the oven and roast for 1 hour. Remove the steak from the pan, shred the meat and reserve the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 17038,&quot;Minted Melon Iced Honey Green Tea 6 chunks honeydew melon, about 1-? inches square 15 large fresh mint leaves 1 bottle Pure Leaf?

When the dough is consistent begin rolling dough balls about the size of a ping pong ball. Using a tortilla press that is lined in a thick plastic, press out the dough. You use the plastic (it can be a ziploc bag that has been cut) so that the dough does not stick to the tortilla press. Meanwhile have a deep pot filled with cooking oil approximately 2 inches high and heated to 250 degrees. Drop the flat tortilla in the hot oil and using a metal spatula repeatedly douse with the oil. You will see that it will begin to puff up. Flip it over and using the spatula make an indention in the middle of the tortilla to forma taco shape. Remove from oil and allow to drain. Fill with ground meat, shredded chicken, guacamole, bean and cheese or your favorite filling. Top with shredded lettuce and diced tomato. Caution; Be very careful when making these. Make sure there is proper ventilation and do not allow the oil to get too hot. Also, if you can&#39;t get your hands on a tortilla press then use a clean counter. You will still need the plastic so that the dough does not stick to the counter.

Roasted potatoes are a great side for this dish. Simply place raw potatoes underneath your chicken when roasting. They will be perfectly cooked when your chicken is ready.; Take the chicken out of the packaging and rinse it thoroughly under cold running water and pat dry. Place the chicken in the refrigerator and let it dry for at least 12 hours, or until the chicken skin is somewhat dry. Take cheesecloth and form it into a small ball (a tennis ball size) tied up with butcher&#39;s string. Put the ball in a bowl with 2 teaspoons salt, the rosemary or thyme sprig, 1 marjoram sprig and the whole black peppercorns. Fill the bowl with water so that the water level is slightly above the cheesecloth ball and put it in the refrigerator for 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Take the chicken out of the refrigerator and make sure that it is completely dry. Rub the olive oil over the surface of the chicken and sprinkle evenly with the remaining 1 tablespoon salt. Loosen the skin over the breast and slide the remaining 2 sprigs marjoram under each side. Take the cheesecloth ball, squeeze out slightly the excess brine, and stick it into the chicken cavity along with the half lemon. Tie the legs together with butcher&#39;s twine. Place the chicken breast-side up on a baking rack and tuck the wings under the shoulders. Place the chicken in the oven and roast until the skin dries up and the salt becomes white, 15 to 20 minutes. Increase the temperature by 25 degrees every 15 minutes until you reach 375 degrees F. Continue this process until the chicken is cooked. To check the chicken for doneness, insert a thermometer into the breast part below the wings and read the heat. If the chicken has reached 165 degrees F and the skin is somewhat crispy, shut down the oven and let it rest for another 10 minutes. If you like to have crispier skin, turn on your broiler for 2 to 3 minutes until the skin gets darker. Cut the chicken into quarters and serve.

Place the salmon on the prepared baking sheet and rub the lemon zest mixture over the top of the salmon. Brush with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Roast on the top rack until the salmon is just cooked through and flakes with a fork, 14 to 16 minutes depending on thickness. Meanwhile, toss the potatoes on a second rimmed baking sheet with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper. Roast on the bottom rack, tossing once about halfway though, until golden and tender, 15 to 17 minutes. While the salmon and potatoes cook, stir together the sour cream, mayonnaise, parsley, dill, capers, lemon juice, Dijon and scallions in a serving bowl. Remove 1/3 cup of the mixture and reserve in the refrigerator to make the salmon cakes. Place a 5-ounce (approximate) portion of salmon on each of 4 plates, divide the potatoes and sauce among the plates and serve lemon wedges on the side. Wrap and refrigerate the remaining salmon for salmon bowls and salmon cakes. For the salmon bowls: To make the dressing, combine the rice vinegar, soy sauce, honey, ginger and sriracha in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the vegetable oil and sesame oil. To assemble, make a base of 3 cups of mixed greens per bowl. Top each with 1/2 cup of the grains and 1 cup of the mixed vegetables. Flake 12 ounces to 1 pound of the leftover salmon into large chunks and divide equally over the bowls. Drizzle with the dressing and garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallions. For the salmon cakes: Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the bell pepper and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl to cool for about 10 minutes. Flake the remaining 8 ounces leftover salmon into the bowl. Add the seafood seasoning, lemon zest, egg, 1/3 cup reserved sauce from the salmon and potatoes meal and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix well with a fork to combine and break up the salmon into small flakes. Add the panko and mix well to combine. Form into 4 large or 8 small cakes. Dredge the salmon cakes in the panko mixture and chill for 30 minutes on a large plate in the refrigerator. Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until a few breadcrumbs sizzle on contact. Add the salmon cakes and cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. (The dredged salmon cakes can also be wrapped and frozen; cook from frozen, adding 2 to 3 minutes to the total cooking time.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 17072,&quot;Spring Fiddlehead Pasta Kosher salt 12 ounces fusilli pasta 3/4 cup ricotta cheese Zest and juice of 1 lemon Freshly ground black pepper 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 1/2 cups fiddlehead ferns Instructions: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook until very al dente, about 9 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta. Combine the ricotta, lemon zest and a few grinds of black pepper in small bowl and set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the fiddleheads and sprinkle with pepper and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring gently, until the fiddleheads are crisp-tender and caramelized, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the fiddleheads to a bowl. Add the lemon juice, cooked pasta and reserved water to the skillet and return to medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens slightly and the pasta is al dente. Add the ricotta mixture and lightly toss until the pasta is just coated. Divide the pasta among 4 bowls and top with the fiddleheads and a few grinds of black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 17073,&quot;Shrimp and Papaya Salad 1 1/2 pounds cooked bay shrimp 1 papaya 1 head butter or Boston lettuce A few sprigs parsley 2 tablespoons milk 1/2 cup mayonnaise Salt Instructions: Preparing the Shrimp Rinse the cooked shrimp under cold running water, pat dry with paper towels, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Preparing the Papaya Cut the papaya in half lengthwise, and 1) use the spoon to scoop out and discard the seeds. Peel off the skin with a paring knife and discard, then place the papaya cut side down on a cutting board. 2) Use a sharp knife to cut the fruit lengthwise into slices 1/2 inch wide, then slice those pieces crosswise into 1/2-inch chunks. Remember that a ripe papaya is fragile, and will turn to mush if harshly handled. Finishing the Salad Rinse the lettuce leaves and pat dry with paper towels. Rinse the parley and pat dry; remove the stems and discard. Finely chop the leaves. Arrange 2 or 3 lettuce leaves on each serving plate, making them into a bed for the salad.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. While continuing to pulse, slowly add the water and lemon juice until the dough just comes together. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your thumb and index finger to make sure it holds its shape. If it doesn&#39;t, add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time while still pulsing, but make sure that the dough doesn&#39;t form into a wet ball. Remove the dough from the food processor. Divide the dough in half, press each half into a disk, and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for 20 minutes. (You will only use 1 disk of dough for this recipe; the other disk of dough will keep for up to 1 month, wrapped well, in the freezer.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 dough disk out to a 12-inch round. Line a 9-inch pie pan with the dough. Crimp the edges and dock the bottom of the dough with a fork. Freeze the dough in the pan for 20 minutes. Line the dough-lined pan with parchment paper and fill to the rim with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the weights and parchment. Continue baking until the crust is baked through, 15 to 20 more minutes. Let cool completely. For the filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine the egg yolks, maple syrup, cornstarch, and salt, whisking until smooth and pale. In a large, heavy saucepan, combine the cream, milk, and vanilla and bring to a simmer. With the mixer running on medium speed, slowly and carefully pour the hot milk mixture into the mixer and whisk until combined. Transfer the mixture back to the saucepan and whisk constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens to the consistency of mayonnaise. Remove the pastry cream from the heat and add the butter, whisking until incorporated. Pour the pastry cream directly into the cooled prepared crust. Cover the tart with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool. To finish: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the heavy cream, mascarpone, and maple syrup to stiff peaks. Using a small offset spatula, spread the topping across the surface of the pie. Garnish each slice with a Maple Cookie, if you like. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter, maple syrup, and 1/2 cup of the sugar until light and fluffy. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, and salt until fully combined. Add the flour mixture all at once to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until just incorporated. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap. Press the dough into a disk and wrap it up. Refrigerate for 1 hour. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thick. Using a maple leaf cookie cutter, stamp out cookies and place 1/2 inch apart on the prepared pans. Press together and re-roll the scraps 1 time. Sprinkle the cookies with a light, even layer of the remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Bake until the edges of the cookies are golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17083,&quot;Portobello Mushroom Pizza Bites 4 portobello mushrooms, stems removed 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 slice white bread, crust removed and torn into very small (about 1/4 inch) pieces 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 3 tablespoons oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped 4 teaspoons tomato paste 2 ounces part-skim mozzarella, thinly sliced 6 to 8 small basil leaves, torn Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Scrape out the gills of the mushrooms with a spoon, being careful not to break the cap. Rub the mushrooms with 2 tablespoons of the oil and half the garlic. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon oregano. Place the mushrooms, gill-side up, on the prepared baking sheet, and roast until tender, 15 to 25 minutes. (If the mushrooms are thicker than 1 inch, they will take longer to cook.) Meanwhile, toss the bread pieces in a medium bowl with the remaining garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon oregano, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the red pepper flakes. Transfer them to a medium skillet over medium heat, and stir until they turn golden and crisp on the edges, 5 to 6 minutes. Return the croutons to the bowl. While the mushrooms are still hot, pat them dry with a paper towel. Top each with 1 teaspoon tomato paste, spread evenly, and slices of mozzarella to cover. Divide the sun-dried tomatoes and croutons between the 4 mushrooms, and place in the oven to melt the cheese, 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with basil leaves. Cut each mushroom into 4 to 8 pieces, depending on the size of the mushroom. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 17084,&quot;Curried Scallops with Cucumber Sauce and Salmon Pearls 1 medium cucumber, hot house variety 1/4 cup chopped parsley 1/3 cup rice wine vinegar Salt Freshly ground black pepper *2 egg yolks 1 teaspoon sugar 1/4 cup light sesame oil 1/4 cup almond oil 6 dry pack sea scallops, side muscle removed Salt and pepper 1/2 cup curry powder 1 cup flour 2 tablespoons peanut oil 1 tablespoon butter 1 1/2 bunches watercress, to garnish 6 scallop shells, to plate 6 tablespoons salmon caviar Chive flowers Instructions: With a paring knife, remove the skin from the outside of the cucumber.

Cover and cook on high for 3 to 4 hours, or 8 hours on low. If you don&#39;t have a slow cooker, you could braise the legs in the oven at 350 degrees F for 2 to 3 hours. The smoked turkey legs are already cooked, we just want to braise them so the meat falls off the bone and it is easy to shred. Once the turkey leg has braised and tenderized, remove from the slow cooker and let it cool until you are able to handle it, 10 to15 minutes. Once cool, remove the skin and discard. Pull the meat from the bone and tendons. Be aware that turkey legs have quite a few tendons. Using 2 forks, shred the turkey meat and set aside. Pour the turkey stock that is left in the slow cooker into a saucepot and bring it to a simmer. Dissolve the cornstarch in 4 tablespoons water, and then whisk that mixture into the turkey stock. Let the sauce boil for a minute to let the cornstarch thicken the sauce. Once the sauce is thickened, turn off the heat and add the shredded turkey to the pot to keep it super moist. For the latkes: In a food processor fitted with the shredding blade, shred the potatoes and the onion. (Alternatively, you could use a box grater). Once shredded, place the potatoes and onions into fine mesh strainer set over a bowl or the sink. Press and strain as much liquid from the potatoes and onions as possible, then transfer to a mixing bowl. (Alternatively, place the mixture in a kitchen towel and wring the potato mixture dry.) Add the scallions, shredded potatoes and onions to a large bowl. Whisk the eggs in a separate bowl and add them to your potato scallion mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Dust the potatoes with the flour, gently tossing until it appears that the flour has soaked up any moisture. Start with 1/3 cup and adjust up to 1/2 cup if necessary. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil until shimmering. Using 2 forks, gently gather up a heaping tablespoon worth of the potato mixture and gently place the potato mixture into the oil. Using the forks, spread the mixture out to make a loose, spider looking patty. Then press the latke flat using a flexible spatula. Once the latkes are golden brown on one side, 2 to 3 minutes, flip them to brown the other side, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove them from the skillet and drain on a baking sheet lined with a drying rack or paper towels and season immediately with salt. Repeat until all latkes are cooked. You can always hold the latkes in a 200 degree F oven to keep warm, while you fry in batches. To assemble: Take a crispy latke and top with some of the shredded smoked turkey leg and garnish with a dollop of the Kumquat Cranberry Chutney. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the kumquats, vinegar, sugar, cranberries, ginger, mustard, cinnamon, garlic, shallot, salt and pepper to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until the chutney thickens, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 17097,&quot;Country Style Noodles 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 clove fresh garlic<br> 1 Thai cl, crushed<br> 6 ounces chicken, shrimp or crab<br> 1 clove pickled garlic plus 3 ounces pickled garlic juice<br> 1 whole egg<br> 1 handful rice noodles<br> 1 tablespoon fish sauce 1 tablespoon palm sugar<br> 2 ounces green onion, chopped Lime wedge, for garnish Instructions: Heat up vegetable oil in a wok until it is shimmering. Throw in fresh garlic and crushed Thai cl and cook until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Throw in the meat and cook, stirring continuously, until it is cooked medium-well, about 1 minute. Add the pickled garlic and then the egg; while the egg is still runny, add the noodles. Add the fish sauce followed by the palm sugar and cook, stirring, until the noodles are soft. Add the pickled garlic juice and cook, stirring, about 30 seconds maximum. Add green onion, allowing to cook for no more than 15 seconds. Remove from wok and place on a serving dish.

Butter and flour a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan. Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl on the pan (without touching the water). Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Keep warm. Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and cloves in a medium bowl. Stir the vanilla and half the bananas into the buttermilk. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. While mixing, drizzle in the oil and beat until incorporated. Beat in the egg. While mixing slowly add the flour mixture to the butter in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk mixture in 2 parts, beginning and ending with the flour. (Scrape the sides of the bowl between additions, if needed). Fold in the remaining bananas. Gently swirl the melted chocolate into the batter so that it has a marbled effect. Scoop the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.

Peel the pears and slice them lengthwise into halves. With a small sharp paring knife and a melon baller, remove the core and seeds from each pear, leaving a round well for the filling. Trim a small slice away from the rounded sides of each pear half so that they will sit in the baking dish without wobbling. Toss the pears with some lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown. Arrange them, core side up, in a baking dish large enough to hold the pears snugly. Gently toss the crumbled blue cheese, dried cranberries, and walnuts together in a small bowl. Divide the mixture among the pears, mounding it on top of the indentation. In the same small bowl, combine the apple cider, port, and brown sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Pour the mixture over and around the pears. Bake the pears, basting occasionally with the cider mixture, for 30 minutes, or until tender. Set aside until warm or at room temperature. Just before serving, whisk together the olive oil, 1/4 cup of lemon juice, and 1/4 cup of the basting liquid in a large bowl. Divide the arugula among 6 plates and top each with a pear half.

Fill another bowl with water and add ice. Add the parsley to the boiling water and blanch until softened, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the ice water. When cold, drain and squeeze the parsley well to remove as much water as possible. Transfer to a blender and add the salt and sugar. Start the machine, and add the oil in a thin, steady stream. Blend until the blender jar feels slightly warm, 3 to 5 minutes. To make the parsnips, combine them and the garlic in a large saucepan, then add water to cover and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the point of a knife inserted into the parsnips meets no resistance, about 25 minutes. Drain, transfer to a food processor, and puree. Add the honey and butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pulse to blend. Keep warm. To make the venison, combine the fennel, coriander, cardamom, and black pepper on a large plate and mix. Season the venison with the salt to taste and roll it lightly in the spice mixture to coat evenly. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the venison and sear it, turning once, about 8 minutes for medium-rare. Allow the meat to rest for 5 minutes, then slice into 6 pieces each. PLATING: Divide the puree among 4 serving plates.

Reserve the remaining 1/2-cup of tamari. Fill the bottom of the boiler with 3-inches of water. Assemble the boiler and place over a medium-low flame. Cook the tamari mixture until it reduces to make a light syrup. This should take 60 to 90 minutes and yield 1/4 cup of tamari syrup. Meanwhile, trim the tofu slices to make each a perfect rectangle. Pour 1/4 cup of the reserved tamari onto a plate. Place the tofu slices over the tamari, then pour the remaining 1/4-cup of tamari over the tofu. Be careful to pour the tamari so each slice is completely covered with tamari. Marinate 1 hour. Place the tofu slices onto a cookie sheet or baking pan and baste with a thin coating of the tamari syrup. Place under a preheated broiler 4-inches from the heat and broil 2 to 4 minutes, or until the tofu jiggles like hot custard. Use the leftover tamari marinade to baste the tofu as it cooks so the tofu doesn&#39;t dry out. Toss the cucumber and pickled ginger in a small mixing bowl with the yuzu and mirin.

Remove the foil from the roast and continue to bake until the roast is very tender and will pull apart easily with a fork, about 2 hours longer. Remove the pork from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Remove any excess fat from the roast and discard if desired; I just love the crunchy bits of skin left on top! Using 2 forks or your hands, shred the pork into bite-sized pieces. Serve with sauce and buns to make sandwiches. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch Published by William and Morrow, 1993. In a medium non-reactive saucepan set over medium-high heat, add the butter and, when melted, add the onions and cook until they are very soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, paprika, Essence, ground mustard, salt, crushed red pepper, black pepper, and cayenne pepper and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes, or until the tomato paste begins to brown. Add the water, cider vinegar, and dark brown sugar, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have come together, about 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool before using. The sauce may be made up to 1 week in advance and refrigerated in an airtight, non-reactive container. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 17120,&quot;Jeff&#39;s Fresh Black Bean Salsa 1 large sweet Vidalia onion, diced 2 to 3 fresh limes, juiced 1 tablespoon kosher salt 4 large or 5 small ears fresh corn, shucked (or substitute 1 1/2 cups defrosted frozen corn) 2 (28-ounce) cans good quality whole peeled tomatoes (recommended: Tuttorosso brand) 2 cans black beans, drained and rinsed (recommended: Goya) 1 large green pepper, diced 1 cup chopped cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 habanero or Scotch bonnet pepper, finely minced with seeds (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: In a large bowl, mix together the diced onion, juice of 2 limes, and kosher salt. Let stand at room temperature for 10 to 20 minutes (this will soften the bite of the onion). In a large pot with a steamer insert add about 2 inches of water. Add the corn and steam until just cooked through, about 5 to 8 minutes. Then shock the corn in cold water until cool to the touch. With a paring knife, carefully shave off the niblets onto a cutting board. A good way to do this is to slice off about 1/2-inch of the end of the corn cob. Hold the cob upright with the flat end on the board and shave with knife tip pointed downward at 4 o&#39;clock. Don&#39;t cut into the cob. Tweeze and pick through the kernels with fingers, pulling out wayward strands of corn silk. While nothing beats fresh corn for this recipe (and this is a lot easier than it sounds) a close second is a good quality frozen corn. NEVER USE CANNED CORN! Pour the tomatoes into a colander over the sink, and with your hands squeeze out the liquid without overly squishing them. Loosely chop the tomatoes into 1/2-inch chunks. Toss the corn, tomatoes, black beans, green pepper, cilantro, cumin, and habanero into the bowl with the marinated onions. Taste and add more lime juice, salt, cumin, hot pepper or even more cilantro, if needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 17121,&quot;Balsamic Blueberry Mascarpone Crostinis 18 (1/4-inch thick) French baguette slices 1 Tbs. olive oil 12 Tbs. mascarpone cheese 1 cup fresh blueberries 1 Tbs. balsamic vinegar 1 tsp. sugar ? tsp. kosher salt ? tsp. freshly cracked black pepper 2 Tbs. thinly sliced fresh basil leaves Instructions: Preheat oven to 375F.

Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, vanilla extract and eggs. Add the wet ingredients all at once to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined, being careful not to over mix. Fold in the corn kernels and melted butter. Rest the batter for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Add a few tablespoons of the clarified butter to a large cast-iron skillet or cast-iron griddle set over 2 burners, and heat over medium heat. Use a 1/4-cup measuring cup and spoon a scant 1/4 cup into the hot skillet. Cook until small bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on both sides. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a prepared oven-proof plate and cover with a towel. Place in the oven to keep warm until all of the pancakes are cooked and ready to serve. Repeat for the remaining batter. For the goat cheese: Put the goat cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk and mix until smooth. Add the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla, and whip until soft peaks form. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. For the bananas and walnuts: Combine the piloncillo and butter in a high-sided saute pan over medium-low heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar begins to melt. Add the cream and whisk until you have a uniform mixture. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla and salt. Then add the bananas and cook until slightly softened, about 1 minute. Stir in the walnuts. Serve 3 pancakes per person. Top with a dollop of whipped goat cheese and spoon the caramelized banana mixture over each plate.

Reserve the flat piece. To make the cockpit: Lightly draw an oval (about 4 inches wide and 5 inches long) on the top of the watermelon with a pen or marker, slightly farther from the stem end (which will be the back of the spaceship). Use a paring knife to remove the oval, reserving it. Scoop out 3 cups of watermelon balls using a melon baller. Remove the remaining watermelon flesh and save for another use.<br> To make the nose of the spaceship: Cut one of the oranges in half slightly off center, so one half is large than the other. Scoop out the flesh from the smaller half with a spoon to make an orange rind cup (reserve the larger half). Squeeze the juice from the scooped orange flesh into a large bowl; discard the squeezed flesh.<br> Skewer the scooped-out orange half onto a wooden dowel and insert the dowel in the front of the watermelon spaceship, sticking out horizontally. (Tip: You can use a meat mallet to tap in the dowel, skewer or toothpicks if the rind is very hard.) Stick 3 grapes, alternating colors and spaced evenly, on the rest of the dowel.<br> To make the wings: Cut the reserved oval piece in half lengthwise to make the wings. Cut a small piece from the top and bottom of each wing at an angle, so they&#39;ll sit flat against the watermelon. Attach each wing with 2 toothpicks, sitting them slightly behind the cockpit. To make the tail of the spaceship: Insert a skewer in the back of the watermelon spaceship, slightly above where the stem was, at a 45-degree angle. Cut 4 thin slices of starfruit and stick them on the skewer in size order (smallest at the top), evenly spaced. Add a green grape to cover the tip of the skewer.<br> To make the alien ship captain: Slice a small piece from the bottom of the kiwi so it sits flat. Use a paring knife to carve a smile into the kiwi. Use an apple corer to cut 2 eyes from the reserved watermelon flat piece. On the white side, carve a small round in the center of each circle (but don&#39;t go all the way through). Cut the ends from a red grape and press the ends into the rounds to make eyeballs. Stick the eyes onto toothpicks and insert in the top of the kiwi. Slice a piece of starfruit and sit the alien on top to make weird alien feet.<br> Slice the remaining starfruit and add to the bowl with the orange juice. Put the reserved large orange half cut-side down on a cutting board and remove the rind and pith with a paring knife. Cut the orange segments into the bowl. Repeat with the remaining whole oranges. Add the watermelon balls and remaining grapes to the bowl and sprinkle with the sugar. Toss well. Spoon the fruit salad into the spaceship and sit the alien captain in the driver&#39;s seat of the cockpit.

Cook in boiling water for 10 minutes, (add dried scallops here if you like) then lower heat and cook for about 30 minutes. While making stock, wash and drain all vegetables. Cut mizuna into 2 strips (you won&#39;t need much of this-just to add green color). Slice the kamaboko fairly thin. Put a few mochi into toaster and toast until puffy. Remove chicken from stock onto a plate. While chicken is cooling, strain the soup in either cheesecloth or some kind of cloth to strain* to a clean pot. Add the carrots and daikon and cook until tender (about 10 to 15 minutes). (Shred 1 breast of chicken and add to broth. Save the rest to make chicken salad or whatever for another time.) Check flavor and add salt if needed. Just before serving, put mizuna in soup just to parboil-must be crunch/crisp. Put toasted mochi in a bowl, pour the soup over mochi, then put several slices of kamaboko on top and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17139,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Grilled Brewed Awakening Rib Roast with Sunny&#39;s 1-2-3 Horseradish Sauce 4 cups brewed French roast coffee 1/2 cup kosher salt<br> One 3-bone standing rib roast, about 6 pounds<br> 1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs 1/4 cup ground French roast coffee or espresso 1/4 cup dark brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground sage<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons hot Hungarian paprika<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 12 ounces coffee beer Sunny&#39;s 1-2-3 Horseradish Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup sour cream 3 heaping tablespoons prepared horseradish<br> 2 shakes Worcestershire sauce<br> Instructions: For the brine: In a large bowl, add the coffee, salt and 4 cups warm water and stir to dissolve the salt. Add the rib roast. (If the liquid does not cover the meat completely, either make sure to flip the roast halfway through brining, or transfer the brine to a large turkey bag, add the rib roast and then seal tightly so the roast is completely surrounded by the brine.) Brine, refrigerated, at least 8 hours and up to 12. For the rub: In a small bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, ground coffee, brown sugar, parsley, sage, paprika, garlic powder, salt, white pepper and a nice grind or two of black pepper. Remove the roast from the brine and pat it as dry as possible with a paper towel (discard the brining liquid). Using your hands, coat the roast on all sides with the rub, gently massaging it into the flesh. Let rest on the counter to come to room temperature, about 2 hours. For grilling and serving: Place a drip pan under the grates on a grill and pour in the beer. Heat the grill to medium high (300 to 400 degrees F). Place the roast bone-side down directly on the grill over the drip pan on indirect heat. Close the grill and cook until medium rare (120 degrees F), about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Remove from the grill and cover with aluminum foil to rest for a real 20 minutes. Slice between the ribs and serve, or cut the meat off the ribs in a chunk and slice from there. Serve with Sunny&#39;s 1-2-3 Horseradish Sauce. In a small bowl, mix the sour cream, horseradish and Worcestershire.

Pour a mound of kosher salt onto a rimmed baking sheet. Prick the potatoes all over with a fork and nestle them in the salt; this prevents the potatoes from browning and draws out their moisture. Bake the potatoes until fork-tender, about 45 minutes. Let sit until just cool enough to handle. Halve the potatoes lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a potato ricer; discard the skin. Press the flesh through the ricer onto a floured counter or cutting board; let cool 3 to 4 minutes. Spread out the potatoes slightly. Beat the egg with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl and drizzle over the potatoes. Sprinkle the potato mixture with 1 cup flour and knead until a smooth dough forms, adding up to 1/2 cup more flour if the dough is sticky. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest 10 minutes. Lightly flour your surface. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll into \snakes,\ about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut into 1/2-to-1-inch lengths with a bench cutter or knife; transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and lightly dust with flour. Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a large skillet over high heat. Cook, stirring, until the butter develops brown flecks and smells nutty. Watch it closely to keep the butter solids from burning. Remove from the heat. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi; wait until they float to the surface, then simmer 30 more seconds. (Taste one to make sure it&#39;s cooked through.) Return the brown butter to medium-low heat. Scoop the gnocchi from the pot with a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to the skillet and toss until some of the brown-butter flecks stick to the gnocchi. Add the red pepper flakes, sage and a few tablespoons of the gnocchi cooking water; toss again. Remove from the heat and add half of the cheese. Divide among bowls and top with the remaining cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 17157,&quot;Aligot-Style Potatoes with Roasted Garlic 1 head garlic 2 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds medium Yukon gold potatoes (about 4), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 dried bay leaf 1 cup heavy cream, warmed 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 12 ounces shredded Gruyere (about 3 cups) 12 ounces fresh mozzarella, shredded through the large holes of a box grater (about 3 cups) 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut off the top third of the head of garlic to expose the cloves. (Reserve the top part for another use.) Put the bulb on a 12-by-12-inch piece of aluminum foil, drizzle with the olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and several grinds of black pepper. Wrap the foil up and over the garlic, leaving some space between the foil and the exposed garlic cloves and seal the edges. Bake until the garlic cloves are deep golden brown and very tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool slightly, then squeeze out the tender cloves (see Cook&#39;s Note). Meanwhile, add the potatoes and bay leaf to a large pot and fill with enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Season generously with salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower to medium-low and simmer until fork-tender, about 12 minutes. Drain well and discard the bay leaf. Reserve the empty pot.<br> Pass the potatoes and roasted garlic through a potato ricer or food mill back into the pot. They should be very finely mashed and smooth. Place over medium-low heat and stir in the heavy cream and butter with a wooden spoon until creamy and combined. Add half the Gruyere and mozzarella, stirring vigorously until the cheese is completely melted and incorporated. Add the remaining Gruyere and mozzarella and continue to stir until all the cheese is melted and incorporated and the potatoes are smooth and stretchy.

Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the water is absorbed and the rice is soft and creamy, about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure the rice doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom of the pot. While the rice is cooking, heat the butter and olive oil in a small pan over medium heat and add the prosciutto. Cook until it begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Once the rice is cooked, remove to a large baking sheet and let cool for 10 minutes. (Rice can be made a day ahead, cooled, and stored in the refrigerator overnight.) While the rice is cooling, pour 1/2 cup (120 ml) room-temperature water into a shallow bowl. Place the bread crumbs in a separate shallow bowl. Set both aside. Once the rice is cool, combine it with the crisped prosciutto, egg, parsley, Parmigiano cheese, and salt in a large bowl. Using an ice cream scoop or lightly wet hands, create a 2-inch (5-cm) round ball with the rice mixture. Make an indentation in the middle and add a cube of mozzarella cheese. Encase the cheese with rice and reshape into a perfect ball, then set on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining rice mixture. Using your hands, lightly wet the outside of each of the rice balls with the room-temperature water, then roll in the bread crumbs. Set them on the baking sheet. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drop 4 rice balls into the oil (they should fully submerge) and cook until the outside is golden brown, about 3 minutes. If your pot is wide, carefully roll the rice balls in the oil to ensure even cooking on all sides. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining rice balls. They are best eaten at room temperature, garnished with a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese, if you can wait! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 17181,&quot;Three Sister&#39;s Stew 4 cups butternut squash, pumpkin or acorn squash baked with salt and pepper, some raw butter and a little cinnamon, cooled 2 cups medium diced yellow onion 4 tablespoons fresh crushed garlic 4 cups fresh corn from the cob 2 1/2 cups cooked yellow eyed beans, pinto beans can be substituted 2 1/2 cups anasazi beans 1 cup roasted, seeded and peeled and medium diced Anaheim cl 2 cups diced scallion 2 cups queso blanco, white cheddar or Monterey jack may be substituted Olive oil for sauteing Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Remove the chiles from the bag and, using paper towels, wipe off the charred skin from the chiles. With a paring knife, slice the chiles down the center just to reveal the inside, being careful not to fully cut them in half. With a spoon, scoop out the seeds and the vein, keeping the stem and the rest of the cl intact. Place the chiles in a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish and set aside for stuffing. To make the tuna filling: Combine the tuna, peas, corn and mayonnaise in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. To make the pickling liquid: Cook the carrots in boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.<br> Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and onions and cook until the onions are slightly cooked, but still crispy, 5 minutes. Add 2/3 cup water and the vinegar and bring to a simmer (see Cook&#39;s Note, below). Add the carrots, oregano and bay leaves. Simmer until the vegetables are crisp- tender and almost all of the vinegar has evaporated, 8 minutes. Let cool slightly.<br> To stuff the peppers: Stuff the peppers with the tuna mixture. Place back in the baking dish; they should fit snuggly. Pour the warm pickled mixture over the stuffed chiles and allow to cool to room temperature. Cover and chill for 2 hours or overnight. Serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 17204,&quot;Whole Smoked Brisket and Burnt Ends 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 3 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons chili powder 2 teaspoons smoked paprika 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 cup apple cider One 14- to 16-pound whole packer beef brisket 2 cups Kansas City-Style BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 1 tablespoon canola oil 3 cloves garlic, smashed 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice Pinch ground cloves 1 cup ketchup 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons molasses 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon English-style dry mustard powder 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 bay leaf Instructions: Stir together the brown sugar, salt, black pepper, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, granulated garlic, onion powder and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Combine the apple cider and 1 cup water in a food-safe spray bottle. Set both aside. Trim the excess fat and silver skin from the brisket, leaving a 1/4-inch layer of fat on the top side of the brisket (the side with the fat cap). As you trim, make sure to remove any hard pieces of fat found throughout the meat since it will not render off during the cooking process. Transfer the brisket to a rimmed baking sheet; sprinkle it evenly all over with the spice rub then use your hands to rub the spices into the meat. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour to let the seasoning penetrate. Preheat a pellet grill to 225 degrees F (see Cook&#39;s Note). Place the brisket, fat-side-up, directly on the grill grates. Insert a temperature probe if you have one, otherwise you will need an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature regularly. Close the lid and cook for 2 hours. At that point, mist the brisket with the apple cider mixture. Close the lid and cook, misting with the apple cider mixture every hour, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, about 6 hours more. Transfer the brisket to a rimmed baking sheet or cutting board then wrap the meat completely in aluminum foil. Return the wrapped brisket to the grill and re-insert the temperature probe. Close the lid and continue to cook until the internal temperature reaches 203 degrees F, about 3 hours. Remove the brisket from the grill and let rest, wrapped, for 30 minutes. Unwrap the brisket and transfer to a cutting board. Slowly separate the point cut (the thick fatty part) from the flat cut (the thinner, leaner part) by running a sharp knife through the fat that separates the two muscles. The flat cut can be sliced thinly and served immediately. For the burnt ends, increase the pellet grill temperature to 275 degrees F and dice the point cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Transfer to a disposable aluminum tray or rimmed baking sheet lined with foil. Toss with the BBQ sauce and return to the pellet grill. Close the lid and cook, tossing occasionally, until the meat is caramelized all over and dark around the edges, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, chili powder, tomato paste, paprika, crushed red pepper, allspice and cloves; cook, stirring, until the paste is dark brick red, about 3 minutes. Add the ketchup, vinegar, molasses, brown sugar, salt, soy sauce, Worcestershire, mustard, black pepper, bay leaf and 1 cup water. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the flavors come together, about 30 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic cloves and bay leaf; let the sauce cool to room temperature. The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 17205,&quot;The King of Puddings 4 eggs 1 pint (565 milliliters) milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 4 ounces (115 grams) fine bread crumbs 8 ounces (225 grams) sugar 4 level tablespoons jam (raspberry jam is really nice) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Separate 3 of the eggs. Put the yolks in a bowl with the remaining whole egg and beat together. Add the milk, vanilla essence, bread crumbs, and 3 ounces (85 grams) of the sugar.

Add the chicken sausage coins and brown them on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes, turning often. Transfer the sausage to a plate until ready to use. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the skillet and heat it over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft but not browned. Add the garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1 tablespoon room temperature water to the pan to stop the garlic browning, and the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, then stir in the spinach and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Cook, stirring often, until the spinach is wilted and the water in the pan evaporates, about 2 minutes. Spread this frittata filling evenly in the skillet and layer with the chicken sausage. Pour the egg-milk mixture over the frittata filling and use a silicone spatula to scrape the sides of the pan and gently pull eggs from the edges toward the middle so that soft curds form and the frittata begins to firm up. Give the pan a couple of good shakes to release the frittata from the pan bottom (the top of the frittata will still be raw). Sprinkle the olives and feta over the eggs. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until the fritatta is mostly dry (the feta will release some liquid--this is fine--but just be sure the egg is completely cooked) and lightly browned on top, 5 to 7 minutes.<br> Let rest 5 minutes, then slide the frittata onto a large plate and sprinkle with flaky sea salt and pepper to taste. Top with more feta, parsley and olive oil. Slice into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 17212,&quot;Verdura Pizza Cooking spray 1 (13.8-ounce) package refrigerator pizza crust dough (recommended: Pillsbury) 1/2 cup pasta sauce 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 (5.5-ounce) package crumbled goat cheese 1 1/2 cups baby spinach, washed 1 (6-ounce) jar artichoke hearts, quartered in marinade, marinade reserved (recommended: Progresso) 3/4 cup roasted red bell peppers, cut into 1/2-inch strips 2 tablespoons sliced ripe olives Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Add the fish bones and cook them over low heat, covered, until any flesh on them flakes from the bones. Add the vegetables and any shells from the shrimp, cover and cook over low heat until the vegetables sweat, about 10 minutes. Deglaze the pot with the wine, scraping up any particles sticking to the bottom of the pan. Stir in the saffron, thyme, and basil. Add the fish stock or water, and let the mixture gently boil for 1 hour. Then puree it in a food processor or pass it through a food mill. Pass the puree through a medium strainer into a clean stockpot. Stir in the Pernod. Season the base, to taste, with salt, pepper and cayenne. The soup should have a full-bodied flavor: If it seems weak, reduce it over low heat to concentrate the flavor. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Skim any fish oil from the top of the soup and reserve it to stir into the rouille. Toast the croutons in the oven until golden, and then brush with rouille. Bring the soup to a boil. Add the shellfish and/or uncooked fish fillets to the soup, 1 variety at a time. Cook each until done; then remove from the soup and keep warm. (The lobsters will take about 10 minutes and their shells will be bright red when done; medium shrimp will take 3 or 4 minutes to cook; fish fillets from 1 to 7 minutes, depending on their thickness (they should remain slightly underdone); and the mussels and clams only cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until their shells open). Presentation: Place 1 crouton in the bottom of each large, shallow, heated soup plates. Then arrange the fish and/or shellfish around each crouton. Ladle the hot soup over all. Serve immediately. Pass additional rouille in a separate serving bowl. Clean the fish bones under cold running water, removing the gills from the head and any traces of blood on the frames. In a large saucepan, heat the oil. In it sweat the fish bones and vegetables over low heat, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring once or twice to prevent them from browning. Deglaze the pan with the wine, and then add enough water to cover the bones and vegetables by 2 inches. Add the bouquet garni and bring the liquid to a boil. Skim the froth from the surface, reduce the heat, and simmer the stock for 20 to 25 minutes. Strain the stock into a clean saucepan. Bring it to a boil and reduce it over medium heat to 1 quart. Note: Fish stock will keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days or frozen for 2 to 3 weeks. After that time the flavor begins to fade. Yield: 1 quart Prep Time: 20 minutes Cook Time: 35 minutes In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, garlic, mustard, and chili flakes.

Line two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners and set aside.<br> Crack the eggs into a small container and set aside. Set the sugar aside. Then, in a small bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, nutmeg and salt together with a fork and set aside.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed, beat the butter with a paddle attachment until the butter is light in color and fluffy. Add the sugar to the butter and continue beating until the sugar is uniformly incorporated into the butter. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Then restart the mixer on low speed and add 1 egg at a time, waiting until it is fully incorporated in the butter mixture before adding the next egg.<br> Once all the eggs have been added, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure that all the butter is incorporated with the eggs. Add the dry ingredients in three additions, alternating with the milk and oil, added in two additions, fully incorporating each addition into the batter before moving to the next step. If needed, stop the mixer after each addition and scrape down the sides of the bowl, and then resume mixing on low. Once all the dry ingredients and the milk have been combined with the butter mixture, evenly fill the cupcake pan cavities two-thirds of the way. Bake the cupcakes until the top of each cupcake is slightly springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 14 to 16 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately turn the cupcakes out of the pan onto a cooling rack. Let the cupcakes cool completely.<br> Putting it all together: Using an apple corer or knife, core the centers out of the cooled cupcakes and remove. Fill the cupcakes with the Vanilla Bean Pastry Cream. Pipe the Dark Chocolate Italian Meringue Buttercream to cover the top of each cooled cupcake. Bring the shallow dish or container for the finished pastry cream near the stovetop, and have the plastic wrap nearby as well. Measure the butter and vanilla bean paste into a small container and bring over near the stovetop. Pour the milk and 1/4 cup sugar into a heavy saucepot and scald over medium heat until the milk starts to steam. Do not boil the milk!<br> Meanwhile, whisk together the cornstarch and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar to combine and prevent any lumps in the cornstarch, and then add the whole egg and egg yolks. Whisk the egg yolk mixture until smooth and completely combined, and then bring over to the stove area and set the bowl with the yolks on top of a damp dish towel.<br> When the milk is steaming, remove from the heat. Whisking the egg yolk mixture constantly, slowly pour the milk in a steady stream into the egg yolk mixture. Once all the milk is combined with the egg yolk mixture, pour it back into the saucepot and return to medium-high heat, whisking constantly. Continue whisking and bring it to a boil. Let the egg yolk mixture boil for 1 minute (and continue whisking constantly so lumps don&#39;t form!) and then remove from the heat. Stir in the butter and vanilla bean paste, and then pour the entire contents of the pot into the shallow dish.<br> Immediately cover the surface of the pastry cream with the plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool, about 1 hour. Once cool, remove from the refrigerator and whisk until completely smooth and lump free. Fill a piping bag with the pastry cream and set aside until you need it. Measure the sugar and 1/4 cup water into a heavy saucepan and heat over high heat until the sugar mixture reaches 250 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes (use a candy thermometer to gauge the temperature).<br> While the sugar is cooking, beat the egg whites on medium speed in the mixing bowl of a stand mixture to the soft peak stage (whites will look foamy and white). Be careful not to over whip the whites (if the egg whites start to look clumpy, then they&#39;ve been over whipped. If this happens, toss them out and start again! If the whites are beating faster than the sugar is cooking, turn down the mixer speed. You can always turn up the speed if you need to!) Add the cream of tartar and continue whipping.<br> While the egg whites are whipping on medium speed, gently pour the sugar syrup down the side of the mixing bowl. Turn the speed up to high and whip until the mixing bowl no longer feels warm to the touch, about 7 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, melt the dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl at 30 second intervals, stirring in between each interval, until the chocolate is completely melted. Turn the mixer speed back to medium and add the butter in small chunks until it is completely incorporated. Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the vanilla bean paste and sea salt. Turn the mixer back on medium-low speed until the vanilla paste has mixed entirely through the buttercream. Spoon a small amount (about 1/2 cup) of the buttercream into the melted dark chocolate and stir to combine. Add the chocolate mixture back to the buttercream and whip thoroughly, stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all the chocolate is combined.<br> Fit an 18-inch plastic piping bag with an 847 star tip and twist the bag right by the tip to prevent the buttercream from leaking out. While you grasp the piping bag right above the star tip with your hand, fold the top of the piping bag over your hand and spoon the butter cream into the piping bag. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17272,&quot;Spinach Gratin 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 4 cups chopped yellow onions (2 large) 1/4 cup flour 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg 1 cup heavy cream 2 cups milk 3 pounds frozen chopped spinach, defrosted (5 (10-ounce) packages) 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Brush the hoisin sauce on both sides of each pork chop, and sprinkle both sides lightly with salt and pepper. Rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Bring 12 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Remove from the heat and add the dried rice noodles to submerge. When the noodles are tender but still have some bite, about 3 minutes, drain through a fine mesh sieve. Reserve the noodles for a later use. Toss the eggplant and string beans in the oil with some salt and pepper, and then transfer to the grill. Cook the eggplant until tender but they still hold their shape, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Grill the string beans, turning occasionally, until charred and crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer the eggplant and string beans to a cutting board and cut into bite-size pieces. Reduce the heat to medium. Grill the pork chops until just cooked through, 2 minutes per side. Remove the pork chops to a plate and rest for 5 minutes, then thinly slice across the grain. In a small bowl, mix together the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, chili-garlic sauce and 1/2 cup water. Divide the noodles, pork slices, eggplant, string beans, cilantro, tomatoes, peanuts and fish sauce mixture among four large serving bowls.

To make the custard: Place 4 (6-ounce to 1 cup) ramekins on a baking pan. Place a saucepan on the burner. Add the cream, sugar, and the vanilla bean. Scrape the little seeds out of one half, and add them to the pot. Bring it to &#39;scald&#39; (just before it begins to boil), but watch it because it can burn. Pull off the heat. Whisk the egg yolks in a medium bowl until well blended. Gradually, whisk the hot cream mixture into the yolks. Divide the custard evenly among the ramekins. Place the baking pan in the oven, and add some hot tap water into the pan to come partially up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until just set, for about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until the custards are well set, about 2 to 3 hours. To make the pineapple: Peel, core and slice the pineapple off the core lengthwise, and into 6-inch thick pieces. In a medium pan, heat the canola oil. Pop in the pineapple and let it cook until browned on the edges, then dust with brown sugar to caramelize. Bring to a sizzle allowing the fruit to get nicely coated and slightly brown on the edges. Turn off the heat. Add a good shot of rum (if you do it while the burner is on, you may well need those firemen to put out the blaze!). Turn the heat on and let it &#39;flambe&#39;. Add a generous bit of butter to build sheen and thicken this caramel sauce. When the fire subsides, place 2 pieces of pineapple onto your serving plate, top with a nice mound of creme brulee, dust it all again with brown sugar and torch it to a nice crunchy finish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 17278,&quot;Broccoli and Cauliflower Salad 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced 2 slices bacon, cut in small pieces, cooked to crisp 1/2 bunch broccoli, cut into small florets (about 1 1/2 cups) 1/2 small head cauliflower, cut into small florets (about 1 1/2 cups) 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Shock the onions in an ice water bath for 10 minutes to temper the sharp flavor, and pat dry.<br> Place the bacon, broccoli, cauliflower and onions in a large salad bowl.

Add the sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites to the mixing bowl, and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar completely dissolves. Transfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes. Toss in a couple of chunks of butter at a time, making sure the pieces are incorporated before adding more. After all the butter is added, continue whisking on medium-high speed. The mixture will deflate and appear curdled. Continue whisking until the buttercream comes back together to form a smooth and spreadable consistency. Slowly drizzle in the optional flavoring while beating until smooth and light. (If the frosting is very soft or begins to break, refrigerate until set but still spreadable and then beat until light before using.)

If not, let cool for 5 minutes.<br> Lay a sheet of gim rough-side up (smooth/shiny-side down) on a bamboo sushi mat with one of the shorter sides closest to you. Spread 3/4 cup of the rice mixture (about the size of a baseball) across the entire sheet in an even layer, leaving 1/4 inch of gim on the bottom and 1/2 inch on the top empty. Make sure the rice is evenly distributed and that no spot is empty.<br> Spread one-quarter of the egg, spinach and carrot filling horizontally in rows in the middle of the rice, covering only about a third of the rice. Leaving the rest of rice completely empty, continue layering one-quarter of the crab stick, burdock root and danmuji on top. Using your thumb and index finger and with the help of the bamboo mat, start rolling slowly from the side nearest you, while using your middle and ring fingers to secure and tuck in the filling. As you roll and the kimbap begins to enclose onto itself, pull the bamboo mat toward you and continue to roll until completely closed. When you reach the end of the rice, lightly brush a small amount of water at the top edge of the gim (to ensure sealing) and continue rolling, gently pressing down and squeezing on the bamboo mat. Slowly unroll the bamboo mat and re-center the kimbap. Reroll and gently press down on the bamboo mat one last time to secure everything in its place. Lightly brush the rolls with sesame oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Cut off the very end tips of the chicken wings and discard. Cut the wings in half where the joint bones meet. Make sure the wings are dry. In a bowl, combine the flour, salt and some pepper; add the wing pieces and toss to coat. In a large cast-iron skillet or a small stockpot, heat the oil to 350 degrees F on a deep-fat thermometer. Shake off any excess coating from the wings and drop the pieces into the hot oil. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the wings from the pan to a bowl. Toss with 1/2 cup of the sauce of your choice until evenly coated. Serve immediately. Wearing gloves to protect your hands from the cl&#39;s volatile oils, remove most of the charred skin and all the seeds from the habanero. In a small saucepan, combine the cl, molasses, honey, ketjap manis, vinegar, tamarind and garlic, and bring just to a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Add the ketchup and Dijon mustard to the syrup and pour into a blender and puree, or use an immersion blender to puree right in the pan. Stored in an airtight container, the syrup will last up to 2 months in the refrigerator. Put 1/2 cup of the sauce in a bowl, add the hot fried wings and toss until evenly coated.<br> Combine the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl and stir to make a slurry. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add the canola oil. Add the green onions, ginger, garlic and black beans, and saute quickly for a couple of minutes. Add the water and cornstarch mixture, vinegar and honey. Stir until the cornstarch starts to thicken the sauce, a minute or two. Add the sesame oil and red pepper flakes if using. Put the sauce in a bowl, add the hot fried wings and toss until evenly coated. Serve hot, sprinkled with the sesame seeds.<br> In a saute pan over medium heat, add the olive oil. Add the garlic, ginger, orange juice and 1/4 cup water and bring to a simmer. Add the preserved lemon or lemon zest, honey, orange blossom water, turmeric, cayenne pepper, cinnamon and coriander. Cook until the sauce is reduced a bit, another 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Put the sauce in a bowl, add the hot fried wings and toss until evenly coated. Serve hot, sprinkled with the parsley and cilantro, with the olives and almonds alongside.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 17294,&quot;Grilled Shrimp Dogs with Grilled Vegetable Relish 1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined and tails removed 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 grape tomatoes 1 small red onion, cut into 1/2-inch rounds 1 large dill pickle, sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch thick 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates 2 tablespoons dill pickle brine 4 hot dog buns Instructions: Combine half of the shrimp, 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper in the bowl of a food processor and process until mostly smooth. Add the remaining shrimp and pulse until the shrimp is mostly chopped into large pieces. Carefully transfer the shrimp mixture onto a parchment-paper-lined sheet tray. Wet your hands and lightly form the shrimp mixture into a disc (wetting your hands will prevent the shrimp mixture from sticking to them). Divide the disc into 4 equal amounts. Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 sausages or \shrimp dogs\ approximately 6 inches long and 1 inch wide, wetting your hands as needed. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you make the grilled vegetable relish. Prepare a grill or large grill pan for medium-high heat. Thread the tomatoes onto the wooden skewer, leaving only 1/2 inch of the skewer revealed on each end. (This prevents the skewer from having to be soaked in water before grilling.) Put the skewered tomatoes onto a baking sheet along with the onions and pickle slices. Brush all of the vegetables liberally with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Lightly oil the grill grates. Arrange the skewered tomatoes, onions, and pickle slices on the hot grill. Cook until the tomatoes are lightly charred in spots and have started to burst, 6 to 8 minutes, using a pair of tongs to rotate the tomatoes occasionally so that they cook evenly. Cook the onions until lightly charred and the flesh is tender, 6 to 8 minutes total. Cook the pickle slices until lightly charred and have distinct grill marks, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the grilled vegetables to the same baking sheet that they were on before. Cool the vegetables slightly before quartering the tomatoes and chopping the onions and pickle slices into small pieces. Place the cut vegetables into a medium mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and the pickle brine. Stir to combine and season to taste with salt and pepper. Reserve. Remove the shrimp dogs from the refrigerator and brush them liberally with the remaining tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Use your hands to carefully arrange the shrimp dogs on the grill and cook until lightly charred on all sides and just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes total, using a pair of tongs to rotate the shrimp dogs as they cook. You will know that they are cooked through when the texture turns from soft to springy and a cake tester inserted through the center comes out hot to the touch. Transfer to a plate or baking sheet. Gently open up each of the 4 hot dog buns, being careful not to unhinge them. Arrange the hot dog buns cut-side down on the grill and cook until lightly charred and warmed through, about 1 minute. Smear the inside of the grilled buns with the remaining 2 tablespoons mayonnaise. Place a shrimp dog on each hot dog bun then spread a spoonful of the reserved relish on top of each. Serve with any remaining relish on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 17295,&quot;Jalapeno Hushpuppies Peanut oil, for frying (about 1 1/2 quarts) 1 1/2 cups self-rising cornmeal 1 cup self-rising flour 1/2 onion, chopped 1 7-ounce can diced jalapeno peppers, drained (or 6 fresh jalapenos, seeded if desired, and diced) 1 15-ounce can creamed corn 2 large eggs, lightly beaten Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Hot sauce, for serving (optional) Instructions: Pour about 1 1/4 inches of peanut oil into a deep-fryer or Dutch oven; heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F.

Toss the cherry tomatoes and olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Transfer to a 2 1/2- to 3-quart baking dish, place the feta in the center of the tomatoes and season with a pinch of black pepper. Bake until the tomatoes have burst and the feta has softened, about 30 minutes. Raise the heat to 450 degrees F and continue to cook until the tomatoes and feta are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.<br> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 13 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then thoroughly drain the pasta.<br> As soon as the tomatoes and feta come out of the oven, stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes (if using). Use the back of a spoon to smash the tomatoes and feta into a smooth and creamy sauce (it\u2019s okay if some of the oil isn\u2019t fully integrated).

Lightly spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. Place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes. Gently remove the egg whites from the mixer to a medium bowl and set aside. Combine the sugar and butter in the bowl of the mixer and cream together, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and whip an additional 30 seconds to incorporate. In another medium bowl, sift together the cake flour, baking powder and fine salt. With the mixer on low speed, pour half the coconut milk into the butter and sugar mixture. Turn the mixer off and add half the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are just incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Repeat this process with the remaining coconut milk and dry ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the whipped egg whites into the batter. Pour the batter into the greased baking dish. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Allow the cake to cool completely. For the coconut syrup: Place the coconut water and honey in a microwave-safe container. Microwave until the honey is dissolved, about 1 minute. Poke the surface of the cake with the tines of a fork. Brush the cake with the warm syrup. Sprinkle the flaked coconut evenly over the cake. For the frosting: Place the sugar and coconut water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Let boil for 2 minutes before you add it to the egg whites (see below). Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vanilla extract. Reduce the speed to the lowest setting and slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the egg whites. Continue to drizzle until all the syrup has been added. Then, turn the mixer up to high speed and whip until the frosting becomes thick, glossy and holds stiff peaks, about 3 minutes more. The frosting should be used to decorate the cake immediately. Scrape the frosting onto the center of the cake in a large mound. Push outward with an offset spatula, spreading the frosting over the surface of the cake and making cloudlike swirls to cover completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 17302,&quot;Turkey Sausage and Broccoli Pasta 8 ounces rigatoni 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 pound turkey sausage Red pepper flakes, to taste 1 onion, chopped 3/4 cups chicken stock 1/2 red pepper, sliced 1 1/2 cups broccoli florets Instructions: Prepare rigatoni according to directions on box.

Instructions: For the syrup: In a medium saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil until the syrup reduces to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the cream and cinnamon. Keep the syrup warm over low heat until ready to serve. (The syrup can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, then cover and refrigerate. Reheat before serving). For the French toast: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Preheat a nonstick griddle or large nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Using a serrated knife, remove the top from the panettone. Cut the bottom of the panettone in half crosswise. Cut each half into 4 equal pieces. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, milk, and sugar until smooth. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter on the griddle. Working in batches, dip slices of panettone into the custard, turning to allow both sides to absorb the custard. Cook the soaked panettone slices until golden brown and firm to the touch, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the French toast to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and panettone slices. Transfer the French toast to plates. Drizzle the cinnamon syrup over the French toast and place a dollop of mascarpone on top.

Cut the onion in half and add one of the halves to the pot; chop the other half and add it to the pot too. Add the ginger and habanero pepper, if using, then add water to cover. Cook over medium heat until the onion is translucent, the fat from the wings begins to render and the broth is very fragrant, about 15 minutes. Remove the habanero pepper, if using, and transfer it to a blender or food processor. Add the peanut butter, garlic and 3 cups water to the blender and blend 1 minute. Stir the peanut butter mixture into the broth; it will foam and bubbles will form on the surface. Cook, stirring continuously to stop it from boiling over, about 5 minutes; some of the foam/bubbles will disappear and the soup will settle. Remove the ginger from the soup, add it to the same blender (cut it into smaller pieces first, if desired) with 2 cups of the soup and blend until smooth. Stir the ginger mixture back into the soup. Transfer the onion half to the blender with 1 cup of the soup and blend until smooth; stir the mixture into the soup to combine. Stir in the tomato sauce. Let the soup simmer until it starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. If using the mushrooms, add them to the soup, cover and let simmer, about 5 minutes, then remove the cover (if not adding the mushrooms, proceed to the next step).

Spread with the pesto and top with the mozzarella. Arrange the zucchini in overlapping rows on top. Sprinkle with the parmesan and drizzle with the olive oil. Transfer the baking sheet to the hot pizza stone and bake until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with basil; season with salt and pepper. Combine the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Stir in 2 cups warm water (about 105 degrees F) and 2 tablespoons olive oil with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until the dough rises slightly, about 1 hour. Using lightly floured hands, transfer the dough to a generously floured surface and knead several times until it just starts becoming smooth and elastic, about 1 minute (do not over-knead). Transfer to a lightly oiled large bowl. Tightly cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, place a pizza stone or inverted rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F.

In a large stainless-steel bowl, combine the flour and salt. Slowly add the boiling water in 1/4 cup increments, mixing with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is no longer too hot to handle. All the water may not be needed. Knead the dough on a floured work surface until it becomes smooth and elastic, 15 to 20 minutes. Form the dough into a ball, return it to the bowl, and cover it with a damp cloth. Allow the dough to rest for 1 hour. To form the wrappers, add more flour to the work surface. Divide the dough in half. Shape 1 portion into a log and roll it back and forth under your palms to make a thin sausage shape measuring about 1-inch in diameter. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces. One by one, stand each piece on end, flatten the piece with your palm, and rollout to form a circular wrapper about 3 inches in diameter and 1/16-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining dough. To fill the dumplings, place about 1/2 teaspoon of the filling in the center of each wrapper. Avoid getting filling on the edges of the wrapper, which would prevent proper sealing. Place another wrapper on top pressing down around filling to remove excess air. Crimp the edges together. Continue with remaining filling and wrappers. For the filling: In a food processor, puree the chicken until smooth then add the goose liver, foie gras and egg and puree until smooth again. Do not over puree as it could break the filling. Remove from processor and fold in the chives. Season. Steam dumplings in a steamer or steamer basket for about 15 minutes or until cooked through. Remove and keep warm until serving. Meanwhile, in a medium non-reactive saucepan, coat lightly with oil and caramelize the shallots. Deglaze with both vinegars and reduce by 80 percent. Add honey and check for seasoning. Keep at room temperature. PLATING Zig-zag syrup on a plate and top with dumplings.

Cool completely, then grind with a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder. Add the garlic, sage, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper and the red pepper flakes; grind to mix. Combine the spices with the ground pork in a bowl. Add the maple syrup and mix. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dough: Combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, Italian seasoning, mustard powder, baking soda, cayenne and sea salt in a food processor; pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse 5 to 6 times (for 4 to 5 seconds each time), until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Add the mozzarella and pulse 3 to 4 times, until well combined. Add the buttermilk and process until a ball forms. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Form the sausage mixture into 16 mini sausages, about 4 inches long (use about 2 tablespoons sausage for each). Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the sausages in 2 batches until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Cool on paper towels. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Sprinkle with flour, then gently pat out and roll into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle. Trim the edges to make them even. Cut the rectangle in half crosswise, then cut each half into four 3-by-8-inch strips. Cut each strip in half diagonally to form 16 long triangles. Transfer to a baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place 1 sausage on the wide end of a dough triangle and roll up. Repeat with the remaining dough and sausages. Arrange the pigs in blankets 2 inches apart on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets. Brush the tops with the beaten egg and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the chipotle-agave mustard: Combine the agave, both mustards, the adobo sauce and a pinch of black pepper in a bowl. Serve the pigs in blankets with the mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 17338,&quot;Chilled Cantaloupe and Mint Soup 1 cantaloupe, seeds and rind removed, cut into chunks 2 tablespoons fresh mint, minced<br> 1 lime, juiced<br> Salt to taste<br> Instructions: In a blender, combine all ingredients and blend until smooth.

At this point, add in the flour and stir vigorously with a spoon. Continue to cook until the dough becomes a solid mass and begins to pull away from the sides of the pot, about 3 to 5 minutes. Switch off the heat, mix in the vanilla extract and add in the eggs, 1 at a time, incorporating each egg before adding in the next.*<br> The resulting pastry should be flexible and soft, but firm enough to hold its shape. Set it aside covered with plastic for 5 minutes. When ready to make the pastries, fill a deep skillet or deep-fryer 2/3 full of oil and heat it to 300 to 325 degrees F. Form the dough into doughnut hole shapes. Fry the beignets, in batches, until golden brown, about 3 to 6 minutes being sure not crowd them. Remove them from the oil to a cooling rack.<br> Caramel: Put the rosemary and water into a small pot and simmer over medium heat until the rosemary is limp, about 3 to 6 minutes. Strain the liquid, discarding the rosemary, and pour it back into the pot. (Chef&#39;s Note: If this liquid is not 1/4 cup exactly, add water.) Add in the sugar and corn syrup. Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the syrup thickens. Stir in the heavy cream and butter and switch off the heat. Pour into a serving bowl and reserve for the beignets.<br> Arrange the beignets on a serving platter and dust with powdered sugar. Serve with the honey and Rosemary Caramel in small bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 17340,&quot;Yogurt Cheese 2 quarts plain yogurt Instructions: Place 4 layers of cheesecloth in colander set over a bowl. Add the yogurt and let drain overnight in the refrigerator. The desired consistency is that of soft cream cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 17341,&quot;Deconstructed S&#39;mores 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 2 1/2 tablespoons gelatin powder 2 large egg whites (about 1/4 cup) 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 2 tablespoons peach compound (or the compound of your choosing) 2 tablespoons cornstarch 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 8 ounces unsalted butter 3/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/3 cup molasses 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 cup whole wheat flour 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 cup wheat germ 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 teaspoon apple pectin 1 cup strawberry puree 1 tablespoon glucose 1 teaspoon citric acid 4 ounces unsalted butter 1/2 cup strawberry jelly 10 ounces white chocolate couverture, melted 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 8 ounces dark chocolate couverture Instructions: For the marshmallows: Heat 2/3 cup water with 3/4 cup sugar and the corn syrup in a one-quart sauce pan over medium heat. While the syrup is heating up, place 3/4 cup water in a shallow 2 cup bowl and sprinkle the gelatin powder over the top. Once the gelatin has completely dissolved, mix the contents gently. While the syrup is heating up, begin to whip the egg whites and the cream of tartar with a hand mixer. Once the egg whites have reached a medium peak, sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar into the whites and continue mixing. Once the syrup reaches 260 degrees F, mix in the gelatin mixture and stream this into the egg whites. Let this mixture cool slightly and add the peach compound. Combine the cornstarch and powdered sugar. Pipe the marshmallow mixture into whatever shape desired, into mold that has been sprinkled with the cornstarch and powdered sugar. Sprinkle the powdered sugar cornstarch mix on top and let dry. For the Graham crackers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using a hand-mixer, cream together the butter, brown sugar and molasses until it lightens in color. Sift the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, wheat germ, baking soda and salt together. Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture in two parts. Do not over mix. Cover in plastic and place in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Lightly dust the rolling surface with all-purpose flour, and roll the graham crackers down to 1/4-inch. Cut with a circle cutter the size of a quarter and bake for 12 to 15 minutes.<br> For the jelly: Mix 1 tablespoon of the sugar with the pectin. Place the strawberry puree into a one-quart saucepan. Bring the strawberry puree to a simmer, and sprinkle the pectin sugar on top. Once this mixture comes to a boil, add the remaining 1 cup sugar, the glucose and citric acid. On a low heat, bring the mixture to 215 degrees F. Pour the mixture into a glass bowl and cover with plastic wrap in order to prevent the mixture from forming a skin.<br> For the ganache: Using a hand mixer, cream together the butter and jelly until it lightens in color. Next, stream in the warm white chocolate and the balsamic vinegar. Do not over-mix. Scrape this into a disposable pastry bag, and pipe these into quarter-size discs. Once the butter chocolates have set, start to melt the dark chocolate couverture. Try not to take the chocolate temperature above 120 degrees F, because if you do, the s&#39;mores will be hard to handle. Dip each chocolate into the dark chocolate and let set. There is no need to temper the chocolate because you will eventually set the marshmallow on fire.<br> To assemble: Place the graham cracker down, then place a butter ganache, and top with a marshmallow. Carefully set the marshmallow on fire and blow it out when the s&#39;more reaches the proper tastiness. Repeat for the remaining s&#39;mores. Eat immediately. If these are prepared earlier, just set the marshmallows on fire right before you are ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 17342,&quot;Salmon Potato Hash 1 (2-pound) center-cut, skin-on, salmon fillet Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Fresh dill, for garnish About 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 russet potatoes, rinsed in water and cut into large dice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 onions, thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 green onions, finely chopped 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed 1 teaspoon smoked paprika Pinch cayenne pepper Water White vinegar 4 to 6 large organic farm fresh eggs Lemony Hollandaise: 3 egg yolks 1/2 lemon, zested 1 lemon, juiced 1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard 3 tablespoons water Pinch cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, melted Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. For the salmon: Place the salmon on a large baking sheet skin-side down. Drizzle salmon with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Place into the oven and bake for 30 minutes until flaky. Transfer to a cutting board. For the Hash: Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat and add olive oil. Once heated add the potatoes and shallow-fry for about 8 minutes until evenly browned on all sides. Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and place onto a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large bowl. Using 2 forks, flake the salmon, removing it in chunks from the skin, and fold into the potatoes. Remove most of the oil, leaving only a couple of tablespoons. Place over medium heat and add the sliced onions, sliced peppers and garlic and allow to caramelize. Add the green onions, thyme leaves, paprika and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and stir to combine. Add the potatoes back to the pan and stir to combine. For the eggs: Place a large saute pan with high sides over medium heat and fill with a few inches of water. Heat until just below a simmer. Add a splash of white vinegar and using a wooden spoon, stir the water in 1 direction to create a small whirlpool. Crack the eggs and add, 1 at a time, to the spinning water. Allow to poach until desired doneness. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate. For the hollandaise: Put the egg yolks, lemon zest, lemon juice, mustard, water, salt and pepper, to taste, into a blender. Blend together and then slowly start pouring in the melted butter with the blender running. Stop the blender when all the butter has been incorporated. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Thin the hollandaise with a little water, if it is too thick. Place the salmon-potato hash on serving plates or serving platter and top with the eggs. Pour hollandaise sauce over the eggs and garnish with or dill. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 17343,&quot;Maple Sugar Sweet Potato Fries Vegetable oil, for frying 14 cup maple sugar 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon mild yellow curry 2 large sweet potatoes or yams, skin-on 1 tablespoon minced green onion, to garnish Instructions: In a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot, heat enough vegetable oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the maple sugar, black pepper, salt, and yellow curry. Reserve. Scrub the sweet potatoes clean. Cut in half and then into 12-inch thick wedges.

Add the oysters and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour. While the oysters are soaking, whisk the mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, the remaining tablespoon of hot sauce, pickle brine, 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, parsley, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder and sumac together in a medium mixing bowl. Add the iceberg lettuce and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Heat the peanut oil in a 5-quart Dutch oven over high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Then lower the heat to slowly bring the oil up to 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, combine the cornmeal, panko, the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Remove each oyster from the marinade and shake off the excess moisture. Dredge in the cornmeal mixture, then move to a cooling rack set over a half-sheet pan. Allow the oysters to sit for several minutes afterwards to allow the breading to set. Transfer 6 oysters at a time to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (Watch your thermometer because the introduction of cold food will likely pull the temperature down a bit.) Carefully transport the fried oysters to a clean cooling rack. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Bring the oil back to 370 to 375 degrees F and repeat with the remaining oysters. Split the rolls in half lengthwise. Tear out a bit of bread from the center of each roll, creating a trough. (If you wish, lightly toast the rolls in a 375 degrees F oven for 3 minutes.) Line the bottom of your roll with slaw and top with 5 to 6 oysters. Consume. Notice how the slaw is kinda gooshy (in a good way) and how that contrasts with the crunch of the oysters. Pulling some of the bread out of the middle will help the sandwich stay together, but you&#39;re still going to need a roll of paper towels to eat this thing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17346,&quot;Roasted Chicken Salad 7 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts Salt and pepper Salt and pepper<br> 2 pinches cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon lavender 1 lemon, juiced 3 cloves garlic, minced 2/3 cup sliced roasted almonds 1 large onion, chopped 1/2 bunch celery, chopped Dressing, recipe follows 2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves 2 tablespoons chives 2 tablespoons chopped tarragon leaves 1 cup mayonnaise 3/4 cup sour cream<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray. Use a medium ice cream scoop to portion cookie dough on the prepared pans. Use two fingers to lightly flatten each scoop of dough. Bake, rotating and switching the pans halfway through, 13 to 14 minutes for a chewy cookie (a few minutes longer if you like a more well-done cookie). Eat warm with a glass of milk and cool the rest on a wire rack. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chianti]&quot; 17355,&quot;Ice Cream Flower Pot Desserts 1 whole pound cake (store-bought, frozen) 1 gallon ice cream, your favorite flavor 1 package chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Oreo&#39;s 1 package gummy worms Instructions: Slice the pound cake (frozen is fine) into 1- to 1 1/2-inch slices. Next, with a biscuit cutter or cookie cutter that fits the bottom of the flower pot, cut the slices into rounds. (You can put the scraps in a zip-top freezer bag and use them at a later date.)<br> Into each of your (washed and dried) flower pots, drop a round of pound cake, lightly pressing to make sure they are all the way down. Hold a straw up against the side of a flowerpot and snip it so it&#39;s 1/2 to 1 inch shorter than the top. Then, just use that as a guide to cut the rest of the straws. Stick each straw into the center of each pot, anchoring it into the cake.<br> Now, grab whatever flavor ice cream you&#39;d like to use, and either set it out on the counter to soften it OR nuke it for 20 seconds or so. It needs to be somewhat soft for this step. Just spoon it into the pots, working it around the straw, until it almost reaches the very tip top of the straw. Clean up the top edges of the pot with a damp paper towel. Now return the pots to the freezer until firm.<br> In a food processor, pulse the cookies until they resemble nice, rich topsoil. (You can also crush them in a zip-top bag with a rolling pin.) When they are nice and firm, take the pots out of the freezer. Place a couple of gummy worms on top of the ice cream, then spoon the dirt (crushed cookies) over the top. Be generous here! Place a fresh flower into the straw and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 17356,&quot;The Best Parker House Rolls 1 1/3 cups whole milk 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 cup warm water, about 110 degrees F One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 3 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 5 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) Nonstick cooking spray Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling Instructions: Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium-high until it just starts to simmer, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter and the sugar until melted. Set aside to cool. Put the warm water in a small liquid measuring cup and stir in the yeast. Let it sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Combine the milk mixture, yeast mixture, eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and half the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Slowly add the remaining flour, mixing until a smooth ball forms. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to knead the dough until very smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Coat a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray, then place the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 60 to 75 minutes. Melt the remaining 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Set aside. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray, line with parchment paper then spray the paper. Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto the prepared surface. Pat into an even thickness. Use a chef&#39;s knife or bench scraper to divide the dough into 24 pieces, then shape into balls to create small rolls. Place in the prepared baking dish in rows of 4 by 6, then brush the tops of the rolls with 4 tablespoons of the melted butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the rolls lightly with flaky sea salt. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush with the remaining 4 tablespoons melted butter. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17357,&quot;Crab Cakes 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 dash Worcestershire sauce 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped 2 green onions (scallions), white and green parts, finely chopped 2 large egg yolks 2 pounds jumbo lump crabmeat 6 cups fresh breadcrumbs Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, seafood seasoning, cayenne, Worcestershire sauce, bell peppers, green onions and egg yolks. Gently stir in the crabmeat. Put the breadcrumbs on a cookie sheet. Mold the crab cake with one hand and pat the cake with bread crumbs using the other hand. Form into 10 crab cakes, 3 inches wide and 1/2-inch thick. Each cake will need 3/4 cup bread crumbs. Heat 4 cups of oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add a single layer of crab cakes and fry in the oil, turning 3 of 4 times until crispy on outside, about 5 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining crab cakes.

Whisk the ingredients together to create a smooth texture. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water on the stove (being careful of the hot water in the pot) and continue to whisk in long strokes so that the egg mixture rides high up the side of the bowl. Continue to whisk air into the eggs, all the while over the pot of hot water, for 5 to 7 minutes or until the mixture is triple in volume. When the eggs have increased in volume and thickened serve with fresh fruit and pound cake.; &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 17359,&quot;Phil&#39;s Calcionetti 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup powdered sugar Pinch salt 2 tablespoons shortening 2 eggs 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest 1/2 cup chick peas, cooked 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons grated chocolate 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts Vegetable oil, to fry 1/4 cup milk, to seal dough Powdered sugar, to dust cookies Instructions: Preheat vegetable oil to 360 degrees. To make the dough, sift together flour, sugar and salt. Mix in shortening using hands or pastry cutter until crumbly. Add eggs and lemon zest. Mix until just incorporated. Use pasta machine to roll out half the dough to 1/8-inch thickness and forming a long rectangular shape (roughly 15 inches by 3 inches), being careful not to overwork dough. Repeat with other half of dough. Set aside. To make the filling, use fork to mash chickpeas thoroughly. Stir in brown sugar, honey, grated chocolate, and chopped walnuts. Drop heaping teaspoonfuls of filling along length of rectangular dough (leaving 1-inch between spoonfuls) keeping to one side. There should be enough room for about 10 spoonfuls. With pastry brush use milk to moisten area around each filling spoonful. Fold dough lengthwise over filling and press down to remove any air and to seal edges. With a fluted pastry cutter or pizza cutter, cut into squares to form individual cookies. Repeat procedure with remaining filling and dough. Fry cookies in hot vegetable oil until golden brown. Remove and place on paper towels to drain excess oil. Dust with powdered sugar. Serve the same day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 17360,&quot;Pistachio, Cardamom and Saffron Cookies 1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 1 tablespoon for greasing the cookie tray 1 tablespoon milk, warm 2 pinches saffron threads 4 tablespoons fine granulated sugar 3 cardamom pods, husks removed, crushed 3 tablespoons finely chopped pistachios Pinch of grated nutmeg, optional 1 tablespoon pandanus (kewra) water (see Cook\u2019s Note) 1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, sifted 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cups melting white chocolate wafers, or enough to make 1/2 cup of melted white chocolate 2 pinches saffron threads 2 tablespoons finely crushed or slivered pistachios Edible gold dust/sprinkles, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a multi-cavity cookie tray (e.g. mini muffin tray, a muffin-top tray or a hemisphere pan) with the 1 tablespoon butter and set aside to chill. Combine the warm milk with the saffron threads, stir and set aside for 5 minutes until the saffron threads begin to bloom and the milk takes on a golden hue. Cream the remaining 1/2 cup butter with the granulated sugar in a large mixing bowl for 2 to 3 minutes until the butter is soft and the sugar has melted in. Add the crushed cardamom pods, finely chopped pistachios, the saffron milk with the saffron threads and a pinch of grated nutmeg if using and the pandanus water. Mix until well combined. Slowly add in the all-purpose flour and salt and mix well again. The mixture will be sandy in texture. Use a spatula to break up any lumps and stir it all until well combined and there are no dry spots. Portion the cookie mixture using an ice cream scoop and scoop it directly into the prepared chilled cookie tray. Lightly compress the mixture into the cavity using the back of a spoon. Fill each cavity to the top as these cookies will not rise. Chill any unused cookie mixture between bakes. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until the edges begin to lightly brown. The cookies do not change color or rise during baking. Carefully unmold from the cookie tray. Place them on a wire rack and allow them to cool completely before storing in an airtight container in a cool place until ready to decorate. To decorate: Arrange the cookies on a wire rack with a drip pan or cookie sheet underneath. Bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Place the melting white chocolate wafers in a heatproof bowl over the simmering water. The bottom of the bowl must not touch the water. Maintain a slow simmer and do not let the water boil. Using a silicone spatula, stir until the chocolate is melted. Quickly stir in one pinch of saffron threads while the chocolate is warm. Carefully pour the white chocolate over the cookies or dunk cookies into the chocolate. Alternatively, use a spoon to drizzle the melted chocolate over each cookie. Sprinkle the pistachio slivers, gold dust or sprinkles and more saffron threads before the chocolate hardens. Cool completely. Serve when the chocolate is firm. Store in a cool, airtight container for up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17361,&quot;Bourbon Brown Sugar-Stuffed Sweet Potato Skins 4 medium sweet potatoes 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 16.5-ounce can baked beans with bourbon and brown sugar, such as Bush&#39;s Best Bourbon and Brown Sugar Grillin&#39; Beans<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/2 teaspoon chili powder<br> 2 scallions (white and pale green parts), sliced, dark green tops sliced and reserved for garnish 1 jalapeno, seeds and ribs removed, diced<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> Juice of 2 limes<br> 1 avocado, diced<br> One 10-ounce tube Mexican chorizo Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

For the citrus: Slice the Meyer lemons into 1/4-inch-thick wheels, then trim the wheels into even squares (about 1 1/2 inches in size). Repeat with the navel oranges, tangerines, Cara Cara oranges, grapefruits and blood oranges. Line the cut citrus pieces on a baking sheet in a single layer. Set aside. For the glaze: Place the granulated sugar, brown sugar, butter and water into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat; simmer until the sugars dissolve. Pour the mixture into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and, using a pastry brush, brush over the entire surface.<br> Starting with blood oranges and beginning at the top right corner of the baking dish, tightly line the blood orange pieces side by side, with the corners at the top, bottom and sides so you have a row of diamonds, not squares. Repeat, fitting the second row tightly into the gaps from the first row. Repeat with remaining citrus, going from dark to light and creating 2 rows for each type, until the entire baking dish is filled. Cut the remaining citrus diamonds in half and place into the edges of the dish to fill in the remaining gaps around the border. Set aside. For the buttermilk cake: Place the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk together.

When the butter is foamy, add the cubed pumpkin and cook, stirring often to stop it from sticking and burning, until it softens and falls into a puree. Turn the pumpkin into a saucepan, add 1/2 of the cream and half the herbs and cook over a low heat for approximately 1 hour, or until the puree is thick and the liquid has evaporated. Stir occasionally to prevent scorching. Remove from the heat and beat in an additional 2 tablespoons of butter. Whisk in the beaten eggs, season, to taste, with salt and pepper and set a side to cool. On a floured surface, roll out the pasta as thin as possible. Cut into 2 sheets and brush 1 of them with egg wash. Using a teaspoon, place 24 equal mounds of the pumpkin puree on the egg-washed dough, about 2 inches apart. Cover the mounded dough with the second sheet of pasta and press around the mounds of pumpkin to seal the dough. Using a ravioli cutter or a sharp knife cut the ravioli. Dust a tray with semolina and place the ravioli on it. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, while you make the sauce. Prepare the sauce: In a saucepan, reduce the stock with the shallots to 1/2 cup. Add the remaining cream and reduce by half. Over a low heat, whisk in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, a little at a time, over low heat. Strain the sauce into a clean saucepan and add the remaining sage and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the ravioli to the rapidly boiling water and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain. Add the ravioli to the sauce and bring just to a boil. Correct the seasonings. Divide the ravioli among preheated soup dishes and spoon the sauce over them. Garnish each serving with a fresh sage leaf. Serve immediately. A simple but delicious alternative sauce can be made from fresh unsalted butter, minced fresh sage, and a little freshly grated Parmesan. Spinach Pasta Dough: Wash the spinach carefully in 2 or 3 changes of water. Cut off 1 inch of the stems. Chop the leaves and puree them in a towel or napkin and squeeze the juice into a measuring cup. (Use a towel or napkin that you dont mind using only for this purpose, because spinach juice stains.) There should be about 1/4 cup of juice. Stir 2 tablespoons of the spinach puree into the spinach juice and reserve. Discard the remaining puree. Combine the flours in the food processor with salt. With the motor running, add the eggs, olive oil, and enough of the spinach mixture through the feed tube so that the dough forms a ball pressed together. Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest at room temperature, for at least 2 hours. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll and cut 1 at a time as desired. Keep. The unrolled dough covered to prevent it from drying. Place any cut pasta on baking sheets that have been liberally dusted with semolina. Place the flours in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the salt, eggs, and olive oil. Process until the dough begins to mass on the blade (about 1-2 minutes). Remove the dough from the processor and press it into a ball. Wrap in plastic and let rest at least 2 hours in the refrigerator before rolling and cutting. (Rolling the dough by hand is extremely tedious; with a small pasta machine and cutting attachment, you will save time and produce a much more uniform product.) Notes: The pasta can be made by hand or in an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. For each of these methods, mix the dry ingredients together first, make a well in the center, add the wet ingredients and mix them together slowly until everything is combined well. Wrap in a plastic. In a stockpot, place the chicken bones, then add all the remaining ingredients except the water. Add water to cover by 2 inches, bring it to a boil and reduce the heat. Simmer the mixture for 2 or 3 hours, skimming the surface scum form the stock as it collects. Strain the stock into a clean pot, and grease it thoroughly. Bring the stock to a boil, and reduce it over moderate heat to 2 quarters. Use the stuck immediately or let it cool to room temperature and refrigerate or freeze until needed. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 17371,&quot;Tilapia With Hash Browns 1 20-ounce bag frozen shredded hash browns, thawed 4 cloves garlic, smashed and thinly sliced Kosher salt 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, us more for drizzling 1/2 cup pitted Spanish green olives, roughly chopped 3/4 pound tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces 1/4 cup diced roasted red peppers 3 scallions, white and light green parts only, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 1/2 pounds skinless tilapia fillets 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence or dried rosemary Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Transfer to a counter dusted lightly with flour and knead gently until the dough comes together and is smooth, about 1 minute. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. With your hands, flatten and shape one piece of dough into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Dust it lightly with flour and pass it through the widest setting on a pasta machine. (If the dough comes out oddly shaped, re-form into a rectangle.) Fold it into thirds, like a letter, and if necessary, flatten it to a 1/2-inch thickness. Pass it through the widest setting again with the seam of the letter perpendicular to the rollers. Repeat this folding and rolling step 10 to 12 times, dusting the dough with flour if it becomes sticky. Without folding the dough, pass it through the next setting on the pasta machine. Continue to pass the dough through the machine, reducing the space between the rollers after each pass and lightly dusting the pasta with flour on both sides each time, until the pasta is about 1/16-inch thick and 3 inches wide. Lay the rolled-out dough on a floured counter. Roll out the remaining dough in the same manner. Cut each piece of dough into 11-inch lengths. Cut the dough into fettuccine by hand, or by passing through the pasta machine on the fettucine setting. For the black truffle sauce: Boil a large pot of salted water. Add the pasta and boil until al dente, about 3 minutes. Strain, reserving 2 cups of pasta water. Add the butter to a large pan over medium heat and let melt. Add half the Parmesan and 1/2 cup pasta water and stir to combine. Add the pasta and toss to coat. Add the remaining Parmesan and stir to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add more pasta water.

I like it mild, so you may want more) (recommended: Sriracha) 2 teaspoons light brown sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 4 teaspoons vegetable or canola oil 8 (1 1/4-inch thick) lamb loin chops Instructions: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Toast the coriander and fennel seeds in small pan over a medium flame, shaking every 30 seconds so they don&#39;t burn. Once they&#39;ve given off a lovely aroma and have turned a darker tone, remove from the hot pan and cool completely on a plate. Then throw them into your spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. Mix the spices with the yogurt, tomato paste, ginger, garlic, hot sauce, brown sugar, salt, a healthy few grinds of freshly ground black pepper, apple cider vinegar, and oil. Taste and season according to your palate. Cover each chop with the marinade, rubbing it into the meat and fat. You can marinate overnight, a few hours, or just 30 minutes. I&#39;ve done all three and it tastes great every way. Bake the chops in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish until the lamb is cooked to medium-rare, or to your liking, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest, tented with foil, for about 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 17425,&quot;Striped Bass Puttanesca with Seared Fingerling Potatoes 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 4 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3 anchovies, roughly chopped or mashed with a fork 1/4 cup capers 3/4 cup pitted Moroccan oil cured black olives, roughly chopped<br> 1/2 cup white wine 6 cups Basic Tomato Sauce, recipe follows 4 (6-ounce) striped bass fillets, skinned Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 small bunch basil, stemmed, for garnish 1 pound fingerling potatoes, parboiled for about 12 to 15 minutes, drained and cooled 2 tablespoons olive oil 5 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for garnish 12 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 6 (28-ounce) cans chopped tomatoes 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar Kosher salt Instructions: In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until just fragrant, 1 minute. Add the anchovies, capers and olives and cook until the anchovies have begun to dissolve in the oil, about 5 minutes. Pour in the wine and the Basic Tomato Sauce and bring to a simmer. Add the fish fillets, making sure they are submerged in the sauce, and gently simmer until the fish is cooked through and the flesh is milky white and slightly flaky, about 10 minutes.

Rub the couscous between your fingers to fully incorporate these ingredients. In a enamel casserole or couscousiere heat 2 tablespoons of oil over low heat. Add the onions and begin to cook them to a translucent stage. Without browning the onion, add the saffron, tomato paste, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Stir these ingredients quickly and combine well, but take care to avoid burning the tomato paste by working quickly at this stage. Pour in the hot enriched stock and bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Place the couscous in its steamer over the simmering broth and allow to simmer gently for 50 minutes, until the couscous has cooked. At the end of the required cooking time for the couscous, season the shrimp with salt and pepper, place the peeled shrimp into the simmering broth under the couscous and cook for 3 to 4 additional minutes. The shrimp will gently poach. Two minutes before serving add the calamari. Serve the seafood on a bed of couscous, ladle on some broth, and sprinkle the crushed almonds over the whole dish. Enriched fish stock: After peeling the shrimp, reserve the shells but discard the vein. Put the fish stock (broth or clam juice may be substituted) into a pot and bring to a gentle boil, lower to a simmer and then add the reserved shrimp shells. Cook together for 20 minutes before straining out the shells and any other solids. Set the enriched stock aside and discard the shells. Keep warm to finish the couscous or cool and refrigerate promptly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 17427,&quot;Salt and Pepper Squid with Caramelized Onions and Bell Peppers 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon Szechwan peppercorns 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon ground white pepper 1 pound cleaned squid, tentacles separated, tubes cut lengthwise in half 1 cup self-rising flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 tablespoon peanut oil plus peanut oil, for frying 1 large onion, sliced 1 red bell pepper, de-seeded and julienned 1 yellow bell pepper, de-seeded and julienned 2 Thai bird chiles or 1 jalepeno, de-stemmed and sliced Instructions: Heat a saute pan very hot and add the salt.

Line the bottom and sides of the pan with waxed paper, allowing the paper to overhang by 2-inches on each side. Lightly spray the waxed paper inside the pan. In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the sugar, water, and honey over low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a simmer, and cook until the syrup turns amber and registers 315 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 15 to 20 minutes. While the syrup is cooking, in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour the syrup into the egg whites. Increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is very thick, about 7 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Fold in 1/2 of the apricots. Using a spatula sprayed with cooking spray, scrape the mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the remaining apricots on top. Fold the overhanging pieces of waxed paper onto the surface of the mixture. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Remove the waxed paper from the nougat and discard. Using a knife sprayed with cooking spray, cut the nougat in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 8 pieces. Dip 1 end of the nougat into the melted chocolate and place on the prepared baking sheet.

Add whipped topping and stir again, until evenly combined. Cover and refrigerate the icing until you&#39;re ready to ice the Danish.<br> To make the Danish: In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, oats, granulated sugar, soymilk, and almond extract, and stir until thoroughly mixed. Fold in cherries and set aside. This is your filling.<br> Spray a large baking sheet with nonstick spray. Roll out the dough on the sheet into a large rectangle of even thickness. If using crescent roll dough, pinch together perforated seams to seal. Arrange baking sheet in front of you so that the short sides are on the left and right and the long sides are on the top and bottom. Spoon the cherry filling lengthwise across the middle third of the dough, leaving 1/2-inch borders on the left and right of the filling.<br> Starting from the top, make 12 vertical cuts-about 1 inch apart-along the top section of the dough, stopping about 1/2 inch from the filling. Repeat with the bottom section of the dough. This will create 1-inch-wide strips of dough on both the top and bottom of the filling.<br> Alternate folding the 1-inch strips from the top and the bottom over the filling, covering the filling completely and creating a crisscrossed, \braided\ appearance. When you reach the last few strips, cross them toward the middle of the Danish. After all the strips have been folded, fold the left and right sides of the dough in toward the filling, so the filling cannot escape, and pat firmly to seal.<br> Bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until pastry is crispy and golden brown.

Add the milk, vanilla extract, almond extract and eggs and whisk to combine. Place the bowl onto the stand mixer, fitted with a dough hook attachment, and mix on medium speed to combine. Use a rubber spatula as needed to scrape the bottom and sides. With the mixer running, add butter 1 tablespoon at a time until it is incorporated into the dough. When all the butter is incorporated, mix on medium for another 10 to 15 minutes, until smooth and slightly sticky. Stretch the dough into a ball. Lightly oil a clean bowl, place the dough in top down, flip over to coat in oil fully and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until it\u2019s doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Grease a 9-by-5-inch metal loaf pan and line with enough parchment paper to come all the way up on the two long sides and allow 1-inch wings. On a clean work surface, roll the dough out into a 22-by-10-inch rectangle. The dough should be slightly sticky but if it\u2019s too sticky to work with you can dust with a little flour. Using all but about 2 tablespoons of the Filling (recipe follows), spread it onto the dough, leaving a ?-inch border at the top edge. Roll the dough the long way into a tight log and pinch the edges to seal. Cut it in half so you have two shorter logs. Spread the top of one of the logs with the reserved filling and then twist the logs together. Transfer to the loaf pan, cover with plastic, and let rise until puffy and risen by about half, 30 to 40 minutes. Arrange an oven rack in the lower third and preheat to 350 degrees F. Gently brush the top of the babka with the egg wash and cover with the Crumble (recipe follows). Bake until the top is deep golden brown and the internal temperature is 190 to 195oF, begin checking at 45 minutes. While babka is baking, prepare the Glaze (recipe follows). Cool for 15 minutes in the pan and then transfer to a rack. Drizzle over the glaze and then cool completely before cutting open. To store wrap tightly in plastic wrap and keep at room temperature. This is best within a day or two. In a medium bowl with a stiff rubber spatula, mix together the sesame paste, sugar, coconut oil, salt and orange zest until combined and spreadable.

Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish (sold already toasted in large shaker jars on Asian foods aisle) . &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 17439,&quot;Roasted Garlic-Asiago Dip with Homemade Crackers 2 bulbs elephant garlic 1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese Kosher salt 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 batch Calzone Dough, recipe follows All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash 2 tablespoons dry yeast 1 teaspoon sugar 1 cup warm water 2 cups high-gluten flour 1 cup semolina flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for bowl Instructions: For the dip: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the garlic bulbs in the oven and roast until soft when squeezed, about 30 minutes; let cool for 10 minutes. Cut the tops off the garlic and squeeze the roasted cloves out of the skin. Place the roasted garlic in a food processor with the cheese and season with salt. With the machine running drizzle in the olive oil. Taste and make sure it is delicious; re-season if needed. For the crackers: In a small bowl combine the Asiago and cayenne. Run the Calzone Dough through a pasta roller, adjusting the setting thinner until the dough gets very thin, about 1/8-inch thick. Dust the dough lightly with flour during the process if the dough is sticky. Brush the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle liberally with the Asiago-cayenne mix. Using a pizza wheel, cut the dough crosswise into triangles. Place the dough triangles onto a sheet tray and bake until light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 3 to 4 minutes on the tray before removing. Eat right away or store in an airtight container. In a small bowl, combine the yeast and sugar and whisk together with the warm water. Let sit for 15 minutes; when the water looks frothy and smells very yeasty, it&#39;s ready. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the flours and salt. Pour in the yeast-water mixture and the olive oil. Mix to combine on medium speed. When a dough ball has formed, continue to knead until the dough is tight and not at all sticky, 5 to 6 minutes. Lightly oil a mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm place to let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down and let it rise a final time for 30 to 40 minutes before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 17440,&quot;Sassy Sangria 3 cups chianti or other fruity red wine 1 cup brandy 1/4 cup orange flavored liqueur (recommended: triple sec) 1 orange, sliced 1 lime, sliced, optional 1 lemon, sliced, optional 1 apple, cored and diced 8 fresh raspberries 2 cups club soda, chilled Instructions: In a large pitcher, combine all ingredients except club soda. Cover tightly and refrigerate 3 hours to let flavors meld. Pour 3/4 cup sangria mixture into each of 8 wine glasses, dividing fruit equally. Top each glass with 1/4 cup club soda. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 17441,&quot;Crema de Pinon 1 1/2 cups milk 1 1/4 cups pine nuts, toasted (see Note) and coarsely chopped Zest of 1 large orange 1/2 vanilla bean 5 tablespoons granulated sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch, thoroughly mixed with 1 tablespoon sugar 3 egg yolks, lightly beaten 6 tablespoons Grand Mariner or other orange liqueur 2/3 cup orange juice 22 (4 inch) ladyfinger cookies 2 tablespoons whole pine nuts, for garnish Instructions: Butter a 10 x 6 inch or similar size rectangular baking dish with 2 1/2 inch sides and set aside. In a medium heavy saucepan, bring the milk to a boil, being careful not to let it boil over. Remove from the heat and immediately add 1/2 cup of the pine nuts, the orange zest, and the vanilla bean. Cover and let steep for 30 minutes, then strain out and discard the nuts and orange zest and return the mixture to a clean pan (wash and dry the vanilla bean and reserve to use again). Bring up almost to a boil over medium high heat and add the sugar. Reduce the heat to low and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Place the cornstarch-sugar mixture in a small bowl and stir 1/4 cup of the hot milk into it, stirring until it is a paste. Add the cornstarch mixture back into the hot milk and stir it in well. Continue cooking for about 5 minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly. In a small bowl, add about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture to the egg yolks and whisk together well. Return this mixture to the pan and continue to cook, stirring and scraping the bottom and sides of the pan to be sure none of the mixture scorches. Cook until the mixture is a thick coating consistency and you can see the bottom of the pan as you stir. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 3/4 cup pine nuts. In a shallow bowl, combine the Grand Mariner and the orange juice. Dip whole ladyfingers into the mixture, soaking for about 2 seconds, then lay an even layer of them in the base of the pan. For the sides of the pan, break the ladyfingers in half, soak them in the juice mixture, and prop them all around the sides of the dish, cut side down, like a picket fence. Scoop the cream mixture into the prepared dish and spread it evenly. Garnish with pine nuts. Cool to room temperature and serve within 4 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 17442,&quot;Spicy Chicken Tacos 1 pound ground chicken 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br> 1 tablespoon Spicy Red Rub, recipe follows 1/4 cup sliced pepperoncini 2 cups Sweet and Sour Peppers and Onions, recipe follows 2 tablespoons white vinegar<br> Kosher salt<br> Fresh ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon Garlic Confit Puree, recipe follows 8 (6-inch) corn or seven-grain tortillas, warmed<br> 1/4 cup Chipotle Yogurt Sauce, recipe follows 3 tablespoons smoked paprika 3 tablespoons cumin seeds, toasted and ground<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons whole cloves, toasted and ground<br> 1 tablespoon cayenne<br> 1 tablespoon mustard seeds, toasted and ground<br> 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/teaspoon cayenne pepper.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/teaspoon%20baking%20powder.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>teaspoon baking powder</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/teaspoon%20chopped%20fresh%20thyme.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
