If using chunks (as opposed to a large block of ice), fill the bowl just under half way. Add Cointreau and brandy. Using a ladle or long spoon, stir briefly. Add orange slices and cranberries (if using) and then pour in the champagne. Stir 12 times and let sit for a minute, so the ingredients can get acquainted. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Prosecco, Sparkling Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46237,&quot;Hot Chocolate with Peppermint Schnapps 1 quart milk (skim, 2 percent or whole) or half-and-half 6 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped (recommended: Scharffenberger) 9 ounces peppermint schnapps Whipped cream, for serving 6 peppermint sticks, for serving Instructions: Heat 1 cup of the milk in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add chocolate, stirring constantly, until melted. When the chocolate has melted, increase heat to medium and add the remainder of the milk while whisking rapidly. Do not allow to boil. Serve in small cups fortified with a jigger (1 1/2 ounces) of peppermint schnapps and a dollop of whipped cream. Add a peppermint stick to stir. If transporting in a thermos, heat thermos up with hot water to get it warm for 1 minute. Pour water out and fill with hot chocolate. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 46238,&quot;Grilled Tofu and Chicken Pad Thai 8 ounces extra-firm tofu 2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless, chicken breasts 2 tablespoons peanut oil, plus more for brushing Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 shallots, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon ancho chili powder 1/4 cup tamarind paste, reconstituted in 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup rice vinegar 2 tablespoons fish sauce 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter 1 pound Thai rice noodles, soaked in hot water for 15 minutes and drained 1/4 cup thinly sliced green onion 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves 4 ounces bean sprouts 1/4 cup cashews, toasted and coarsely chopped 2 limes, halved and grilled Instructions: Heat grill to high. Brush both sides of tofu and chicken with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the tofu on each side for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly charred, remove, and cut into thin slices. Grill the chicken for 4 minutes per side or until slightly charred and just cooked through, remove, and cut into thin slices. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan on the grates of the grill or side burner on the grill. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft. Add the ancho powder and cook for 10 seconds. Add the tamarind mixture, vinegar, fish sauce, brown sugar, and peanut butter and bring to a boil. Place the cooked noodles, tofu, and chicken in a large bowl. Pour the boiling sauce over the noodles and toss gently until until combined. Fold in the green onion, cilantro, and bean sprouts and top with the chopped nuts. Serve with grilled limes on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 46239,&quot;Badal Jaam 2 cups plain yogurt 2 tablespoons lemon juice 10 medium cloves garlic, peeled and finely minced 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves, divided 2 large globe eggplants, cut into 3/4-inch-thick slices 1 1/2 teaspoons salt Oil for pan frying 1 tablespoon oil 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and chopped 6 to 8 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped 1/2 medium onion, peeled and chopped 2 teaspoons paprika 1 teaspoon salt 4 medium tomatoes, coarsely chopped and pureed in a food processor 1 1/2 teaspoons toasted powdered cumin seeds 1 1/2 teaspoons black salt powder 1 1/2 teaspoons mango powder 1 1/2 teaspoons cl flakes Instructions: Hang yogurt in a muslin cloth over the sink and let the whey (water) drip out for about 2 hours. Transfer the thickened yogurt to a bowl and add lemon juice, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and half of the cilantro. Mix thoroughly and set aside. Salt eggplant slices with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and let drain for about 30 to 45 minutes. Pat dry. Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet (about 1/4 inch deep) and fry eggplant over medium to high heat until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove and let drain on paper towels. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 4-quart saucepan. When hot, add ginger and garlic and saute for 20 seconds. Add chopped onion and saute over medium heat until soft, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and tomatoes; simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the sauce becomes thick and is the consistency of ketchup. Place eggplant slices in a deep baking tray in a single layer. Generously brush the top of each eggplant slice with the tomato sauce. Mix together cumin, black salt, mango powder and cl flakes, and sprinkle on top of the eggplant slices. Seal the tray tight with aluminum foil. Bake in a preheated oven for 20 minutes at 275 degrees F. Serve with a dollop of thickened yogurt sauce and a sprinkle of the remaining chopped cilantro on each slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 46240,&quot;Roasted Turkey with Turkey Meatballs 2 cups/500 ml hot water 2 cups/500 ml molasses 2 cups/500 ml salt 2 cups/500 ml brown sugar 1 tablespoon/15 ml black peppercorns 2 lemons, sliced 2 onions, quartered 1 head garlic, smashed 1 large bunch fresh rosemary 32 cups/8 l cold water One 16-pound/ 8 kg turkey 1 pound/454 g bacon, diced 2 celery stalks, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 leeks, chopped 1 large onion, chopped 4 pounds/2 kg ground turkey 1 teaspoon/5 ml smoked paprika Pinch cayenne Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup/250 ml cubed day-old bread (about 2 slices) 1/2 cup/125 ml milk 1 cup/250 ml grated Parmigianino-Reggiano or pecorino 1/2 cup/125 ml chopped fresh chives 1/2 cup/125 ml chopped fresh dill 1/2 cup/125 ml chopped fresh parsley 2 green onions, chopped 1/2 cup/125 ml butter, room temperature 2 cloves garlic, minced Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 leeks, halved lengthwise 4 cups/1 l chicken or turkey broth Instructions: For the brine and turkey: Pour the hot water in a large and deep non-reactive pan, bucket or large cooler with ice. Stir in the molasses, salt and brown sugar until fully dissolved. Then add the peppercorns, lemons, onions, garlic and rosemary. Add the cold water and let cool to room temperature (or put in the refrigerator). Place the turkey in the brine. Using a syringe, inject the turkey with some of the brine. Cover and leave in the brine for 48 hours in the refrigerator. For the stuffing: In a skillet over high heat, cook the bacon until almost crispy, about 5 minutes. Add the celery, garlic, leeks and onions. Continue cooking until translucent. Add the ground turkey and cook until browned. Add the paprika and cayenne. Season with salt and pepper and let cool. Meanwhile, soak the bread in the milk in a small bowl. In a large bowl, combine the soaked breadcrumbs, the bacon mixture, cheese, chives, dill, parsley and green onions. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside part of the stuffing to stuff the turkey. Form the remaining stuffing into meatballs using a 1 tablespoon measurement. Reserve on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator until ready to cook. With the rack in the lowest position, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C). Remove the turkey from the brine and dry thoroughly. To roast the turkey: In a bowl, mix together the butter and garlic. Set aside. Fill the turkey cavity with the reserved stuffing. Tie the drumsticks together with kitchen string to help the turkey keep its shape. Rub the turkey in between the skin and the flesh with the garlic butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Scatter the leeks on the bottom of a large roasting pan and pour in the chicken broth. Place the turkey on the leeks. Add the meatballs to the pan. Roast for about 5 1/2 hours, basting the turkey with the broth every 20 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh without touching the bone reads 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). If necessary, add more broth so there is always about 4 cups/1 l liquid in the bottom of the roasting pan. If any parts of the turkey begin to scorch during cooking, cover them with aluminum foil. Place the turkey and meatballs on a serving platter. Cover and let rest 20 minutes. Strain the liquid from the roasting pan into a saucepan and skim the fat at the surface. Adjust the seasoning. Reduce the sauce to the desired consistency. Keep warm. Serve the turkey with the roasting sauce and the turkey meatballs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46241,&quot;Lemon Meringue Tart 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar Kosher salt 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) cold unsalted butter, diced 2 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening (recommended: Crisco) 1/4 cup ice water 4 extra-large egg whites, at room temperature 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Lemon Filling, recipe follows 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar 4 extra-large eggs 3 extra-large egg yolks (save the whites for the meringue) 1/4 cup finely grated lemon zest (6 to 8 lemons)<br> 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Combine the flour, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Put the flour mixture in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and shortening and pulse about 10 times until the butter is in small bits. Add the ice water and process until the dough comes together. Dump on a well-floured board and form into a disk. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Roll out the dough and fit into a 9-inch tart pan with removable sides. Don&#39;t stretch the dough when placing it in the pan or it will shrink during baking. Cut off the excess by rolling the pin across the top of the pan. Line the tart shell with a piece of buttered aluminum foil, butter side down, and fill it with dried beans or rice. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the beans and foil and prick the bottom of the shell all over with a fork to allow the steam to escape. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to cool.<br> Raise the oven temperature to 425 degrees F.<br> For the meringue, whip the egg whites, cream of tartar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed until frothy. With the mixer still running, slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and beat until the meringue is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes.<br> Immediately spread the lemon filling in the cooled tart shell and pipe the meringue over it with a large star tip. Be sure the meringue covers the entire top and touches the edges of the shell, to prevent it from shrinking. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes, until the meringue is lightly browned. Cool to room temperature. Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for 1 minute. On low speed, add the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, and then add the lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt. Don&#39;t worry; it will look curdled.<br> Pour the mixture into a small saucepan and cook over medium-low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until thick, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Whisk briskly when it starts to thicken and cook over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes, whisking constantly. Don&#39;t allow it to boil! It will be 175 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.

Season with some salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes before serving to let the flavors meld and intensify. For the broccoli rabe schmear: In a large saute pan over medium heat, add the olive oil. Let the olive oil heat up and then add in the garlic, shallot and broccoli rabe. Let cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add in the butter, red pepper flakes, and some salt and pepper. For the sausage patties: Get two baking sheets, line one with wax or parchment paper. Remove the sausages from the casing, roll them into 4 balls and place them evenly apart on the tray with the wax paper. Place another piece of wax paper on top of the sausages, and then press the other baking sheet down to sandwich the sausages and flatten them out; you are trying to press them so that they are roughly 1/4-inch thick. Heat a griddle pan over medium heat. Add the oil to the griddle. Cook the sausages until nicely browned, 5 to 7 minutes flipping halfway through the cooking time. When you flip the sausages, add 2 slices of mozzarella to the top of each sausage patty. Let soften slightly, and then remove from the griddle. For the sandwich build: On the bottom of each ciabatta bun, schmear a generous dollop of the broccoli rabe schmear. Place the sausage patties with the softened mozzarella on top. Top each with the Italian pico de guyzerelli and another slice of bread to close the sandwiches. Slice the sandwiches and eat with a carafe of mediocre Chianti. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 46243,&quot;Veggie Fritters with Southern Chive Dip Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> One 8.5-ounce box cornmeal muffin mix<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br> Kosher salt<br> One 12-ounce can seltzer water<br> 1 bunch baby broccoli<br> 8 ounces green beans, trimmed<br> 8 ounces whole okra<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon sriracha<br> 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger<br> Instructions: Fill a Dutch oven a little less than halfway with the oil.

Butter and flour 1(6-inch) diameter and 1 (8-inch) diameter metal bowls. Combine the cake mix, coconut water, oil, and eggs in another large clean bowl. Beat for 2 minutes, or until well blended. Pour 2 cups of batter into the smaller buttered and floured bowl; pour remaining batter into the larger prepared bowl. Bake the smaller cake for 40 minutes and the larger cake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Cool the cakes in the bowls on a cooling rack for 30 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the cooling rack and cool completely. To decorate: Cut the larger cake in half, forming 2 half-moon pieces. Spread 1/4 cup of frosting over the flat top of each piece. Place the pieces cut side down on a work surface, adhering the frosted sides together. Trim 1-inch from 1 end of the cake; discard the trimmings. Repeat with the smaller cake. Place the larger cake on a serving platter. Spread 2 tablespoons of frosting over the trimmed end of the smaller cake. Place the trimmed end of the smaller cake against the trimmed end of the larger cake. Spread the remaining frosting over the cakes to cover completely. Sprinkle with all but 1/2 cup of the coconut, pressing to adhere.

Heat the milk with 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan over low heat to between 110 and 115 degrees F. Transfer it to a small bowl and stir in the sugar, then sprinkle over the yeast and let stand until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. (Cover the bowl if the room or the yeast is cold.) Put a pizza stone on the lowest rack in your oven, removing the second rack if there is one. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Cut two 10-by-7-inch pieces of parchment paper.<br> Put the flour in a medium bowl and whisk in the salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeasty mixture and the oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until the flour is incorporated and the mixture forms a shaggy ball -- it will be soft and sticky. Flour your work surface, scrape the dough onto it and knead until smooth, elastic and still slightly sticky, about 5 minutes. Put the dough in the oiled bowl, turn it to coat with oil and cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap. Set the bowl in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.<br> For the filling and topping: Work the mozzarella and feta together with a fork in a medium bowl. Make a little well in the center and add 1 egg. Beat the egg a bit with a fork, and mix and mash well to combine with the cheeses.<br> Lightly flour your work surface. Turn the dough onto the floured surface and cut it in half. Round the halves gently back into rough rounds. Put 1 piece of parchment paper on your work surface and flour it lightly. Press and use a rolling pin to roll 1 piece of dough into a round 1/8-inch thick and 10-inches across. Slide it onto the paper -- it will hang over the long edges -- and then slide it, paper and all, onto the back of a baking sheet. (Alternatively, use a pizza peel.) Repeat with the other piece of dough, transferring it to the back of a second baking sheet.<br> Spoon half of the cheese mixture on the first round, spreading some 1/2-inch from the edge and mounding the rest in the middle (there will be a big mound). Roll the sides up tightly to make a shape like a cheese-filled canoe -- it should be about 10 inches long and 4 inches wide. Pinch the ends together and twist to seal tightly. Repeat with the other piece of dough and remaining cheese. Let rest 10 minutes. Slide the khachapuris on their papers onto the pizza stone, leaving a few inches of space between them. Bake, turning them 180 degrees after about 8 minutes, until golden and crisp, about 12 minutes total. Crack 1 egg in each khachapuri and continue to bake until the white is just set around the edges, but some of the white and the yolk are still a bit raw, about 3 minutes. Remove to a serving platter, dot each khachapuri with 1 tablespoon butter and stir the eggs into the hot cheese?they will continue to cook. Serve immediately, tearing off pieces of bread to scoop up the hot, buttery, eggy, gooey cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 46256,&quot;Frozen Mochas 1 1/2 cups chilled very strong brewed coffee or espresso, or coffee concentrate, recipe follows 1 cup whole milk, or more to taste<br> 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips, plus more for topping if desired! 1/4 cup sweetened condensed milk<br> 1/4 cup chocolate syrup, plus more for drizzling 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/4 cup half-and-half, optional Whipped cream, for serving 1 pound ground coffee (a good, rich roast) Instructions: Add the coffee, milk, chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, chocolate syrup and vanilla to a blender. Top off the blender with ice and blend until smooth and icy, with tiny chocolate bits throughout. (Add some half-and-half if you&#39;d like it to be a little richer and creamier.) Serve in glasses with whipped cream on top, and drizzle the whipped cream with chocolate syrup or dot with more chocolate chips. In a large container, mix the ground coffee with 32 cups (8 quarts) cold water. Cover and allow to sit at room temperature 8 hours or overnight. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth and set over a pitcher or other container. Pour the coffee/water mixture through the strainer, allowing all the liquid to run through. Discard the grounds.

Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. Combine the bourbon, milk and vanilla in a separate bowl (it may get clumpy looking--that&#39;s ok) and set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and coconut oil until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add 1 3/4 cups of the granulated sugar and beat until fluffy, about 1 more minute. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well between additions. Add the dry ingredients in four batches, alternating with the wet mixture, starting and ending with the dry. Stir in the pecans. In a stand mixer with a whisk attachment and a clean bowl, whip the egg whites with the cream of tartar on medium until soft peaks form. Sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and whip to stiff peaks, about 5 minutes total. Fold the egg whites into the batter in thirds. Pour into a bundt pan and bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Let cool before turning the cake out of the pan. For the glaze: In a medium bowl, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, bourbon and 2 tablespoons water.

Wrap in a towel to keep warm while you dip and heat the remaining tortillas. Make 12 stacks of 2 tortillas each on a baking sheet. Divide the lamb evenly among the tortillas. Top with poblano strips, sprinkle evenly with the cheeses and bake 3 to 4 minutes, to melt the cheese and heat through. Serve immediately. Note: Fresh chiles and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. (If you are rushed, you can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits. Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away flavorful juices. Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 46263,&quot;Buttermilk Fried Chicken 2 cups buttermilk, shaken 1 shallot, peeled, halved lengthwise, and thinly sliced crosswise 2 garlic cloves, smashed 1 jalape?o pepper (with seeds), halved lengthwise Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 boneless chicken breasts 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 2 1/2 teaspoons smoked Spanish paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon celery salt 2 (48-ounce) bottles canola oil Bunch of parsley, for garnish Instructions: For the marinade, in a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, shallot, garlic, jalape?o, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper. With a rolling pin or a meat mallet, pound the chicken breasts between 2 sheets of parchment paper until they are evenly 1/2 inch thick. Slice each chicken breast in half crosswise so you have 2 pieces approximately the same size. Add the chicken to the marinade, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours but not more than 24 hours. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, celery salt, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper and set aside. When ready to cook the chicken, preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Place a sheet pan with a baking rack on it in the oven. Pour the oil into a medium (9-inch round x 4 1/2-inch high) Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset, fitted with a candy thermometer, until the oil is 2 inches deep. Heat the oil over high heat until the temperature reaches 350 degrees. Meanwhile, lift the chicken from the marinade, dredge it well in the flour mixture, submerge it again in the marinade, then dredge again in the flour mixture, dusting off the excess. Transfer the chicken to a plate or sheet pan until ready to fry. When the oil is 350 degrees, lower three pieces only(!) carefully into the oil with a slotted spoon and adjust the heat to keep the oil at 350 degrees. Don&#39;t crowd the chicken! Cook for 5 minutes exactly, turning once to brown evenly. With the slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the sheet pan in the oven to keep warm. Fry the remaining three pieces, sprinkle all the chicken with salt, and serve hot.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 46264,&quot;Four-Flavor Diner Sandwich-Dilla 4 teaspoons canola oil 1/2 yellow onion, diced<br> 8 ounces ground beef Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ketchup 1 teaspoon mayonnaise 1 teaspoon yellow mustard, plus more for drizzling<br> One 1/2-inch-thick boneless center-cut pork chop (about 4 ounces) 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 9 large flour tortillas 8 slices American cheese<br> One 8-ounce package shredded sharp Cheddar<br> 5 strips cooked bacon 1/2 medium tomato, sliced Two 8-ounce packages shredded Swiss cheese<br> 4 slices deli ham<br> 5 dill pickle sandwich slices 4 ounces sliced corned beef 1/2 cup sauerkraut, patted dry Russian dressing, for drizzling 1 teaspoon sesame seeds 1 teaspoon caraway seeds Instructions: Position an oven rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 475 degrees F. Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of black pepper and cook, breaking up the meat, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off the fat and transfer the meat mixture to a medium bowl. Stir in the ketchup, mayonnaise and mustard. Wipe the skillet clean, add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the pork chop liberally with salt and pepper. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the pork and cook until browned on both sides and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Rest for 5 minutes, then slice very thinly against the grain.<br> Line a sheet pan with parchment and rub with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Arrange 8 of the tortillas on top of the parchment, overlapping as needed. There should be a 3- to 4-inch overhang of tortillas on all sides. Position the sheet pan so one of the long edges is facing you. To make the patty melt: In the top left quadrant of the tortillas, arrange half the American cheese, then top with the meat mixture and remaining American cheese.<br> To make the happy waitress (bacon tomato grilled cheese): Reserve 1/2 cup of the Cheddar and 1 strip of bacon for topping. In the top right quadrant, sprinkle half of the remaining Cheddar on the tortilla base, then top with the remaining 4 strips of bacon, the sliced tomato and remaining Cheddar.<br> To make the Cuban: Reserve 1/2 cup of the Swiss cheese from one of the packages for topping.

Prepare a grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grill grates.<br> Remove the chicken from the marinade; reserve 2 cups of marinade and discard the rest. Place the chicken on a paper towel-lined baking sheet and pat dry. Sprinkle the chicken on both sides liberally with salt and pepper and arrange the pieces skin-side down on the grill, leaving some space between each. Cook until the skin is lightly charred and releases easily from the grill, about 2 minutes. Rotate the chicken pieces about 90 degrees so the skin won&#39;t burn and cook another 2 minutes. Flip the chicken skin-side up. Cover the grill and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each thigh reads 165 degrees F, 20 to 25 minutes more. If the chicken pieces are getting too dark in spots, move them around the grill to cook evenly. Transfer to a platter and let rest for about 5 minutes before serving.<br> Meanwhile, transfer the reserved marinade to a small saucepan and place on the still-hot grill. Bring to a boil, then continue to cook until it has thickened slightly and reduced by half, about 20 minutes.<br> Finely grate the zest from 1 of the lemons, then sprinkle over the chicken.

In a mixing bowl add sugar, 2 tablespoons orange juice, and 1/2 the orange zest. Spread the softened unsalted butter over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle orange sugar evenly over the dough. Starting with the long side, roll up dough tightly ending with the seam side down. Cut 18 slices each about 1/2-inch thick. Place in 2 (9 by 13-inch) greased baking dishes and cover with a kitchen towel. Allow the rolls to rise in a warm environment for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until doubled in size. Bake at 375 degrees F until the tops are golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and brush tops with melted butter and cool on a cooling rack. For the glaze: In a mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons orange juice, remaining zest, and softened butter. Spread the glaze over the warm rolls. Rapid Rolls: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the instant yeast, and warm water. Let it activate for 5 minutes until bubbly. Stir in the honey. On low speed, add 1/2 cup melted butter, 2 teaspoons salt, and eggs. Slowly add the flour cup-by-cup until fully incorporated and the dough pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl. Add more flour if it is too sticky. Portion the dough into 24 even servings.

Remove the top quarter of the bread round, then cut it into cubes and set aside. Using a knife, cut out the interior of the bread round, leaving it hollow. Cube the removed bread and set aside. Mix together the olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Brush the outside and inside of the bread bowl with the oil mix. Place the bread bowl on a sheet pan and sprinkle the inside with the Parmesan. Toss the cubed bread in the remaining oil and place on the sheet pan next to the bread bowl. Bake until crisp, 15 to 18 minutes. For the beer cheese: Meanwhile, add the butter to a large saucepan or high-sided skillet over a medium heat.

Add enough cold water to come 2 inches above the beans. Cover and soak at room temperature for at least 12 hours and up to 18 hours. Line a large mesh sieve with 2 layers of cheesecloth or a nut milk bag and set it over a large Dutch oven (see Cook\u2019s Note). Gently massage the beans to remove some of the skin. Repeat this step until most of the skins have come off. It is okay if some skins remain. Transfer the drained beans to a blender. Add 2 cups of cold water to just cover the beans. Blend on medium-high speed until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and add 2 more cups of cold water and blend on low speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. (If your blender is not large enough to hold the entire contents, blend half the beans with 1 cup cold water and transfer to a bowl; repeat to blend the remaining beans and 1 cup water. Then blend this mixture again in 2 batches, each with another 1 cup of water, for a total of 4 cups water) Transfer half of the blended mixture to the lined sieve. Blend the remaining half with 2 more cups of cold water on low speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. Stir the bean mixture in the sieve to let some liquid through and then gather the 4 corners of the cheesecloth or the top of the nut bag together in a bunch and twist to close. Gently press and squeeze on the cheesecloth or nut bag to extract the soy milk into the pot. Pour the remaining bean mixture into the cheesecloth or nut bag and repeat the same action to extract more soy milk. During straining, try not to squeeze too hard as the mixture can burst out of the top of the cheesecloth or nut bag and become messy quickly. Gently unwrap the cheesecloth or nut bag, break up the bean paste into smaller pieces, slowly pour another 4 cups of cold water over the bean paste and mix until combined. Wrap the cheesecloth or nut bag again and gently squeeze out as much soy milk as possible. Reserve the bean paste for another use (see Cook\u2019s Note). Bring the soy milk to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently to avoid scorching the bottom. Lower the heat to medium and let simmer, skimming the foam from the top as needed, until the soy milk has slightly reduced and doesn\u2019t taste bitter, about 20 minutes. Skim foam occasionally as needed. For sweetened soy milk, stir in the sugar if using and 1/2 teaspoon salt. For savory soy milk, omit the sugar and stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Enjoy the soy milk while it\u2019s hot or let cool completely and then refrigerate in an airtight container for at least 8 hours and up to 5 days. When ready to serve, preheat the oven or a toaster oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the frozen youtiaos on a baking sheet until crisp, about 5 minutes. If desired, heat the soy milk in a medium pot over medium-high heat until steaming, 4 to 5 minutes. Enjoy the soy milk cold or hot with the youtiao. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 46274,&quot;Haupia French Toast 1 (12-ounce) can coconut milk 4 tablespoons sugar 4 tablespoons cornstarch 3/4 cup water 1 1/2 loaves challah bread or brioche 4 eggs 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon Powdered sugar Fresh fruit, seasonal Instructions: To make the haupia, pour the coconut milk into a saucepan. Combine the sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl, stir in the water and blend well. Stir the sugar mixture into the coconut milk and cook stirring over low heat until mixture thickens. Pour into 8-inch square pan and chill until firm. Cut into 2-inch squares. To prepare the French toast, make a slit in the center of the bread and stuff the haupia in the center. Slice the bread at a bias cut, approximately 1 1/2-inches thick. You should have approximately 12 slices. In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs, cream, sugar, and cinnamon and whip until ingredients are well mixed. Dip each piece of bread in this mixture, allowing it to soak in on both sides. Lightly shake off any excess. Heat a griddle to 375 degrees F and sear each piece of bread until golden brown. To serve, place slices on each plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar and garnish with fresh fruit. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 46275,&quot;Shrimp and Snow Pea Salad 12 ounces snow peas 1 1/4 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 6 radishes, thinly sliced into half-moons 4 scallions, thinly sliced 1/3 cup rice vinegar 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger Salt 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds Instructions: Bring a large saucepan of water with a steamer basket to a boil.

Put them in a large saucepan with cold water to cover by about 3 inches and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 40 to 45 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander in the sink. Let the potatoes cool just until you can handle them--hot potatoes make better mashed. Meanwhile, melt the butter in the pan over low heat. Hold the potatoes in a towel or in a kitchen glove and gently peel the potato skins off with a knife or your fingers. Quarter the potatoes and put then in the pan. Heat the milk in a microwave-safe measuring cup or bowl until hot. Mash the potatoes with the butter with a fork or potato masher if you have one, until most of the lumps are gone and the potatoes are smooth and fluffy. Then stir in the milk, until the mashed potatoes are light and smooth, if there are still lumps paddle them smooth with a wooden spoon. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt or to taste, and pepper, to taste.

Blend the ricotta, 1/4 cup of sugar, egg yolks, orange zest, almond extract, cinnamon, and salt in a food processor until very smooth. Blend in the melted chocolate. Transfer the ricotta mixture to a large bowl. Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites in another large bowl with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar. Continue beating until semi-firm peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the ricotta mixture. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cups. Fill the pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the custard cups. Bake until the pudding puffs slightly but the centers are still creamy, about 25 minutes (the pudding will become thick and creamy when cold). Allow puddings to cool slightly before removing from water bath. Remove the custard cups from the bath. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. Run a knife around the sides of the puddings to loosen. Invert the puddings onto plates. Drizzle the strawberry sauce around the puddings and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling, Cava]&quot; 46282,&quot;Turkey Sweet Potato Casserole 2 cups cooked, mashed sweet potatoes 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/3 cup evaporated milk 1/4 cup Swanson?

Drain off the excess water and place the fish in a bowl. Add turmeric powder and a large pinch of salt. Add lime juice and mix. Cover and refrigerate for 25 minutes.<br> Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over a medium gas flame until seriously hot, but not burning.<br> Add the chiles, ginger, garlic, onion, and curry leaves to the oil. The curry leaves must be added in at the beginning, so the flavors can infuse with the other ingredients. Stir lightly until onions are transparent. Add 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, and stir. Add enough liquid coconut milk to cover the ingredients in the pan. Do not add the thick coconut milk yet, as it will curdle. Add the fish and a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 6 to 7 minutes until cooked.<br> Add the quartered tomato and the thick coconut milk.

This is one of the most crucial steps in creating a delicate pulao, where each grain of rice is separate from the other. Pour the rice into a large bowl and fill with fresh water. Gently wash the rice, running your hand through the rice without breaking the grains. The water will go smoky. Pour off the water and fill the bowl again. Wash, drain, and repeat 3 or 4 times until the water runs clear. By washing the rice in this way, you&#39;ve just removed the excess starch from the rice so the grains won&#39;t stick together. In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the canola oil until it&#39;s shimmering, but not smoking. Add the cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves - they should sizzle as they hit the oil. Saute gently until their woodsy aromas waft up into your nostrils. Add the Ginger-Garlic Paste and the chopped scallions and saute 1 minute or so until they soften. Add the rice to the pot, season with salt, and saute gently until the grains aren&#39;t sticking together anymore and the rice turns translucent, about 2 minutes. You should also start to smell the basmati&#39;s gentle aroma. This smell always reminds me of my mum! Add the can of tomatoes and stir. Cook about 2 minutes to get rid of some of the excess liquid. Add the water and salt and turn the heat up so that the contents of the pot come to a boil. Then turn the heat down as low as it can go, put a lid on it, and cook for 15 minutes. Don&#39;t take the lid off at all during this process! Once the 15 minutes are over, resist the temptation to take the lid off again. Let it sit 5 minutes off heat. This will steam the rice and give you a nice, fluffy pulao. Finish with a flourish of peanuts and a sprinkling of the scallion greens and serve. Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. Save what you don&#39;t use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It&#39;s a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 46285,&quot;Duck Foie Gras in Spiced Red Wine 1 1/2 bottles red wine (preferably from Bordeaux) About 1 pound fresh duck liver 3 1/2 ounces sliced carrots 4 pieces star anise 1 cup sliced leeks 1 large onion, peeled and sliced 2 cloves 1 tablespoon sweet peppercorns 2 large handfuls coarse salt 1 large handful powdered sugar Salad, your choice, for serving Vinaigrette, your choice, for serving Green asparagus, for serving Instructions: Pour the wine into a large cast iron pot and add all of the ingredients.

Pat the beef dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the beef generously with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy 6-quart roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until brown on all sides, about 15 minutes total cooking time. Transfer the beef to a bowl. Add remaining tablespoon oil to the pan, add the onions and saute until tender, scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of the pot, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute 1 minute. Add the wine and boil 1 minute. Stir in the broth and mushrooms. Return the beef to the pan. Bring the liquids to a boil. Cover and transfer to the oven. Braise until the beef is fork-tender, turning the beef over halfway through cooking, about 3 hours. Transfer the beef to a cutting board. Tent the beef with foil and let stand 15 minutes. Meanwhile, spoon any excess fat off the top of the pan juices. Transfer the pan juices and vegetables to a blender and puree until smooth.

Immediately turn off the heat and set aside. In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring constantly, to caramelize the mixture. (You will smell a characteristic nutty-caramel odor when the butter browns, signaling that the mixture is ready.) Whisking constantly, gradually add the butter/brown sugar mixture to the hot milk/cream mixture. If the mixture is not smooth, blend for 20 seconds with a hand blender or pour through a fine sieve. Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Whisk in the cornstarch and salt until dissolved. Whisk the cornstarch mixture back into the hot milk mixture in the saucepan. Add the scotch and whisk in. Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Turn off the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour into the pre-baked pie shell and chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. For the meringue top: Whip whites with the salt to soft peaks, then add sugar and whip until sugar is dissolved and whites are glossy. Spread meringue on top of the slightly cooled pie and bake for 5 minutes until lightly browned (cappuccino colored). Chill until ready to serve. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter. Turn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape into round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between two sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won&#39;t be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It&#39;s entirely up to you. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don&#39;t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don&#39;t do this more than two or three times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11-inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies. Set your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it&#39;s up to you. Either choice will work. To transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan. Don&#39;t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don&#39;t be concerned; it will patch easily. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. For a single-crust pie: Working around the rim, turn the crust under itself (not under the rim of the pan) to make a thick edge, pressing it firmly against the pan to reduce shrinkage. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \V\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill the finished crust or crusts for 20 to 30 minutes before filling the pie. When the bottom crust is filled, rest the top crust on top and pinch the edges together, turning them under all the way around. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \V\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. For a prebaked pie or tart crust (blind baking): Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don&#39;t turn it down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights or dried beans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \blond. Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent overbaking, until medium brown.

Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Sprinkle southwest seasoning on both sides of chicken. Lightly coat with olive oil. Grill chicken over coals with mesquite or hickory chips added. (In metal tray if using a gas grill). Rotate chicken a quarter turn after a few minutes to add grill marks. Turn chicken over after about 5 to 7 minutes and grill the other side the same way. When chicken is done (moist and tender) take off the grill and let rest. Bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil for the pasta. Add pasta and cook until it is al dente. Keep cooked pasta covered and warm in a slight bit of its water. In a small, ungreased frying pan, toast pine nuts until they are golden brown. Key - Do NOT burn the pine nuts or the entire dish will taste bitter. Cut the outer covering (rind) off the brie. Throw away the rind and set the cheese aside. Heat a large frying pan to medium-high heat and add all of the olive oil. After 30 seconds or so add the tomato, garlic, parsley/cilantro and basil. Let this saute for about 1 minute. Key - have all of the ingredients ready and next to the stove because this sauce works fast! Add the brie and toasted pine nuts. Toss or slowly stir over low heat for two minutes or until the cheese is completely incorporated into the sauce. You should have a medium thick sauce with a beautifully rich pink color with splashes of green. Drain the remaining water off the pasta in a colander. Place a nice portion of pasta on a decorative plate. Chop the chicken breasts on a bias and place on top of the pasta. Ladle a fair amount of the brie sauce over the chicken and pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 46291,&quot;Roasted Nati Koli Saaru 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds<br> 1 teaspoon cumin seeds<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns<br> 2 whole cloves<br> 1 cup shredded coconut<br> One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled<br> 5 to 7 cloves garlic, depending on size, peeled<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon jaggery<br> 2 tablespoons coarse sea salt crystals<br> 1 bunch cilantro, roughly chopped<br> 4 to 5 jalape?os<br> Juice of 1 small lime<br> One 4- to 5-pound chicken, butterflied (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 cup neutral oil (sunflower or grapeseed work great) 1 yellow or white onion, sliced<br> 2 sprigs curry leaves<br> 2 cups canned crushed tomatoes<br> 1 tablespoon Kashmiri red chili powder<br> 2 teaspoons turmeric powder<br> One 13 1/2-ounce can coconut milk<br> Salt<br> 1/2 lime Cilantro, for garnish<br> Cooked jasmine rice, for serving<br> Lime wedges, for serving Instructions: For the chicken and the marinade: Place a medium cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the sesame oil. Add the fenugreek, cumin, black peppercorns and cloves and toast for about 30 seconds. Turn off the heat and let the mixture sit in the hot skillet for another 30 seconds, and then transfer to a mini food processor. Return the skillet to medium-low heat and add the shredded coconut to the skillet. Stir until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the mini food processor. Add the ginger, garlic, cinnamon, jaggery, salt and cilantro to the processor Place the same skillet the spices cooked in over medium-heat heat (no need to add any more oil). Add the jalape?os and cook until blistered and charred. Plunge the jalape?os into a bowl of cold water. Peel the jalape?os and discard the stems. Add to the processor with the spices. Add the lime juice and process until the mixture forms a thick paste, adding a little water if necessary to get a smooth texture.<br> Place the chicken in a baking dish or other container large enough so the chicken will lay flat. Rub the bird all over with the marinade, cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours or overnight. When it is about 2 to 3 hours before serving, make the sauce: Place a large cast-iron pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the oil and onion. Move the onions to one side and add the butterflied chicken, skin-side down. Add the curry leaves when the onions start to sizzle. Once you have a good sear on your chicken, carefully flip it over. Add the tomatoes, chili powder, turmeric, coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups water and stir together. Lower the heat and simmer the sauce for 15 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pop the dish into the oven. Check every 20 minutes; you are looking for the chicken to start to break down, the sauce to thicken and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh not touching bone to register 165 degrees F.<br> Taste the sauce and add salt if needed.

Brush with the egg yolk and scatter the rest of the ingredients over, being subtle with the allspice and cinnamon. Roll the pastry up tightly like a Swiss roll to make a long sausage shape. With a knife, cut across the sausage into 1-inch (2 1/2-centimeter) pieces. Take 8 pieces aside, and freeze the rest of the pastry for a rainy day. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C/gas 6). Turn all the pieces of pastry swirl-side up and flatten them slightly. Dust the surface of your pastry with flour, then roll each piece out into a thin circle (around the size of a teacup saucer). Even I don&#39;t have proper pastry molds at home, so I just grease and flour the outsides of 8 of my glass tumblers. Then, I place a circle of pastry on top of each tumbler, pleating, pinching and hugging the pastry around them. Place the tumblers on a baking tray, pastry at the top, and put in the preheated oven until crisp and golden, around 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and, while still hot, take a tea towel and pat the slightly raised top of the pastry back down on to the flat bottom of the tumbler ? giving you a flat base again. Allow to cool, and carefully remove the pastry cases from around the tumblers. Fill your pastry cases with the chocolate filling: Place the double cream, sugar, and pinch of salt in a pan and bring to the boil. As soon as the mixture has boiled, remove from the heat, and add the butter and chocolate. Stir until it has completely melted. Allow the mixture to cool slightly, stirring in the cold milk until smooth and shiny. Sometimes this mixture looks like it has split. Allow the mixture to cool down a bit more, and whisk in a little extra cold milk until smooth. Scrape all the mixture into the cooked pastry shells. Shake to even it out and allow to cool for around 1 to 2 hours, until it is at room temperature. Dust with the cocoa powder. Ultimately the pastry should be short and crisp and the filling should be smooth and should cut like butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 46293,&quot;Escalivada con Anchoas (Roasted Red Peppers and Eggplant with Anchovies) 12 small eggplants (a little larger than a bell pepper) 12 red bell peppers Extra-virgin olive oil, preferably Spanish 1 to 2 teaspoons sea salt 1 clove garlic, finely minced, optional 18 large anchovy fillets, packed in olive oil, preferably Spanish Aged sherry vinegar, optional Sea salt, such as Maldon, optional Grilled crusty bread drizzled with olive oil Salty, briny black olives Instructions: Preheat your grill or broiler to high heat. Roast the eggplants and red bell peppers, whole, as close as possible to the heat source, turning and rotating each piece with kitchen tongs, to achieve an evenly charred exterior. The skin on the eggplants should get a dark toasted color and the bell peppers should be charred with papery layer of black. Put the roasted vegetables in a glass bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and set aside to cool. Once the reserved vegetables are cool enough to handle, peel both the peppers and eggplants. Slice the eggplants into long strips. De-seed the peppers and slice them into long strips. Combine the peppers and eggplants in a bowl and add 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil, salt and garlic, if using. Be careful to not over-season with salt because the anchovies are also very salty. Let stand for a minimum of 30 minutes. Serve in individual plates or on a platter, family-style. Lay the anchovies across the top of the dish. Finish the dish with a final drizzle of olive oil, a small splash of sherry vinegar and a light sprinkling of sea salt, if using. Serve with grilled crusty bread and some black olives. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 46294,&quot;Garlic-Herb Breadsticks 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 clove garlic, minced Chopped fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme and/or oregano), for sprinkling Instructions: Put 3/4 cup warm water in a food processor. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and pulse until dissolved. Add the flour, olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter and pulse until the dough forms a ball, about 1 minute. Continue to process with the motor running until smooth, about 2 more minutes. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment; brush with olive oil. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Divide into 12 equal pieces, then roll each piece into a 12- to-16-inch rope. Arrange the ropes 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets, rolling them to coat with the oil. Cover each baking sheet with a damp cloth and set aside in a warm place until the breadsticks double in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and the garlic in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until melted, about 1 minute. Brush the breadsticks with the garlic butter; sprinkle with herbs and salt. Bake until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46295,&quot;Pork Rib Roast with Cranberry-Apricot Stuffing 3 tablespoons cognac or other brandy 3 tablespoons water 1/3 cup dried cranberries 1/3 cup dried apricots, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup whole almonds, toasted and chopped 1 medium shallot, minced 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, toasted and crushed 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus additional for seasoning Freshly ground black pepper 1 (6-rib) center-cut pork roast, backbone removed and ribs Frenched, about 4 pounds after trimming) 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 cup creme fraiche or sour cream 1/2 cup Dijon mustard Instructions: Warm the cognac and water in a small saucepan, add the cranberries and apricots, and set aside until plump, about 10 minutes. In a small food processor, pulse the fruit and any unabsorbed liquid with the almonds, shallot, butter, fennel seeds, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper, to taste, until the fruit and nuts are coarsely chopped. With a boning knife or other long, thin knife, make a cut 3 inches across in the center of one end of the roast. Gently push and work the blade in and straight through the roast to the other end. (If your knife isn?t long enough, make a cut at either end and work your way to the center, making sure that the cuts meet.) Insert the narrow end of a wooden spoon into the opening to widen it a bit all the way through. Push the stuffing into the loin, working first from 1 end and then the other, filling to the center. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pat the loin dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the roast, holding the bones up so that the bottom gets well browned, then turn the roast to brown the meaty side, about 6 minutes total. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the pork meat side down for 30 minutes. Turn the roast over so it sits on the bones and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 155 degrees F, about 1 hour more. Transfer the roast to a carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving. Whisk the creme fraiche or sour cream with the mustard in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Slice roast between the bones to make individual chops, arrange them on a platter, and serve, passing the mustard sauce. Know-How: Roasting meat on the bone keeps meat moist and improves its flavor. Pan-searing before roasting is the way to get a great burnished crust on lean meats that would otherwise dry out if left to brown solely in the oven. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46296,&quot;Parmesan Crisp with Pink Sauce 1/2 cup mayonnaise, such as Hellmann&#39;s 4 piquillo peppers<br> 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest (1/2 small lemon)<br> 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small food processor, combine the mayonnaise, piquillos, lemon zest and salt. Puree until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. Line a straight-sided baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle the Parmesan onto the parchment and spread thinly and evenly into an oval (or whatever shape you like). Bake until bubbly and just beginning to brown, 9 to 10 minutes. Transfer the parchment with the crisp to a wire rack and allow to cool completely. Serve the Parmesan crisp on a board for people to break off pieces, with the pink sauce alongside for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 46297,&quot;Grilled Coconut Wings with Thai Peanut Dipping Sauce 2 cups coconut milk 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons crushed garlic 2 teaspoons ground turmeric 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1 teaspoon ground galangal (or 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger) 1 tablespoon kosher salt 20 chicken wings, jointed Thai Peanut Sauce, recipe follows 1/2 cup unsalted roasted peanuts 1 tablespoon peanut oil, plus more to taste 2 fresh Thai chiles or other small chiles 1 1/2-inch-thick slice fresh ginger 4 garlic cloves 1/3 cup canned unsweetened coconut milk 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce 4 teaspoons fish sauce 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice Pinch salt (add to taste, as fish sauce can be very salty) 1/2 cup finely minced cilantro leaves and stems Instructions: To make the marinade: using a food processor, grind the ingredients into a paste the consistency of thin yogurt. Reserve small amount for basting and transfer the remaining marinade to a glass bowl. Add the cleaned and trimmed chicken wings. Toss liberally, cover with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight. To grill the wings, shake off the excess marinade and grill the wings over medium heat for approximately 5 minutes per side, or until crispy. Brush them frequently with the reserved marinade, and be careful not to burn the wing tips. The wings should have a crispy texture with a deep mahogany color when done. Serve with the Thai Peanut Sauce. To make the peanut sauce, add the peanuts along with the peanut oil to a food processor. Blend, on high, until the peanuts form a rough paste. Add the rest of the ingredients except for the cilantro; blend until smooth. Stir in the cilantro and thin with peanut oil to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Gewrztraminer, Riesling, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 46298,&quot;50 Toast Toppers Top This...

Meanwhile, liberally sprinkle the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Add the oil to the pot. Add half of the chicken skin-side down and cook until the skin is deeply browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook until the second side is deeply browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Add the garlic to the pot and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned in spots, about 1 minute. Add the olives, capers, vinegar, oregano and 1/2 cup water and stir to combine, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pot. Turn off the heat and add the rack on top of the olive mixture with the handles facing up. Nestle the chicken on the rack skin-side up. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 10 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, make the yogurt sauce. Add the yogurt, parsley, mint, lemon zest and juice and a large pinch of salt and pepper to a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Set aside. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. Remove the chicken to a platter and use a slotted spoon to scoop the olive mixture on top and around the chicken. Cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.<br> Remove the rack and set the pot to normal saute. Simmer the sauce until slightly thickened and reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes. Spoon the sauce on top of the chicken and serve with the yogurt sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 46303,&quot;Crispy Potato Rajas Tacos 3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut in 1/2-inch dice 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 2 medium onions, halved and cut in 1/4-inch slices lengthwise Salt, to taste Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 4 medium red bell peppers, roasted, peeled, seeded, and julienned 4 medium poblano chiles, roasted, peeled, seeded, and julienned 1 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup grated Mexican Manchego or Monterey Jack cheese 2/3 cup grated Cotija cheese 1/3 cup grated Panela cheese Vegetable oil, for frying 12 small corn tortillas Chipotle Crema, recipe follows, for serving Border Guacamole, recipe follows, for serving Corn Relish, recipe follows, for serving 1 cup sour cream 1/4 to 1/2 chipotle en adobo, to taste, finely minced into a paste 1/4 lime, juiced Salt, to taste 5 ripe California avocados, preferably Hass, halved, seeded, and peeled 6 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 1 medium red onion, diced 4 jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded, and finely diced 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 4 cups fresh corn kernels (about 5 ears) 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch dice 4 poblano chiles, roasted, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch dice 4 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced on the diagonal 1/2 cup red wine vinegar Instructions: For the potato rajas: Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil and cook potatoes until just tender, about 6 to 8 minutes, being careful not to overcook. Drain, pat dry, and spread in a single layer on a tray to cool. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onions with salt and pepper until they begin to brown, about 10 minutes.

Add the shrimp shells and tails, onion, carrot and celery and saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, then add 10 cups of cold water, the tomatoes, parsley, bay leaf and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, skimming the surface occasionally, for 40 minutes. Strain the stock through a strainer lined with cheesecloth into a large bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids. The stock can be made 2 days in advance and stored tightly covered in the refrigerator, or frozen up to 3 months. For the tomato aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, anchovies, tomato powder, tomato paste, green onion, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. For the broth: Heat the oil in a large, high-sided saute pan over high heat and cook the fennel and onion until they begin to soften. Add the pastis and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, saffron, cl flakes and 2 cups of the shrimp stock. Bring to a boil, add the garlic and cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add 4 more cups of shrimp stock, reduce the heat and cook until the flavors meld and the broth reduces slightly, about 20 minutes. Strain the shrimp-tomato broth into a large bowl, discard the solids, pour the liquid back into the high-sided saute pan and set aside. For the anchovy butter: Put the anchovies and butter in a bowl and mix until combined. Season with salt and pepper, cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 20 minutes. For the seafood: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Season the scallops on both sides with salt and pepper. Sear the scallops on one side until golden brown, about 2 minutes, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds. Remove to a baking sheet. Add another tablespoon of the oil to the pan and season both sides of the halibut fillets with salt and pepper. Sear on one side until golden brown, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds. Remove to the baking sheet with the scallops. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the large saute pan, season the shrimp with salt and pepper and sear until the shells become lightly golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Deglaze the pan with 1 cup of the reserved shrimp-tomato broth. Transfer the liquid to the remaining shrimp-tomato broth in the high-sided saute pan. Heat the shrimp-tomato broth over high heat. Add the mussels, cover and cook until they open, about 2 minutes. Remove the mussels to the baking sheet with a slotted spoon and discard any that did not open. Add the seared seafood and lobster tails to the shrimp-tomato broth, cover and let cook for 2 minutes. To serve: Add the anchovy butter to the broth and cook until thickened; stir in the parsley, tarragon and lemon zest. Top each baguette slice with a large dollop of tomato aioli and garnish with chives. Divide the seafood and broth among 6 large, slightly shallow soup bowls. Top each with a tomato aioli crouton and garnish with more parsley or tarragon or chives, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 46307,&quot;Japanese Style Grilled Salmon 4 (5-ounce) salmon fillets 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup sake or dry white wine 1/4 cup mirin 2 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons chopped green onion 3 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger 1 small lemon, thinly sliced Soba Noodle Salad (recipe follows) Instructions: This approach with salmon works equally well on fresh halibut or sea bass. We serve the resulting fish hot or at room temperature either as the center of the plate or as part of a salad. If you&#39;re using salmon, try marinating and grilling the skin separately to use as a garnish. Season salmon with salt and set aside. Combine marinade ingredients, except lemon slices, in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Add lemon and pour cooled marinade over fish and marinate refrigerated for 2 to 4 hours. Turn fish occasionally. To serve: Grill or broil on both sides until just done, approximately 4 to 5 minutes per side. Be careful not to overcook. Salmon should still be translucent in the center. Serve with Soba Noodle Salad on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46308,&quot;Chicken Croquettes 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large shallot, minced 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dredging 1 cup heavy cream 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more Freshly ground black pepper Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 4 cups finely chopped poached chicken breasts, recipe follows 2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley leaves 1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh chives 2 large eggs 1 1/4 cups fresh breadcrumbs Vegetable oil for shallow frying Serving Suggestions: Dijon mustard 10 sprigs parsley 2 sprigs fresh thyme 1 small onion, halved 1 small carrot, halved 1 stalk celery, halved 3 pounds split chicken breasts, on the bone and fat trimmed 3 pounds split chicken breasts, on the bone and fat trimmed<br> 5 to 6 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium Instructions: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, add the shallots and saute until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the 2 tablespoons of flour, stir it into the butter with a wooden spoon, and cook for 2 minutes more. Whisk in the cream, bring to a simmer, stirring until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Pour the sauce into a medium bowl; season with 1 teaspoon of the salt, pepper to taste, and nutmeg. Set aside to cool, stirring occasionally. Stir the chicken, parsley, and chives into the cooled sauce. By hand, form the chicken mixture into eight 3-inch long torpedo-shaped croquettes. Put the croquettes on a pan or large plate, cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours or until set and firm. Put a heaping cup of flour in a shallow bowl or lipped plate. In another small bowl whisk the eggs with the remaining salt and pepper to taste. Spread the breadcrumbs into a third shallow bowl. Bread the croquettes. Roll them in the flour, taking care to shake off any excess. Next, dip them in the egg mixture, and finally roll in the breadcrumbs until evenly coated. Place on a plate. Pour enough oil into a large skillet to come about halfway up the sides of the croquettes, and heat over medium heat. Shallow-fry the croquettes until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels and serve with the mustard. Put the parsley, thyme, onion, carrot, celery, and chicken breasts in a medium saucepan. Cover with the broth, and bring just to a boil. Lower the heat to very low and cover. Poach the chicken for 20 minutes or until firm to the touch. Remove the pan from the heat, uncover, cool the chicken in the stock for 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and reserve the liquid. Bone and skin the chicken and cut the meat into cubes. Discard the bones and skin. Strain the broth and store, covered, in the refrigerator for 3 days or freeze for later use. Remove any fat from the surface of the broth before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 46309,&quot;Canneles from Bordeaux: Canneles de Bordeaux 3 cups milk 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped 7 1/2 ounces (3 tablespoons plus 3/4 cup) unsalted butter 1 cup sugar 2/3 cup pastry flour 1 extra-large egg yolk 2 extra-large eggs 3 tablespoons dark rum 3 ounces beeswax, finely chopped (about 1/3 cup) Instructions: In a small saucepan, combine the milk, vanilla bean, and its scrapings. Bring the milk to the scalding point over medium high heat, then remove the pan from the heat and add the 3 tablespoons of butter. Set aside to cool to lukewarm. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar and flour. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, eggs and rum. Whisk the egg mixture into the sugar and flour mixture, then whisk in the lukewarm milk mixture. Strain into a container; cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours. To prepare molds for baking, melt the beeswax in a saucepan over low heat. Add the remaining 3/4 cup butter to the melted wax and stir until the butter is melted. Remove the mixture from the heat and, using a narrow pastry brush, carefully coat the inside of 18 (2 by 1-inch) canneles molds. (Dedicate this brush to canneles making because the wax will get into the brush.) If the wax mixture starts to set up or thicken, return it to the heat for a moment until it thins. Remove the batter from the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before baking it. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the waxed canneles molds on a heavy baking sheet with a rim to prevent any wax and butter that melts from the molds from dripping onto the bottom of your oven and creating a fire hazard. Fill the molds 3/4 full with the batter, whisking the batter frequently and well to ensure that the sugar and flour remain evenly distributed. Bake for about 50 minutes, or until the surface of the canneles is dark brown. Remove from the oven, being very careful not to spill any of the hot wax on yourself. (It is wise to keep children and pets out of the kitchen during this part of the process.) Using tongs or an old towel, pick up each mold and tap it upside down to remove the canneles. If it doesn&#39;t come out after a few taps, using a paring knife to loosen it from the sides. And...viola! Serve warm from the oven. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46310,&quot;Southern Biscuits 12 ounces all-purpose flour, plus 1/2 cup for dusting 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 ounce unsalted butter, chilled 2 ounces shortening, chilled 8 fluid ounces low-fat buttermilk, chilled Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Whisk together the 12 ounces flour, baking powder, baking soda and kosher salt in a large mixing bowl. Using your fingertips, rub the butter and shortening into the dry goods until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the middle of this mixture and pour in the buttermilk. Stir with a large spoon until the dough just comes together. Then knead in the bowl until all the flour has been taken up.<br> Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, then start folding the dough over on itself, gently kneading for 30 seconds, or until the dough is soft and smooth. Press the dough into a 1-inch thick round. Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut out biscuits, being sure to push the cutter straight down through the dough to the work surface before twisting to \punch\ out the biscuit. Make your cuts as close together as possible to limit waste.<br> Place the biscuits on a half sheet pan so they just barely touch. Reroll any scraps and punch out as many biscuits as possible. Use your thumb to create a shallow dimple in the top center of each biscuit and bake until the biscuits are tall and light gold on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn the biscuits out into a kitchen towel-lined basket and cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 46311,&quot;Middle Eastern Pizza 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 yellow onion, chopped 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 tablespoon sumac (available at Middle Eastern and gourmet stores) 1 35-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes, diced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 1 pound prepared pizza dough, at room temperature 1 medium eggplant, cubed 1 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 large red onion, thinly sliced 8 ounces fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese, diced 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped 1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped 3/4 cup feta cheese, crumbled Torn fresh mint, for topping Instructions: Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic powder, sumac and tomatoes and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Make the pizza: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Drizzle a rimmed baking sheet with 2 tablespoons olive oil and stretch the pizza dough to fill the pan (it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect since this is a rustic pizza). Brush the dough with olive oil and bake until just golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant and cumin, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the eggplant is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 5 more minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Add the red onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Top the crust with 1 cup sauce, the mozzarella, eggplant mixture, caramelized onion, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and feta. Return to the oven and cook until the cheese melts and the crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 more minutes, brushing the crust with olive oil halfway through. Remove the pizza from the oven and brush the crust with olive oil again. Top the pizza with the mint. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 46312,&quot;Crookneck Squash Frittata 1 pound small yellow crookneck, trimmed and cut into 1/8-inch thick slices 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 6 large eggs, beaten 1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese 1/2-ounce grated Parmesan Instructions: Heat the oven to the high broil setting. Set a rack in the oven 3 to 4-inches from the broiler. In a medium bowl toss the sliced squash with the oil, rosemary, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Lay the squash in a single layer on a cooling rack set inside a foil lined half sheet pan. Broil until the squash is golden brown on 1 side, about 8 to 10 minutes. Whisk the eggs, ricotta, and Parmesan together in a medium mixing bowl. Put the squash in a 10-inch nonstick, oven-safe saute pan set over medium heat. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and stir with a silicone spatula to make sure egg gets under the squash. Cook without stirring until the egg mixture has set on the bottom and begins to set on top, about 4 to 5 minutes. Put the pan under the broiler until lightly browned and puffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Loosen the frittata from the pan by moving a rubber spatula around the edges. Slide the frittata onto a plate or other serving dish, and cut into 6 servings. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46313,&quot;Creme Brulee Without a Torch 1 vanilla bean 2 cups (480 milliliters) heavy cream<br> 6 large egg yolks<br> 1/2 cup (90 grams) plus 2 to 3 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/8 cup (30 grams) mascarpone, optional<br> Instructions: Using a small, sharp knife, split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape the seeds into a saucepan along with the heavy cream; add the scraped bean. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then immediately remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for 10 minutes. Combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl, whisking until the mixture is very pale yellow. Whisking constantly, pour 1 ladleful of the warm heavy cream into the egg mixture to temper, then slowly pour the mixture back into the pan, whisking constantly. Remove the vanilla bean and stir in the mascarpone. Chill the mixture, covered, for 1 hour or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Divide the batter into four 5-inch or six 4-inch ramekins. Place the ramekins in a larger roasting pan and fill the pan with hot water, coming halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until set like gelatin and a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let cool at room temperature, 30 minutes. Transfer to the fridge until completely chilled, about 1 hour. Sprinkle the remaining 2 to 3 tablespoons sugar on top of the creme brulees (you want a nice, even layer). Choose a metal spoon that you don&#39;t love so much and place it over a high flame on the stove. Let the bowl of the spoon get hot enough that it looks red. Remove the spoon from the stove (the handle shouldn&#39;t be hot because flatware doesn&#39;t conduct heat) and burn the top of the creme brulee with it. Reheat the spoon for each creme brulee, cleaning the spoon after each use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 46314,&quot;Preserved Lemons 13 to 14 lemons (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 sprigs fresh oregano, optional<br> Instructions: Wash 10 of the lemons thoroughly and dry them completely (reserve the remaining 3 to 4 lemons for juicing). Cut off about 1/4 inch from the tip of the 10 lemons, then cut them almost all the way into quarters, keeping the ends attached. Mix the sugar and 3/4 cup salt in a small bowl. Gently open each quartered lemon, use a small spoon to fill it with the salt mixture and close it back up. Place the lemons and remaining salt mixture in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to overnight. After this time, the lemons will have released some of their juices and become squishy.<br> Transfer the salted lemons and oregano if using to a sterilized quart glass jar with tight lid, pressing them tightly into the jar; you want as little space between the lemons as possible. Squeeze enough juice from the reserved lemons (about 3/4 cup) to fill the jar with lemon juice. You may need more or less juice, depending on the size of the lemons.<br> Refrigerate the lemons, turning the jar upside down every few days and then placing it back in the refrigerator right-side up, until the rinds are soft, 3 to 4 weeks. You can keep the preserved lemons in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o]&quot; 46315,&quot;Marinated Crab Salad 1 cup olive oil 1 cup red wine vinegar 2 large garlic cloves, minced 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup chopped parsley, leaves 1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon 1/2 pound cooked lump or back fin crabmeat 1/2 pound cooked special crabmeat 6 cups mixed greens 4 to 6 lemon wedges Instructions: In a non-reactive bowl combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, pepper, parsley, and tarragon.

Whisk the eggs, milk, paprika and 1 teaspoon salt in a shallow bowl; add the shrimp and refrigerate at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. Put the flour in a shallow bowl and season with pepper. Put the breadcrumbs in another shallow bowl. Remove the shrimp from the egg mixture and dredge in the seasoned flour. Dip the shrimp in the egg mixture again, then roll in the breadcrumbs to coat; transfer to a rack set over a baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to fry. Combine the mayonnaise, pickle, ketchup, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, scallions and parsley in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat about 1/2 inch peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, add the shrimp and fry, flipping halfway through, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels; season with salt. Spread the mayonnaise mixture on the rolls and fill with shredded lettuce and the fried shrimp.

Whisk in 1 1/2 cups water and 2 tablespoons olive oil until smooth. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F with a pizza stone or baking sheet on the bottom rack. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Whisk the baking powder into the chickpea mixture and pour half of the batter into the hot skillet, swirling to evenly coat the bottom. Cook until just set, about 2 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the hot pizza stone and bake until the edges and top are browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Flip the crust in the skillet and bake until the top is browned and crisp, about 3 minutes more. Transfer the crust to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Make another crust with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the remaining batter. For the toppings: Brush the crusts lightly with olive oil. Arrange the mozzarella on top and sprinkle with Parmesan. Divide the tomatoes between the two crusts and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roughly tear the basil leaves and scatter over the top.

Cut the round ends off an inexpensive whisk. Arrange the tines so they are evenly spaced. You will also need an open space to make the cotton candy. At home, slit open a garbage bag and cover the floor area. Wedge 2 long wooden spoons under something heavy so they extend off the edge of the counter. Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 320 degrees F, what is known as the hard crack stage (the sugar becomes brittle when it comes in contact with a cooler surface). Remove from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-size microwaveable glass bowl. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown. A glass bowl will hold the temperature of the sugar. I put a towel under the bowl to keep the bowl from tipping over and to protect my hands from the heat of the glass. (The sugar will stay liquid enough to work with easily for about 10 minutes; after that it will start to thicken. If this happens before you are finished, just pop the bowl in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the sugar is liquid enough to work with once again.) If you are going to color and/or flavor the sugar, add those drops now. Dip the tines into the hot sugar. Allow the sugar to drain off for 1 to 2 seconds until the draining sugar strands are relatively the same consistency. Then wave the whisk over the extended wooden spoons and allow the sugar strands to gently drift until they are resting on top of the spoons. Make sure you are about 12 to 18 inches above the spoons. Use broad long strokes and work quickly. Gather the cotton candy and roll onto paper that you&#39;ve rolled into a long, thin cone, like cotton candy is served in at the carnival or serve as is. If you need to store the cotton candy for a few hours, place it in an airtight container. The delicate sugar will melt in a humid environment. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 46324,&quot;Caramel and Chocolate Apples 12 Granny Smith apples 1 pound caramel Melted dark, white or milk chocolate 1/2 cup nuts 1/2 cup M&amp;M&#39;s or favorite candy topping Instructions: Insert lollipop sticks into core of apples. Heat caramel until it becomes liquid. (Can use stove top or microwave). Roll out caramel in between 2 pieces of plastic wrap to flatten. Cut caramel into long strips, about 4 inches long, to fit around apple. Wrap caramel around apple. Stand upright on waxed paper and let set for 15 to 20 minutes. Melt dark, white or milk chocolate. Pour melted chocolate into a metal bowl. Dip apples into chocolate. Sprinkle chocolate covered apple with nuts, M&amp;M&#39;s or your favorite topping. You can also add stripes of dark, white or milk chocolate around the apple. Place decorated apples onto wax paper, standing upright. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage]&quot; 46325,&quot;Pump-Up-the-Jam Cocktail Weenies 14 hot dogs with about 40 calories and 1 gram of fat or less each 3/4 cup very finely chopped yellow onion<br> 1 cup chili sauce (the kind found by the ketchup) 3/4 cup low-sugar grape preserves 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard Instructions: Cut each hot dog into thirds, leaving you with cocktail-sized franks. Place in the crock pot. Add onion to the crock pot as well. In a bowl, combine chili sauce, preserves, and mustard; mix well. Add to the crock pot and gently mix to coat.

Let cool, then stir in the apple and lemon juices. Cut the backbone out of each chicken using kitchen shears; discard. Trim off any remaining ribs. Place the chickens breast-side up, then firmly press down with your hands to flatten. Trim off any excess skin. Transfer the chickens to a large pot, laying them flat (or use a two-gallon resealable plastic bag). Add the brine, thyme, garlic and 2 cups cold water. (If the chickens are not covered, add 1 to 2 more cups water.) Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Place a drip pan under the grill grates. Preheat the grill to medium and prepare for indirect cooking: On a gas grill, turn off half the burners; on a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side. Meanwhile, soak the applewood chips in water, 30 minutes; drain. Remove the chickens from the brine and pat dry. Season on both sides with the paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. When the grill registers 375 degrees F, add the wood chips: On a gas grill, fill a smoke box with half the chips and use according to the manufacturers&#39; instructions; on a charcoal grill, sprinkle half the chips over the coals. Place the chickens breast-side up on the cooler side of the grill, making sure they lie flat. Cover the grill and cook 1 hour, then add the remaining wood chips (if using charcoal, add more coals at this point or as needed so the temperature stays between 325 degrees F and 375 degrees F). Continue grilling until a thermometer inserted into the thighs and breasts registers 165 degrees F and the skin is browned and crisp, 1 to 1 1/2 more hours. Transfer the chickens to a cutting board and let rest at least 15 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 46327,&quot;Sweet Potato Chips With Black Olive Tapenade 2 medium sweet potatoes, unpeeled 1/4 cup olive oil, divided 1 cup pitted black olives 3 scallions 1/4 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained (4-6 pieces) Nonstick cooking spray Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400-degrees F and spray two large baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray. Thinly slice* sweet potatoes and lay out pieces in a single layer on the sheets. Using a silicone brush, coat each slice of sweet potato with olive oil (you&#39;ll use about 1 tablespoon).

Return the pan to the stove and carefully ignite the alcohol and shake the pan until the flames die down, about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and cool completely. Place the softened ice cream into a large bowl. With a wooden spoon, mix in the cooled banana mixture. To assemble: Line 1 cup molds with plastic wrap. Spread 3/4 cup of the ice cream over the bottom and sides of the molds. Spoon 1/4 cup of the chocolate mousse in the center of the mold. Fill the mold with the remaining ice cream. Wrap the molds in plastic wrap and freeze until firm. For the garnish: In a saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Cook the sugar mixture for 1 minute. Add the bananas and continue to cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. To serve, drizzle each plate with the chocolate sauce. Unmold the bombes and place in the center of each plate. Spoon the banana mixture over each bombe and serve immediately. 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br> Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan, over medium heat, and bring to a simmer. Cook until the chocolate melts completely, whisking occasionally. Remove from the heat, pour into a glass bowl and cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled.

If you like things spicier, put everything through a meat grinder, or a blender, and grind it up. Keep in the refrigerator until ready to serve. For the refried beans: Heat the lard in a heavy frying pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until softened and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and chipotle pepper and continue sauteing for 1 minute.<br> Add a ladle of cooked beans and, using a masher, start mashing the beans. Once the first spoonful of beans has been mashed completely, keep adding more beans and repeating the process. The unique taste of refried beans occurs as a result of slowly frying the starches inside the beans in the lard, so you want to add the beans a little bit at a time, to make sure they all get good and fried.<br> Once all the beans have been mashed, add a little bean liquid or water, until you get the texture that you want. Keep it a bit looser than you eventually want, as they will continue to firm up as they cool off the heat. Season with salt and pepper.

For the caramel: Pour the sugar into a medium-size, heavy-bottomed frying pan and place over medium-high heat. Make a dry caramel by letting the sugar cook until evenly dark golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remember, the caramel will continue to cook in the oven, when baking the custard, so do not make it too dark or it will taste bitter. Occasionally stir the sugar with a wooden spoon to remove any lumps. When the caramel has reached the proper color, add water (it may splatter) to keep it from becoming too hard. Mix in the water and remove the caramel from the heat. Carefully pour the hot caramel into the bottom of a 2-quart mold. It may be necessary to tilt the mold from side to side so that the caramel completely covers the bottom. For the custard: Pour the milk and 1/2 cup of the sugar into a non-reactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan. While the milk is heating over medium-high heat, use a sharp paring knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the bean with the knife. Place the skin and seeds in the heating milk. Scald the milk mixture by heating it until bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan. Remove from heat. Place the remaining sugar, the whole eggs, and egg yolks in a large mixing bowl and whisk until well incorporated. When you add sugar to eggs (especially to egg yolks), it is important to create an emulsion quickly or else a chemical reaction that produces heat will occur. If you do not whisk immediately, this heat will cook the egg yolks and cause lumps in the custard. Continue to whisk while slowly pouring the hot milk into the egg mixture and whisking until the mixture is smooth and homogenous in color. Try not to create air bubbles on the surface of the custard when you whisk, as these can form a crust on the baked custard. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the vanilla bean pieces and any overcooked eggs. Sprinkle the cranberries into the bottom of the mold. Then, pour the milk mixture into the mold and place in a roasting pan in the oven. Traditionally, custard is baked in a hot water bath to insulate it from the direct heat of the oven and to keep the eggs from cooking too fast, which would cause them to separate. Use hot water from the tap and pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach halfway up the side of the mold. When baked correctly, the custard should tremble slightly when gently shaken. In a conventional oven, this should take about 1 hour. If you detect any liquid under the skin, the custard is underbaked. Put it back in the oven and shake it every 5 minutes until it is ready. If the custard begins to bubble during baking, reduce the oven temperature 25 degrees F (14 degrees C). Remove the mold from the oven and the water bath and place on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving; it will finish setting in the refrigerator. Let the water bath cool before removing it from the oven. To unmold the creme caramel: Carefully run a sharp paring knife around the inside of the mold to loosen the custard. Invert a flat plate over the creme caramel. Place 1 hand on either side, grasping both plate and mold, and flip them both so that the mold is on top. Gently lift off the mold. You may need to tap the bottom of the mold to release the custard. Sometimes I like to serve this dessert with whipped cream. Creme caramel will keep in the refrigerator, well wrapped in plastic wrap, for a couple of days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 46345,&quot;Blackberry-Gin Fizz Floats 1 pint blackberries 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh mint 8 ounces gin 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 1 24-ounce bottle ginger ale 1 pint vanilla ice cream or blackberry sorbet Instructions: Heat the blackberries, sugar and 1 tablespoon water in a small pot over medium heat, smashing the berries with a potato masher, until thick, about 5 minutes.

Let macerate for 10 minutes to get the juices running, and then use your hands to crush the tomatoes. Place the tomatoes in a fine mesh strainer set over a saucepot. Use a rubber spatula to press all the liquid out of the tomatoes. Discard the solids and save all the sweet juice. Set the pot over medium heat and add the honey and garlic. Simmer for 10 minutes or so until you are left with about 1/2 cup worth of tomato juice. Turn the heat off and add in the Dijon mustard. Then whisk in the olive oil to make an emulsification and season with salt and pepper. For the salad: In a large bowl, add the greens and basil leaves. Pour over some of the vinaigrette to lightly coat the greens and gently toss.

Gently place the ribs and any accumulated juices in the pot. Cover and cook in the oven until fork-tender, about 1? hours. Transfer the pot to the stovetop, uncover and cook over medium heat, spooning the sauce over the ribs occasionally so they don&#39;t dry out, until the sauce is very thick and glazes the ribs, 25 to 30 minutes more. Meanwhile, finely chop the scallion greens. Mix half of them together with the jalapeno, lime zest and sesame seeds in a small bowl. (Reserve the remaining greens for another use.)

Lay the eggplant slices on the rack, generously salting each slice (about 1/4 teaspoon per slice). Place another baking sheet on top of the eggplant and weigh it down with a few cans. Let them sit 30 minutes. Flip the eggplant slices, sprinkle with more salt, weigh down again and let them sit for another 30 minutes. (This draws out the bitter juices.) Meanwhile, toast the walnuts. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the walnuts on a small baking sheet and pop into the oven until the walnuts give off their nutty aroma and deepen in color, about 5 minutes. When they are cool enough to touch, chop them finely. Make the ricotta filling: Push the ricotta through a sieve into a medium bowl. This gives the cheese a light, airy texture. Add the toasted walnuts, garlic, mint, date, half the lemon juice, a pinch of salt and a swirl of olive oil. Stir together, taste for seasoning and then set aside. Rinse the eggplant slices well and pat them dry. Warm a grill pan over moderately-high heat. Brush the eggplant slices with olive oil on one side; place the oiled-side down on the hot griddle and brush the other side. Cook until browned, about 2 minutes, then flip and cook another 2 minutes. To assemble the rolls, place a couple of tablespoons of filling at one of end of a slice of eggplant. Roll and place on a plate seam-side down. Top the eggplant rolls with the remaining lemon juice, a swirl of extra-virgin olive oil and the reserved mint leaves, torn over the dish. Serve hot or at warm temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</li></ol><p>&quot; 46352,&quot;Harvest Rice 1 container Minute?

(The heat coming from a dying charcoal grill or a gas grill cooling down will also work well.) Halve each graham cracker sheet crosswise into 2 squares. Dollop about 1 teaspoon of the jam on one half and top with 4 raspberries. Dollop about 1 teaspoon of the lemon curd on the other half. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Take the graham cracker squares and chocolate to your grill (as the marshmallows toast they will become soft and start to droop off the skewer). Working with a few at a time, skewer a marshmallow on a long fork or metal skewer and hold over the heat about 2 inches above the grates. Toast, turning occasionally, until the marshmallow puffs and turns golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Place the marshmallow on top of the graham square with the fresh raspberries and gently press the graham half with the lemon curd on top of the marshmallow. Pull the skewer out the marshmallow while pressing down so it is sandwiched between the lemon and raspberry halves, and squeeze the curd and jam toward the edge of the graham. Enjoy immediately while warm and gooey.

Oil the rump steak and then place into the preheated pan. Cook for about 2 minutes on the first side, and then flip and finish cooking the second side, about 2 minutes more. This will yield a steak that is on the rare side; cook 1 to 2 minutes longer, per side, for a more well-done piece. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. For the Sauce Bearnaise, put the shallot, tarragon stalks, 1 tablespoon of the chopped tarragon and the chervil, if using, and the vinegar, wine, and peppercorns in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and boil until reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Don&#39;t move from the stove; this doesn&#39;t take long. Press the reduced liquid through a regular or tea strainer and leave to cool. Put egg yolks and water in the top of a double boiler. Set over the bottom, in which water has come to a simmer. Add the reduced and strained liquid and whisk well. Keep whisking as you add the butter, cube by cube, until it is all absorbed.

Combine the brown sugar, paprika, coriander, mustard powder, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl. Reserve 1/2 teaspoon of the spice mixture for the syrup. Halve each chicken breast crosswise. Lightly pound the thicker pieces between 2 pieces of plastic wrap with the flat side of a meat mallet or heavy skillet so that they are the same thickness as the other pieces. Toss the chicken with the vegetable oil, then rub all over with the spice mixture. Generously brush the waffle iron with vegetable oil. Put a larger chicken piece in the center of each back quadrant of the waffle iron and a smaller piece in each of the front quadrants. Press the lid down to flatten the chicken and cook, pressing on the lid periodically, until the chicken is just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter and repeat with the remaining chicken. Meanwhile, combine the maple syrup, vinegar and the reserved 1/2 teaspoon spice mixture in a small saucepan over high heat. Cook until bubbling and thick, about 5 minutes. Drizzle over the chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46402,&quot;Roasted Chicken with Salad and Dijon Vinaigrette 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves Zest of 1 lemon 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons finely minced shallots 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 heads Bibb lettuce, interior lighter leaves only (about 6 cups; reserve the outer leaves for another use) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Crusty bread, for serving Instructions: For the chicken: Combine the Dijon mustard, olive oil, rosemary, thyme and lemon zest in a large bowl. Add the chicken and coat well with the mustard paste. Sprinkle the chicken from high above with salt and pepper (to ensure even distribution). Refrigerate for 30 minutes and up to 4 hours.

Fill a taco shell with ice cream almost to the top, then squeeze the shell a bit to compress the ice cream and push it even with the rim of the shell. Put the filled shell back in the freezer, then continue with the remaining taco shells and ice cream, refilling the piping bag as needed. Freeze until the ice cream is solid again, about 30 minutes. Melt the chocolate and 1/2 cup of the cream in a double boiler. Stir until smooth and shiny. If it is too thick (depending on the chocolate brand), add a bit more cream--the chocolate mixture should cling to the taco when dipped, but not run right off. Dip the top of each taco in the chocolate. Fill in any empty spots by spooning on additional chocolate and spreading it. Let any excess drip off, then roll each in the chopped pepitas while the chocolate is still setting.

Sprinkle the chops with salt and pepper. Set up the dredging station: Get 3 large bowls or plates in a row, with the last one closest to your stove. Place a plate next to the last bowl. In the first bowl, add the flour. In the middle bowl, add the eggs with a splash of water. In the last bowl, add the breadcrumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, dried sage, cardamom, Hungarian paprika, salt, black pepper, chili powder and lemon zest. Stir with a fork. Dredge the chops: First, take each seasoned chop and dredge in the flour, shaking off any excess flour. Dip each in the egg, and then press each into the breading mixture, making sure to completely cover both sides. Remove each to the resting plate. Fry the chops: In a large pan over medium-high heat, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook the chops until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and set aside. To keep warm, cover gently with aluminum foil and do not seal (or place in a warm oven anywhere from 100 to 150 degrees F, uncovered). For the gravy base: In the same pan on medium heat, add more oil if needed. Add the carrots, celery, half the onions, thyme, bay leaf, a pinch of salt and a grind or two of black pepper. Cook while stirring until everything is tender and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Raise the heat and add the wine, using a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. When the wine has reduced by about half, add the beef broth. Bring to a simmer and reduce the sauce by half, about 10 minutes. Pour the sauce through a sieve into a bowl, pressing down to get the most liquid out of the solids. Set aside. Finish the mushroom gravy: Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel. Over medium heat, add the butter and melt, but don&#39;t brown it. If the heat is too high, lower it. Then add the remaining chopped onions, the mushrooms, a pinch of salt and a grind or two of pepper. Cook while stirring until tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle over the flour and stir while cooking a few more minutes until the veggies soak up the flour. Add the reserved sauce base back to the pan and bring to a simmer. Cook while stirring until thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve poured over the cooked chops. Serve with Sunny&#39;s Lemon-Thyme Spaetzle. For the batter: In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, thyme, salt, black pepper, ground mustard, cayenne pepper, nutmeg and lemon zest. Gradually whisk in the flour to make a thick, tight batter. Add more flour by the spoonful until the proper texture is met (this should feel like it won&#39;t drip through a colander whole, but can be pressed through and remain stringy, not doughy). Boil the spaetzle: Fill a double boiler halfway with water and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and place a colander over the pot. Add a heaping cup of spaetzle batter at a time to the colander and, with a rubber spatula, press the batter through the holes into the boiling water. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the colander between pressings and stir the spaetzle into the water so the next group of batter doesn&#39;t stick to the one before it. The spaetzle is cooked when it floats to the top. Remove with a fine mesh sieve and strain to remove as much water as possible (shake it!). Pan fry the spaetzle: In a large pan on medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Add the butter to the remaining bacon fat in the pan and allow it to melt. Then add the boiled spaetzle to the pan to saute. Water and oil can produce splattering, be careful! Allow the spaetzle to build a golden crust, and then toss and cook until it&#39;s mostly golden all over, but still tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan and toss. Sprinkle with lemon juice, taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46405,&quot;Spicy Chipotle, Portobello, and Hominy Chowder 1 1/2 pounds large portobellos, stems and black gills removed 3/4 cup kosher salt 3/4 cup sugar 1 1/2 quarts water 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound slice yellow onion 2 stemmed and seeded chopped chipotles 1 tablespoon finely slivered garlic 2 cups husked and quartered fresh tomatillos 1/2 teaspoon whole fennel 1/2 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 cups diced and seeded tomatoes 7 cups vegetable stock 1 1/2 cups cooked white hominy Salt and pepper Instructions: Rinse the mushrooms and set aside. In a saucepan, add the salt and sugar to the water, and simmer over moderate heat until salt and sugar are dissolved. Remove from heat, cool to room temperature, and add mushrooms to brine. Allow to marinate for at least 2 hours. Remove mushrooms from brine and gently press between towels to remove excess moisture. On a bbq or stovetop smoker over moderately low heat, gently smoke mushrooms until just cooked through. Set aside to add to finished chowder. To make chowder, heat the olive oil in a deep soup pot. Add the onions, chipotles, and garlic. Saute until soft, but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatillos, fennel, cumin, coriander, oregano, cinnamon, tomatoes, and stock. Simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add the hominy to pot, and simmer to heat through. Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper. To serve, slice the smoked portobellos at an angle, and place in warm soup bowls.

Top each with a scoop of strawberry ice cream. Stand the cones in a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish filled with raw rice and transfer to the freezer. Allow to freeze solid, at least 1 hour. For the meringue: Meanwhile, place the egg whites and 1/3 cup sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until the egg whites form soft peaks. Combine the remaining sugar with 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and bring to 235 to 240 degrees F (softball stage), without stirring. Continue to beat the egg whites on medium-high speed and slowly drizzle in the hot syrup, aiming the syrup between the side of the bowl and the beaters. Continue to beat until both the bottom of the bowl and the mixture are cool, 10 to 15 minutes. (The mixture should be thick and glossy and hold firm peaks.) Beat in the salt and set aside. Remove the cones from the freezer. Working quickly, use a small offset spatula to swirl the meringue over each cone, covering the ice cream completely. Return to the rice-filled baking dish.

Pour in about 16 cups water to just cover ingredients by 1 inch. Add more water if necessary but do not fill more than two-thirds of the pot. Cover and lock the lid. Bring to pressure according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. (If the cooker has two levels of pressure, cook on the lowest.) Adjust the heat to maintain pressure, and cook for 45 minutes. Let the pressure subside by itself (natural method), or if in a rush, run cold water over the lid for a few minutes. Strain the liquid through a colander lined with layers of cheesecloth. Discard the solids. Cool uncovered and refrigerate overnight until the fat floats and solidifies. Remove the fat and save a small amount for matzo balls. Storage: Refrigerate up to 4 days. Important to bring to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute before using. Freeze up to 6 months. For the matzo balls: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the seltzer, schmaltz, salt, pepper and eggs. Then in a separate bowl, add the baking soda to the matzo meal and mix together. Next, add the matzo meal mixture into the egg mixture while stirring to a loose consistency. It will look watery, like a loose porridge. If it becomes too thick, either don&#39;t add the full amount of matzo meal or add a bit more seltzer. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Fill a large pot with water and salt and bring to a simmer. With wet hands, roll out balls and gently drop to the water. Simmer until tender, light and fluffy in the center, 45 to 60 minutes. (To test centers, insert a toothpick, which should slide easily all the way through.) Allow to cool in the water undisturbed. Refrigerate in the cooking liquid or transfer to chicken soup.

Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and toss carefully with your fingers to coat each cube of butter with the flour. Pulse 12 to 15 times, or until the butter is the size of peas. With the motor running, add the ice water all at once through the feed tube. Keep hitting the pulse button just until the dough comes together. Turn onto a well-floured board, cut in half and form into two disks. Wrap and refrigerate for about 1 hour. (Wrap the second dough well and freeze, if not using.) For the filling, place 3 tablespoons of water in a small bowl, whisk in the cornstarch and set aside. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the rhubarb, raspberries, granulated sugar, orange zest and orange juice. Cook over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes, until some of the juices are released. Stir in the cornstarch, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, until cool. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Roll the pastry into an 11- to 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface and transfer to the prepared pan. Pile the raspberry rhubarb mixture onto the pastry, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border all around. Fold the border up over the filling, pleating if necessary and pressing lightly. Brush the pastry with egg wash, sprinkle just the pastry with turbinado sugar and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the pastry is browned and the filling is thickened.

Add the chicken quarters to the mixture and let brine, refrigerated, for at least 2 hours. Set a wire rack on a baking sheet. Remove the chicken from the brine, pat dry with paper towels and then set on the wire rack for at least 1 hour at room temperature, though it is ideal to do this step overnight in the refrigerator. (If you decide to refrigerate it overnight, be sure to bring the chicken to room temperature for about an hour before grilling.) Heat a grill to medium heat (about 350 degrees F). In a large bowl, toss the chicken with the cornstarch and vegetable oil. Grill the chicken skin-side down for 15 minutes, keeping an eye on it to make sure the skin doesn&#39;t burn.

Cut off the top of the artichoke about 1-inch and remove the stem so that the bottom is flat. Wash the artichoke in cold water and rub all cut surfaces with some of the fresh lemon juice and pulp. (A round slice of lemon may be tied to the bottom of the artichoke to prevent oxidation of the base.) Bring water to a boil, add the salt and the remaining pieces of the lemon, rind and all, and place the artichokes base down. Cover the pot and bring the water to the boil again before lowering the heat to a simmer. Cook the artichoke at a steady simmer for 35 to 45 minutes or until a leaf pulls easily free from the center. Allow to cool for 10 minutes in the water, remove cool to room temperature. When cool some of the cooking juices may be drizzled over the top of the artichokes. In a stainless steel bowl combine the vinegar, mustard, herbs, salt and pepper and whisk to emulsify. Add the oil in a small steady stream until all the oil has been incorporated and the dressing has achieved a silky, smooth texture. The dressing may be stored, covered, for up to two weeks in the refrigerator, but should be brought to room temperature before using.

Cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes, stirring almost constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens like heavy cream. (Don\u2019t allow it to boil!) Cook for 30 seconds, scraping the bottom of the pan with the spoon. The mixture should coat the spoon and if you run your finger down the back of the spoon, it will leave a clear trail. Immediately, pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into the chocolate mixture and stir to combine. Cover and chill completely in the fridge or over a bowl of ice water. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Mix in the Oreos in the last few minutes. Transfer to a container or loaf pan, cover and freeze. Soften slightly, scoop and serve frozen. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46476,&quot;Spinach Alfredo Pasta Bake 1 pound short pasta, such as penne or gemelli 1 cup ricotta cheese<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br> Zest of 1 lemon<br> 7 tablespoons butter<br> One 10-ounce container mushrooms, sliced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 8-ounce bag fresh spinach 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 cup dry white wine or low-sodium vegetable broth<br> 1 cup half-and-half<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> Low-sodium vegetable broth, as needed, for thinning<br> 1 cup grated Parmesan<br> 3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the pasta in the boiling water, draining it about 2 minutes before the time on the package. It should still be a bit firm. Rinse it in cold water to stop the cooking process and set aside. Mix the ricotta with the parsley and lemon zest in a small bowl and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter. In a large deep skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the mushrooms have given up their liquid, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the spinach and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the spinach has wilted. Remove the vegetables and set aside, leaving any liquid in the skillet. Add 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Pour in the wine and let it bubble up and reduce for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Add the half-and-half and cream, season with salt and pepper and cook, whisking, until it&#39;s all combined. If it gets too thick as it cooks, you can thin it with a little vegetable broth. When the sauce looks good, remove it from the heat and stir in 3/4 cup of the Parmesan. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small pan. Remove from the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. In the buttered baking dish, stir together the pasta, vegetables and sauce. (Add a splash of broth if needed). Add spoonfuls of the ricotta mixture, pushing them a bit into the pasta. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the top of the pasta. Cover and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and cook until the top is brown and the mixture is bubbling, about 20 minutes more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti]</p><p>&quot; 46477,&quot;Conch Tempura Roll with Dirty Fried Rice and Goat Pepper Aioli 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon ginger, minced 1 onion, chopped 1 tablespoon Bahamian thyme 1 teaspoon paprika 2 goat peppers, stemmed and chopped, (may substitute Thai birds) 1/2 pound ground pork 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 cup cooked pigeon peas (may substitute black beans) 3 cups cooked long grain rice Salt and pepper 4 sheets nori 8 large sheets conch, pounded thin, and scored on one side Canola oil, for frying 2 cups rice flour 1 cup ginger beer 4 cups club soda Goat Pepper Aioli, recipe follows 2 goat peppers, stemmed and chopped, may substitute Thai birds 1 tablespoon garlic, minced 1 tablespoon Creole mustard, may substitute Pommery 1 lime, juiced 1 cup grape seed oil Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of grapeseed oil, and swirl to coat the pan. When the oil shimmers, add the garlic, ginger, and onions and saute, stirring occasionally, until soft and browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the thyme, paprika, and goat peppers, and stir to mix. Mix in the pork, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, then add the soy sauce and saute for another 2 minutes. Add the peas, and rice and toss thoroughly until heated through. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper, and let cool. Arrange a sheet of the nori, shiny side down, on a rolling mat. Have a small bowl of water handy. Place the scored side of the conch on the bottom half of the nori sheet, and season with salt and pepper. Fill with the rice, and then roll. Wet the edge, and press the mat to seal. Repeat with the remaining nori, conch, and rice. Allow the maki to rest, seam side down, for 2 minutes. Fill a fryer or heavy medium pot 1/3 full with the oil and heat over high heat to 425 degrees. Place the flour in a medium bowl and slowly whisk in the ginger beer. Pour in enough club soda so that the mixture resembles a light pancake batter. Dip the rolls in the batter and fry all at once, turning as necessary, until golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the rolls with a mesh spoon and drain on paper towels. Season, to taste, with the salt and pepper. With a sharp knife, slice each roll in 1/2. Cut 1 half straight across, and cut the other half diagonally into 2 pieces. With a spoon, drizzle the aioli onto the plates in a zigzag pattern, and arrange the rolls over, and serve. In a food processor, combine the peppers, garlic, and mustard, and process. With the machine running, add the oil slowly, until the mixture emulsifies. Add the oil more quickly, until the mixture is mayonnaise-like. Add the lime juice, and adjust the seasons with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 46478,&quot;Pineapple Refresher 1 (6-ounce) can pineapple juice 1 cup grapefruit-flavored soda (recommended: Fresca) 3 shots vodka 2 tablespoons frozen limeade concentrate (recommended: Minute Maid) Ice cubes Lime wheels/lime rind or pineapple wedge, for garnish Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a blender.

Sprinkle the duck on both sides with salt. Place skin-side down in a medium skillet and then raise the heat to medium. As the pan heats, the fat will render. Cook until the skin is a deep golden brown, about 12 minutes, spooning off some of the fat as it cooks, and reserving a tablespoon or so. Flip the duck and cook until an instant read thermometer registers between 128 and 132 degrees F for medium rare, another 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to rest. While the duck is cooking, trim the thickest stems from the purslane and discard. Tear the purslane into 3- to 4-inch pieces. Chill until ready to serve. Halve the grapes and set aside.<br> When the duck is done, remove all of the fat from the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. (If there are little brown bits stuck to the pan, just wipe or scrape them out.) Return 2 teaspoons of duck fat to the pan. Add the grapes and stir for about 2 minutes just to warm them. Add the vinegar, and stir for about a minute, scraping the bottom of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Pour the grape mixture over the purslane and toss. Season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper. Divide the salad among four plates. Thinly slice the duck breast and place 4 or 5 slices, overlapping slightly, alongside each salad.

Marinate refrigerated for one hour. For the soup: In a heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic ginger root and jalapeno. Saute for two minutes, stirring. Add the split peas, coriander, cumin, celery seed, cinnamon and clove. Mix well. Add the chicken stock, stir again, and bring to a boil. Turn heat down to low and simmer slowly, partially covered, for about one hour, or until split peas are just soft. You may need to add more chicken stock if the peas become too thick and dry. While the soup is cooking, prepare the relish, toss all six ingredients together in a bowl. Season to taste. When the soup is ready, butterfly the marinated shrimp, removing the veins. Place in a heavy saute pan over medium high heat. Add two tablespoons of vegetable oil, swirling around the pan. Add the shrimp, cut side down, and saute for 2-3 minutes, or until just cooked. Turn the shrimp over, and cook the spiced side for 1 minute. Remove from pan. With a wooden spoon, crush a few of the soft peas in the soup against the side of the pot. Stir well. If the soup looks too thick, add a little chicken stock. Season to taste. Ladle hot soup into four wide soup bowls. Mix in most of the tomato relish, saving about 1/4 cup. Place three shrimp in the center of each bowl. Divide the remaining tomato relish among four bowls, placing it in the center of the shrimp. Top that with a few fresh cilantro leaves.

Put the onions, carrots, parsnips, and garlic into the bottom of a large roasting pan. Place the roast, rib side down, on top of the vegetables. In a small bowl mash together the horseradish, garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil to make a paste. Smear the paste generously over the entire roast and drizzle with some extra oil. Roast for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or approximately 20 minutes per pound for medium-rare. Check the internal temperature of the roast in several places with an instant-read thermometer, it should register 125 degrees F. for medium rare. Remove the beef to a carving board, cover it with foil, and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. Note: the internal temperature of the meat will continue to rise about 10 degrees. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Pour the pan juices into a fat separator and set aside to allow the fat and beef juices to separate. Use the juices to serve with the meat and save the fat for Yorkshire pudding. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 46518,&quot;Panko Fried Pork Chops with Texas Toast Vegetable oil, for frying Four 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick bone-in pork chops (12 ounces to 1 pound)<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 cup whole buttermilk<br> 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs<br> 2 teaspoons Miss Brown&#39;s House Seasoning, recipe follows 8 slices Texas toast, buttered and griddled<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon sweet paprika<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Pour the oil to a depth of 1 inch in a large cast-iron skillet with high sides.

F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil; set aside. Slice the challah into eight 3/4- to 1-inch-thick pieces. Whisk the eggs and half-and-half in a large shallow dish, then whisk in the granulated sugar, salt and vanilla until the sugar is dissolved and the custard is smooth. Put the confectioners\u2019 sugar in a fine-mesh strainer. Add 4 slices of bread to the custard and let soak, turning once, until saturated but not falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the soaked bread, letting the excess custard drip off, then immediately dust with some of the confectioners\u2019 sugar. Cook until the bottom of the bread is golden, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and dust with more confectioners\u2019 sugar. Continue to cook, flipping twice more and dusting with more confectioners\u2019 sugar each time, until both sides are browned and caramelized, about 5 more minutes; add 1/2 tablespoon more butter when the skillet is dry. Transfer to the baking sheet. Add 1 more tablespoon butter to the skillet and repeat with the remaining bread, custard and confectioners\u2019 sugar; add 1/2 tablespoon more butter to the skillet when needed. Transfer the baking sheet with all the French toast to the oven and bake until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wipe out the skillet and add 4 tablespoons butter; increase the heat to medium high. Add the apples and cardamom and cook, stirring, until softened and lightly browned in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the honey, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons water and continue to cook until the sauce has thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the brandy and carefully tilt the pan or use a long lighter to ignite. Cook until the apples are glazed and soft but not falling apart, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and swirl to melt and slightly thicken the sauce. Divide the French toast among plates. Spoon the apples and sauce on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 46521,&quot;Garlic Green Beans 2 pounds green beans, stems removed 1 head roasted garlic 2 ounces olive oil 1/4 cup water Salt and pepper Instructions: In a casserole dish with a lid, add green beans, garlic, olive oil, water and salt and pepper.

Add the butter and allow it to melt but not completely. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until the yolks and whites are just blended. Pour the mixture into the pan but don&#39;t mix it. Allow the eggs to warm slowly over low heat without stirring them. This may take 3 to 5 minutes, so be patient! As soon as the eggs start to cook on the bottom, use a rubber spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan and fold the cooked eggs over the uncooked eggs. Once the eggs start to look a little custardy, stir them rapidly with the spatula until they are the texture of very soft custard. Remove the pan from the heat before the eggs are fully cooked, as they will continue to cook in the warm pan. Immediately, stir the truffle butter into the eggs. This will stop the cooking. Cut the slices of toast in half diagonally and place them on 3 dinner plates. Spoon the scrambled eggs over the toasts and garnish with minced chives. Sprinkle with salt and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46523,&quot;Spicy Shrimp and Mushroom Casserole 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 cups (about 8 ounces) white button mushrooms, thinly sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 poblano chiles, charred, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 2-inch by 1/4-inch strips 1 cup fresh, or frozen and thawed, corn kernels 1 clove garlic, minced 3/4 cup flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound large shrimp, deveined, tails intact 1/4 cup dry white wine 1/4 cup vegetable stock Instructions: In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over high heat. Add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the juices have evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add the poblano strips, corn and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes to blend flavors. For the shrimp: Mix together the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Dredge the shrimp in the seasoned flour. In a medium skillet, melt the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to the mushroom mixture. Add the wine and vegetable stock to the skillet and increase the heat to high, scraping up the brown bits that stick to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir until thickened. Pour the sauce over the shrimp and mushroom mixture and stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer to a serving dish and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 46524,&quot;Lizzie&#39;s Chicken and Dumplings One 5-pound hen or chicken (makes about 4-pounds cooked, after bones and skin removed) 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon pepper 2 cups unsifted all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Salt and pepper Instructions: For the chicken: Put the hen, breast side down, in an 8-quart stockpot and add water to within 2-inches of the top of the pot; this will vary according to the size of your pot, but the hen should float clear of the bottom of the pot and be covered completely. Add the salt and pepper. Bring the water to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and cook for 2 hours, or until the chicken is tender and the drumstick joint twists easily. Allow the chicken and broth to cool slightly, and then remove the hen to a colander. Strain the broth into a very large bowl. Cover the broth and place in in the refrigerator. When the fat solidifies on the top of the broth, remove and discard it. Remove the chicken from the bones and cut or shred the meat by hand into small pieces. Set aside 2 cups of the broth and refrigerate or freeze the rest for another use. (Leftover broth may also be frozen in individual containers to be used another time.) For the dumplings: Heat 2 quarts of the defatted chicken broth in a 3-quart saucepan. While it heats, put the flour in a medium bowl. Dissolve 1 teaspoon salt in 3/4 cup water and stir the mixture into the flour to make a stiff dough. Turn the dough out onto a heavily floured surface and knead until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Heavily flour a rolling pin and roll out the dough very thin (you can also divide the dough into 4 portions and roll each portion separately, which will give you thinner dumplings). With a very sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into 2 by 4-inch strips. When the broth reaches a rolling boil, add some of the strips of dough. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot and bring back to a boil. Continue to add the dough strips in batches, always raising the heat to bring the broth back to a rolling boil before dropping in more dough strips and reducing the heat to simmer before covering the pot again. Sprinkle in the salt and pepper to taste. Add the 2 cups of cooked chicken, heat and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46525,&quot;Creamed Corn 6 ears corn 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 shallot, minced<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, or more as needed<br> 1/4 cup chive-onion cream cheese<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives<br> Instructions: Cut the kernels off the corn and place in a bowl. Use the back of a knife or a butter knife to \milk\ the cobs. (This means applying pressure to remove any of the juice left from the kernels being cut off.) Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook until softened and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the corn and any liquid scraped from the cobs. Cook until the kernels are bright yellow, shiny and softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Stir in the cream cheese until it is melted and combined into the corn, another 2 to 3 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Transfer the corn to a serving dish and sprinkle with the chives. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46526,&quot;Creamy Stovetop Bacon Mac and Cheese Kosher salt 1 pound elbow macaroni<br> 6 strips thick-cut smoked bacon, cut in 1/4-inch pieces 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 4 cups hot whole milk Freshly cracked black pepper 1 teaspoon dry mustard, or more as needed<br> 8 ounces sharp Cheddar, shredded (2 cups) 8 ounces Muenster cheese, shredded (2 cups)<br> 1 tablespoon hot sauce<br> Instructions: In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente; drain. Set an extra-large skillet, or a large heavy saucepan, over medium-low heat and cook the bacon until crispy and the fat renders out, 10 to 12 minutes. Set the bacon aside, reserving the fat to build your sauce. At this point you should have about 1/4 cup of reserved fat. If needed, add some olive oil or butter to make sure you have a 1/4 cup of fat in the pan. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until the paste bubbles a bit, about 2 minutes (make sure it doesn&#39;t brown). Continuing to whisk, add 3 cups of the hot milk and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir in the dry mustard, and then gradually add the Cheddar and Muenster cheeses, stirring constantly until all of the cheese has melted into the sauce. Stir in the hot sauce and the remaining 1 cup milk. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and stir to coat. Stir in the crispy bacon and season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 46527,&quot;cl Chicken Skewers 2 tablespoons paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon allspice 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into quarters 4 Fresno peppers 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided 3 tablespoons goat cheese 3 tablespoons sour cream 1/2 teaspoon sriracha sauce 2 ounces Manchego cheese, cubed 1 sprig fresh mint, chopped 4 large flour tortillas 1 lime, halved Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. In a large bowl, stir together the paprika, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, garlic, lemon juice, and oil for the marinade to make a paste. Toss the chicken thighs in the paste and rub all over to coat. Let the chicken marinate in the bowl for 15 minutes. Rub the Fresno peppers with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and grill them on all sides until they&#39;re lightly charred on all sides, about 2 minutes on each side. Let the peppers cool, then slice off the tops and cut the peppers into bite-size pieces. Remove the chicken from the marinade, stick 4 pieces onto each soaked skewer and grill over high heat until cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes on each side. Mix the goat cheese, sour cream, and sriracha sauce together. Set aside. In a bowl toss the cubed Manchego cheese and mint together. Grill the tortillas for a few seconds on each side, to soften and warm them. Lay a tortilla on each plate. Slather the sour cream mixture on top of the tortillas. Lay the chicken skewers on top, divide the peppers over among the tortillas then divide the cubed cheese and mint over top. Squeeze a little fresh lime juice over each one and serve. To eat, lift the tortilla and wrap it around the skewer.

Using the dough hook on low speed, stir in the warm water and 2 tablespoons of the oil, mixing until the flour is completely moistened. Let stand 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt and knead on medium speed for 5 minutes. (The dough will tighten up, then begin to relax. After 5 minutes, it will be very wet and stick to the bottom of the mixer but not the sides.)\u202f Rub 2 tablespoons oil around the bottom and sides of a mixing bowl large enough to hold at least double the volume of dough. Using a scraper or spatula, transfer the dough to the bowl, flipping once to coat completely with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\u202f\u202f Pour 1/4 cup oil into an 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Use your hands to coat the bottom and sides. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and flatten it slightly with your hands. Flip the dough once and gently stretch it to fit in an even layer in the baking sheet. (The dough may not stretch to the edges at this point. If it starts to pull back, let rest 10 minutes and re-stretch, making sure to pull from the center as well as the edges to get an even thickness.) Use your fingertips to make dimples over the surface of the dough, pressing firmly without making holes.\u202f Toss together the mushrooms, squash, rosemary, 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a medium bowl. Spread the mushroom mixture on one quadrant of the dough. Top the next quadrant with the olives and sprinkle with the pancetta. Top the third quadrant with the artichoke hearts and sprinkle with the peas. Sprinkle the basil over the last quadrant and arrange the tomatoes cut-side up. Gently press the toppings into the dough so they stay in place. Let the dough rise until slightly puffy, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.\u202f\u202f Bake the focaccia, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until the top and bottom are deep golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the baking sheet, place a ball of BelGioioso Burrata in the middle of each quadrant and return to the oven to slightly warm the cheese, about 5 minutes. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with flaky salt. Use a spatula to transfer the focaccia to a cutting board or serving platter, then cut open the BelGioioso Burrata and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 46529,&quot;White House Thyme Roasted Turkey 1 gallon water 1 bunch fresh thyme 4 whole heads fresh garlic, cut in half horizontally 2 medium yellow onions, peeled and quartered 4 lemons, zest removed in large strips 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 6 fresh or dried bay leaves 1 cup kosher salt 1 cup light brown sugar Ice One 20-pound fresh turkey, neck and giblets removed, rinsed 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature 2 teaspoons fine sea salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the brine: Heat the water, thyme, garlic, onion, lemon zest, peppercorns, bay leaves, kosher salt and light brown sugar in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar and salt dissolve. Transfer the liquid to a clean 5-gallon bucket. Add enough ice to total 3 gallons of liquid and mix until incorporated. For the turkey: Add the turkey to the bucket with the brining liquid and refrigerate for at least 12 hours. When ready to roast, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Have ready a large roasting pan with a rack. Remove the turkey from the brining liquid and use paper towels to pat it as dry as possible inside and out. Rub the turkey with the butter all over, including the cavity, and sprinkle with the sea salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the thyme, garlic, onions, bay leaves and lemon zest from the brine solution. Fold the wingtips underneath the turkey. Truss the legs with kitchen twine. Place the turkey in the roasting pan, breast-side up. Fold the neck flap under. Roast the turkey for 1 hour to brown it, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and cook for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F.

Arrange in a single layer and season the meat with salt and pepper. Divide the meat into 6 portions (about 4 ounces each). Using your hands, form each portion into a ball-shape by gently tossing it from one hand to the other. Form each portion into a thin patty (about 1/4-inch). Each patty should be somewhat larger than a slice of the bread (the patty will shrink to the size of the bread when cooked). Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-heat. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 7 minutes. Transfer the onion to a bowl. Wipe out the skillet, return to the heat, and heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add 2 patties and saute, turning once, until well browned and cooked to medium, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining oil and patties. Arrange 1/6 of the onion over 1 bread slice. Place 1 cheese slice over the onion and top with a patty. Top the patty with a slice of cheese and cover with a bread slice. Spread about 2 teaspoons of butter over the outside of each slice. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 6 sandwiches. Heat the cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 2 sandwiches and cook, turning once, until lightly browned and the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and repeat with the remaining 4 sandwiches.

Leave the skewers out overnight, uncovered, to dry out. The next day, prepare an outdoor grill for medium heat. Grill the bacon, flipping as needed to ensure even cooking, until most of the fat has rendered and the bacon is charred in spots on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to absorb any excess fat. (Note: If you have a charcoal grill, cook the bacon in a grill pan. It should not be grilled over charcoal because of the risk of flare-ups.) Whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, butter, sugar, cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until combined; pour into a rimmed baking sheet. Put the skewers of bread in the buttermilk mixture to soak, turning as needed, until the bread has absorbed some of the liquid but is not falling apart, no more than 5 minutes. Spray a large piece of aluminum foil all over with cooking spray and place it on half the grill. Transfer the skewers to the foil in 1 layer, at least 1/2 inch of space between them. Grill, covered, turning the skewers a few times as needed, until the cubes of bread are golden in most places and no longer wet, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the skewers and foil from the grill, and return the bacon to the grill just until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve the grilled French toast kebabs and bacon with warm maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46536,&quot;Fried Chicken 1 quart buttermilk 1/2 cup Emeril&#39;s Original Essence, divided, recipe follows 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons sugar 1 head garlic, cloves peeled and crushed 2 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) chickens, cut into 8 pieces each 4 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper Peanut oil, for frying 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Combine the buttermilk, 1/4 cup Essence, salt, sugar, and garlic in a large nonreactive bowl. Stir to blend. Immerse the chicken in the mixture and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and for up to 24 hours. Combine the flour, the remaining 1/4 cup Essence, and the cayenne in a large doubled brown paper bag or plastic freezer bag and shake to blend. Drop the chicken, a few pieces at a time, into the flour mixture and shake thoroughly to completely coat. Remove the chicken and shake off the excess flour. Repeat the coating process with the remaining chicken pieces. Place the coated chicken on a large wire rack set over a sheet pan and let rest until ready to fry, at least 20 minutes. Heat 4 inches of oil to 300 degrees F over medium-high heat in a medium Dutch oven or heavy pot. Fry the chicken in batches, skin side down, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Turn and fry until golden brown on the second side, 8 to 10 minutes longer. Remove the chicken and drain on paper towels. (Note: An even oil temperature is the key to success; a clip-on candy/deep-fry thermometer should be kept in the pot at all times.

Cook slowly until the bacon is crispy and has rendered its fat, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pan for another use. Add the onion, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Place the clove and star anise into a small spice bag, add to the Dutch oven and stir to combine. Cook, uncovered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions caramelize, 45 to 60 minutes. Add the celery and the 3 cloves of minced garlic to the pan and continue to cook over low heat until the celery is semi-translucent, approximately 30 minutes. Remove the spice bag from the pot. Meanwhile, place a wide 4-quart saute pan, over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and once it shimmers, add the beef chuck and the pork butt and cook, stirring frequently, until the meat is well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the meat to a colander to drain. Return the pan to high heat, add 1/2 cup of the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Transfer these bits and any remaining wine to the Dutch oven along with the meat. Add another 1/2 cup of the wine, evaporated milk, beef broth, and mushrooms to the Dutch oven and stir to combine. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. Once the sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours, place the 4-quart saute pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once it shimmers, add the 2 cloves of sliced garlic and cook for 30 to 45 seconds or until fragrant. Do not allow the garlic to brown. Add the tomatoes, oregano, basil, and marjoram and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, approximately 30 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup wine, tomato paste, ketchup, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine. Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high; add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the tomato mixture to the meat mixture and stir to combine. Simmer the sauce, uncovered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, while preparing the pasta. For the pasta: Bring the water and salt to a boil over high heat. Carefully add the pasta, stirring quickly to separate. Cover and return to a boil, being careful that the water does not boil over. Once boiling again, uncover and continue to cook until slightly less than al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain in a colander. Add the pasta to the meat sauce and cook, over low heat, for another 2 to 3 minutes or until the pasta is al dente. Add the Parmesan cheese and toss to combine. Transfer pasta and sauce to a serving bowl or individual bowls and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 46549,&quot;Sharp Cheddar Cupcakes with Candied Pecan Topping and Honey Blue Cheese Frosting 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup whole milk 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) butter, softened 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 egg, beaten 2 1/2 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar Candied Pecans, recipe follows Honey Blue Cheese Frosting, recipe follows Cheddar Cheese Crisps, recipe follows 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 cups toasted pecans, finely chopped, plus 12 whole pecans 8 ounces cream cheese 1 stick butter 4 tablespoons blue cheese 2 tablespoons honey 1 cup powdered sugar 1 cup shredded Cheddar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Make sure you know the weight of the roast. Preheat oven to 275 degrees. Season roast extremely well with salt and pepper. Place in roasting pan, fatty side up, and place in oven. Cook until desired degree of doneness is reached (resist the temptation to open the oven door a lot). For rare meat, the roast should take about 20 minutes per pound. When you&#39;re within half an hour of your estimated finish time, remove the roast from the oven, and plunge a quick-read thermometer into a fleshy part of the meat near the center (don&#39;t do anywhere near a bone). We like to stop cooking the roast in the oven at 115 degrees; this is extremely rare, but the roast will continue to cook as it stands outside the oven (the temperature should go up 5 to 10 degrees). If you remove it at 120 degrees it will be rare, and at 125 degrees it will be medium-rare; we wouldn&#39;t recommend going much higher than that. Place the roast on a cutting board, uncovered, and let it rest for 15 minutes. When ready to serve, simply cut the meat away from the bone in one enormous chunk. Then, cut the \filet\ of meat into slices and serve immediately. Cut through the bones (you&#39;ll have 5), and serve them separately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 46555,&quot;Chocolate Buttercream Frosting 1 pound bittersweet chocolate 12 ounces semisweet chocolate 3/4 cup egg whites (4-5 extra-large eggs), at room temperature 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 teaspoons instant espresso powder, dissolved in 1 1/2 teaspoons water 3 tablespoons dark rum, optional Instructions: Chop the chocolates and place them in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan simmering water.

Set the skewers on a skewer holder over the fire and grill until golden brown and succulent, turning often, about 20 minutes. Or, lacking a skewer holder, place them on the grill and grill to perfection. Serve with or on a piece grill-warmed pita bread and the cacik on the side. Toss grated cucumber with a light sprinkling of salt. Leave for 30 minutes. Drain the cucumber, squeezing out all the liquid. Pound the garlic in a mortar with 1 teaspoon salt until completely mashed. Stir the garlic into the yogurt and beat with a fork until smooth. Stir in the cucumber, the dill, mint and olive oil and stir until the consistency of a thick soup. Refrigerate for an hour and serve cold.

Once cornmeal is incorporated, keep heat low and continue to whisk until mixture is slightly thickened and creamy. Stir in Parmesan, and season with pepper. (Since Parmesan is salty, add salt only if needed). Set aside in a warm place. Heat oil in a saute pan. Saute onion, garlic, carrot, zucchini, yellow squash, and eggplant, until they begin to soften. Stir in tomato paste, chopped fresh parsley, thyme, and let cook until flavors integrate, about 10 more minutes. Add olives and heat through. Season with salt and pepper, as needed.

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 48 hours. Remove the brisket from the brine and pat off excess liquid with paper towels. For the Tennessee rub: Mix the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cornstarch, paprika, chili powder, salt, cumin, onion powder, black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne and white pepper in a bowl. Rub both sides of the brisket with the Tennessee rub. Set up your smoker with 3/4 pound of hard wood (preferably hickory). Put the brisket on a wire rack. Set your smoker temperature to 190 degrees F. Smoke the brisket 8 hours. Remove the brisket from the smoker and allow it to rest for at least 45 minutes. For the barbecue sauce: Heat a stainless steel or lined 4-quart saucepan on medium heat until the pan is hot. Add the oil along with the onions, garlic and ginger. Saute for 5 minutes, then add the ketchup, mustard, brown sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire, salt and lemon juice. Simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally to keep it from burning on the bottom. You may make your barbecue sauce ahead and keep in your refrigerator for 7 days. The sauce also freezes very well. To make your sandwiches, slice and warm your Italian rolls in a toaster oven or nonstick pan. Cut a generous portion of brisket for each and place on a toasted roll. You can either top with the barbecue sauce or serve it on the side and dip your sandwich as you eat it. Repeat to make 9 more sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 46605,&quot;Tasso Shrimp and Cream on Pasta 3/4 stick butter 1 tablespoon Cajun meat seasoning 2 1/2 cups julienne tasso 3 cups heavy cream 4 dozen cleaned shrimp 1 1/2 cups sliced green onion Instructions: Melt most of the butter in skillet then add tasso and seasoning.

Add a small amount of flour (1/4 to 1/2 cup) to bind the dough and absorb the excess moisture. Knead the dough on a lightly-floured work surface. It is important not to add too much flour because the gnocchi may get heavy. Take a large piece of dough, and roll it out into thin logs, approximately 3/4-inch thick. Cut each log into 1/2-inch wide cubes. Make ridges on each gnocchi by using the back of a fork in a rolling action. The imprints will trap the sauce on the surface of the gnocchi. Continue until all the dough is used. Place the gnocchi on a tray in a single layer underneath a cloth to prevent them from drying out. The gnocchi may be set in the refrigerator or freezer, until they&#39;re needed. To cook the gnocchi: Add the gnocchi to a pot of boiling salted water for about a minute, or until they float to the surface. The make the sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the fresh sage leaves. Drain the gnocchi and add them directly to the saucepan.

Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Combine the frozen blueberries with 2 tablespoons water in a medium saucepan and heat over medium, stirring and mashing occasionally with a rubber spatula, until the blueberries have broken down and released their juices, about 10 minutes. Strain the juices through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl or measuring cup, using your rubber spatula to mash the blueberries and wring out any juices that they\u2019re still holding onto. You should have around 3 tablespoons of liquid (if it\u2019s much more than that, discard any excess or reserve it for another use). In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together the butter and cream cheese until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, then mix in the heavy cream, vanilla, salt and blueberry juice until creamy. To decorate: Shaping this cake is easiest to do when the layers are cold. So if you have the time, wrap the cake layers in plastic wrap and freeze overnight or even up to a few weeks. (If you don\u2019t have the time, it\u2019s not the end of the world, just make sure the layers are fully cooled.) Use a sharp serrated knife to level the cake layers if they\u2019re not totally flat on top and save the scraps in a large bowl. (If the cakes are frozen too solid to cut, you can let them thaw at room temp for a few minutes so they soften just slightly.) Place an 8- to 10-inch cardboard cake circle on a rotating cake wheel and add a small dollop of frosting to \u201cglue\u201d on the first layer. Add the first layer of cake, followed by a thin layer of frosting, another layer of cake, another thin layer of frosting and the third layer of cake. Use a thin knife to cut a hole down the center of the cake that\u2019s just big enough for a Barbie doll. Try not to make the hole too big so that she doesn\u2019t flop around. Shove her in! The cake will only come up to her thighs at this point but fear not, the rest will be filled in by cake scraps. Now it\u2019s time to carve the cake. Use a serrated knife to slowly carve away the cake into the shape of a skirt. Start at the top and shave it off gradually, cutting away from yourself and down the bottom, transferring your scraps to the scrap bowl. Leave about 1 1/2 inches of uncarved cake all around the top to allow room to build up the remaining skirt with your scraps. This doesn\u2019t need to be perfect AT ALL! Frosting will cover up any imperfections! Once you\u2019ve got a general skirt shape, use your hands to mush up the scraps in the bowl. The frosting and the cake\u2019s moisture should help them stick together into a dough-like consistency, but if they&#39;re too dry, add a plop of frosting. Pack the cake dough firmly on top of the cake to build the skirt up to reach Barbie\u2019s waist (or higher to be an empire waist! Or a low-rise waist! You are your own fashion designer!). Take a step back to look at the general shape of the skirt and make any adjustments you\u2019d like: carve off some more for a slimmer skirt, add some Victorian-era dimension with some cake dough, etc. And then frost! Frost all over with thick swoops of frosting. Swirl in food coloring to create a groovy tie dye look, add sprinkles for a bedazzled look or get out your piping bags and pipe a whole lace wedding dress if that\u2019s your vision.

Meanwhile, add the bacon to a large skillet and place over medium heat to cook until crisp, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the bacon to a plate or bowl leaving the fat behind and add in the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and cook until lightly golden, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cocktail onions and continue to cook until the mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Peel and mince one clove of garlic and add to the pan. Cook for 30 seconds. Transfer to the plate with the bacon. Increase the heat to medium-high. Dry the steaks with paper towel and rub with olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Add the steaks to the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until deeply golden brown and cooked to medium-rare. Use tongs to hold each steak on its side to render the fat cap, about 1 minute. Remove the steaks to a plate or cutting board, tent loosely with aluminum foil and allow them to rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the sauce. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the butter, thyme and remaining clove of unpeeled garlic. Cook for 30 seconds. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk together, then add in the tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute. While whisking, slowly pour in the wine and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes to thicken. Add the sugar as well as the mushrooms, onions and bacon into the sauce and continue to simmer until thick and heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper and keep warm on low. Slice the steaks into 1-centimeter (1/2-inch) thick slices and divide between two plates. Spoon the sauce and veg over the steaks and serve topped with some fresh thyme leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM]&quot; 46627,&quot;Roast Chicken Salad 1 1/3 cups cooked boneless chicken, cut into 3/4-inch pieces 1 tablespoon lime juice Salt and pepper Dry mustard, pinch 2 tablespoons chopped red onion 1/4 cup diced celery 1 tablespoon mango chutney 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup toasted ,chopped pecans 1 tablespoon parsley,chopped 2 leaves bib lettuce Instructions: Recipe adapted from Jane Doerfer Toss the chicken with lime juice, generous amounts of black pepper and a pinch of dry mustard.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with wax paper and cover it sparsely with 1/3 cup of the yellow sanding sugar. Prepare a piping bag with a 1/2-inch pastry tip. Pour 2/3 cup of cold water into the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the powdered gelatin on top. Let sit for 5 minutes.<br> Put the granulated sugar and 1/2 cup cold water in a small pot over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved, about 4 minutes. Attach a candy thermometer to the pot, bring the mixture to a boil and boil until the thermometer registers 238 degrees F, about 8 minutes. Brush the sides of the pot with a wet pastry brush if sugar crystals stick to the sides as the syrup boils.<br> Carefully pour the hot sugar syrup into the bowl with the gelatin and whisk the mixture by hand for a few minutes to cool it slightly. Then, using the whisk attachment, whisk the mixture on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, 9 to 11 minutes. Add the vanilla and mix for another 30 seconds.<br> Put half of the mixture (about 2 cups) into a large bowl. Add about 5 drops of pink gel food coloring and gently fold with a rubber spatula to combine and until no streaks remain. Scrape into the prepared 8-inch square pan and spread into a smooth, even layer. Let sit at least 4 hours, uncovered, so the marshmallow stiffens.<br> Add about 5 drops yellow gel food coloring to the remaining marshmallow in the stand mixer, gently folding with a rubber spatula to combine. Transfer the yellow marshmallow to the prepared piping bag. Pipe a chick shape (about 2 1/2-inches long) on the prepared baking sheet by beginning piping close to you, pulling away from you to begin making the chick&#39;s body, then doubling back toward yourself. When you reach the end of the body nearest you, double back a bit to make the head, pulling away to create the beak. Repeat, keeping about an inch between the chicks. Let sit at least 4 hours, uncovered, so the marshmallow chicks stiffen.<br> To coat the bunnies in sugar: Put the remaining 1/2 cup pink sanding sugar in a medium bowl. Heat a saucepan filled with a couple inches of water to just under a boil, then turn off the heat. Dip the unrimmed edge of a 2 1/2-inch bunny-shaped cookie cutter into the warm water, then press the cutter into one corner of the marshmallow, creating a bunny marshmallow. Nudge the cut bunny out of the cutter and into the bowl filled with pink sanding sugar. Toss the cut bunny with a fork until well covered with sanding sugar. Repeat, dipping the cutter into the warm water each time you cut a bunny.<br> To coat the chicks in sugar: Put the remaining 1 cup yellow sanding sugar in a medium bowl. Use an offset spatula to remove 1 chick from the wax paper. Place the chick in the bowl filled with yellow sanding sugar. Toss the chick with a fork until well covered with sanding sugar. Repeat with the remaining chicks.<br> To make eyes and a nose for the bunnies, dip a toothpick or pointed skewer into the black gel food coloring and place 2 dots on each face for the eyes and 1 dot centered below the eyes for the nose. To create eyes on the chicks, dip a toothpick or pointed skewer into the black gel food coloring and place 1 dot on each side of each chick&#39;s head.

Pour the beer into a medium bowl and stir in the vodka. Slowly whisk in 1 teaspoon paprika and 1 cup flour. The batter should be fairly thick (to coat the onion rings before frying) but also easy to stir. Set aside in a warm place. Gather the onion rings in a medium bowl and use a small strainer to sprinkle it with remaining 2 tablespoons paprika. Toss to blend. Prepare a baking sheet fitted with a kitchen towel to drain the onion rings as they come out of the oil. Stir the batter slightly. To test the consistency of the batter and the temperature of the oil, put an onion ring on a slotted spoon and submerge it completely in the batter. It should coat the piece lightly. If the batter is too thick, add a little water to thin it out. If the batter is too thin, sift and whisk in a little more flour. Dip the onion ring in the batter, drain the excess batter, and use a slotted spoon or a pair of kitchen tongs to lower the onion ring into the oil. It should bubble slightly and the onion should gradually rise to the top. Fry until light brown, 2 to 3 minutes, and transfer them to the kitchen towel. Fry the onions in small batches. Season with salt and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 46633,&quot;Scrambled Eggs with Prosciutto and Focaccia Neutral oil, such as avocado or canola, for shallow-frying 8 paper-thin slices prosciutto Freshly ground black pepper 12 large eggs 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1/4 cup crme fra?che 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes Kosher salt 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for garnish 8 pieces Focaccia, recipe follows, sliced in half and lightly toasted, for serving 2 1/2 cups (600 g) lukewarm water 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast 2 1/2 teaspoons (15 g) honey 5 1/3 cups (800 g) all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons (18 g) kosher salt 1/4 cup (50 g) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan 1 1/2 teaspoons (5 g) kosher salt 1/3 cup (80 g) lukewarm water Flaky salt 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: In a small saut pan, heat 1/4 inch of neutral oil just below medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Line a plate with paper towels. Lay 1 slice of prosciutto into the hot oil (be careful of the oil sputtering once the prosciutto is added) and fry until the prosciutto shrinks and becomes almost translucent, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. Remove the prosciutto to the paper towels and season with pepper. Continue to fry all the slices, replenishing and reheating the oil as needed. The prosciutto will crisp up as it cools. Set aside while you prepare the eggs. Crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk until light, frothy, and uniform in color. Strain the eggs through a fine-mesh sieve into a separate bowl. In a large nonstick saut pan, combine the butter and crme fra?che. Pour the eggs into the pan and add the pepper flakes. Turn the heat to low and cook slowly, mixing frequently and gently using a silicone spatula or a wooden spoon until soft curds form. Depending on the strength of your burner, this can take anywhere from 15 to 35 minutes (sometimes even longer). Remove from the heat (the eggs will still be somewhat wet and have a custard-like consistency). Season with salt and pepper and gently fold in the Parmigiano. Working quickly so that the eggs do not continue cooking in the hot pan, mound the eggs on top of the warm Focaccia and sprinkle with additional Parmigiano-Reggiano and pepper. Top with the crispy prosciutto and serve as open-faced sandwiches. Make the dough: In a medium bowl, stir together the water, yeast, and honey until dissolved. In a very large bowl, whisk together the flour and kosher salt, then add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir with a rubber spatula until just incorporated, then scrape the sides of the bowl clean and cover with plastic wrap. Leave out at room temperature until at least doubled in volume, 12 to 14 hours. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil evenly onto an 18 13-inch sheet pan. When the dough is ready, use a spatula or your hand to release it from the sides of the bowl and fold it onto itself gently. Pour the dough out onto the pan, then pour an additional 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the dough. Using your hands, gently stretch the dough to the edges of the pan. (The best way to do this is to place your hands underneath the dough mass and pull outward.) The dough will shrink a bit, so repeat stretching once or twice over the course of 30 minutes to ensure that the dough remains spread out over the whole pan. After the dough is stretched, using your fingertips, dimple the dough all over its surface. Make the brine: Stir together the kosher salt and water until the salt is dissolved. Pour the brine over the dough to fill the dimples. Proof the focaccia, uncovered and at room temperature, for 45 minutes until the dough is light and bubbly. Thirty minutes into this final proof, set one oven rack in the middle position and a second in the top position and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. If you have a baking stone, place it on the middle rack. Otherwise, invert another sturdy baking sheet and place it on the middle rack. Allow the baking stone or baking sheet to preheat before proceeding with baking. Sprinkle the focaccia with flaky salt. Bake directly on top of the stone or inverted pan until the bottom crust is crisp and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. To finish browning the top crust, transfer the focaccia to the upper rack and bake for 5 to 7 minutes longer. Remove the focaccia from the oven and brush the olive oil over the whole surface. Let cool for 5 minutes, then release the focaccia from the pan with a metal spatula and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature. For longer storage, wrap in parchment and keep in an airtight bag or container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barolo]&quot; 46634,&quot;The Turducken: Boneless Turkey Stuffed with a Boneless Duck and Boneless Chicken \One Big Bird<br> 3 pounds coarsely ground pork 2 1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped garlic 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme Pinch chili pepper flakes Pinch ground mace Pinch ground allspice Pinch ground bay leaf Pinch ground sage Pinch cayenne pepper, optional 3 teaspoons bacon fat 1/2 pound butter 4 pounds frozen chopped spinach, thaw and remove excess liquid or 3 pounds freshly chopped spinach 2 cups sauteed onion 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground fennel seed 1/2 teaspoon white pepper One 6-pound fresh whole duck One 4-pound fresh whole chicken 1 cup olive oil, divided About 5 tablespoons blackening spice, divided One 25-pound fresh whole turkey 2 tablespoons freshly chopped garlic 5 pounds favorite cornbread dressing 3 whole roasted red bell peppers, cut into strips 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 quarts of your favorite turkey gravy Instructions: For the andouille sausage stuffing: In a large bowl, mix the pork, liquid smoke, garlic, salt paprika, black pepper, chili pepper flakes, mace, allspice, ground bay leaves, sage and cayenne pepper, if using, with some cold water. In a pan or on a flat-top, brown off the sausage mixture in about 3 teaspoons of bacon fat for flavor. Once the sausage mixture is browned, chill immediately. For the Spinach stuffing: Melt the butter in large skillet. Add the spinach, onion, fennel seed, salt and white pepper and saute for 5 minutes until hot. Set aside to cool. Preparation of the duck and chicken: It is wise to de-bone the duck and chicken first for practice. Place the fresh chicken breast-side down on large cutting board. Starting at the bird&#39;s neck, you will cut through the skin along the length of the spine. Using the tip of the knife and starting from the neck end, separate the meat from the rib cage on 1 side. Disjoint the wing from the shoulder blade and reserve for stock. Work towards the thigh bone, cut through the ball and socket joint and \pop\ loose using upward pressure with your hand from under the bird. Using your thumbnail, loosen the \oyster meat\ (the most tender part) from the frame. With the knife, remove the thigh and leg bone, but keep the leg attached to the bird. Repeat the process on other side of chicken. When both sides are finished, the bird will lay flat. Grab rib cage by the neck area and gently pull towards back to remove the entire carcass and breast bone cartilage. Repeat the same de-boning procedure for the duck. In a well ventilated area or with an exhaust fan on high, preheat a large cast-iron pan to very hot. Rub the boneless chicken and duck with olive oil. Generously sprinkle with blackening spice on both sides. Place skin-side down in the pan for 1 to 2 minutes then turn over and repeat. Refrigerate. De-bone the turkey using the same procedure as the chicken and duck with 2 exceptions: The turkey wings should be left attached to the meat and the bone-in drumstick should be disjointed from the boneless thigh meat and left attached to the meat. The final product should be a flat boneless turkey (except for the wings and drumsticks). To stuff the turducken: Place the turkey skin-side down on a flat surface. Rub the meat with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons chopped fresh garlic and 1 tablespoon blackening spice. Spread an even layer of cornbread dressing over the meat about 3/4 inch thick and pat down with hands. Spread 1/4-inch layer of spinach stuffing. Sprinkle with 2 cups of the andouille sausage stuffing. On top, place 6 to 8 slices of roasted red bell peppers. Place the chilled duck, skin-side down, on top of layered stuffing. Repeat the layered stuffing as above. Arrange the chilled chicken, skin-side down, on top of the stuffed duck. Spread the remainder of the stuffing on top of chicken. Press down gently with hands to compact all ingredients. To truss the turducken: This may take another person&#39;s help. Lift the sides of the turkey together. Have a helper hold the bird closed while sewing the back of the turkey together using butcher&#39;s twine, making the stitches about 1 inch apart, starting at the back of turkey and working towards the neck. Be careful since the Turducken has no boney frame. Roll over breast-side-up and finish sewing the neck portion of bird. Tie off and cut twine. Now sew up the opening at the leg section of turkey. Truss the legs together with twine. For extra support, tie butcher&#39;s twine around the bird&#39;s width every 3 inches down along the bird&#39;s length. Position your hands evenly under the turducken and lift into a large roasting pan with rack inside. The pan should be at least 3-inches deep to catch drippings during cooking. Rub the entire exposed skin of the bird with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of blackening spice and salt. Add 1/2 cup water to the bottom of the roasting pan. Wrap the drumsticks with aluminum foil. Place parchment paper over the entire bird. Loosely tent the roasting pan with aluminum foil. Bake at 200 degrees F for 12 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Remove all foil and parchment paper the last hour of roasting time and turn up temperature to 325 degrees F. Baste with the drippings. When done, remove from the oven and let set in the roasting pan for at least 1 hour. With 2 heavy duty spatulas, insert underneath and remove the turducken from the rack to place on carving platter. Remove all butcher twine, including pulling out the portion along the spine. To serve, cut the turducken in half lengthwise, then cut servings crosswise in approximately 1-inch thicknesses. Serve with gravy and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 46635,&quot;Green Beans with Coriander and Garlic: Feijao Verde com Coentro e Alho 2 pounds tender young green beans, washed and tipped 3 quarts boiling water, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced 2/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh coriander leaves (the dried won&#39;t do) 5 to 6 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon lemon juice 3 to 4 tablespoons cider vinegar 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cook the beans in the boiling salted water in a large covered saucepan over moderate heat, 10 to 12 minutes until tender. Meanwhile, place the garlic and coriander in a large heat-proof bowl. As soon as the beans are done, drain well, return to moderate heat, and shake the pan 30 to 40 seconds to drive off all excess moisture. Dump the hot beans on top of the garlic and coriander and let stand 10 minutes. Add 5 tablespoons of the olive oil and toss well to mix; cover and marinate in the refrigerator 3 to 4 hours or, better yet, overnight. About 45 minutes before serving, bring the beans from the refrigerator and let stand, still covered, on the counter. Just before serving, add the lemon juice, 3 tablespoons of the vinegar, and the pepper. Toss well, taste, and add more vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper, if needed. Serve as an accompaniment to pork, poultry, veal, or beef. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 46636,&quot;Classic Cheesecake 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 2 tablespoons granulated sugar Pinch fine salt 2 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 1/4 cups sour cream 6 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 tablespoon vanilla paste (see Cook&#39;s Note) or extract 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 3/4 cup sour cream 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 teaspoon vanilla paste or extract Berries, optional Instructions: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. For the crust: Melt the butter, covered in the microwave, in a medium microwave-safe bowl, or a saucepan. Brush a 9-inch springform pan with some of the butter. Stir the remaining butter together with the crumbs, sugar, and salt. Press the crumb mixture over the bottom of the pan, taking care to get the crust evenly into the edges. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool. Wrap the bottom and up the sides of the pan with foil and put in a roasting pan. For the filling: Beat the cream cheese on medium speed with a hand-held mixer until smooth. Add the granulated sugar and beat just until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl and beaters as needed. Slowly beat in the sour cream, then eggs, vanilla and both citrus zests; take care not to over whip. Pour into the cooled crust. Bring a medium saucepan or kettle of water to a boil. Gently place the roasting pan in the oven (don&#39;t pull the rack out of the oven). Pour in enough hot water to come about halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake the cheesecake for about 1 hour and 10 minutes---the outside of the cake will set but the center will still be loose. For the topping: Stir together the sour cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla. Spread over the top of the cooked cheesecake and return to the oven for 5 minutes. Turn the oven off, cook the cheesecake in the residual heat in the oven for about 1 hour. This gentle finish minimizes the risk of the dreaded crack in your cheesecake. Remove cheesecake from the roasting pan to a rack. Run a knife around the edges and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Bring cheesecake to room temperature 30 minutes before serving. Remove the springform ring. Dip a knife in warm water, wipe dry before slicing each piece. Serve with berries, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 46637,&quot;Healthy Sweet Potato Dip with Spiced Pita Chips 2 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 1/4 pounds total) 3 whole-wheat pitas, split 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2/3 cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/8 cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside the baking sheet. Prick each of the sweet potatoes 5 times with a fork and place on the rack, keeping space in between to allow the heat to circulate. Bake the sweet potatoes until a paring knife can easily go through without resistance, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. Keep the oven heated to 400 degrees F.<br> Line a baking sheet with parchment. Dividing evenly, brush both sides of each pita half with the olive oil using a pastry brush, and season the inner side of the pitas with the smoked paprika and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cut each seasoned pita into 6 wedges, then arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until lightly golden and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes.

For the macaroni: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the macaroni to al dente according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside. For the sauce: In a large saucepot on medium heat, add the butter, onion, Worcestershire sauce, flour, paprika and a few pinches of salt as well as black pepper. Cook for a few minutes while stirring, then add the half-and-half and cream cheese. Cook until the mixture begins to simmer. For the dish: Butter the sides and bottom of a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish or lasagna pan. Mix both cheese blends together in a large bowl. Put the scallions and cooked macaroni in a large bowl and toss in 4 cups of the shredded cheese. Pour over the sauce and stir, shake, jiggle and tap the bottom of the bowl lightly to make sure the sauce seeps completely into the nooks and crannies. Pour this mixture into the prepared dish. Toss the fried onions with the remaining 2 cups of cheese and sprinkle over the top. Bake until the top is melted and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 46639,&quot;Basic Pie Dough 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 6 ounces cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes 1/4 to 1/3 cup ice cold water Instructions: To prepare the dough by hand, combine the flour and salt in a stainless steel bowl, using a pastry knife mix well. Add the cold butter cubes to the flour and mix in until the mixture begins to resemble a mealy mixture where the butter forms pea sized nuggets plainly visible in the flour. Add only enough ice water to pull the dough together. The water should be added to the flour slowly to ensure that only the minimum amount of water is used. Do not over mix the dough. When the dough has been mixed just sufficiently to combine the ingredients, form it into a ball and wrap in a piece of plastic and refrigerate for several hours. When ready to use, lightly flour a pastry board and a rolling pin, and unwrap the dough. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and begin to roll out the first piece into the bottom crust. Tamp down the dough with the pin and gently begin to roll out into a circular pie shape by rolling evenly outward from the center and turning the dough in small 1/8th turns to keep the rolling even. When the dough is rolled out to an even thickness and is about 12 inches and is about 1/8th-inch thick it is ready to be transferred to a 10-inch pie tin. Lightly butter the tin, lift the dough with the rolling pin by partially rolling the dough up on the pin, center the dough in the tin and unroll. Pierce it in several places with the tines of a fork. Roll the second half of the pie dough into a round shape slightly larger than the pie pan. Fill the bottom crust with your chosen fruit filling. Cover the filling, such as apple, with the top half of the pie dough. Using both hands, crimp the edges of the two crusts together to seal. With a sharp knife, make several crosshatch slits in the top crust. Brush with the egg wash and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46640,&quot;Duck Fried Rice with Napa Cabbage 5 tablespoons peanut oil 2 shallots, thinly sliced 2 garlic cloves, minced 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated Pinch red pepper flakes 1 small head Napa cabbage, cored and chopped 1 (8-ounce) can straw mushrooms, drained and rinsed 1/2 cup frozen peas, run under cool water for 2 minutes to thaw 1 generous pinch kosher salt 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 pint cooked long-grain white rice 3 tablespoons soy sauce 1 cup cooked duck meat, cut in pieces Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: Heat 3 tablespoons of the peanut oil in a wok or large non-stick skillet over medium-high flame. Give the oil a minute to heat up, then add the shallots, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes; stir-fry for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the cabbage, mushrooms, and peas, stir-fry until the cabbage is wilted and soft, about 8 minutes; season with a nice pinch of salt. Remove the vegetables to a side platter and wipe out the wok. Put the pan back on the heat and coat with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. When the oil is hot, pour the eggs into the center of the pan. Scramble the egg lightly, then let it set without stirring so it stays in big pieces. Fold in the rice and toss with the egg to combined well, breaking up the rice clumps with the back of a spatula. Return the sauteed vegetables to the pan and moisten with the soy sauce. Toss everything together to heat through and season again with salt. Spoon the fried rice out onto a serving platter, lay the pieces of duck on top and garnish with cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 46641,&quot;Chocolate-Coconut Pretzels 1 1/2 tablespoons dry active yeast 1 tablespoon agave nectar 2 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon sea salt 2 large eggs 1 cup Nutella, softened 2 cups shredded coconut 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon ancho cl powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper Instructions: Mix 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F), the yeast and agave in a bowl. Set aside 5 minutes. In a food processor fitted with the dough blade, pulse the whole-wheat flour, 2 cups all-purpose flour and the sea salt. Add 1 egg and the yeast mixture and pulse in 10-second intervals until the dough comes together, about 3 pulses. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead 10 to 12 times, adding up to 3/4 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cut the dough into 4 equal portions; cover with a clean towel. On a floured board, roll out one piece of dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, with a shorter side facing you. Spread 1/4 cup Nutella across the middle of the dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough over the Nutella, then sprinkle 1/2 cup coconut over the folded part. Fold the top third of the dough over the coconut. Reroll the dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle. Cut into seven 11-by-2-inch strips. One at a time, pinch the cut long edges of each strip together and roll into a 12-inch rope with your hands. Transfer the rope to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Grab the ends and bring them toward each other, forming a U shape, then cross the left end over the right end to make a pretzel shape. Cross the left end over the right again to make a twist in the middle. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough dough and the remaining Nutella and coconut, spacing the pretzels 3 inches apart. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes; preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl. Mix the sugar, cl powder, cinnamon, cloves and cayenne in another bowl. Brush the pretzels with the egg; sprinkle with the spice mixture. Bake until browned, 16 to 18 minutes, checking on the pretzels every 5 minutes to avoid overbaking. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 46642,&quot;Apple Chocolate Cake 1 stick salted butter, at room temperature, plus more for buttering the pan 1 1/2 cups vanilla wafer cookies, such as Nilla, crushed<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 3 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 3/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 2 large apples such as Honey Crisp, peeled and cut into small dice<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest<br> 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan and dust all sides with the crushed vanilla wafers; set aside. Sift the flour and baking powder together in a small bowl and set aside. Using a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on high speed until pale and very thick, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan and cook, scraping the sides and bottom of the pan to prevent burning, until the butter browns and smells nutty, 6 to 8 minutes. Add 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar to the eggs. Add one-third of the flour mixture, then half of the butter, another third of the flour, the remaining butter and the rest of flour, mixing between additions. Whisk until just barely combined. Using a spatula, gently fold the batter until the ingredients are combined. It is very important not to over-whisk or over-fold the batter or it will lose volume. Pour into the prepared pan. In a medium bowl, toss the apples, cinnamon, lemon zest and remaining 2 teaspoons granulated sugar and pour on top of the batter. Sprinkle on the chocolate chips and bake until the cake is golden brown and springs back to the touch, 40 to 50 minutes. Release the pan when cooled and sprinkle the cake with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 46643,&quot;Tequila-Spiked Queso Fundido 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 ounces fresh chorizo<br> 1 small onion, finely diced<br> 1 small green bell pepper, finely diced<br> 1 small yellow bell pepper, finely diced<br> 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon tequila, preferably gold 2 Roma tomatoes, diced<br> 1 pound Monterey Jack cheese, grated<br> 8 ounces white Cheddar, grated<br> Sprinkle of chili powder<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br> Tortilla chips, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook, crumbling it as you go, until browned. Remove from the skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off any excess fat from the skillet. Add the onion and bell peppers to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat until the veggies begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in 1/4 cup of the tequila. Turn the heat back on and cook until the vegetables are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat and set aside. Meanwhile, stir the tomatoes and remaining 1 tablespoon tequila together in a small bowl and set aside to marinate for a few minutes. To build, cover the bottom of a medium ovenproof skillet with a third of the Monterey Jack and Cheddar. Add half of the chorizo, then another third of the cheese. Next, add as much of the veggie mixture as you&#39;d like (you may have a little left over). Add almost all of the remaining cheese, the rest of the chorizo and then whatever cheese you have left. Sprinkle the top very lightly with chili powder. Bake, starting to watch it 4 to 5 minutes in, until the cheese is totally melted, hot and slightly bubbling...but before the cheese starts to firm up/harden. (In other words, you still want the cheese to be extra gooey.) Drain the tomatoes. Remove the skillet from the oven and top with the spiked tomatoes and cilantro. Serve immediately with tortilla chips. It&#39;s best when piping hot! Wrap a cloth around the skillet handle so guests won&#39;t burn themselves. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 46644,&quot;Mini Venison Wellington Four 6-ounce/175g venison or beef steaks, each about 1-inch/2cm thick Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 large red onions, finely sliced 1 ounce/30g unsalted butter Pinch salt Pinch sugar 2 tablespoons Armagnac brandy 1 pound 2 ounces/500g puff pastry or croissant dough 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 free-range egg, mixed with 2 tablespoons water, for the egg wash Instructions: Place a large nonstick frying pan over the highest possible heat.

When the sugar mixture becomes hot, slowly stir in the egg and flour mixture. Cook over medium heat until the pudding boils up. Turn the heat very low and stir and cook 1 or 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour cooled butterscotch into pre-baked piecrust. Top the pie with meringue. Bake in a 350 degree preheated oven 15 to 18 minutes until lightly browned. For the Crumb Crust: Put the metal chopping blade in place in the food processor beaker. Add the flour, frozen butter, and salt to the beaker. Process for 8 to 10 seconds, turning on and off, until the butter is cut into the flour and the mixture forms very small, flaky granules. Add the lemon juice and eggs to the beaker and process until a ball of dough forms on top of the blades, about 15 seconds. The dough should be damp but not sticky. If it seems too soft, sprinkle with 1 to 2 tablespoons flour and process for an additional 5 to 6 seconds, until well combined. If it feels too dry, sprinkle with a few drops of water and process to blend well. Wrap the ball of dough in waxed paper, plastic wrap, or foil and chill until firm but still malleable.

Scrape down the side of the work bowl, recover, and let stand until foamy, about 15 minutes. With the machine running, add 1 1/2 cups of the all-purpose flour down the feed tube. It&#39;s easier if the flour is poured from a spouted measuring cup into a wide-mouth canning funnel inserted in the feed tube, or a stiff piece of paper rolled into a cone (the opening at the bottom should be at least 1-inch across). Using a plastic spatula scrape the work bowl and, if necessary, redistribute the dough so that it evenly surrounds the blade. Be careful of the blade. Add the salt and remaining flour, distribute evenly over the dough, and pulse for 10 seconds. Again scrape the work bowl and redistribute the dough. Pulse the dough for 20 seconds nonstop, shut the machine off, and let the dough rest covered in the work bowl for 5 minutes. Now pulse for another 20 seconds. Leaving the blade in place, carefully redistribute the dough until it&#39;s of uniform thickness. Recover the work bowl, keeping the pusher from the feed tube in. Note the level of the dough, estimate what it should be when doubled in bulk, and mark that level on the side of the work bowl. Let the dough rise in the sealed work bowl until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, lightly coat an 8-inch springform pan or 8-inch pie pan lightly with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. When the dough has fully doubled, pulse quickly 4 to 5 times to punch down, then pulse for 20 seconds nonstop. Let the dough rest in the sealed work bowl for 5 minutes, then pulse for another 20 seconds. The dough will roll into a ball and leave the sides of the work bowl reasonably clean. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, shape into a ball, then roll in the flour to dust lightly. Place the loaf in the prepared pan, cover with a clean, dry dish towel, and set in a warm, dry spot until nearly doubled in bulk, this will take about 30 minutes. When the dough has risen for 10 minutes, position 1 rack in the middle of the oven and slide a second rack in the slot just below. Place a large shallow baking pan on the lower rack?I use a 15 1/2 by 10 1/2 by 1-inch jelly roll pan?and half-fill with water. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Center the risen loaf on the middle rack and bake uncovered for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. and continue to bake until richly browned and hollow sounding when thumped, about 20 to 25 minutes longer. Remove the bread from the pan as soon as it comes from the oven, set right-side up on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46682,&quot;Red Velvet Bars 1 box (18 1/4 ounces) German chocolate cake mix (recommended: Betty Crocker) 1 stick butter, softened 1 egg 1 ounce red food coloring (recommended: McCormick) 16 ounces cream cheese, softened (recommended: Philadelphia) 1/2 cup sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (recommended: McCormick) Instructions: Set up grill for indirect cooking over medium heat.

Add the cake flour and stir with a wooden spoon until dough-like. Set aside in the fridge to cool for 20 minutes. When cool, use your fingers to break apart the mixture into large pea-sized crumbs. Hold in the refrigerator. For the sauteed apples: Heat a small saucepot over medium heat. Add the butter and heat until melted. Add the apples, brown sugar, apple pie spice and salt and saute until the apples are slightly browned and al dente, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Using 2 sheets of parchment, create an overlapping cross in the pan to cradle the cake and make it easy to remove once baked. Prepare the cake batter according to the instructions on the box. Add the cake batter to the prepared baking dish, then \stud\ in a layer of the cooled apples. Bake for about 20 minutes, then remove the baking dish and carefully spread the crumb topping into an even layer over the cake.

Add the butter and process until the largest pieces of butter are pea-size. Transfer to a large bowl. Combine the vodka, vinegar and 4 tablespoons of the ice water in a small bowl. Drizzle the wet ingredients over the dough, then mix with a fork until shaggy pieces form. Knead the dough in the bowl with your hands a couple of times until it comes together (it will look quite dry, which is fine). Transfer the large clumps of dough to a work surface. Drizzle 1 tablespoon ice water over any remaining smaller bits of dough in the bowl and knead again to bring it together. If the remaining dough is still too dry to come together, add more ice water in 1-tablespoon increments. Add to the dough on the work surface and press together into a single mass, incorporating any dry bits. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick block.<br> Divide the block into 4 pieces with a bench scraper or knife. Stack the pieces on top of one another, tucking any unincorporated dry bits in between the layers. Flatten the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick block. Repeat this process (cutting, stacking and flattening) 3 more times; this creates layers of butter in the dough that produce a wonderfully flaky crust.<br> Divide the dough in half and form into 1-inch-thick discs; wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 3 hours and preferably overnight. The dough can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated, or frozen for up to 3 months.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 46686,&quot;Mexican Lasagna Cooking spray 12 ounces cooked chicken, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 3 cups) 1 cup sour cream (regular or low-fat) 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese (regular or low-fat), divided 1 cup shredded Cheddar (regular or low-fat), divided 1/2 cup mild, medium or hot salsa 1 (4-ounce) can chopped green chiles 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 teaspoon ground chili powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste 8 (6-inch) corn tortillas, cut into 6 wedges Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottom of each with parchment. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the milk, vanilla, eggs and egg yolk together in another medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add about a third of the flour mixture and beat on medium-low until incorporated. Now add a third of the egg-milk mixture and continue to beat on medium-low until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Repeat with another third of the flour, then all of the egg-milk mixture and finishing with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake until the cake has a nice golden brown crust around the edge, bounces back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely in the cake pans on a rack.<br> For the frosting: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter, milk and vanilla in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until all the sugar is blended into the butter. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.<br> Remove 3 tablespoons frosting and place it in a small bowl; leave this frosting plain. Remove another 3/4 cup frosting, place in another bowl and dye with the orange food coloring. Dye the remaining 3 3/4 cups frosting in the mixing bowl with the yellow food coloring. Fill a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip with the yellow frosting. Fill a second piping bag fitted with a tip with the orange frosting. Assemble the cake: Cut a 4-inch circle out of the center of one cake layer (reserve or discard the cut-out cake). Put the cake ring on a spinning cake stand or serving platter and frost the top with about 1/2 cup of the yellow frosting. Fill the hole with the candy corn. Put the other cake layer on top, so that the rounded side of the cake is facing up; push down gently to sandwich the two cake layers together.<br> Pipe a ring of yellow frosting along the outside edge of the cake. Pipe a second ring just inside it so they are touching. Pipe the remaining yellow frosting onto the sides of the cake, making sure to connect it to the frosting ring on the top of the cake. Using a large offset spatula, flatten the icing on the side of the cake to frost the outside until smooth.<br> Pipe 3 concentric touching rings of orange frosting just inside the yellow rings. Spoon the reserved white frosting on the center of the cake and spread it flat so that it touches the orange frosting.<br> Position the tip of a large offset spatula in the center of the cake so the length of the blade looks like a radius and touches the top of all three frostings. Using one continuous, circular motion with gentle pressure (using a spinning cake stand will help), spread the frostings flat on the top of the cake so they form stripes (some of the frosting will come off with the spatula; do not try to reapply it). Let the cake stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46688,&quot;Red Beans and Rice 1 pound dried red beans 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 8 ounces andouille sausage, sliced 1/2 inch thick 1 onion, chopped 3 scallions, sliced (white and green parts separated) 3 stalks celery, chopped 1 green bell pepper, chopped Kosher salt 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 smoked ham hock 4 fresh bay leaves 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground sage 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme 2 cups long-grain white rice 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar, plus more to taste Hot sauce, for topping Instructions: Put the dried beans in a large bowl or container and cover with water.

Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan, add the onion, and cook for 5 minutes over medium-low heat. Add the scallions, and cook for another 2 minutes until the scallions are wilted but still green. Meanwhile, gently squeeze most of the water out of the spinach and place it in a large bowl. When the onion and scallions are done, add them to the spinach. Mix in the eggs, Parmesan cheese, 3 tablespoons bread crumbs, the nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Gently fold in the feta and pine nuts. Place 1 sheet of phyllo dough flat on a work surface with the long end in front of you. Brush the dough lightly with butter and sprinkle it with a teaspoon of bread crumbs. Working quickly, slide another sheet of phyllo dough on top of the first, brush it with butter, and sprinkle lightly with bread crumbs. (Use just enough bread crumbs so the layers of phyllo don&#39;t stick together.) Pile 4 layers total on top of each other this way, brushing each with butter and sprinkling with bread crumbs. Cut the sheets of phyllo in half lengthwise. Place 1/3 cup spinach filling on the shorter end and roll the phyllo up diagonally as if folding a flag. Then fold the triangle of phyllo over straight and then diagonally again. Continue folding first diagonally and then straight until you reach the end of the sheet. The filling should be totally enclosed. Continue assembling phyllo layers and folding the filling until all of the filling is used. Place on a sheet pan, seam sides down. Brush with melted butter, sprinkle with flaked salt, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the phyllo is browned and crisp. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 46704,&quot;Campfire Cookies 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup superfine sugar 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, at room temperature 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract One 1-pound box confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons meringue powder Green gel food coloring Coarsely chopped chocolate-covered almonds, peanuts or malt balls (for the dirt) 54 chewy chocolate candies, such as Tootsie Rolls 10 red gummy bears, snipped into small pieces 10 yellow gummy bears, snipped into small pieces 10 orange gummy bears, snipped into small pieces 10 light pink gummy bears, snipped into small pieces 54 mini marshmallows 54 pretzel sticks Instructions: For the cookies: Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Beat the superfine sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes; beat in the egg, then the vanilla. Add the flour mixture and mix on medium-low speed until completely incorporated. Divide the dough in half, pat into 2 discs about 1/4-inch thick and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Let the dough sit at room temperature for a few minutes to make rolling easier. Roll out 1 disc of dough at a time on a floured work surface to about 1/4-inch thick. Cut out rounds with a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter and arrange about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake, switching and rotating the pans halfway through, until the cookies are golden brown on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a wire rack; let cool completely. For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons water and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft glossy peaks form, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons water if necessary, to make a thick but spreadable icing. Beat in the food coloring, a few drops at a time, to make a deep green color (for grass). For decorating: Spread the icing on the cookies, almost to the edges. Sprinkle the chopped chocolate covered nuts almost to the edge of the green to resemble dirt. Arrange 3 chewy chocolate candies in a triangle on top to resemble logs in a campfire. Fill the space in the center of each with snipped gummy bears to resemble a campfire and embers. Poke a marshmallow on the end of each pretzel stick and stick in the icing to form a tripod that meets in the center. Let the icing harden, about 1 hour. Right before serving, light the marshmallows on fire and blow it out when they are toasted to your liking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46705,&quot;Smashed Chinese Cucumber Salad 1 pound Persian or mini cucumbers 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon crushed red cl flakes Toasted sesame seeds and fresh cilantro, for garnish Instructions: Place the cucumbers in a resealable plastic bag.

Throw in the onions and peppers and cook until the peppers have a few dark brown/black areas, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and set aside. Add the Perfect Grilled Chicken to the skillet and heat over medium-high heat until warmed through. Dice into cubes and set aside. Sizzle 1/2 tablespoon of the butter in a separate skillet or griddle over medium heat and lay a flour tortilla in the skillet. Then build the quesadillas by laying grated cheese on the bottom tortilla, and then arranging the chicken and cooked peppers over it. Top with a little more grated cheese and top with a second tortilla. When the tortilla is golden on the first side, carefully flip the quesadilla to the other side, adding another 1/2 tablespoon butter to the skillet at the same time. Continue cooking until the second side is golden. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and fillings. Cut each quesadilla into wedges and serve with Pico de Gallo. Mix together the olive oil, honey, mustard, salt, thyme, oregano and lemon juice in a large shallow container. Pound the chicken breasts to uniform thickness and add them to the marinade. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 8 hours. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the chicken in batches until golden brown on the first side, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side and cooked all the way through, another 4 to 5 minutes. Let the chicken cool. Transfer the chicken to freezer bags individually and in pairs, so it&#39;s easy to defrost the exact amount you need. Yield: 24 servings Slice 2 of the jalapenos in half. With a spoon, scrape out the seeds. (If you like things spicy, leave in some of the white membranes.) Dice the jalapenos very finely; you want a hint of heat and jalapeno flavor, but you don&#39;t want to cause any fires. Now dump the jalapenos, cilantro, tomatoes and onions in a bowl. Slice the lime in half and squeeze the juice from half the lime into the bowl. Sprinkle with salt, and stir together until combined. Be sure to taste the pico de gallo and adjust the seasonings, adding salt or more diced jalapeno if needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 46711,&quot;Ultimate BBQ Bison Prime Rib Roast One 3 lb.

Rub and pat all over the brisket in a thick even coating. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. When ready to grill, soak the wood chips in cold water in a large bowl. Prepare a charcoal grill for indirect cooking: Light the coals, then bank them to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side of the grill and replace the grates. Let the fire burn until the temperature is between 200 degrees F and 250 degrees F (you should be able to hold your hand about 5 inches away from the coals for 6 seconds). Drain the wood chips and scatter a handful of them over the coals. (If using a gas grill, cook over low indirect heat and use a smoker box for the wood chips.) Place the brisket fat-side up on the grates above the drip pan. Cover the grill; adjust the vents to maintain a temperature between 200 degrees F and 250 degrees F. Cook until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the brisket registers 185 degrees F to 200 degrees F, 7 1/2 to 10 hours. Rotate the brisket every few hours and add more charcoal and wood chips every 45 minutes to keep the temperature steady (use dry wood chips if you need more). Remove the brisket from the grill, wrap in foil and let rest 45 minutes to 1 hour. Pour the drippings from the drip pan into a bowl; let them settle, then skim off the fat. Meanwhile make the sauce: Combine the vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, paprika and 1 teaspoon salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking, until hot but not boiling, about 3 minutes. Let cool; season with salt. Slice the brisket against the grain. Serve with the pan juices and sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 46721,&quot;Chocolate Ricotta Toast 1 cup fresh ricotta cheese 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Four 1/2-inch-thick slices rustic bread 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 1/2 ounces dark chocolate (about 70-percent) Instructions: In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla using a rubber spatula.

Line two baking sheets with parchment. In a food processor, pulse together the pecans and sugar just until sandy--do not overpulse, as you don&#39;t want a paste. Add the flour and salt; pulse until combined. Cut butter into small cubes and add to the food processor. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water and pulse quickly, until a rough dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and press into a cohesive dough. Roll to a 1/4-inch thickness. Using a knife or a rectangular cookie cutter, cut into 1-by-3-inch rectangles, about 24 total; re-roll scraps if necessary. Sprinkle the tops of the cookies lightly with sea salt. Transfer to the prepared baking sheets and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Bake until golden brown at the edges, 14 to 17 minutes. Let the cookies cool to room temperature. For the fondue: Combine the sugar, water and honey in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook until the mixture is a deep-amber caramel color, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully pour in the cream--stand back as the mixture will bubble and splatter. Once the bubbling subsides, turn off the heat and whisk the caramel until smooth. Whisk in the whiskey, butter, salt and vanilla. Pour the sauce into the fondue pots and keep warm.

Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Roll out the Pizza Dough to the desired shape, using flour as needed to avoid sticking. Brush the grill with oil. Grill the dough until cooked through and grill marks appear, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to an inverted baking sheet. Heat the oil in a medium saute pan until it begins to shimmer. Add the spinach and cook until beginning to wilt. Transfer to a kitchen towel to drain, wringing the towel if necessary. Cook the bacon in a small saute pan over medium heat until crispy; transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Spread a thin layer of Bechamel Sauce on the dough, leaving a slight border around the edges. Sprinkle the spinach and bacon on top of the sauce. Sprinkle evenly with the fontina. Carefully crack the eggs on top. Bake until the cheese is melted and the eggs are set, about 7 minutes. Thinly shave the truffle over the pizza.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the warm water, sugar and yeast; stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the mixer to the lowest speed; add the oil and salt. Mix in the flour, a little at a time, until incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium, stopping the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise in a warm spot, such as over a gas pilot light, until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Bring the milk and one of the bay leaves to a gentle simmer in a small saucepan, stirring to prevent scorching. Keep the pan over low heat. Make a white roux by melting the butter over medium-low heat in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to coat the flour and remove the starchy taste; do not allow to brown. Remove from the heat, then gradually add a bit of the warm milk, whisking vigorously. Return the pan to the heat and bring to a low simmer. Add the rest of the milk while whisking constantly. Cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 5 minutes. Season with the garlic, remaining bay leaf and salt and white pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 46734,&quot;White Truffle Mac and Cheese 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup chopped red onion 1/2 cup chopped garlic 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups whole milk 1 1/2 cups cooked cavatappi pasta 1/2 cup chopped fresh herbs (equal parts rosemary, thyme and basil) 1/4 cup infused white truffle oil 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup Japanese bread crumbs (panko) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Add butter to a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute the onions and garlic until they turn slightly brown. Add the flour and whisk together for 3 minutes to make a blonde roux. Whisk in the milk and bring to a boil, stirring constantly to prevent the roux from burning.

Butter the bottom and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans. Dust with flour and tap out the excess; set aside. Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed, scraping down the bowl as needed, until very light and fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until combined; continue beating until well blended, 1 to 2 more minutes. Reduce the speed to medium low; beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk and vanilla in two batches, until just smooth (it\u2019s OK if the batter looks curdled at first\u2014it will smooth out). Stir the batter a few times with a rubber spatula to make sure it\u2019s blended.<br> Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are browned, the edges begin to pull away from the pans and the centers spring back when pressed, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then remove the cakes to the rack to cool completely. While the cakes cool, make the crumble: Toss the potato chips, cookies, coconut, melted butter and brown sugar in a medium bowl until well coated. Spread on a baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then stir in the chocolate-covered raisins and/or nuts; set aside. Make the frosting: Mix the brown sugar and 2 tablespoons heavy cream in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave, stirring once or twice, until smooth, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Let cool slightly. Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar in two batches until smooth and fluffy. Add the brown sugar mixture; beat on medium-high speed until fluffy and spreadable, 1 to 2 more minutes.<br> Make the ganache: Combine the remaining 1/3 cup heavy cream and the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe measuring cup or bowl; microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted, about 1 minute. Let the ganache cool until it\u2019s thickened but still spreadable.<br> Put 1 cake layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Top with 1 cup frosting, spreading it to the edges. Sprinkle with a heaping 1/2 cup of the crumble, gently pressing it into the frosting. Top with the second cake layer. Cover the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting (this is the crumb coat\u2014it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect). Refrigerate until the frosting is set, 15 to 20 minutes. Cover with the remaining frosting. Press some of the remaining crumble around the bottom of the cake. Spoon the ganache over the top of the cake and gently spread, letting it drip down the sides. Sprinkle with the remaining crumble. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46770,&quot;Smokin&#39; Margarita 1/2 ounce agave nectar, plus more for rimming the glass Black lava salt, for rimming the glass<br> 1 1/4 ounces tequila<br> 1/2 ounce fresh lime juice, plus 1 lime wedge, for garnish 1/4 ounce mezcal<br> 1 large egg white, optional<br> Instructions: Put some agave in a small dish and the black lava salt in another dish.

In a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and salt and continue whipping until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, gradually add 1 cup of the granulated sugar and continue whipping until stiff and the sugar has dissolved, about 30 seconds more. Sift the remaining 1/4-cup of granulated sugar with the sifted cake flour 3 times, to aerate the mixture. Fold into the egg whites, then fold in the vanilla and maple syrup. Spoon the batter into an ungreased proper angel food pan or 6 miniature ones. Smooth the top with the back of the spoon. Bake until light golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool by hanging the cake (in the pan) upside down around the neck of a bottle until it cools to room temperature. Run a long, sharp knife blade around the cake to loosen, then knock the cake out onto a plate. Glaze: Stir the ingredients together until smooth. Pour over the top of the cake and spread with a spatula, letting the glaze trickle down the sides. Let set for at least 30 minutes before serving, or until the icing is hard.

Whisk together the oil, salt, cloves, lime juice and chipotle in a small bowl. Pour over the shrimp in the bag and seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. For the tropical salsa: Meanwhile, combine the pineapple, avocado, cactus, jalapenos and mangoes in a medium bowl. Add the cilantro, vinegar, oil and epazote and toss to combine. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve. For assembly: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and sprinkle with salt. Place the shrimp on the grill over direct heat and cook, turning once, until they are charred and the flesh is pink, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add the cooked shrimp to the salsa and toss to combine.

Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook on both sides until opaque in the middle, about 3 minutes. Remove to a cutting board and cut in half. Set aside. Return the skillet to the stovetop (do not wash it) and add the garlic and onion. Stir and cook until the onion starts to turn translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low. Add the rice to the skillet and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, taking care not to burn it. Pour in the wine and stir. Once the wine is absorbed, begin adding the broth 1/2 to 1 cup at a time, allowing the rice to cook and absorb the liquid each time. Stir occasionally as you go and add the salt and pepper during one of the broth additions. After 4 cups of broth have been absorbed, taste the rice. It should have a slight bite, but if it seems undercooked, add additional broth for the rice to absorb and cook until the risotto is to your liking. Add both the lemon zest and juice to the risotto towards the end of cooking. Stir in the heavy cream, shrimp and basil, then serve immediately with extra lemon zest and Parmesan cheese on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 46776,&quot;Carrot Halwa Blondie Bars Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 leveled teaspoons double-acting baking powder 2 cups shredded carrots 1/2 cup raisins 5 tablespoons sugar One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk 1/2 cup whole milk 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/8 teaspoon plus an extra pinch ground nutmeg 5 to 7 cardamom pods, seeds removed and finely crushed 1/2 cup slivered almonds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 11-by-15-inch baking tray with nonstick cooking spray. Sift together the flour and baking powder in a large mixing bowl. Combine the carrots, raisins, sugar and condensed milk in a heatproof or glass bowl. Rinse out the condensed milk stuck to the sides of the can using the whole milk, and then add both to the carrots and mix well. Microwave the carrots until soft and have lost their raw texture and taste, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the melted butter, nutmeg and cardamom until well combined. (I prefer to add the spices after the carrots are cooked to ensure that the essential oils in the spices do not dissipate.) Pour the carrot mixture into the center of bowl with the flour. Fold in the carrots gently, working from the sides in towards the center, taking care not to over-mix (this can cause the gluten to bind together, resulting in a tough and leathery texture).<br> Spread evenly onto the baking tray and sprinkle with the almonds.

Reduce this by one third, and then toss in your cooked pasta. Heat the pasta through and add the Parmesan, white pepper, and salt and toss. Pour into bowls and add more Parmesan cheese (as much as you like). Ask your butcher for a 5 pound, nice square piece of pork belly (skinless) that will fit into a 2-gallon zip-top bag. Pat the belly with paper towels to dry. Mix together all the spices. Wearing plastic gloves, rub the cure mixture into both sides of the belly. Place in a 2-gallon zip-top bag, put on a sheet pan, and refrigerate. Every day for 1 week, turn the bag over and massage the belly (through the bag) to ensure saturation. The pork will take on a slightly darker color than what it was. This is a sign that the cure is working. It will also draw some moisture out of the belly. When the meat is darker and firmer, remove the belly from the bag and run under water to remove any cure sediment. Pat dry and lightly cover with a dusting of ground white pepper. Roll the belly very tightly into a log and wrap tightly with cheesecloth. Tie the end and hang in a 34 to 38 degree F refrigerator for at least 2 weeks.At this time the bacon should be fully cured and have a good firmness when squeezed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46779,&quot;Hot Hawaiian Beef Sandwiches 24 dinner rolls, such as King&#39;s Hawaiian Original Hawaiian Sweet Rolls 1/2 cup salad dressing spread, such as Miracle Whip Hot sauce, to taste<br> 24 thin slices deli roast beef<br> 12 slices pepper Jack cheese<br> 1 stick butter<br> 1 tablespoon lemon pepper<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 6 dashes Worcestershire sauce<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the butter and pulse until just combined with some pea-size pieces. Pulse in 6 ounces cheese until coarse crumbs form, then gradually pulse in 5 tablespoons ice water. Pinch the dough with your fingers: If it doesn\u2019t hold together, add up to 2 more tablespoons ice water, a little at a time. (Do not overwork the dough.) Divide the dough in half, form into disks and wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Meanwhile, make the filling: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. In a large bowl, toss the apples with the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Add the apples to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until syrupy and the apples are crisp-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir the cornstarch and water in a small bowl until smooth, then add to the skillet and cook, stirring, until the juices thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Transfer the apple mixture to a parchment-lined baking sheet to cool completely. Preheat the oven to 400? F. Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plate. Add the apple filling, mounding it in the center. Roll out the other disk of dough and place it over the pie; trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold in the edges and crimp with your fingers. Cut a few slits in the top of the pie to allow steam to escape. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before baking. Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet, brush with the beaten egg and bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 ounces cheese and continue baking until the cheese melts and the crust is dark golden, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool completely on a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46799,&quot;Orange Ginger Brown Rice Vegetable oil 1 medium onion, diced 1 cup brown rice 1 teaspoon orange zest 1 tablespoon finely chopped or fresh ginger 2 cups vegetable stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Begin by sweating onions in oil in a medium sized pan until they are translucent.

Line a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with foil. Peel the onions and cut them in half along the equator. Cut the bottoms slightly so that the onions can sit cut-side up steadily. Use a spoon or melon baller to scoop the centers out of the onions, leaving about 1/4-inch (or 1 layer of onion) as the shell and reserving the scooped flesh. (The onions should look like little bowls.) Place the hollowed-out onions in the baking dish. Drizzle the olive oil over them and sprinkle with about 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Roast the onions until they are soft and brown on the tops, about 30 minutes. Let rest until cool enough to handle. (Leave the oven on.) Meanwhile, roughly chop the reserved onion flesh. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to brown, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle in 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper, or more if desired. Reduce the heat to medium and let the onions cook until they are very soft and brown, another 10 to 15 minutes. Pour 1/2 cup wine into the skillet and scrape up any brown bits. Let the wine cook out, then transfer the onions to a large bowl to cool slightly. Add and combine the sausage with the caramelized onions. Mix in the panko, thyme, garlic, half the Parmesan, half the parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Use a 1/2-cup ice cream scoop or measuring cup to add a heaping half cup of the sausage mixture to each roasted onion. They should be mounded; press everything in to keep it together. Pour the stock and remaining 1/2 cup wine into the bottom of the baking dish. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the onions from the oven, remove the foil, sprinkle the remaining Parmesan on the tops of the onions, then bake until the cheese is melted and browning and the sausage is browned, another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, then sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 46802,&quot;Sidecar Cocktails Freshly squeezed lemon juice Sugar 1 cup Cognac or good brandy 1/2 cup Triple Sec or Cointreau 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice Maraschino cherries or lemon peel, to garnish Instructions: If you want to frost the glasses, dip the rim or 4 martini glasses in a shallow plate of lemon juice and then in the sugar.

Working with one wrapper at a time and keeping the rest tightly wrapped, put a wrapper on your work surface and brush the edges with water using your finger or a small pastry brush. Put a mounded teaspoon of filling in the center of the wrapper, spreading it out into a football shape. Bring the edges of the wrapper together, resting the dumpling base on your work surface. Seal the edges by making 4 to 6 pleats on the side facing you and pressing the edges together. (Only 1 side should be pleated.) Set aside, cover with a damp paper towel and repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.<br> To cook the gyoza: Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Quickly arrange half the gyoza, bottom-side down in the skillet, and cook until beginning to brown on the bottom, about 1 minute. Add 2/3 cup water to the skillet (it will spatter), cover tightly and let the gyoza cook until the skins are tender, about 6 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until the liquid has cooked off and the gyoza are crisp and brown on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Repeat with the remaining vegetable oil and dumplings.

With a knife, pierce the skin of the brisket in 5 places and insert the garlic cloves. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy skillet or roasting pan, add the meat, sear on all sides and remove. Add 2 more tablespoons of the oil to the same pan and saute 3/4 of the onions (about 6 cups) until they are limp. Add the turmeric, ginger, white pepper, bay leaves, celery, 1/3 of the diced tomatoes, and water to the pan. Stir-fry a minute or 2 and let cool. Place the brisket in a baking pan and surround with the cooked vegetables. Roast, covered, in the oven for 3 hours or until a fork goes in and out of the meat easily. Remove, cool and refrigerate, reserving the vegetables. You can prepare this a day ahead of time. Tomato-Onion Sauce: Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the frying pan; add the remaining onions and saute until onions are translucent. Then add the remaining diced tomatoes and simmer, covered, for a few minutes. Set aside or refrigerate overnight or until ready to serve the meat. When ready to serve, remove any fat that accumulated on the brisket as it cooled. Cut, against the grain, into slices about 1/4-inch thick. Return the slices to the baking pan along with the reserved vegetables in which the meat was cooked. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and reheat the brisket, covered, for about 30 minutes. Add to the tomato-onion mixture, olives, preserved lemons and 2 tablespoons each of parsley and cilantro and heat in small saucepan. Remove the brisket and some, or all, of the vegetables to a serving platter and serve, covered with the tomato-onion sauce and garnished with the remaining parsley and cilantro. Cut 7 of the lemons lengthwise, almost into quarters, leaving them intact at one end. You can also slice them thin. Using your fingers, stuff as much salt as possible inside the lemons, close them, and place in sterilized wide-mouth 2 quart jar. Squeeze the juice of at least 4 lemons into the jar. Allow to stand, half covered, at least 1 week on the counter, shaking the bottle each day, or until the peels sink with the weight of the salt in the jar. Then add a few more salted lemons, lemon juice, and, if you like, olive oil to cover. Close the jar and leave out on the counter for at least 3 weeks before using. When using the lemons, merely rinse with water, remove the seeds, and chop up for your recipes.

Add 1 tablespoon salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes, until just tender. (I use a small bamboo skewer to test them.) Drain in a colander, cover the colander with a clean kitchen towel, and allow the potatoes to steam for 5 to 10 minutes. Cut them in quarters or halves, depending on their size, and place them in a large bowl. Meanwhile, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, garlic, egg yolk, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. While whisking, slowly pour in the olive oil, making an emulsion. Stir in the wine and capers. While the potatoes are still very warm, pour half the vinaigrette on the potatoes and toss them gently, allowing them to soak up the vinaigrette. Stir in the scallions, celery, red onion and lobster and add enough vinaigrette to moisten. Reserve any remaining vinaigrette. Add the zest and juice of the lemon, the tarragon, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and toss carefully.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Dust a work surface lightly with flour and then roll the puff pastry into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle. Rotate the rolled dough so the 12-inch side is parallel to you. Cut the dough in half horizontally by measuring 7 inches up the side, marking it there, and then cutting it in half using the mark as a guide. Evenly spread the strawberry jam over the bottom half of the dough, making sure to spread all the way to the edges. Dust the Strawberry Sugar over the jam. Top with the other half of the dough, pressing down lightly to adhere the top piece to the jam. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch strips using a pizza cutter, making about 24 strips. Twist each strip four or five times and then pinch the ends to prevent the twists from unraveling during baking. Place 12 strips onto each of the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool 5 minutes. Use an offset spatula to release the twists from the parchment if any jam has leaked out. Let sit until cooled completely. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 1 day. (Makes 24 twists.) For the strawberry whipped cream: Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the cream and Strawberry Sugar on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Refrigerate for up to 2 hours before serving. For the strawberry milkshake: Remove 6 strawberries from the quart and reserve for garnish. Remove the tops from the remaining strawberries. Cut approximately 4 strawberries lengthwise into 6 slices each, so you have 24 slices, and then roughly chop the remaining strawberries. Reserve for later use. Pour some of the Strawberry Sugar into a small dish. Dip the rims of six 8-ounce glasses in water and then directly in the sugar. Carefully drop 4 slices of strawberries into the bottom of each glass. Use a skewer or offset spatula to press the strawberries up against the sides of the glasses so that when you pour the shake into the glass you will see the strawberries in the bottom of the glass. Hold the glasses at room temperature while you make the shake. Place the chopped strawberries in a blender with the milk and strawberry jam. Mix on high speed until the strawberries break down into very small pieces. Add the softened strawberry ice cream and mix until blended. Pour the shake into the prepared glasses; top with whipped cream. Serve with 2 twists and garnish with a whole strawberry by cutting a small slit in the bottom of the strawberry and resting it on the rim. Serve immediately. Place the freeze-dried strawberries, sugar and cinnamon in a food processor and process until finely ground and blended; the sugar should be as fine as bartender&#39;s sugar.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with heavy foil. Place a baking rack over the lined sheet tray and arrange the bacon slices across the rack next to each other, not overlapping. In a small bowl, whisk the maple syrup and mustard. Generously spoon over the top of the bacon, and bake 12 to 15 minutes. Turn the bacon over and baste with syrup mixture. Bake an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until the bacon has reached desired crispiness. Carefully remove the pan from the oven. Sprinkle hot bacon with a scant pinch of finely ground black pepper. Let the bacon rest on the rack for 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46841,&quot;Basil Oil 2 bunches fresh basil, stems removed 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Juice of 1 lemon Instructions: Add the basil to boiling water for 45 seconds to 1 minute. Remove to a bowl of ice water to stop it from further cooking. Dry and add to a blender. Add the olive oil and blend until smooth. Strain through cheesecloth into a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the lemon juice right before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46842,&quot;Aunt TC&#39;s Lemon-Lime Soda Cake 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus additional for greasing 3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted, plus additional for the pan 3 cups granulated sugar 5 large eggs 2 tablespoons lemon extract 1 cup lemon-lime soda, such as 7Up 3 cups sifted confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup milk 3 tablespoons lemon-lime soda, such as 7Up 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Generously grease and flour a fluted 10- to 12-cup Bundt pan. Beat the granulated sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the flour 1 cup at a time, blending well after each addition, until the batter is smooth; stir in the lemon extract. Mix the lemon-lime soda into the batter and pour into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. For the glaze: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, lemon-lime soda and extracts together in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until the glaze is smooth. Pierce holes in the cake with a skewer. Pour 1/4 cup glaze over the cake. Flip the cake onto a serving plate to remove from the pan, then pour the remaining glaze on top. The cake can be served immediately, but tastes even better the longer it sits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 46843,&quot;Individual Shrimp Scampi Pizzas 1 (12-oz) package of SeaPak Shrimp Scampi 1 pound store bought pizza dough, fresh or frozen (thawed) 1 cup diced grape or cherry tomatoes ? cup shredded mozzarella cheese ? cup grated parmesan cheese Zest of 1 lemon 1 cup arugula Instructions: Preheat oven to 450F. Prepare scampi according to package directions and keep warm. Spray two large baking sheets with non-stick cooking spray and set aside. Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces, and using your hands, stretch each into a 6-inch pizza crust. Place the crusts on the baking sheets. Brush some of the warm scampi juice on each of the dough discs and top with the diced tomatoes. Bake for 15 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom to ensure even cooking. After 15 minutes remove from the oven and divide the shrimp scampi between the 4 pizzas. Top each with mozzarella cheese and put back in the oven for another 3-5 minutes. In a small bowl, toss the Parmesan cheese, lemon zest and arugula. Remove the pizzas from the oven (the crust should be a golden brown). Top each pizza with the arugula mixture and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 46844,&quot;Easiest-Ever Mashed Potatoes 2 pounds russet potatoes (about 4 medium) 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for cooking the potatoes 4 to 8 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 to 1 cup whole milk Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Lightly scrub the potatoes. Put them in a large saucepan with cold water to cover by about 3 inches and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 40 to 45 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander in the sink. Let the potatoes cool just until you can handle them--hot potatoes make better mashed. Meanwhile, melt the butter in the pan over low heat. Hold the potatoes in a towel or in a kitchen glove and gently peel the potato skins off with a knife or your fingers. Quarter the potatoes and put then in the pan. Heat the milk in a microwave-safe measuring cup or bowl until hot. Mash the potatoes with the butter with a fork or potato masher if you have one, until most of the lumps are gone and the potatoes are smooth and fluffy. Then stir in the milk, until the mashed potatoes are light and smooth, if there are still lumps paddle them smooth with a wooden spoon. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt or to taste, and pepper, to taste. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46845,&quot;Grilled Red Snapper with Roasted Eggplant and Peppers 1 to 1 1/2 pounds tiny baby eggplant or purple Oriental eggplant, halved 2 to 3 fresh sweet red peppers, cored and quartered 1/3 cup pure olive oil, plus olive oil to brush on grill 2 (2 1/2 to 3 pound) whole red snappers* 8 sprigs fresh rosemary 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Instructions: Prepare an outdoor barbecue grill with good charcoal briquets or wood chips stacked against one side of the grill and let them burn until ash white. Brush the grill lightly with olive oil, then brush the eggplant and peppers lightly with the oil. Place them skin-side down on the opposite side of the grill -- not over direct heat. Roast 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until well grilled and cooked. Remove to a warm platter and reserve while grilling the fish. Brush the outside of each fish with olive oil. Fill the cavity of each fish with 2 sprigs of rosemary. Rub the garlic on the outside of the fish. Season with salt and pepper, and grill the fish in the same indirect manner 8 to 10 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, remove the leaves from the remaining 4 sprigs of rosemary. Discard the stems, coarsely chop the leaves and reserve. Remove the fish to second platter and cool 5 or 6 minutes. Because the fish has already been cooked, it can be filleted easily by running a sharp knife along the dorsal fin and lifting the fillet away from the bones using two forks to tease it free gently. Place the first fillet on a serving plate, turn over the fish, and repeat the filleting process for the second side. Serve 1 fish fillet to each person, accompanied with the grilled vegetables. Drizzle each serving with some of the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with the chopped rosemary. *If you substitute fillets for whole fish, keep in mind that they can be tricky to grill and that they cook in half the time. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 46846,&quot;Snap Pea Salad with Tarragon and Fennel 2 tablespoons orange juice, plus 1 teaspoon zest 2 teaspoons hot sauce 1 tablespoon sugar 1/4 cup olive oil, divided Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 fennel bulbs, thinly sliced, fronds reserved for garnish 1/4 pound fresh sugar snap peas, about 2 cups 1/2 cup loosely packed tarragon leaves Instructions: In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, hot sauce, sugar and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and set aside.<br> Warm the remaining olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the fennel and saute for 3 minutes. Stir in the peas along with the orange zest and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Saute until the peas turn bright green, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Pour the vinaigrette over the fennel mixture. Transfer the fennel mixture to serving bowl and toss in the tarragon to release fragrance and wilt slightly. Garnish with reserved fennel fronds and serve slightly warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gruner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 46847,&quot;Kochman&#39;s Fish Tacos One 8-ounce package black quinoa Sea salt 1 teaspoon butter 1 teaspoon garlic powder 3 ripe avocados 1 jalapeno pepper 1 red onion 1 red bell pepper 2 limes Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 mango 4 plum tomatoes 1/2 white onion 1 bunch fresh cilantro 3 limes Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lime, juiced Extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound snapper or grouper (see Cook&#39;s Note, below) Ground cumin Garlic powder Jerk spice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup white wine 12 soft corn tortillas, warmed for serving Greek yogurt, for serving<br> Instructions: For the quinoa: In a small pot, bring 3 cups water to a boil.

Pierce with the point of a knife to check. Meanwhile, cook the kale, which you&#39;ve roughly torn into pieces, in boiling salted water for about 5 minutes (if it&#39;s tough) and drain. Then heat the oil in a frying pan, throw in the chopped chorizo, add the drained cannellini and, stirring, warm everything through, moistening with a couple of tablespoons or so of the chicken stock - or more if you want this soupier. Tip the beans and chorizo into a shallow bowl or lipped plate, roughly arrange the kale on top (drizzling with a little extra-virgin olive oil if you like) and then lift the cooked chicken out of the stock with a spatula and sit this on top of the kale.
