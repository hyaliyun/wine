powder 2 teaspoons lime juice teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Toss all of the ingredients together in a bowl. Spread on a baking sheet and bake 5 minutes, or until lightly browned, shaking the pan once or twice. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 46855,&quot;Cookie Butter Fudge Cooking spray 1 pound white chocolate, chopped 1 1/4 cups creamy cookie butter (speculoos) 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons molasses White nonpareils, for topping Instructions: Line an 8-inch square baking dish with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides; lightly coat the foil with cooking spray. Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Combine the white chocolate, cookie butter and salt in a large heatproof bowl and set it over the saucepan (do not let the bowl touch the water). Cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture is completely melted and smooth. (Reduce the heat if steam sputters around the bowl \u2014 you want to prevent any water from getting in the chocolate and causing it to seize.) Remove the bowl from the pan and stir in the molasses. Wipe the water from the bottom of the bowl, then pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Spread evenly with a rubber spatula and top with white nonpareils. Let set at room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled but not hard, about 30 minutes. Lift the fudge out of the baking dish and peel off the foil. Cut into 1-inch squares with a sharp knife. (If the fudge is too hard or starts to crack when cut, let soften slightly at room temperature, 10 to 20 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 46856,&quot;Giant Sprinkle Macaroons 1 cup sweetened condensed milk (reserve the rest of the can to add to your morning coffee!) 2 teaspoons clear imitation vanilla<br> 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br> One 14-ounce bag sweetened shredded coconut<br> 2 large egg whites<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup rainbow sprinkles, plus more for sprinkling 1/3 cup rainbow sprinkles 3 ounces chocolate (any kind!)<br> Instructions: For the macaroons: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the condensed milk, vanilla and almond extract. Mix in the coconut and set aside. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites and salt until stiff peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the coconut mixture, then gently fold in the sprinkles. Spoon lightly packed 2-inch balls of the mixture onto the baking sheets, 1 inch apart, and sprinkle the tops with more sprinkles. Bake until golden brown; begin checking for doneness at 18 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. For the topping: Place the sprinkles in a shallow dish. Microwave the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until melted (or melt in a saucepan over low heat, stirring often). Dip the bottoms of the macaroons in the chocolate, scrape off any excess and then dip the chocolate in the sprinkles. Place back on the parchment and let cool at room temperature or in the fridge. These can be kept at room temperature for about 3 days or in the fridge for up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 46857,&quot;Japanese Thirst Killer Phosphate 1-ounce cracked ice 1-ounce orgeat (almond) syrup 2 dashes \solution of phosphate\ or citric acid (lemon juice will work) 2 dashes angostura bitters 4 ounces grape juice Seltzer water Slice pineapple, for garnish Instructions: In a 12-ounce glass add ice, almond syrup, lemon juice, and bitters. Fill up with grape juice and seltzer water. Garnish with pineapple.<br> Sells for 10 to 15 cents. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 46858,&quot;Tangy Green Guacamole 3 large ripe avocados, preferably the pebbly-skin Hass variety 1 cup Roasted Tomatillo Salsa 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus a few leaves, for garnish 1/2 teaspoon salt Instructions: Remove the little nub of stem that is still usually lodged at the top of each avocado. Cut each avocado in half by slicing straight down through that spot where the stem was attached, until you reach the pit, then rotating the knife all the way around the pit. Twist the 2 halves apart, then scoop out the pits. With a spoon, scoop out the soft flesh from the skins, collecting it in a large bowl as you go. Coarsely mash with the spoon (or you can use an old-fashioned potato masher or large fork). Gently stir the salsa into the avocado mixture, along with the cilantro. Taste and season with salt. Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface and refrigerate until you&#39;re ready to serve. (Not only will the guacamole improve if made 1/2 hour or so before serving, but also it will maintain its fresh look longer if served cold.) Scoop into a decorative bowl, garnish with cilantro sprigs and you&#39;re ready to set it out for your guests to enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46859,&quot;Juice Pulp Quick Bread Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the loaf pan 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, optional 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 3/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 3 large eggs<br> Instructions: 1 1/2 cups fruit and vegetable pulp leftover from a juicer (We used 1 cup berry/apple and 1/2 cup carrot, but any combination will work here. See Cook&#39;s Note) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F; spray a 9-by 5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray (see Cook&#39;s Note). In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and cardamom if using. In another large bowl, whisk together the light brown sugar, vegetable oil, granulated sugar, vanilla and eggs. Add the dry ingredients to the wet in 2 additions, folding together until just combined. Fold in the fruit and vegetable pulp. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until the pan is cool enough to handle, then unmold the bread onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46860,&quot;Sweet Potato Pancakes 1/2 pound/2 sticks butter 2 1/2 cups brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups pecan pieces, chopped 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: Whisk the eggs, flour, roasted sweet potato puree, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt together. If needed, thin the batter with some milk.<br> Heat the griddle to medium heat. Place two 2-ounce dollops of batter on the griddle. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Place the pancakes on serving dish and ladle 3 ounces of Butter Pecan Sauce over the pancakes. Garnish with confectioners&#39; sugar if desired. Slowly melt the butter, turn the heat up to medium and add the brown sugar and salt. Whisk together until the sugar is melted. Turn off the heat and add the pecans and cream. Whisk until evenly incorporated. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 46861,&quot;American Meat Sauce 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 large onion, diced 1 large green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and diced 2 large celery stalks, diced 3 cloves garlic, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck One 6-ounce can tomato paste 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce Two 28-ounce cans whole tomatoes, crushed by hand 1 tablespoon sugar 1 dried bay leaf Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion becomes translucent but does not get any color, about 10 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the bell pepper, celery, garlic, a generous pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the beef, a generous pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper to the pot and cook, stirring to break the meat into small bits, until browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and oregano and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the Worcestershire sauce, tomatoes with their juices, sugar and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 45 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 46862,&quot;Roast Pork Loin 4 to 6 pounds pork loin, trussed with butcher twine 4 to 6 garlic cloves, chopped 4 to 6 tablespoons fresh thyme, picked and chopped Salt and freshly ground pepper Olive oil Instructions: Rub pork loin with garlic and thyme and season well with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil. Marinate in a plastic bag for at least 2 hours to overnight. Brown all sides and roast on a rack in a roasting pan in a preheated 350 degree oven.

When the oil gets hazy, add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until it is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, breaking it up with the back of a spoon, and cook until nicely browned, about 10 more minutes. Stir in the ketchup, chili powder, and mustard and simmer for 15 minutes until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. While the chili is cooking, get the grill going. Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel. Then carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill to make a nonstick grilling surface. Bring a pot of water up to a simmer and parboil the dogs for about 5 minutes. Take them out of the water, pat them dry, and grill them just long enough to mark them. (That&#39;ll give them a grilled flavor too.) Brush the insides of the rolls with olive oil and lay them face down on the grill; cook until toasty. To serve, put a dog in each roll and top with the chili and some Cheddar. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 46871,&quot;Middle Eastern Pizza 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 large red onion, sliced 1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped Olive oil 1 pound pizza dough, rested at room temperature for 1 hour 1 medium eggplant, cubed 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 tablespoon sumac 1 (32-ounce) can San Marzano tomatoes, diced 1 pound fresh buffalo mozzarella, shredded 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped 1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped 1 1/2 cups French feta cheese, crumbled 1 medium bunch fresh mint, chopped Instructions: Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic powder, sumac and tomatoes and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Make the pizza: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Drizzle a rimmed baking sheet with 2 tablespoons olive oil and stretch the pizza dough to fill the pan (it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect since this is a rustic pizza). Brush the dough with olive oil and bake until just golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant and cumin, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the eggplant is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 5 more minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Add the red onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Top the crust with 1 cup sauce, the mozzarella, eggplant mixture, caramelized onion, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and feta. Return to the oven and cook until the cheese melts and the crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 more minutes, brushing the crust with olive oil halfway through. Remove the pizza from the oven and brush the crust with olive oil again. Top the pizza with the mint. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 46872,&quot;Danish with Goat Cheese and Pear Filling 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup plus 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Two .24-ounce packages active dry yeast 1 1/4 cups milk 1/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/4 pounds goat cheese 8 ounces cream cheese 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 large egg yolk 3 pears 1/4 cup brandy 1 tablespoon honey 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1 large egg 2 tablespoons milk Instructions: For the pastry: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1/3 cup of the flour until fluffy. Between two sheets of waxed paper, roll the butter mixture into a 6-by-12-inch rectangle. Place the sheet of butter in the refrigerator or freezer to chill thoroughly. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the yeast and 1 1/2 cups of the flour. In a saucepan, heat the milk, sugar and salt over medium heat to 115 to 120 degrees F (just slightly warm). Add it to the flour-yeast mixture. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix on low speed, scraping the sides constantly, until just combined. Raise the speed to high and beat for 3 minutes. By hand, stir in the remaining 2 cups flour a bit at a time until it forms a medium-soft dough. Place the dough on a floured surface and knead until it feels elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a 14-inch square. Remove the wax paper from the chilled pad of butter and place the pad on one half of the dough, leaving a 1-inch margin around the sides. Fold the dough over and seal the butter in by pressing the edges of dough together firmly. Roll the rectangle out to a 20-by-12-inch rectangle. Fold it in thirds like you would a business letter. Again roll the rectangle out to a 20-by-12-inch rectangle. Repeat the folding and rolling out twice more, chilling the dough if the butter becomes too soft. Chill the dough for 30 minutes. Lightly roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into 4-inch squares. Place them on an ungreased sheet tray and let them rise for 45 minutes. For the filling: While the dough squares are rising, make the filling. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the goat cheese, cream cheese and sugar until well mixed. Add the salt and egg yolk and mix on high, scraping down the sides once or twice along the way. Set aside in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Slice the pears, skin and all, into thin 1/4-inch slices. Cut these into 1/2-to-1-inch strips. Place in a nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the brandy, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and saute until the pears are soft and the sauce around them thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. For the egg wash: Whisk together the egg and milk. Set aside. To assemble the Danish: Take about a tablespoon of the cheese filling and place it in the middle of each square, elongating the dollop slightly from one corner to the opposite (do NOT get too close to the edges, the filling spreads as it cooks!). Place a few slices of pear on top of each cheese scoop. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the margin of exposed dough around the filling with the egg wash. Gently bring the opposite corners (not the ones that the filling is stretching towards) to the middle and seal with a pinch. Once all of the pastries are sealed, give the tops a quick brush of egg wash. Bake until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46873,&quot;Cheesy Eggs with Buttery Skillet Potatoes 4 boiling potatoes 2 tablespoon oil 1 tablespoon butter 1 small onion, diced Salt pepper and cayenne Garlic salt 3 eggs Monterey Jack cheese, shredded Salsa Sour cream Instructions: Boil potatoes until barely tender, 8 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, cream, egg, half the garlic and 1 tablespoon oregano in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Using your hands or a wooden spatula, mix together until well combined. Portion into 10 meatballs. Set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs, turning as needed, until browned on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes. Move the meatballs to the edge of the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion to the center of the skillet, along with the remaining garlic and oregano. Cook to release the flavor, a minute or two. Add the tomatoes and crushed red pepper, along with 1/2 cup hot water. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then carefully stir the meatballs into the sauce. Simmer, allowing the sauce to reduce slightly and the meatballs to finish cooking, about 15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Add the pasta to the skillet and toss with the sauce, making sure to thoroughly coat the noodles in the sauce. Arrange the meatballs on top of the pasta and sprinkle the mozzarella on top, being careful not to completely cover the meatballs and sauce (so it looks pretty after baking) and transfer to the oven. Bake until bubbly and the cheese is completely melted, about 12 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and top with Parmesan and the fresh basil.

Let cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Generously butter a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan, then line the bottom with wax paper and butter the paper. Tear up the toasted bread slices and make crumbs out of them in a food processor. Place in a large bowl. Process the walnuts until finely ground and mix into the breadcrumbs. Combine the eggs and onions in the processor and process until fine but not liquefied. Stir into the breadcrumbs. Place the green pepper, celery, parsley, tomatoes, and oil in the processor and grind until fine but still with some texture. Stir into the loaf mixture along with the poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix this all very well until evenly moistened. (The mixture may be prepared to this point and refrigerated up to 8 hours in advance.) Scrape it into the prepared loaf pan and smooth over the top. Cover the loaf with foil. Bake 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out dry. Let sit 5 minutes, then run a knife all along the sides of the loaf to help loosen it. Unmold the loaf onto a platter and remove the wax paper. Let the loaf cool 20 minutes or so before slicing it. It&#39;s best to serve the loaf warm and the gravy hot. Melt the butter in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and saute until brown, about 7 minutes. Stir in the flour; it will become very pasty. Cook this roux for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. It will stick to the bottom of the pan a little bit; that&#39;s okay. Stir in the stock, wine, soy sauce, and pepper, and bring to a boil. Cook the sauce at a lively simmer for 5 minutes, stirring almost constantly and scraping any crusty bits that adhere to the bottom of the pan. Serve in a sauceboat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 46887,&quot;Chocolate Kiss Caramel sauce, for the rim Cocoa powder, for the rim<br> 1 1/4 ounces cognac, such as Hennessy VSOP 1 ounce half-and-half 1/2 ounce oloroso sherry, such as Lustau 1/2 ounce Bitter Chocolate Syrup, recipe follows 1/2 ounce Simple Syrup, recipe follows Grated fresh nutmeg, for garnish 4 ounces chopped bittersweet chocolate (70 percent), such as Valrhona 1 cup sugar Instructions: Put a little caramel sauce on one plate and cocoa powder on another.

Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until the salt is dissolved, and the water is fragrant. Turn off the heat and let the brine cool. Put the turkey in a roasting bag, a large plastic bag, or a bowl large enough to fit it with space for the brine. Pour in the brining liquid and seal or cover. If there is not enough room for all of the liquid in the brine, be sure to at least include the herbs, lemon and peppercorns. Refrigerate the turkey for up to 3 days. When ready to cook, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and discard all of brining liquid and solids. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. In a small bowl, mix the marjoram, sage, all the peppers, and salt to make the rub. Rub on all sides of the turkey, and drizzle with oil. Stuff the thyme, sage, and rosemary into the cavity, along with 4 of the garlic cloves, and 1 of the red onion quarters. Allow it to sit on the countertop for about 2 hours to come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the remaining 2 garlic cloves, red onion quarters, and broth in the bottom of a roasting pan. Put the turkey on a rack in the roasting pan. Tuck the wing tips under and tie the legs together with butcher&#39;s twine. Put the turkey in the oven and lower the heat to 350 degrees F. Roast, basting every 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted between the thigh and the body registers 160 degrees F, about 2 to 3 hours. Add more broth to the bottom of the pan so the drippings do not burn. Allow the turkey to rest under loosely tented aluminum foil for about 10 minutes. Remove the turkey from the pan to a cutting board. Arrange the carved turkey on a serving platter and serve with Quick Pan Gravy. Put the roasting pan on the stove top. Remove any large solids, like onions or stalks of rosemary, leaving only the pan drippings, softened garlic cloves, juices and fat. Turn the burner to medium-high heat and add the wine. Using a wooden spoon scrape up all bits from the bottom of the roasting pan. In a small bowl, mix together the flour and butter. Add it to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, while stirring. Cook for about 1 minute, and then whisk in the turkey broth and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and pour it into a serving bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46895,&quot;Old-Fashioned Yeast-Raised Doughnuts 1/4 cup butter or margarine 2/3 cup scalded milk 2/3 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees F) 2 packets active dry yeast 3/4 cup sugar 5 cups sifted flour (approximately) 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon cardamom 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon mace Vegetable shortening or cooking oil, for deep fat frying 1/2 cup superfine sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon cinnamon Instructions: Melt butter in milk and cool to lukewarm.

Lightly butter an 8-by-8-inch baking dish and put it in a roasting pan. Whip the egg whites in a medium bowl using an electric mixer, on medium-high speed, until they form soft peaks. Then slowly pour in 1/4 cup sugar and continue to beat until the whites hold stiff, glossy peaks. Beat the butter with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl, on medium speed, until creamy. Beat in the flour until combined and then add the coconut milk, lemonade concentrate, egg yolks and salt and beat until smooth. Fold a quarter of the egg whites into the coconut mixture to lighten the batter and then fold in the remaining whites. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and add enough boiling water to the roasting pan to come halfway up the side of the dish. Bake until the top of the cake is slightly puffed and the middle is set but still jiggly, about 40 minutes. Remove from the water bath and cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Toss the garlic, tomatoes and scallions on the baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of the oil until coated and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil until the vegetables are charred, flipping them once, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside to cool. Slice the pork tenderloin on the bias into 4 long \steaks\ and sprinkle all over with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking. Put the pork steaks in the skillet and cook, flipping once, until well browned and just a bit pink in the center, about 7 minutes per side. Turn the heat down to medium if the skillet starts to get too dark. Put each steak on a plate to rest. While the pork rests, core the tomatoes, squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins, and chop them both with the scallions to make a chunky relish. Transfer the vegetables and all their juices to a bowl and stir in the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and remaining 1?4 cup oil. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the relish over the pork with crusty bread for soaking up the juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 46913,&quot;Shrimp and Goat Cheese Pizza 16 large shrimp, peeled, cleaned, and cut in half lengthwise 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped oregano 1 tablespoon chopped thyme 1 tablespoon chiffonade basil Kosher salt Pizza Dough, recipe follows 2 tablespoons chili oil 2 cups (8-ounces) grated mozzarella cheese 2 cups (8-ounces) grated Fontina cheese 4 Roma tomatoes (about 1-pound), ends trimmed, cut into thin slices 1 large red onion, peeled, trimmed, and cut into thin slices 4 ounces goat cheese, cut into small pieces 1/4 cup red bell peppers, julienned and Sauteed 1/4 cup yellow bell peppers, julienned and sauteed Instructions: Prepare the shrimp: In a large, shallow bowl, combine the shrimp with the olive oil, oregano, thyme, basil, and salt, turning to coat and flavor well. Marinate for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Heat a skillet or a saute pan large enough to hold the shrimp in 1 layer, and spoon 1 tablespoon of the oil from the marinade into the skillet. Carefully arrange the shrimp in the skillet and, over high heat, saute just to color, 30 to 40 seconds per side. (Do not overcook, as it will continue to cook on top of the pizza dough.) Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Season lightly with salt before arranging on the pizza dough. Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the dough to 4 (8-inch) rounds, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. Brush each of the rounds with the chili oil. Layer the pizza: Start with the mozzarella, then the Fontina, tomato, onion, shrimp, goat cheese, and red and yellow peppers. Gently slide the pizza onto the baking stone and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the pizza onto a firm surface and cut into slices with a pizza cutter or a very sharp knife. Serve immediately. 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey 1 cup warm water, 105 to 115 degrees 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball.) Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.

Reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the rice is tender and most of the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest. Fluff with a fork right before serving. Meanwhile, quarter the bok choy through the stem ends. Halve the mushroom caps (or quarter them if they are large) by stacking them and cutting them in batches. Heat 2 large nonstick skillets with 1 tablespoon oil in each over medium-high heat. Divide the bok choy between the two pans, placing it cut-side down. Cook, undisturbed, until charred in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. By this time, the leaves will be fairly wilted, and there will be enough room to transfer all of the bok choy into just one skillet to finish cooking. Place the bok choy so that the other cut side faces down. Cook until charred in spots, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, scallion whites, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Continue to cook, stirring, until the bok choy and mushrooms are soft, about 4 minutes (if the skillet looks dry add 1 more tablespoon of oil). Stir in the scallion greens, then remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the soy sauce and vinegar. While the bok choy cooks, pat the fish dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Wipe out the other skillet and add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Put the salmon into the hot skillet, flesh-side down, and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook the other side to the desired level of doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more. Divide the vegetables and rice between 4 plates and top each with a piece of salmon.

Massage together for about a minute to work the marinade into the pork. Cover and let marinate in the fridge for 4 hours or overnight. When ready to cook, heat an 8-quart (7.6-L) Dutch oven or pot over high heat for about 2 to 3 minutes. Swirl in the oil and fry the pork, turning occasionally, for 6 to 10 minutes until browned on all sides. Add the peanuts, ginger and pickled garlic cloves. Pour in the chicken stock to cover by 1 inch (3 cm). Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pan so nothing sticks, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the pork belly is fork tender and the curry has a nice, thick gravy-like consistency. To season, stir in the palm sugar, tamarind concentrate, fish sauce, light soy sauce, black soy sauce and pickled garlic juice. Simmer for 5 more minutes, taste and adjust any of the seasonings if you\u2019d like, then serve garnished with lime leaves and cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 46933,&quot;Chuck&#39;s Chocolate Three Way 2 cups 35 percent (light whipping) cream 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: In a medium pot, bring the cream to a boil. Once the cream is boiling, cut the heat and add in the chocolate. Stir together, allowing the heat of the cream to melt the chocolate and create a uniform sauce. You can serve it three ways: 1) Use it as a sauce by serving it warm over ice cream. 2) Use it as a glaze/frosting, serve it warm and pour it over chocolate cake; or whip it to get some air into it and spread it on top of banana bread, carrot cake or cheesecake. 3) Put it in the fridge for an hour or more, and it becomes a chocolate truffle filling.; &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinotage, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah]&quot; 46934,&quot;Christmas Chowder 4 live Maine &#39;chicken&#39; lobsters, approximately 1 pound each 4 medium potatoes (recommended: russet, German butterball, or Yukon gold) 2 ounces high-quality smoked slab bacon, diced to 1/4 inch 2 medium leeks, white part only, rinsed and diced to 1/2 inch Several cups water, lobster stock, or fish stock 2 ounces unsalted butter Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup heavy cream* Sea salt, for seasoning Pinch ground chipotle or cayenne pepper, for seasoning Fresh chives, snipped, for garnish Instructions: Pour 1 inch of water into a pot large enough to contain all the lobsters. Bring the water to a full boil. Remove the bands from the lobsters&#39; claws and place them on their backs over the boiling water. Cover the pot tightly, and steam over high heat about 3 minutes. Quickly remove the lobsters from the pot and chill them rapidly by plunging them into a basin filled with ice and water. Set a wire strainer over a mixing bowl. Twist the tails off the lobsters over the strainer to catch their juices. Shell the lobster tails and claws over the strainer. Cut the tails into 4 quarters, leave the claw and knuckle meats whole, and reserve the lobster meat in a refrigerator. Peel the potatoes, split each into 4 wedges, and slice the wedges into 1/2-inch slices. In a large non-reacting soup pot, cook the diced bacon over moderate heat until golden and nearly crisp. Pour off all but about a generous tablespoon of the fat. Add the diced leeks, stir, and cook about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes, stir, cover the pot, and continue cooking over moderate heat, stirring frequently to prevent browning, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes depending upon the potato variety and the thickness of the slices. (Chef&#39;s Note: I like to mash some of the potatoes with a fork to give the chowder a luxurious but rustic texture, but good mealy potatoes, such as russets, will release some of their substance into the broth, and this step may be unnecessary.) Add the strained lobster juices and enough water, lobster or fish stock, to just cover the vegetables. Simmer 4 or 5 minutes. Keep the chowder base hot as you prepare the lobster meat and cream enrichment. Heat the butter in a wide skillet. Add the lobster meat, season with black pepper, and saute over moderate heat 3 or 4 minutes until the meat is firm, opaque, and pink. Pour in the heavy cream, and rapidly bring it to a simmer. Pour the lobster and cream mixture into the chowder base, and stir gently to combine. Taste for seasonings, and adjust with sea salt (preferably from Maine), plenty of fresh-milled black pepper, and a pinch of chipotle or cayenne pepper. Off heat, cover the pot and allow the chowder to ripen for 15 or 20 minutes before serving. Ladle into warmed soup plates, and sprinkle snipped chives over each serving. Accompany with plenty of warmed common crackers.

On a foil-lined baking sheet toss together the butternut squash, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, herbs de Provence, salt, and pepper. Bake in the oven until soft and golden, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Cook the shallots and garlic until lightly golden, about 3 minutes. In a food processor, combine the butternut squash mixture, the shallot mixture, and the ricotta cheese and pulse a few times to blend. Add the crushed amaretti cookies, the nutmeg, and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pulse until smooth. The tortellini filling can be made one day ahead. To make the tortellini, lay out 6 wonton skins, keeping the remaining skins inside the package or under a very lightly dampened paper towel. Place 1 tablespoon of squash mixture in the middle of each skin. Dip a pastry brush in a little water and wet the edges of the skin. Gently fold the square wrapper into a triangle, making sure the edges are securely closed and there are no air pockets inside. Dampen the two bottom corners of the longest side of the triangle and gently bring them together, pressing lightly to secure. Place the formed tortellini on a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Before laying out another 6 wonton sheets, be careful to dry the work surface. This will help keep tortellini from sticking to the baking sheet. Continue until all the butternut squash mixture is used. There should be approximately 36 tortellini. (The tortellini can be formed, frozen on the baking sheet, transferred to a tightly sealed plastic bag or container and stored for up to six months. To cook, simply toss the frozen ravioli into the salted boiling water and cook for 4 minutes.) To make the sauce and serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the sage, walnuts and cranberries and let cook until the butter starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and season with salt, and pepper. Stir to combine. Then, gently place the tortellini in the boiling water and gently stir. When they begin to float they are done, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, gently spoon the tortellini onto a serving platter, Top with the brown butter sauce, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 46940,&quot;Maple Nut Coffee Ice Cream Dessert 2 pints coffee ice cream 1 cup salted mixed nuts, coarsely chopped or processed 1/2 cup medium to dark amber maple syrup, warmed Rolled wafer cookies, for garnish Instructions: Top 2 scoops of coffee ice cream with chopped salted mixed nuts.

Drain any juices from the turkey and place it on a flat rack in a large, shallow roasting pan. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. Working from the large cavity end, gently run your fingers between the skin and the meat to loosen the skin, taking care not to tear the skin. (Be careful not to do this with rings on your fingers!) Place the softened butter under the skin and gently massage the skin to spread the butter evenly over the whole breast. Sprinkle the cavity generously with salt and pepper. Place half of the thyme sprigs in the cavity along with the onion and garlic. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tie 1 length of string around the bird and the wings to keep the wings close to the body.

Pour the wine, egg yolks, vegetable oil, and salt into the well and whisk the wet ingredients together. Gradually whisk the flour into the wet ingredients to make a batter. When smooth, set aside for 20 minutes. Rinse, drain and dry the strawberries. Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer (or 2 inches of oil in a deep, heavy pot) to 350 degrees. Whip the egg whites in a mixer fitted with a whip attachment (or using a hand mixer) until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, drizzle in the sugar and continue whipping just until stiff and glossy. When you are ready to serve, fold the egg whites into the batter until completely blended. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pot, spear a strawberry with a fork and dip into the batter. Drop into the oil and fry until golden brown, turning once. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 46952,&quot;Crop Tart 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (half of a 17-ounce package), thawed All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 pound mixed colorful vegetables (such as spring onions, radishes, rainbow baby carrots and asparagus), halved lengthwise if thick Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 (4-ounce) log goat cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup roughly chopped pea shoots Finely grated zest and juice of 1/2 lemon 1/4 cup creme fraiche Coarse sea salt, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 10-by-12-inch rectangle. Transfer to a baking sheet; use a paring knife to score a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Poke all over with a fork inside the border. Transfer to the oven and bake until deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack; gently press down the middle if puffed. Let the crust cool completely. Meanwhile, working with one type of vegetable at a time, drizzle with olive oil, season with kosher salt and pepper and gently toss in a large bowl. Spread out on parchment paper-lined baking sheets, leaving space between the vegetables so they don&#39;t steam. Roast until just tender, about 15 minutes. Pulse the goat cheese, pea shoots and lemon zest and juice in a food processor until pale green and mostly smooth. Transfer to a bowl; stir in the creme fraeche, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper. Spread the goat cheese mixture on the crust, inside the border.

Meanwhile, make the dough: Mix the masa harina and 1 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 10 tablespoons butter and 3/4 cup warm water and mix with the paddle attachment until combined. Add the granulated sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, the almond and vanilla extracts and ground cinnamon; mix until combined, about 1 more minute. Cover and refrigerate. Make the filling: Simmer 1/2 cup water and the cinnamon stick in a saucepan until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and cook, stirring to dissolve, about 1 minute. Add the pineapple, honey and cinnamon water, including the cinnamon stick; cook, stirring, until the mixture is almost dry, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the rum, then return to medium heat. Tilt the pan so the rum ignites (or hold a lit match near the sauce to ignite it). Cook until the pineapple is slightly caramelized, about 3 minutes. Stir in the pecans; set aside to cool. Drain the husks and pat dry. Tear each husk lengthwise into a 3 1/2-inch-wide piece. Tear some of the excess husks into 18 thin strips for ties; reserve the husk scraps. Lay the 3 1/2-inch-wide husks on a clean surface. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end, spread 1 tablespoon of the dough down a husk, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the sides. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pineapple filling down the center of the dough. Roll lengthwise into a tight cylinder. Fold up the narrow end; tie with a strip of corn husk to secure. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and filling.

Allow the temperature to reach 225 to 250 degrees F. Alternatively, set up your offset smoker. Build a fire with apple and cherry wood in the firebox and allow the temperature to reach 225 to 250 degrees F and the smoke to begin to run clear. Clean the brisket by trimming the fat cap, creating a fatty and lean side. Trim the fat on the point down to about 1/2 inch. Trim the fat on top of the flat end down to about 1/4 inch. Flip the brisket over and remove any silver skin and sinew from the meat. You will lose around 2 pounds from trimming. Place the fat you have trimmed into a small pan and place on the smoker or grill to render. You will use it later to brush the brisket before wrapping. To make the pastrami spice, add the coriander seeds, black pepper, salt, mustard seeds, chili flakes and sumac to a small bowl and mix to combine. In a spray bottle, combine the apple cider and Worcestershire sauce. Coat the entire brisket with the mustard, then liberally season on all sides with the pastrami spice. Spray it with the apple cider mixture. Place the brisket on the indirect side of the grill with the fat side facing down. If using the smoker, place the brisket with the fattiest part of the brisket pointed towards the fire. Place a thermometer in the fattest part of the brisket, close the lid and cook, misting the brisket every 30 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 6 hours. Brush the brisket with the rendered fat and wrap it in peach butcher paper. Place back onto the indirect heat on the grill or smoker and continue to cook until an internal temperature of 205 degrees is reached, about 3 more hours. Remove from the grill and let rest for at least 1 hour before separating the flat (lean brisket) from the point (fatty brisket). Slice against the grain and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46981,&quot;No-Bake Cherry Thumbprints 1 cup pitted dates ? cup Archer Farms?

Add the onion, eggplant, a big pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned and starting to soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in 1 more tablespoon olive oil, the garlic, chili powder and cumin and cook, stirring, until the spices are toasted, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 cups water, the tomatoes, beans, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover and reduce the heat to a simmer; cook until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, grate the tofu on the large holes of a box grater onto a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth). Gather up the sides of the towel and wring the tofu dry. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu, spreading it out; cook, stirring once or twice, until well browned and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir the tofu and corn into the chili and heat through, 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Thin the chili with water, if needed. Divide the chili among bowls.

Pulse the olives, shallot, garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, 2 tablespoons olive oil and the juice of 1/2 lemon in a food processor; season with salt and pepper. Pierce the steak all over with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Rub 1 heaping tablespoon olive mixture all over the steak, then set aside, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the remaining olive mixture with the tomatoes, parsley, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the juice of the remaining 1/2 lemon in a small bowl. Grill the steak until browned on one side, about 7 minutes. Flip and cook about 7 more minutes for medium rare. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Cut in half; reserve one half for steak sandwiches. Thinly slice the remaining steak against the grain and top with the olive-tomato tapenade. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 46986,&quot;Pressed Cheese Sandwiches 5 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon aleppo pepper 2 cloves garlic, peeled and pressed 8 large slices sourdough rye bread 16 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into 16 slices Coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1 sprig fresh rosemary Pickled Scallions, recipe follows 8 scallions, root ends trimmed 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar Splash extra-virgin olive oil, about 1 tablespoon Instructions: I think simple recipes are the best way to start out the meal. Melted cheese, in any form, is something that everyone loves. I find these sandwiches only make people want to eat more afterwards! In a small bowl, add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the pressed garlic. Stir to blend. Put 4 slices of the bread on a flat surface. Dry any moisture off the mozzarella cheese and put 4 slices on 4 pieces of bread. Sprinkle with aleppo pepper and drizzle with the garlic and oil mixture. Sprinkle with sea salt and pepper, to taste. \Flake\ the thyme off the stems and onto the cheese. Do the same with the rosemary, but more sparingly. Cover the cheese with the remaining 4 slices of bread and cut each sandwich in half and in half again, to make 4 individual pieces. Arrange them in a single layer on a small baking sheet or large plate and cover them with baking sheet or plate to weigh them down. Refrigerate the sandwiches overnight. This will make them flatter and better integrate the flavors. The next day, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. When the olive oil begins to smoke lightly, add the sandwiches and cook them on 1 side until brown. Turn and cook until brown on the other side. Cook in batches, if necessary. Transfer to a serving platter and season with salt. Top with the pickled scallions and serve immediately. The acidity of the vinegar and the oniony \bite\ of the scallion make this a brightening element for my cheese sandwiches. I avoid salt and pepper to keep the focus on the acidity of the scallion. Put the scallions on a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, slice them into thin rounds from the white part all the way through the green part. Add the scallions to a small bowl with the red wine vinegar and the olive oil. Toss to combine and set aside for 1 to 2 hours to allow the vinegar to work its magic. The scallions can be covered and refrigerated overnight, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</li></ol><p>&quot; 46987,&quot;Sonoran Style Hot Dog 8 large hot dogs, preferably 6 to 1s (6 hot dogs to a pound) 8 thin slices bacon, such as Oscar Mayer 4 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature 8 fresh bolillo rolls, each sliced into a \pocket\ to catch all the fillings (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 cup refried beans, warmed 2 avocados, diced<br> 2 firm, ripe Roma tomatoes, diced<br> 1 small red onion, diced<br> 1 cup pickled jalapenos, drained<br> Zesty Mayo, recipe follows Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish<br> Hot sauce, for serving 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon hot sauce<br> Zest and juice of 1 lime Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Wrap each dog evenly in 1 slice of bacon.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add the eggs, wine, and vanilla. Pulse until the mixture forms into a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough into 4 equal-sized pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece of dough until 1/4-inch thick. Cut each piece of dough into 1/2-inch wide strips. Cut each strip of pastry into 1/2-inch pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a small ball about the size of a hazelnut. Lightly dredge the dough balls in flour, shaking off any excess. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.). In batches, fry the dough until lightly golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. (The rested and quartered dough can also be rolled on a floured work surface into 1/2-inch thick logs and cut into equal-sized 1/2-inch pieces. The dough pieces can then be rolled into small balls and fried as above). In a large saucepan, combine the honey, sugar, and lemon juice over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the fried dough and hazelnuts and stir until coated in the honey mixture. Allow the mixture to cool in the pan for 2 minutes. Spray the outside of a small, straight-sided water glass with vegetable oil cooking spray and place in the center of a round platter. Using a large spoon or damp hands, arrange the struffoli and hazelnuts around the glass to form a wreath shape. Drizzle any remaining honey mixture over the struffoli. Allow to set for 2 hours (can be made 1 day in advance). Decorate with sprinkles and dust with powdered sugar, if using. Remove the glass from the center of the platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 47021,&quot;Strawberry White Pepper Shortcake 2 cups strawberries, hulled (green part trimmed off), berries cut into pieces 2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons light brown sugar, plus a little more, packed 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons white pepper 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 4 teaspoons baking powder 1 cup chilled heavy cream, whisked to soft peak 1 cup Greek yogurt Instructions: In a bowl, toss the strawberries with the 2 tablespoons vinegar and brown sugar, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Process the remaining cookies and chocolate in a food processor until they form a crumb mixture. Add the butter and process until the mixture starts to clump together. Press the mixture into a high-sided fluted tart pan, making a smooth base and sides with your hands or the back of a spoon. Put it into the refrigerator to chill and harden. Melt the marshmallows in a saucepan over low gentle heat along with the milk. Once the milk starts to foam (not boil), take off the heat and keep stirring until the marshmallows blend into the milk to make a smooth mixture. Pour the mixture out of the saucepan into a heatproof bowl, then whisk in the creme de menthe and creme de cacao. Leave until cool. In a medium bowl, whisk the cream until it starts to hold soft peaks then, still whisking, add the cooled marshmallow mixture. This filling should be thick but still soft, not stiff or dry, so that it will eventually drop easily out of the bowl into the chilled pie crust. When the marshmallow mixture and cream are combined, whisk in a few drops of food coloring, if desired. Spread the filling into the chilled base, swirling it about with an icing spatula or silicone spatula to fill evenly. Put the pie in the refrigerator, covered, to chill overnight or for a minimum of 4 hours until firm.

Put the chiles on a small rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Don&#39;t let them burn or they will turn bitter. Transfer the chiles to a medium heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Cover with plastic wrap and let the chiles soak until softened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Drain the chiles then remove and discard the stems. Split open each cl and scrape out the seeds with the back of your knife. Discard the seeds and transfer the chiles to a blender. Add the cumin, half of the diced onion, half of the garlic, 1/2 cup of the beef stock, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Blend, occasionally scraping down the sides of the blender, until a smooth, slightly fluid paste forms (you want to eliminate all but the tiniest bits of skin). Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the cl paste and cook until slightly darkened, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and melt 2 tablespoons of the lard (or heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil). Season the beef cubes with salt and pepper. When the lard begins to smoke, swirl the pot to coat and add half of the beef. Cook, lowering the heat if the meat threatens to burn, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with 2 more tablespoons of the lard and the remaining beef. Set aside. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon lard (or heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil) in the pot. Add the remaining diced onion and garlic and cook gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the beef back to the pot along with any juices. Then add 2 cups water and the remaining 2 cups beef stock. Stir in the reserved cl paste and bring to a simmer over high heat, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Lower the heat to maintain the barest possible simmer (just a few bubbles breaking the surface) and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender, about 2 hours. Thoroughly stir the masa harina, brown sugar and vinegar into the chili. Gently simmer for a few minutes until the sauce has thickened. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Serve in individual bowls with a dollop of crema, shredded cheese, white onion and a lime wedge. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 47049,&quot;Moussaka a la Grecque 3 medium eggplants 8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 onions, chopped 2 pounds ground lamb 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 1/2 cup red wine 1/2 cup chopped parsley Pinch cinnamon 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 quart whole milk, heated 4 large eggs, beaten Pinch nutmeg 2 cups ricotta 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Peel the eggplant and slice it crosswise 1/2-inch thick.

Meanwhile, roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch diameter circle approximately 1/8-inch thick. Transfer dough to a 9 1/2-inch pie dish and trim edges so there is a 1/2-inch overhang. Use excess dough to press crust into pie plate. Fold edge of crust back on itself and press, as desired, into a decorative crust. (Can be made 2 days ahead and kept covered in refrigerator until ready to use.) Pierce bottom of crust all over with a fork. Line pie with aluminum foil so it overhangs slightly and covers edges of pie crust and fill with uncooked rice, dried beans, or baking weights. Place pie dish on baking sheet and bake until crust is set and edges are slightly puffed up, about 25 minutes. Gather foil together and remove along with weights. Continue to bake crust until it is thoroughly golden, about 15 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and let cool a few minutes before filling. Meanwhile, peel 1 banana and place in a blender with milk, egg yolks, cornstarch, sugar, vanilla, and salt and process until smooth. Pour into a small saucepan, bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly until mixture bubbles and is thick, about 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter, a few pieces at a time, until melted. Set aside to cool slightly. Pour in filling into the pie shell and evenly smooth with a spatula. Slice remaining 3 bananas into 1/2-inch pieces and arrange on top of custard. Smooth whipped cream over top, loosely cover in plastic, and set in refrigerator until cool and set, at least 3 hours. In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, and sugar until well combined. Using clean hands, add butter and toss until just coated. Rub butter between thumb and forefingers to incorporate into flour mixture until butter is in lima bean-sized pieces and comes together in quarter-sized clumps when squeezed in palm, about 2 minutes. Add shortening, toss until just coated in flour, then rub into flour mixture until mixture forms pea-size pieces (some big chunks should remain) and comes together in fist-sized clumps when squeezed, about 1 minute. Drizzle in half ice water and rake through mixture with fingers until just moistened. Drizzle in remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time and comb through mixture with fingers to moisten. It will go from being a shaggy mess to coming together. Dough is moist enough when it is moistened through but is not wet when pressed. (Do not overwork the dough or it will become tough.) While rotating the bowl with 1 hand, push dough between other palm and side of bowl to gather into a ball. Turn dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, press it into a flat disk, then close in wrap. Place in coldest part of refrigerator (usually back bottom shelf) at least 30 minutes before rolling out and forming into a crust. Yield: about 1 pound dough (enough for 1 (9 to 10-inch pie dish)) Prep Time: 5 minutes Inactive Prep Time: 30 minutes Ease of preparation: intermediate Place very clean glass or metal bowl and metal whisk in freezer just until cold, about 5 minutes.

Cover both pots and bring all the water to a boil. When the smaller pot of water comes to a boil, stir in rice and return water to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer. Place a colander over the pot and add the edamame to it. Place the pot cover over the edamame nesting it in the colander. Steam the edamame 5 minutes, then remove them to 2 small bowls, salt them and cover bowls with plastic or foil to keep warm. Set colander aside and return pot lid to rice, stirring rice before replacing the lid. While the edamame are steaming, before removing them to the bowls, you have a pocket of time to work with. Add 1/2 cup, a couple of handfuls of Napa cabbage to the second pot of water. Blanch the shredded cabbage 1 minute and remove with a spider or tongs to paper towels to drain and cool. Chop shredded blanched cabbage. Combine meat, chopped salad shrimp, sake, ginger, 1 scallion, 1 tablespoon tamari, sesame oil, black pepper and cooled, chopped cabbage in a bowl. Place 2 teaspoons of filling on each won ton wrapper. Wet your fingertips to help seal won ton wrappers. The gyoza should look like small half moons. Place 1 or 2 Napa cabbage leaves into the bottom of the colander. The leaves will prevent your dumplings from sticking to the surface of colander. Arrange dumplings on Napa leaf in colander and steam over second larger pot of simmering water. Place large pot lid over the colander to trap the steam. Dumplings need to steam 10 to 12 minutes. While you are working on this, go back and forth with the edamame as necessary per above directions. While dumplings work, slice the fillet steaks thinly across the grain. Toss with seasoning and teriyaki or tamari and sherry. Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat. Add oil and the meat and stir-fry. When meat browns at edges, add scallions and cook 2 minutes more, stirring frequently. Use remaining raw shredded Napa cabbage as a bed to serve your dumplings on. Plate all of your items on little dishes and in small bowls. Mix dipping sauce of tamari, mustard and vinegar for the gyoza and set out alongside dumplings. Warm or cold sake, leftover from cooking, is the perfect beverage and chilled navel oranges or tangerines make a refreshing end to this meal. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Shiraz, Tempranillo]&quot; 47099,&quot;Chicken Cacciatore 1 whole chicken, about 5 to 6 pounds, cut into 8 pieces 1 cup flour Creole seasoning, recipe follows 1 cup olive oil 2 cups chopped yellow onions Salt Crushed red pepper 1 pound shiitake mushrooms, cleaned, stemmed and sliced 2 tablespoons chopped garlic 1 cup dry white wine 2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes, peeled and seeded 1 cup tomato sauce 2 cups chicken stock 1 bay leaf 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1/4 cup chiffonade basil 1/2 pound cooked fettuccine or spaghetti (tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper) 4 ounces grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Season the chicken with Creole seasoning.

Cover and bring to boil over medium heat. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook until tender. Once the potatoes are cooked, pour them into a strainer, removing all of the water. Put them back into the original pot. If there is still a lot of excess water in the potatoes, put the pot over low heat, shaking the pot so the potatoes dry off but not burn. Turn off the heat, cover and keep warm.<br> In a large stock pot, over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon canola oil. When the butter has melted, add the onions, shallots and carrots. Turn the heat down to medium-low, and cook the vegetables until they soften, without burning or caramelizing. Saute for approximately 5 minutes, then add 2 quarts of vegetable stock. Keep the stock at a low simmer for about 30 minutes. Taste the stock and season with kosher salt and black pepper, to taste.<br> While stock is cooking, make Garlic Confit for croutons:<br> In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add canola oil and whole peeled garlic. Allow to cook until very tender to the touch, about 30 to 45 minutes. It should be like roasted garlic where you can smash and spread it. Allow the garlic to cool a bit then remove garlic cloves from oil and smash the garlic making it look like a puree. Set aside.<br> Pour half of the stock into the pot of cooked potatoes. Using a hand mixer or immersion blender, puree the potatoes. Continue to add stock accordingly until the puree is thick but still pourable. Make sure the whole mixture is smooth. If the soup is still too thick, add more stock. Strain the soup in a fine mesh sieve; this is going to help remove the starchy, grainy feel from the potatoes. Strain the soup at least twice to get a nice smooth texture.<br> Add the strained soup to a fresh clean pot and put it over medium-low heat. Whisk in the 1 cup of the half-and-half, 1/2 a cup of heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of butter. (This is where your palette is going to come into play, you can make this as smooth and buttery as you want.) Season with kosher salt and white pepper. Keep whisking and stirring, so as not to let the soup burn. Lower the heat and keep the soup warm.<br> To make the garlic croutons:<br> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Brush the garlic oil on both sides of the bread slices. Arrange them on a sheet pan and put in the oven to toast on both sides. Remove from oven and spread prepared garlic confit on top.<br> Assembly: Using a 4-ounce ladle, pour a ladle of soup into each bowl and squeeze a nice large circle of chive oil around the soup. Squeeze another large circle of beet reduction directly on top of the chive oil. Put 1 garlic crouton in the middle of each bowl. Garnish the croutons with a sprinkle of finely chopped chives. Fill a bowl with ice and water. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over medium heat. Once the water is at a boil, hold the bunch of chives with a pair of tongs. Put the chives into the water for 3 seconds and immediately remove to the ice water. Drain and dry the chives with a paper towel.<br> In a blender add chives and oil and puree until smooth and thoroughly blended. Allow the mixture to sit overnight, then strain to remove any chive particles. Strain again through 4 layers of cheesecloth. Pour into a squeeze bottle and when ready to use, put the bottle into hot water to bring to room temperature. Puree the beets with a little bit of water in blender. Strain through a mesh strainer into a saucepan. Heat beet juice slowly over low heat and add the lemon juice.

Dredge the veal shanks in the mixture and tap off any excess. In a large heavy skillet or Dutch oven, over medium flame, heat the oil and butter. Sear the shanks on all sides, turn bones on sides to hold in marrow. Add more oil and butter if needed. Remove the browned veal shanks and set aside. Add onion, celery, carrots, garlic, bay leaves and parsley to the pan and cook until softened. Season with salt and pepper. Raise the heat to high, add the wine and deglaze the pan. Return the shanks to the pan, add the stock and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Baste the meat a few times during cooking. Remove the cover, continue to simmer for 10 minutes to reduce the sauce a bit. For gremolata: combine all ingredients together in a small bowl. Strew the gremolata over the osso buco before serving. Serve osso buco with Saffron Risotto. In a saucepan, bring chicken broth to a simmer. Keep warm over low heat.

Add the sugar and place the bowl over a double boiler. Melt until the gelatin and sugar are dissolved and the mixture is smooth and clear. Skim the top, if necessary, and discard.<br> To make the container in which you will create the gelatin bottle mold, you will need a piece of aluminum flashing that is at least 3 inches longer than the height of the bottle and wide enough to wrap around the bottle 1 1/2 times. Curve the flashing, creating a container the bottle can lay in with at least 1-inch of space on all sides. Seal the open sides completely with duct tape and tape a wooden spoon or spatula along the top of the flashing on each side to add extra rigidity to the mold. The final product should look like the template.<br> Pour a 1-inch thick layer of the hot gelatin liquid into the bottom of the mold. Place in the refrigerator and allow to set. When the gelatin is very firm, remove from the refrigerator. Heat the remaining gelatin so it is a liquid consistency if it has started to solidify. Place the champagne bottle on top of the firm gelatin. Pour the remaining gelatin liquid over the bottle, covering the top by about 1-inch. Let this sit until the gelatin begins to gel. Move it to the refrigerator and allow to set until the gelatin is very firm. When it is firm, remove it from the refrigerator cut the duct tape on the ends and peel away the aluminum flashing so you are left with only the bottle completely encased in gelatin. Using a sharp paring knife, slice the mold the long way into two identical halves. Remove the champagne bottle.<br> For the Chocolate Bottle: Fill one half of the mold with chocolate. Place a wire rack so it sits on top of (not inside) a deep roasting pan. Overturn the filled mold onto the wire rack. The excess chocolate will drain from the mold. Allow the chocolate to set slightly. This is important because once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat with the other half of the mold. Unmold both chocolate bottle halves by pulling the gelatin away from the chocolate. If you are not going to fill the bottle with candies or truffles, use tempered chocolate to glue the two halves together to create the bottle.<br> For the Decorated Label: You can either paint the label freehand or use a silk screen kit. Either way, start by using a rolling pin to roll the chocolate plastic about 1/8-inch thick. If you are going to paint freehand, use a paring knife to cut a square the size of the label you would like to make. Mix up your paints by combining the cocoa butter and the powdered food coloring in a 6-to-1 ratio, respectively. Add the cocoa butter slowly until you achieve a medium thickness. The best way to store and warm your paints while you are using them is in a yogurt machine. Use a paintbrush to paint the label.<br> If you are using a silk screen kit, start by melting the unsweetened chocolate over a double boiler. Hold the silk screen over the rolled out chocolate plastic. Using a plastic scraper with a straight edge, apply about a teaspoon of melted chocolate to the silkscreen, and gently pull it across the design. Carefully lift off the silk screen. It will dry almost immediately. Using a paring knife, cut out the label.<br> For the Gold Top: Combine the gold dust with the liqueur in a 6-to-1 ratio, respectively. Use the gold paint to coat the top of the bottle to represent the gold foil typically found on champagne bottles. *Please note: If you are planning to use a silk screen kit to make the label, this should be the first thing you do. Using a silk screen kit involves getting the label design transferred to a silk screen, which can take days to weeks, depending on the manufacturer of your kit. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Riesling]&quot; 47151,&quot;Fig Preserves 1 pound fresh ripe figs, washed, stemmed 1 cup sugar Instructions: In a medium saucepan, mix figs and sugar together and cook on low heat, uncovered, about 30 minutes. If processing, pour hot preserves mixture into a hot, sterile 1-quart or 2 (1-pint) glass canning jars, filling jar to within 1/8-inch from top; wipe rim and seal jar with lid. Put jar in water-bath canner or on rack set in a deep kettle and cover with hot water by 1 to 2 inches. Bring to a gentle simmer (180 to 185 degrees), and process, covered, 5 minutes. Transfer jar to a rack using tongs and let cool completely. Store in a cool, dark place. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 47152,&quot;Grilled Lemonfish with Sweet Corn Salad, Herb Roasted Tomatoes and Eggplant Caviar 6 (5-ounce) portions lemonfish fillets (Cobia), or any firm-fleshed fish that is good for grilling Salt and freshly ground black pepper Sweet Corn Salad, recipe follows Herb Roasted Tomatoes, recipe follows Eggplant Caviar, recipe follows Sweet Corn Salad: 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil 6 ears sweet corn, grilled with husk on, kernels cut off the cob 1/2 cup finely diced sweet onion 1/2 cup peeled and finely diced tomatoes 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves 1 teaspoon Steen&#39;s cane syrup 2 tablespoons lime juice 1/4 teaspoon salt Herb Roasted Tomatoes: 2 pounds ripe Roma tomatoes, sliced into 1/4-inch slices crosswise 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper Eggplant Caviar: 1 eggplant, sliced 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons good-quality extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced capers 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped rinsed anchovies, optional 2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Season each piece of the fish with 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Heat a grill to high and grill the fish to the desired degree of doneness. Place 1/2 cup of the Sweet Corn Salad on each of 6 plates, then top with the grilled fish. Garnish each portion of fish with 4 slices of the Herb Roasted Tomatoes and 2 tablespoons of the Eggplant Caviar. Serve immediately. Heat a large nonstick skillet over a medium-high flame. Add the oil, corn and onions, and saute for 1 minute. Add the remaining ingredients and toss to combine. Allow to cool. Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and toss to thoroughly coat. Place in a single layer on a wire rack placed on top of a baking sheet and bake until moist-dried, about 2 hours. Let cool completely then store in airtight containers. In a colander, toss the eggplant slices with 1 tablespoon of the salt, then cover with a small plate and weight; set aside to drain for 30 minutes. Rinse eggplant slices briefly under cool running water and pat dry. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high. Brush eggplant slices on both sides with some of the oil and grill until tender, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining slices and set aside to cool. Once cooled, cut the eggplant slices into small dice and transfer to a mixing bowl. Add remaining ingredients (including any remaining olive oil), stir to combine, and season, to taste, with remaining salt (if necessary) and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 47153,&quot;Fish Baked in Vine Leaves 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 fennel bulb, halved lengthwise and very thinly sliced crosswise, leaves reserved and 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 6 (6 ounce) white fish fillets, such as red snapper, bass, halibut, perch, mullet or pike About 36 large vine (grape) leaves packed in brine, well rinsed 3 (1/4-inch thick) slices lemon, halved Olive oil, for drizzling Instructions: In a large, shallow ceramic or glass baking dish, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, chopped fennel leaves, salt, and pepper. Pat the fish dry with paper towels and add to the marinade, turning to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spread 3 or 4 vine leaves on a work surface, overlapping them to form a large, sturdy wrapper. Place a few slices of fennel in the center. Cover with a fish fillet and scatter a few more slices of fennel on top. Top with a half lemon slice and drizzle with olive oil. Wrap the fish in the vine leaves and lay it, seamside down, in a large baking dish. Repeat with the remaining fillets, placing them in a single layer in the dish. Bake 20 to 30 minutes, until the fish is opaque throughout; open one package to check for doneness. Immediately transfer to serving plates and have guests unwrap the fish at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 47154,&quot;Caramelized Onion and Cornbread Dressing 2 tablespoons butter 2 onions, chopped 6 large cornmeal muffins, cubed A handful fresh sage leaves, chopped 1 egg 1/4 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup chicken stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes, or until soft and caramelized. Scrape into a large mixing bowl, add the cornbread pieces and the sage, season well with salt and pepper, and give it a good toss until it&#39;s well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, cream, and stock, and pour that over the cornbread. Stir the stuffing together, spoon it into a buttered baking dish and put it in the oven along with the turkey. Bake until hot and crusty on top, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 47155,&quot;Ginger-Scallion Chicken Parchment Pack 8 chicken tenders, about 1 pound Kosher salt 5 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 2 teaspoons rice vinegar 2 teaspoon sambal or chili-garlic sauce 4 scallions, thinly sliced, greens and whites kept separately 2 teaspoons finely grated ginger 8 ounces snow peas, trimmed 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps sliced and stems discarded (about 12) 3 cups frozen brown rice 1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds Instructions: Position 2 racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Cut four 16-inch long sheets of parchment paper. Fold each sheet in half and open like a book. Divide the pieces of parchment between 2 baking sheets (2 pieces per sheet). Trim away the tendon attached to the thicker part of the tenderloin with kitchen shears and discard. Sprinkle the chicken all over with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sambal, scallion whites, ginger, and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Place snow peas and shiitakes in a medium bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce mixture. Mound 3/4 cup brown rice on each parchment sheet, placing it on one side of the fold, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon water. Top with the vegetables, and two chicken tenders per serving, tucking as many of the vegetables as possible under the chicken. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the soy sauce mixture evenly over each serving of chicken. (You should have some left over for drizzling later.) Fold over the top half of the parchment, crimping and overlapping small folds along the open edge to seal tightly. Bake until the parchment puffs, 18 minutes; chicken will be cooked through. Transfer the packets to plates and let stand 2 minutes. Avoiding the hot steam, carefully cut open the packets. Drizzle remaining soy sauce mixture over the chicken and rice. Top with scallion greens, cilantro, and sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 47156,&quot;Mushroom-Polenta Lasagna 1 1/2-ounce package dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound button mushrooms, trimmed and quartered 1 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps quartered Kosher salt 1 small onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 15-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for topping 2 1/2 cups instant polenta Kosher salt 1 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 4 ounces) 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Extra-virgin olive oil, for the baking dish 3 cups grated part-skim mozzarella cheese Instructions: Make the sauce: Soak the dried porcini in 3 cups hot water, 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 2 cups of the soaking liquid. Roughly chop the porcini. Heat 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half of the button and shiitake mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until slightly browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring, until soft, 2 to 3 more minutes; transfer to a bowl. Repeat with another 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil and the remaining button and shiitake mushrooms. Transfer to the bowl and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil to the skillet. Add the onion and porcini and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until darkened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the reserved 2 cups porcini liquid, the crushed tomatoes, button and shiitake mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley; season with salt. Prepare the lasagna: Bring 7 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan; transfer to a large heatproof bowl. Meanwhile, bring 3 cups water to a boil in a separate large saucepan. Gradually whisk the polenta and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt into the bowl of hot water. Cover the bowl tightly with foil and set over the saucepan of boiling water. Reduce the heat so the water is simmering; cook the polenta until the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, uncover and vigorously whisk in the parmesan, eggs and nutmeg. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush a 3-quart baking dish with olive oil. Spread one-third of the polenta in the dish and top with half of the mushroom sauce. Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella. Repeat the layers (polenta, sauce, mozzarella), then top with the remaining polenta. (If the polenta gets too thick, whisk in a little hot water.) Loosely cover the dish with foil and bake until bubbly, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Turn on the broiler. Uncover the lasagna and top with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella; broil until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Let stand 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]&quot; 47157,&quot;Venison Carpaccio with Shiitake Chips and Truffle Oil 1 venison tenderloin, cleaned and frozen solid Canola oil, to cook 1 cup super thinly sliced shiitake caps Truffle oil, to drizzle Fleur de sel and fresh cracked coarse black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped chives Instructions: Using a deli slicer, thinly slice paper thin slices of venison on place directly on dinner plates, making a circle pattern. Wrap each plate with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator. In a saucepan filled 1/3 full of oil on medium heat, fry the shiitakes until brown then drain on paper towels and season with salt.

Remove from the heat and add the remaining lime juice and cilantro; season with salt and pepper. Warm the tortillas as the label directs. Divide the lettuce among bowls; top with the onion and peppers, shrimp and pico de gallo. Serve with the tortillas and lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 47163,&quot;Curry Chicken Burritos 6 large flour tortillas 2 cups diced Curry Chicken, recipe follows 2 cups Coconut Peas and Rice, recipe follows 2 cups shredded mozzarella<br> 1 green bell pepper, julienned<br> 1 red bell pepper, julienned 2 tablespoons sliced banana peppers<br> 1 red onion, sliced<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil Cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, salsa and shredded lettuce, for serving<br> 6 bone-in skinless chicken breasts 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/4 cup curry powder<br> 1 tablespoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne<br> 2 tablespoons minced garlic<br> Kosher salt 1 large white onion, sliced<br> 2 Yukon gold potatoes, skin on, 1/2-inch diced 2 1/2 cups chicken stock<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups parboiled rice<br> 2 cups coconut milk<br> 1 teaspoon granulated garlic<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: In the middle of each tortilla, divide the Curry Chicken, Coconut Peas and Rice, mozzarella, green and red bell peppers, banana peppers and red onion. Fold the right side and left side of each tortilla to the middle, then take the bottom of each tortilla and pull it to the top of the ingredients. Push the ingredients back into the burrito using the now top portion of the tortilla; this is to tighten the burrito. Next, fold the top of each tortilla over the filling and tightly roll into a burrito. Add the vegetable oil to a cast-iron skillet set over medium heat until the oil shimmers but does not smoke. Add the burritos seam-side down and brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and brown the other side. Remove and let cool. Once cooled, wrap each in aluminum foil, place them in a freezer-safe zip bag and freeze. These will last 1 week in the freezer. To reheat: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the burritos from the plastic bag. Place the burritos (still wrapped in aluminum foil) on a baking sheet and reheat until the burritos are hot in the center, about 45 minutes. Serve hot with cilantro, sour cream, guacamole and salsa on a bed of shredded lettuce. Drizzle the chicken breasts with some olive oil in a large bowl. Mix the curry powder, onion powder and cayenne together in a small bowl. Rub the chicken breasts with the seasoning mixture. Add the minced garlic to the chicken, mixing so the garlic is distributed throughout the chicken. Marinate the chicken, spices and garlic together for 30 minutes. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add 1/4 cup olive oil. Sprinkle the chicken with kosher salt and sear it, in batches, until golden brown on each side. Remove the chicken to a plate. Add the sliced onions and diced potatoes and saute until the onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Then add the chicken back in along with the chicken stock. Bring to a boil and lower to a simmer. Cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 45 minutes to an hour. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Then add the rice, coconut milk, granulated garlic, onion powder, thyme, bay leaves and 2 cups water. Cook, uncovered, until the rice begins to peek through and begins to absorb the moisture. Then, stir in the chickpeas. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 47164,&quot;Gnocchi with Vodka Cream Sauce 9 potatoes, scrubbed Kosher salt 2 pounds all-purpose flour 1 egg yolk 10 ounces Parmesan, grated, plus more for serving 2 tablespoons mixed finely chopped herbs (equal parts basil, chives, and parsley)<br> 2 tablespoons mixed finely chopped herbs (equal parts basil, chives, and parsley) 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots 1 tablespoon vodka 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1 cup Gabriel&#39;s Tomato Sauce, recipe follows<br> 14 ounces canned or fresh ripe tomatoes 3 tablespoons olive oil 6 fresh basil leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To make the gnocchi: place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover with water. Add salt and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer the potatoes until they are tender, about 35 minutes. Drain the potatoes. When they are just cool enough to handle, peel them then pass them through a food mill. In a large bowl, mix the flour with the egg yolk, cheese and warm potatoes. Work the mixture until it becomes a smooth dough, then incorporate the herbs. Form the dough into 2 balls. On a lightly floured work surface, roll each ball of dough into a &#39;rope&#39; about 1/2-inch thick. Cut the &#39;ropes&#39; into 3/4-inch pieces. Arrange the gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet. (You can freeze the gnocchi at this point and use straight from freezer.) Shortly before serving, bring a large pot of salted water to boil over high heat. Reduce the heat so the water maintains an active simmer. Working in small batches, drop gnocchi into the water. Cook the gnocchi until they float 3 to 4 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain fully in a colander. To make the sauce: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften. Add the vodka, cream, and tomato sauce, and simmer until the flavors blend, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately before serving, add the gnocchi to the sauce and heat, stirring gently to coat. Spoon the gnocchi into warm bowls and serve. Puree whole tomatoes without their liquid in a food mill. Heat the oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add the pureed tomatoes. Add the basil, season with salt and pepper and simmer, stirring frequently until the sauce is concentrated, about 25 minutes. Remove the basil and refrigerate or freeze until ready to use.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 47165,&quot;Greenmarket Power Fruit Drinks Peaches Water Green Grapes Fresh Lime Juice Pickled Ginger Dried Rhizome powder Apple cider Yogurt Honey Ice Tomatoes Flat-leaf parsley Mint Basil Freshly ground black pepper Water Ice Coffee ice cream Cola drink Vanilla extract Hot coffee Milk Instructions: Puree all ingredients in blender.

Process the mushroom stems and half the parsley in a food processor until nearly pureed, about 20 seconds; transfer to a medium bowl. Add the sausage, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan, garlic, oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper to the bowl, and mix until combined. Stuff each mushroom cap with 1 to 2 teaspoons of the filling, depending on the cap&#39;s size. Give a gentle push to make sure the filling adheres to the cup of the mushroom and mounds a bit over the top. Thread a skewer through the centers of 8 of the stuffed caps; the caps should be touching and relatively snug on the skewer. Repeat with the remaining skewers and mushrooms. Brush the skewered caps with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the skewered caps until the meat is browned around the edges and the mushrooms are charred and beginning to soften, 7 to 9 minutes per side. Transfer the skewers to a serving platter, and garnish with the remaining parsley, Parmesan shavings and a squeeze of lemon. Serve with the lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 47167,&quot;Cannellini Bean Antipasto with Shrimp: Antipasto di Cannellini 1/2 cup, plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste 1 clove garlic, quartered 1/2 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 cups cooked (or rinsed and drained canned) cannellini beans 1/4 cup chopped red onions 2 (5-inch) sprigs fresh rosemary 1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, plus more to taste Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves Instructions: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and the garlic over medium-high heat.

Add the kosher salt until the water tastes like seawater and stir to blend. Add the parsley and cook for 1 minute, and then remove with a slotted spoon. Immediately plunge leaves into an ice bath and allow to cool, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the leaves slightly and then put them in the blender with the sugar and olive oil. Blend until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add some water to facilitate blending. Taste for seasoning. Stir in the scallions and set aside in a bowl large enough to hold the pasta. For the beet vinaigrette: Put the beet pieces in a medium saucepan and add 1 cup of water. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Allow it to reduce until there is about 1/4 cup liquid. Add the remaining 1 cup of water and reduce again until you have only 1/4 cup left. Season to taste. Remove from the heat and stir in the red wine vinegar and olive oil. For the pasta: In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil. Add a generous amount of salt; the pasta water should taste like seawater. Add the pasta to the pot and stir so it doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom as it cooks. Cook the pasta until al dente (chewy but not hard or raw tasting) 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander, reserving some pasta cooking liquid in case you need it later. To serve: Pour the pasta into the bowl with the parsley pesto. Add the beet vinaigrette and butter and toss to blend. Add the Parmesan and finely sliced beet greens, if using. Serve immediately. Alternatively, you can drizzle the red beet vinaigrette over the pasta for a different color effect. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]</p><p>&quot; 47177,&quot;Wild Mushroom Risotto 1/2 cup peanut oil 1/2 pound (1 medium) onion, minced fine 1 large garlic clove, minced 2 cups arborio rice 1 cup dry white wine 2 cups mushroom stock, heated 5 cups chicken stock, heated 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 pound wild mushrooms, stems reserved for stock Salt 1/4 cup (1 medium) tomato, chopped, peeled, and seeded 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter, chilled, and cut into small pieces 2 ounces (1/2 cup) grated Parmesan Large pinch chopped Italian parsley Freshly ground pepper Instructions: In a medium-size heavy saucepan, heat the peanut oil.

Draw 2 (10-inch) circles on parchment, place on an oven tray.<br> Whip the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Add the sifted powdered sugar in three stages mixing well between each addition then add the vanilla. Fold. Add the nuts followed by the sifted dry ingredients with a light hand. Spoon into the circles, level and bake 350 degrees F for 20 minutes, or until a light golden brown. Heat the first 4 ingredients gently in a double boiler. Puree in the food processor then strain. Add the ginger wine after completely cooling. Whip the sugar, butter, honey, and vanilla until light and fluffy. Remove the bowl from mixer. Cover with chilled water swirl and squeeze through the fingers for a minute, drain the water thoroughly and re-beat until light and fluffy. Repeat six times until the mixture is pure white and the sugar is totally dissolved. This keeps very well covered in a cool place for a day or two without refrigeration. Store tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to a month. Melt chocolate over hot, not boiling, water, add the cream, pecans, and ginger, last, after cooling add the ginger wine. Stir well and allow the mixture to thicken. For every 2 pounds of either commercial or homemade rolled fondant melt either 2 cups of high ratio cocoa butter white chocolate or chocolate couverture (compound) and pour into the rested fondant then knead until thoroughly incorporated. If flaking occurs, microwave in 5-second increments until the fondant warms then any rough shards will disappear. Leave to rest overnight before using. This results in a wonderfully soft easy to manage rolled fondant. Warm in the microwave for a few seconds before kneading to use. If using couverture add 1/2 cup sifted Dutch-processed cocoa to the melted chocolate and knead well. Roll out on sifted cocoa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47191,&quot;Wise-Guy Cocktail Fresh grapefruit wedges Orange wedges Lemon wedges 2 tablespoons sugar 3 ounces vodka 2 ounces Campari Citrus peel, for garnish Instructions: In a cocktail shaker, add 4 wedges each of grapefruit, lemon, and orange.

Toast the oats, undisturbed, in 30-second intervals, shaking the pan to redistribute the oats after each interval, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in the peanuts and cherries. Drizzle in the honey. Cook until the honey melts and the mixture gets sticky, 1 to 2 minutes more. Spread onto a piece of parchment paper to cool. For the fruit sauce: Place the raspberries, lime juice and honey in a mixing bowl. Use a fork to smash into a thick sauce. For the yogurt bar: Serve the granola and fruit sauce alongside the yogurt, honey, pepitas and mango. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 47209,&quot;Fruit And Cheese Platter Fig leaves Creamy goat cheese, such as Fleur Verte<br> Bunch of grapes<br> Fig Preserves, recipe follows English Oat Crackers, recipe follows 2 teaspoons grated orange zest (2 oranges) 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice<br> 3 3/4 cups sugar<br> 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise<br> 2 pounds fresh ripe purple figs, stems removed and halved lengthwise<br> 3 cups old-fashioned oats, such as Quaker 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 pound (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, 1/2-inch-diced<br> 3/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 cup lukewarm water<br> Fleur de sel<br> Instructions: Line a wooden board or flat dish with fig leaves and artfully arrange the goat cheese, grapes, preserves and crackers on top. Place the orange zest and orange juice in a medium (10-inch) heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset. Add the sugar, vanilla bean, and figs to the pot. Cover and bring to a full boil over medium heat. (Don&#39;t worry; it may look dry.) Stir the mixture and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Lower the heat, and cook uncovered at a full simmer for 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the little bubbles to be throughout the pot, not just at the edges. After 45 minutes, refrigerate a small amount of the liquid to see if it becomes syrupy. It should be like a soft fruit preserve. Keep cooking just until the liquid starts to gel when cold. If the liquid is too firm, add a little orange juice or water, cook for a minute, and test it again until it&#39;s right. Depending on how ripe the figs are, they will probably keep their shape, but it&#39;s fine if they don&#39;t. Discard the vanilla bean and serve or refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper. Place the oats, flour, brown sugar, and kosher salt in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pulse for 45 to 60 seconds, until the oats are coarsely ground. Add the butter and pulse 15 to 20 times, until the butter is the size of peas. Dissolve the baking soda in the lukewarm water and drizzle it over the crumbs in the food processor. Pulse until the mixture is evenly moistened and can be pressed into balls that will hold together. With a medium (1 3/4-inch) ice cream scoop or two spoons, scoop the dough into your hands and roll them into round balls. Evenly space 12 balls on the prepared sheet pans. Flour the bottom of a flat-bottomed 3-inch-diameter drinking glass and use it to flatten each cracker to 1/8 inch thick and about 3 inches in diameter. The crackers will not be perfectly round. If there is a lot of flour on the crackers, turn them over with a metal spatula. Sprinkle with the fleur de sel and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on the edges. Serve warm or at room temperature. \Cooking for Jeffrey\ by Ina Garten ? Clarkson Potter 2016. Provided courtesy of Ina Garten.

Sprinkle the sponge with the salt. Stir in the olive oil. Stir in 1 cup of the flour at a time and mix until the dough is too stiff to stir with the spoon. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set the dough in a draft-free area and allow to rise until double in size, about 2 to 3 hours. Line the bottom rack of the oven with baking stones. Leaving a 1-inch border free around the tiles so that the heat can circulate properly. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough a couple of times and divide in half. Cover one half of the dough with plastic wrap while working with the other dough. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and roll into 8 balls. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball of dough into a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than 1/4-inch thick. Place each circle of dough next to each other on a parchment lined baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat the above process with the remaining dough. Bake the circles of dough in batches, about 4 to 6 rounds at a time. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the breads look like blown-up balloons. Remove from the oven and cover with a kitchen towel until the remaining rounds are baked.

Leave them uncovered overnight to get stale.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter.<br> Put a large skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. When it is melted, add the mushrooms, celery and onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook until all the vegetables have softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes.<br> In a large bowl, combine the bread, cooked vegetables and water chestnuts. Toss to combine. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs with the broth, parsley, soy sauce and citrus juices. Fold into the bread mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. If the mixture seems too dry, add more broth or a little water. Spread the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Can be covered and refrigerated overnight until you are ready to bake. Let it come to room temperature first. Cover the pan with foil and put it into the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover and cook until the top is browned, about another 20 minutes.

Add the potatoes and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well. Rice the potatoes into a large bowl. Add the evaporated milk, oil, sugar and salt and mix well. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate for a few hours and up to overnight. When ready to make the lefse, add 2 1/2 cups flour to the potato mixture and mix well. The dough should be sticky and hold together, but not so sticky it&#39;s impossible to work with; if necessary, add the remaining 1/2 cup flour. Divide the dough into 2 logs. Cut each log into 9 or 10 pieces and shape into small balls. Work with one dough ball at a time and keep the rest in the fridge. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat (or a lefse grill to 400 degrees F). Generously dust a work surface with flour and flour a rolling pin. Roll one dough ball in flour, then use the heel of your hand to press it into a thick disk. Roll the disc into a circle about 1/4 inch thick, lifting and flipping frequently so it doesn&#39;t stick; use more flour as needed. Use a large offset spatula to transfer the lefse to the grill pan (or lefse grill). Cook until the lefse is steaming and small bubbles appear on the uncooked side, about 1 minute. Flip and cook for another 1 minute on the second side. Transfer the lefse to a clean dish towel and cover with another. Repeat, stacking the lefse atop one another between the dish towels. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 47234,&quot;Chianti Braised Osso Buco with Roasted Fennel and Fingerling Potatoes and Lemon Parsley Pesto 4 tablespoons pure olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 center-cut veal shanks (each about 2 inches thick) 3 whole, peeled cloves garlic 1 tablespoon tomato paste 2 cups good quality red wine, preferably Chianti 4 cups good-quality veal stock 2 sprigs fresh thyme 1 sprig fresh rosemary 1 bay leaf 12 fingerling potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch thick rounds 1 bulb fennel, cut into 1/2-inch strips, fronds removed and reserved 1 teaspoon ground fennel seed, lightly toasted 1 shallot, minced 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt 1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves only 1 garlic clove, minced 1 lemon, zested 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.<br> Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

With a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, stir the eggs constantly, lifting up as they start to cook to keep the uncooked eggs on the bottom of the pan. This process takes much patience and a lot more time than regular scrambled eggs. Keep stirring until eggs, finally start to thicken and become creamy in texture. You should not be able to discern any big pieces, just one homogenous mixture. When eggs are cooked, but still creamy, stir in 2 more tablespoons butter, and season with salt and pepper. While eggs are finishing, melt the teaspoon of butter in another pan and gently warm up the crabmeat. Season with salt and pepper and mix in the chives. Divide the eggs among 4 ramekins, egg shells or toast points and top with the warm crabmeat. This dish is even more heavenly with the addition of minced or shaved truffles.

Pulse until fine. Put vegetable mixture in a mixing bowl, add the mayonnaise and the crabmeat and season with salt and pepper. Be careful not to mash the crabmeat, you want that texture when you bite into the wonton. Lay a wonton wrapper on a flat surface and brush with the beaten egg white. Drop 1 tablespoon of the crab filling onto the center of the wrapper. Fold the wonton in half, corner to corner, to form a triangle. Press around the filling to knock out any air bubbles, then press the seam together to seal so the filling doesn&#39;t seep out. You can leave them this shape or continue on by brushing the 2 side points with beaten egg white. Lay your index finger in the center so you have something to press up against, then fold the 2 sides into the center, slightly overlapping, and press the dough against your finger with your thumb to form a tight seal. Lightly dust the filled wontons with cornstarch to keep them from sticking together and place them on a cookie sheet. (When these are folded they look like Pope hats.)

Serve with Crunchmaster Multi-Seed Rosemary &amp; Olive Oil Crackers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47253,&quot;Pesto with Fusilli 1 pound fusilli pasta 3 cups fresh basil 2 tablespoons lightly toasted pine nuts 3 garlic cloves 3 cups extra-irgin olive oil Pinch salt 1/2 teaspoon cracked pepper 1 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Bring a pot of water to a boil, add pasta, and cook to al dente. In a food processor, combine basil and pine nuts, and blend. Add the garlic and drizzle in the olive oil while the processor is in operation. When the mixture turns to a paste, add the salt, pepper, and Parmesan, and pulse until well blended. To serve, simply combine the pasta and pesto together, and sprinkle Parmesan on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 47254,&quot;Sunny\u2019s Butterflied Roast Turkey with Easy Orange Spice Rub 1/4 cup kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns<br> 1 bunch fresh thyme<br> 1 bunch fresh sage<br> 1 orange, halved<br> One 10- to 14-pound turkey 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cold, cut into small dice<br> Olive oil, for drizzling<br> 3 tablespoons ground cumin 2 tablespoons hot Hungarian paprika<br> 1 tablespoon chili powder<br> Zest of 1 orange<br> Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons honey Juice of 1 orange<br> Orange slices Fresh sage sprigs<br> Fresh thyme sprigs<br> Instructions: For the brine: Combine the salt, peppercorns, thyme, sage, orange and 1 1/2 gallons water in a large pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the salt is dissolved and the water is fragrant. Turn off the heat and let cool completely. For the turkey: To brine the turkey, place the turkey in a roasting bag, large plastic bag or bowl large enough to fit it with still more space for the brine. Pour in the brining liquid and seal or cover. If there&#39;s not enough room for all of the liquid in the brine, be sure to at least include the herbs, orange and peppercorns. Refrigerate at least overnight and up to 3 days. When ready to cook, remove the turkey from the brine and discard all of the brining liquid and solids. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. To butterfly the turkey, using kitchen shears or a knife, cut out the backbone of the turkey. Break the breastbone to open up and flatten the bird by gently pressing down with the skin-side up. Flip over and pat dry. Using your finger, gently release the skin from the muscle of the turkey and insert the butter pieces between the skin and meat all over the bird. For the rub: In a medium bowl, mix together the cumin, paprika, chili powder, orange zest, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the rub in a small bowl and set aside. Drizzle the turkey with olive oil and sprinkle with the rub. Gently rub into the skin. Place the turkey cavity-side down on a rack in a roasting pan and allow to sit on the countertop for about 2 hours to come to room temperature. For the glaze: To the reserved 1 tablespoon of rub, stir in the honey and orange juice until smooth. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Add 1 to 2 inches of water to the bottom of the roasting pan. Place the turkey in the oven, lower the heat to 350 degrees F and roast for 30 minutes. Remove the turkey from the oven and brush the glaze over the skin. Return to the oven and continue to roast, glazing every 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh reads 160 degrees F, 1 to 2 hours. Let the turkey rest at room temperature before carving, tented with aluminum foil, until it comes up to 165 degrees F, about 30 minutes. Plate the turkey and garnish with orange slices and sage and thyme sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 47255,&quot;Red Wagon Pizza 1 pound whole-grain flour, plus more for dusting 10 ounces very cold water 2 teaspoons active dry yeast<br> Sea salt<br> One 16-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> One 16-ounce can whole Roma tomatoes<br> 1/4 cup oregano<br> 2 tablespoons crushed red pepper<br> 2 tablespoons garlic salt<br> One 16-ounce jar mild banana peppers<br> 8 ounces whole-milk mozzarella<br> 8 ounces whole-milk provolone<br> 1 pound uncooked Italian sausage, casings removed<br> 1 small sopressata, sliced into long ribbons rather than rounds Instructions: Pour the flour, water and yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer and mix for 2 1/2 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and mix for another 2 1/2 minutes. Throw 1 tablespoon sea salt on top of the mixed dough; cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. After the dough rests, return to the mixer and mix in 1-minute increments until the dough passes a window test to verify gluten development (see Cook&#39;s Note). Once gluten development is verified, leave the dough in the mixing bowl, cover and place in the refrigerator until it doubles in size, about 2 hours. While the dough is doubling, pour the crushed tomatoes and whole tomatoes into a food processor. Add the oregano, crushed red pepper and garlic salt and process until smooth. Cover and place in the refrigerator until ready to use. Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat the oven to the highest temperature it will allow (500 to 550 degrees F; never set it to broil). Drain the banana peppers. Chop them roughly and set aside. Grate the mozzarella and provolone, and toss them together in a large bowl. Once the dough has doubled in size, divide it into approximately three to four 9-ounce balls. Take 1 ball and reserve the remaining for another use. In the palm of your hand, rotate the ball of dough in a circular pattern until the top of the ball is smooth. Don&#39;t be afraid of the dough ball. If you mess up, just knead the dough and wait for it to rise and try again. Throw some flour down on a clean, dry surface and press the dough ball flat. Once the ball is flat, focus on the edges of the ball by pressing the edge completely flat against the work surface. This will leave a higher point in the center of the dough ball. Now, flip the dough ball over and slowly start to stretch the dough a little at a time from the edge while pushing down slightly in the middle. Again, don&#39;t be afraid: if you mess up, just ball up the dough and wait for it to rise, and try again. The dough should be shaped into a 12- to 14-inch round. Place the round on a flour-dusted pizza peel or cutting board. Ladle some of the tomato sauce onto the dough and float the bottom of the ladle over the dough until the sauce reaches roughly 1/2 inch away from the edge. Do not go over the edge: the sauce will make it difficult for the dough to slide off the peel. Reserve the remaining sauce for another use. Lightly sprinkle the cheese blend over the sauce, being certain to cross the sauce-dough line; this is called anchoring the cheese. You will still want to see some of the sauce through the cheese. Avoid putting too much on; it should be like a screen of cheese. Crumble some uncooked Italian sausage and sprinkle it evenly onto the pizza. Then sprinkle on some banana peppers. This next step is important: Take your ribbons of sopressata and curl them into an &#39;S&#39; shape so they can stand upright, allowing the top of the sopressata to cook faster than the cheese. When building your Red Wagon Pizza, always think of the architecture of the pizza and how it will be cut and eaten. This will help you avoid having slices with no ingredients on them. Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone. If it is not sliding, lift the edge and gently blow on the flour to get the dough to float then slide it onto the pizza stone. Bake, checking the pizza occasionally, until the cheese is golden brown and the crust is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and place it onto a cooling rack to cool for 1 to 2 minutes. Slide it onto a cutting board, cut and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 47256,&quot;Divine Chicken Divan 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the dish<br> Kosher salt 1 large head broccoli, cut into 1- to 2-inch florets, tender stems peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices (about 5 cups) 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons dry sherry (or chicken broth) 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 cup milk 1 cup heavy cream Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg Freshly ground pepper 1 bunch scallions, chopped (about 1 cup) 1 1/2 cups shredded gruyere cheese (about 6 ounces) 1 cooked 3 1/2-pound chicken, meat removed and cut into chunks, skin and bones discarded (3 to 3 1/2 cups meat) 1/2 cup sliced or slivered almonds, toasted 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese 1/4 cup breadcrumbs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and butter a shallow 3-quart casserole dish. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and cook until bright green and almost tender (you still want it to have a little bite; it will cook more in the oven). Drain; cool under cold running water and pat very dry. Set aside. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. When the butter is melted, add the sage and let sizzle a minute, then add the flour. Cook the roux (or else it will taste like raw flour), whisking, for 2 to 3 minutes, without letting it brown. Pour in the sherry (or broth) and cook to reduce it away, about 1 minute. Whisk in 1 cup broth, the milk, heavy cream and nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally to get out any lumps, until thickened, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the scallions and gruyere until the cheese is melted, then remove the sauce from the heat. In a large bowl, mix together the sauce, broccoli, chicken and almonds until thoroughly coated. Pour into the prepared casserole dish. In a small bowl, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the microwave, then toss with the parmesan and breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the casserole. Bake until browned and bubbling, about 35 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47257,&quot;Mini Hawaiian Chicken Skewers 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce (the thick variety) 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger<br> 1 tablespoon brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> Juice of 1/2 lime<br> Kosher salt<br> 4 green onions, sliced 1 1/2 pounds chicken breast, cut into bite-size chunks<br> 2 red bell peppers, cut into chunks the size of the chicken and pineapple<br> One 20-ounce can pineapple chunks, drained<br> Freshly ground black pepper Olive oil, for the grill pan<br> Instructions: Add the teriyaki sauce to a bowl and stir in the ginger, brown sugar, crushed red pepper, garlic, lime juice, a pinch of salt and half of the green onions; set aside.

Instructions: To heat the flour, place it in a microwave safe bowl and microwave in 30 second increments, stirring after each, until an instant read thermometer stuck into a few different spots of the flour reaches 180 degrees F. Let cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together 3 cups of the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, cream cheese and granulated sugar until fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the applesauce and mix until combined. Mix in the vanilla and almond extracts. Add the dry ingredients and mix until combined. Divide the dough among 3 bowls and add food coloring, keeping the colors separate. Wearing disposable gloves, knead in the color by hand, or stir it in with a spatula, until homogenous. If you don&#39;t have gloves, you can use a zip-top plastic bag. You can play with and bake the dough now (dust with a little more flour if it gets sticky) or you can put it in an airtight container and refrigerate for an hour or overnight to play with and bake later. Roll each batch of dough into a log about 2 1/2 feet long and 1 inch wide. Line up the three logs of dough and cut each into 6 equal portions. Twist one portion of each of the colored doughs together and roll into a ball to create the desired tie-dye pattern. Roll in sanding sugar, place on the prepared baking sheet and gently press down using your hand. Repeat with the remaining dough, placing the finished cookies an inch apart. Bake until very lightly browned on the bottom but still gooey on the inside, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Pulse, pulse, pulse until the mixture looks like finely grated cheese. Add half of the ice water and pulse again. The mixture should start to come together to form a rough ball; if it still seems dry, add the remaining ice water and pulse until it has formed a rough ball. Remove the mixture from the food processor to a clean work surface and form it into 2 discs. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (This can be done a few days in advance.) Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine blueberries, lemon zest and juice, sugar and cornstarch in a large bowl. Toss to combine. Set aside. Remove dough from the refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes before using to allow it to soften up a bit. Dust the dough and a work surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll one disc of dough out, rotating the dough a quarter turn after each roll and dusting lightly with flour if it feels tacky, into an even 11-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Butter a 9-inch pie plate and lay the dough in the plate. (There should be about 1/2-inch dough hanging over the sides. If there is more than that, trim it with a sharp pair of kitchen shears.) Fold the dough underneath itself around the rim of the pie plate and pinch or crimp into desired shape. Roll out second disc of dough and slice into 1 1/2-inch strips.

Peel and chop the garlic, quarter the tomatoes and get your wine ready. Add the pasta to the boiling water with a good pinch of salt and cook according to packet instructions until al dente. About 5 minutes before your pasta is ready, get ready to start cooking - you&#39;ll have to be quick about this, so no mucking about! Put 4 generous lugs of extra-virgin olive oil into the hot pan and add the garlic, parsley stalks and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Crumble in the dried cl and add the chopped tomatoes. Stir everything around constantly and just as the garlic starts to colour, tip in the clams and pour in the wine. It will splutter and steam, so give everything a good shake and put the lid on the pan. After about 3 or 4 minutes the clams will start to open, so keep shuffling the pan around until all of them have opened. Take the pan off the heat. Get rid of any clams that haven&#39;t opened.

Then cover with a layer of carrot, keeping carrots in as straight a line as possible. Next layer green bean mixture over carrots. With a spatula layer some plain chicken binder on top of green beans just enough to barely coat them. Then set a row of black olives down the center. Dot olives with a paper thin layer of plain chicken binder. Then repeat green bean layer, then top with the carrot layer and finally a layer of chicken binder which should entirely cover vegetables. Cover the top with buttered brown paper pressing paper directly on top of terrine. Cover top with foil. Tap the loaf pan on the counter a few times to eliminate air bubbles.

Top the warm cinnamon buns with icing and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 47298,&quot;Bananas Foster 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter 1 cup brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 cup banana liqueur 4 bananas, cut in 1/2 lengthwise, then halved 1/4 cup dark rum 4 scoops vanilla ice cream Instructions: Combine the butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a flambe pan or skillet. Place the pan over low heat either on an alcohol burner or on top of the stove, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the banana liqueur and then place the bananas in the pan. When the banana sections soften and begin to brown, carefully add the rum. Continue to cook the sauce until the rum is hot, then tip the pan slightly to ignite the rum. When the flames subside, lift the bananas out of the pan and place 4 pieces over each portion of ice cream. Generously spoon the warm sauce over the top of the ice cream and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 47299,&quot;Bourbon Pecan Chocolate Truffles 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped (not chips) 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons bourbon 1/3 cup finely chopped toasted pecans Instructions: Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it just comes to a boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate and stir once to mix the chocolate and cream together. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Uncover and whisk until smooth and shiny. Microwave in 10 second increments if there are any un-melted lumps of chocolate. Stir in the bourbon. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly against the surface of the chocolate and set aside in a cool place until the chocolate is thick and firm enough to hold its shape when rolled, about 2 hours. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Use 2 spoons to drop small mounds of chocolate onto the baking sheet. Then, with cold hands, roll each truffle between your open palms to make smooth round balls. You may need to run your hands under cool water frequently as you work. Put the pecans on a plate and roll each truffle until well coated. Refrigerate until very cold. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Port, Tawny Port, Sherry]&quot; 47300,&quot;Cauliflower \Mac\ with Bacon and Smoked Gouda 1/2 pound thick-cut bacon (about 8 slices) 1 large (1- to 1 1/2-pound) head cauliflower<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 1/2 cups whole milk, or more as necessary 3/4 pound shredded smoked Gouda Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and lay the bacon out on top. Bake until crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut off the green leaves from the cauliflower. Using your hands or a knife, cut the florets away from the core. Remove the bacon from the baking sheet and set aside. Put the cauliflower on the baking sheet and, using a heatproof spatula, toss with the bacon fat left behind. Spread out in an even layer, sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and some pepper and roast until golden brown, about 20 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, in a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until a thick paste forms and turns golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the milk 1/2-cup at a time, whisking well between each addition, and bring to a bare simmer. Whisk in two-thirds of the smoked Gouda until melted. If the sauce is too thick, add more milk, 1/4-cup at a time, until the desired consistency is reached. Place the roasted cauliflower in 13-by-9-inch baking dish or large oval casserole. Crumble the bacon over the cauliflower, then pour the cheese sauce over the top, making sure all the florets are covered. Sprinkle with remaining Gouda and bake until the cheese is bubbling and the top is golden brown, 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 47301,&quot;Potato and Chorizo Omelet with a Kinda Parsley Salad 4 small waxy potatoes, scrubbed and cut into chunks 6 large free-range or organic eggs Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces Spanish chorizo sausage, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves picked 2 shallots, peeled and very finely sliced 1 lemon, juiced Extra-virgin olive oil 1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked Instructions: This omelet is a cross between a Spanish tortilla and an Italian frittata. It&#39;s Spanish because of the chorizo and potato, but a little Italian too because I like to finish it off in the oven instead of on the burner, so it puffs up like a souffle. It has all the things I love in it - potatoes, sausage and eggs. Preheat your oven to high, or get your broiler nice and hot. Put the potatoes into a saucepan of boiling salted water and simmer them until cooked, then drain in a colander and leave to steam dry. Beat the eggs with a fork in a large mixing bowl, season well with salt and pepper, and set aside. Heat a 7 or 8-inch nonstick, ovenproof frying pan. Add the chorizo slices and the potato chunks. The chorizo will start to sizzle, releasing all its tasty oils and spices. After a couple of minutes, when everything&#39;s lightly golden and crisp, remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Sprinkle the rosemary leaves into the hot fat. As soon as they hit the pan, they&#39;ll start to crisp up immediately pour the beaten eggs on top, adding the potatoes and chorizo and spreading everything out evenly. Place the whole pan in the preheated oven or under the broiler until the omelet is golden brown on top and just cooked through in the middle. While the omelet is cooking, put the shallots into a bowl with the lemon juice, some salt and pepper and a glug of extra-virgin olive oil. Toss and pinch the shallots with your fingertips to soften them slightly, and then mix in the parsley leaves. Serve a little on top of the omelet and tuck in! \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Begin to heat the oil over medium heat but don&#39;t let it get ripping until you have everything else ready to go. Prepare the squid and vegetables: Separate the bodies and the tentacles of the squid. If the squid are big, cut the tentacles in half. Cut the squid bodies open so they lie flat, then cut into 1/4-inch-thick, 1 1/2-inch-long strips. Soak the squid in the milk while you prepare the rest of the fritto misto. Trim the artichoke stems and remove the outer leaves. Slice them very thinly through the stem end. (If you have true baby artichokes, you don&#39;t have to worry about the choke; if you can only find large artichokes, remove the spiny choke before slicing.) Trim the ends off the zucchini and slice lengthwise about 1/4 inch thick, then cut into 1 1/2-inch-long sticks. Set up your fry station: On a sheet pan or large platter, combine the flour, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Have the sliced lemon, garlic, parsley and rosemary prepared and nearby. Line a platter with paper towels or parchment paper. Increase the heat of the oil until it reaches 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Meanwhile, drain the squid; toss the squid, artichokes and zucchini in the flour. Shake the baking sheet back and forth to coat the ingredients. Once the oil is up to temperature, add about one-third of the floured goods, plus a few of the lemon and garlic slices, and let cook for about 1 minute. Add about a third of the rosemary and the parsley and continue to cook until the vegetables and squid are a light golden brown, another 1 to 2 minutes. Using a spider or a Chinese strainer (or as a last resort, a slotted spoon), transfer the fried foods to the lined platter to drain. Season with more salt and chopped parsley and serve with the lemon wedges. This is best served hot, so let your guests dig in while you begin cooking the next batch.

Once boiling, shut off the heat. Rinse out the mason jar you&#39;ll be using for yogurt with some of the hot water. Fill the jar with more hot water and set it aside to preheat. All lids, bowls, spoons, forks or funnels should get a quick dunk in hot water too. Fill the cooler with hot water to about 2 inches. Fill the remaining 3 jars with hot water, seal tightly and set in the cooler. Shut the cooler lid to allow the whole thing to preheat. This is your incubation chamber, your fermentation vessel, your magic box. Place the yogurt (your starter) in a medium bowl and set it aside to allow it to warm to room temperature. (Resist the impulse to add more starter. Though it seems like a good idea, it actually produces a thinner, more fragile yogurt.) Milking: Run a little tap water in a small, heavy saucepan. Swirl it around to coat the interior, and discard (the water, not the saucepan). This small step reduces the adhesion of milk proteins to the metal, minimizing scorching. Add the milk and half-and-half to the saucepan and warm slowly over medium-low heat until the milk reaches 185 to 190 degrees F. Take it slow, 20 or more minutes is a-ok. The slower you warm the milk, the smoother the final result. Stir frequently with a rubber spatula, being sure to run the spatula over the bottom and sides of the saucepan. All this attention reduces the formation of milk \skin\ (though don&#39;t stress any that does form) and limits the sticking and scorching of milk solids. You&#39;ll know the milk is at or near its target temperature when you see steam coming off the surface and small bubbles forming at the edges. Once the milk has hit its target temperature, remove it from the heat to cool while you finish preparing your incubation chamber. Fermenting: Check the temperature of the water in the cooler (probably still quite hot) and add enough water, warm or cool as needed, to get the whole thing to 115 degrees F (about the temperature of very warm tap water). No higher, please. Really, 115 and not any higher. It is not worth running the risk of killing off the lactic acid bacteria in your starter. When the temperature of the milk has dropped to 115 degrees, pour about half a cup (no need to be precise) into the bowl with your starter yogurt. (If the milk has dropped below 115, just gently heat it back to temperature before adding it to the starter.) Whisk with a fork to dissolve the yogurt, and then add the mixture back to the saucepan. Empty the preheated mason jar-the one you set aside for yogurt-of its hot water. Now, pour in contents and stir well. Seal the jar tightly and transfer it to the cooler. Adjust the water level in the cooler to reach just shy of the lids. Close the cooler and stow it someplace peaceful and warm, away from any potential jostling, meddling or peeking. Now comes the hard part: the waiting. Yogurt wants, needs, stillness for proper coagulation. You, on the other hand, will be overcome by the urge to check the set, take the temperature, offer words of encouragement. Stop! Give the milk its &#39;me&#39; time. Let it meditate. It will reward you with yogurt. Six to eight hours later, go ahead and have a look. Take the jar out of the cooler, remove the lid, and peer into the mystery before you. What was liquid should now be semi-solid. Try a little. If it tastes like yogurt and you like what you taste, refrigerate it and call it a day. More likely, though, the yogurt will taste a little flat. The texture might be good, but the flavor will have little of the lactic tang that makes yogurt so distinctive. Instead, I encourage you to give long, slow fermentation a chance. Though it seems kind of scary-won&#39;t it spoil?-time allows for all sorts of wonderful flavors to develop, and for more lactose to be converted to lactic acid (which actually has a preservative effect). With slow fermentation you get fuller flavored, tangier yogurt. So, once you&#39;ve tasted and tested, raise the water in the cooler back to 100 to 105 degrees F, and return the yogurt to the cooler. Ferment for another 12 to 15 hours. Taste again. I got my best results after 22 hours of total incubation-with most of the last 10 hours hovering between 85 and 95 degrees-but yogurt is highly variable, and you could take it even further if you think it would benefit from still more acidity. Let your palate guide you. When through fermenting, refrigerate your yogurt for 3 hours, to allow its structure to firm up. The end result should be almost pudding-like, closer to Greek yogurt than to conventional yogurt. And there you have it, in a few simple steps, you, you, have saved one of the most perishable foods in nature from the forces of rot, and converted it into something durable and delicious. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47305,&quot;Cucumber Pineapple Tequila Cooler 1 cup fresh pineapple cubes 2 limes, skin removed 1 seedless European cucumber, peeled, plus cucumber slices for garnish 4 ounces silver (blanco) tequila 1 1/2 cups ice cubes, plus more for serving 1 tablespoon agave nectar Pinch kosher salt Instructions: Prepare a vegetable juicer (or blender if unavailable). Run the pineapple, limes and cucumber through the juicer, letting all the juices combine. Pour the tequila into a cocktail shaker or pitcher, and then add the juices, ice, agave and salt. Shake or stir vigorously until chilled. Line up 4 tall Tom Collins glasses filled with ice, and pour the tequila cooler over. Serve with straws and cucumber slices for garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Tequila, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 47306,&quot;Shrimp Scampi Linguine Made Without Wine Vegetable oil 1 tablespoon kosher salt plus 1 1/2 teaspoons 3/4 pound linguine 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 1/2 tablespoons good olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic (4 cloves) 1 pound large shrimp (about 16 shrimp), peeled and deveined 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves 1/2 lemon, zest grated 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 lemons) 1/4 lemon, thinly sliced in half-rounds 1/8 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes Instructions: Drizzle some oil in a large pot of boiling salted water, add 1 tablespoon of salt and the linguine, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, or according to the directions on the package. Meanwhile, in another large (12-inch), heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter and olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic. Saute for 1 minute. Be careful, the garlic burns easily!

Line a standard muffin pan or cupcake pan with 12 cupcake liners. In a pot, heat the butter and stout over medium heat until the butter is melted. Remove from the heat, add the cocoa powder and whisk until the mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda and salt and whisk to blend. Set aside. Using a stand mixer, beat the sour cream and egg together in a large bowl to blend. Add the stout/chocolate mixture and beat just to combine. Add the flour mixture and mix on a low until just combined. Divide the batter among the cupcake liners, filling them three-quarters full. Bake until a tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Cool the cupcakes on a rack completely. For the beer syrup: In a pot, combine the granulated sugar and stout and simmer together until the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the vodka. Set the mixture aside to cool. For the stout filling: Using a stand mixer, beat the confectioners&#39; sugar and butter together until well combined. Add the stout, vanilla extract and salt and mix until creamy. For the rocky road frosting: In a clean metal bowl of a stand mixer, whisk the granulated sugar and egg whites together over a pot of simmering water. Whisk occasionally until a candy thermometer inserted in the mixture registers between 140 and 160 degrees F (or until you can&#39;t feel the sugar granules when you rub the mixture between your fingers). Transfer the mixture to the stand mixer and using the whisk attachment, whip until the mixture turns white and almost doubles in size, and the outside of the bowl feels at room temperature. Add the vanilla and salt and continue to whisk. Switch the attachment from a whisk to a paddle and at a low speed, add the butter a few tablespoons at a time and continue mixing. The frosting is done when it looks glossy and smooth. Stir in the chocolate. Fold in the mini marshmallows and slivered almonds with a rubber spatula. To assemble: Brush the beer syrup onto the cupcakes with a pastry brush, or drizzle over the cupcakes using a spoon. Allow the cupcakes to absorb the syrup. Cut a small and shallow hole in each cupcake, and fill each hole with some of the stout filling. Using an ice cream scoop, scoop some rocky road frosting onto each cupcake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 47348,&quot;Carbonara Beans Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Two 14.5-ounce cans cannellini or white beans, drained and rinsed 3 large egg yolks 1 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving 4 slices thick-cut bacon, diced (about 4 ounces) 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped, plus more for serving Instructions: Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the beans, cover and let cook until the beans are just heated through, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the beans sit in the hot water while the bacon cooks (you want the beans to be very hot when adding to the egg mixture). Stir the egg yolks and Parmesan in a medium bowl until no lumps remain; set aside. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until softened and very fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered bacon fat and return the skillet to the stovetop. Reserve 1 cup of the bean water, drain the beans and then add them to the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, to coat with the bacon fat, about 1 minute.<br> Ladle 1/2 cup of the reserved bean water into the egg mixture, whisking constantly so the eggs do not cook but are heated. Pour into the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese is melted, the sauce begins to thicken and the beans are evenly coated, about 1 minute (if the beans look dry, add more bean water, 2 tablespoons at a time, until the desired consistency has been reached). Fold in the parsley and season with a generous amount of pepper.

Beat together the egg and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat together the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes.<br> Reduce the speed to low again and slowly pour in the egg mixture; beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, increasing the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning, and scraping down the sides of the bowl and the beaters themselves as needed. Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed, until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove half the dough from the bowl and set aside. Beat the cocoa into the remaining half on low speed until well combined, about 2 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment. Drop grape sized pieces of plain and chocolate dough in the center of a separate piece of parchment (the dough pieces should be close to each other). Put another piece of parchment on top and using a rolling pin roll the dough to 1/8-to-1/4-inch-thick to create a spotted dough. Chill to firm slightly, about 15 minutes. Cut out cat, dogs and cows shapes with cookie cutters. Push the scrap back together (don&#39;t stack or roll into a ball) and reroll and cut out more cookies. Repeat until you have used up as much dough as you can. Transfer the cut out dough to the prepared baking sheets and bake until set but still light in color on the plain cookie dough part, about 12 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer the cookies to a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Use the melted chocolate to dot on eyes using a toothpick. Put the pink icing into a small resealable plastic bag and make a small opening by snipping the corner.

Grease a 9-inch pie plate with the butter. Dust the dish with 1 tablespoon sugar, making sure you cover the sides too! I do this by holding the pie plate near-vertical and shimmying the sugar around the edge. Set the pie plate aside. Using a stand mixer, an electric hand-mixer or a blender, mix the remaining 1/3 cup sugar, flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, ginger, garam masala, eggs, milk, heavy cream and vanilla and let it go until the mixture is frothy. Arrange the blackberries in the bottom of the pie plate (I don&#39;t like it to look too uniform), and carefully pour the batter into the dish. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the dish halfway to ensure even cooking. You&#39;ll know it&#39;s done when you insert a knife into the center and it comes out clean. Don&#39;t worry if certain areas puff up more than others as the clafouti cools on your counter it will even out. Serve warm or at room temperature, dusted with a little powdered sugar, and topped with a little whipped cream, if desired. I like it just the way it is when it comes out of the oven!

(on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.) Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days. For a Rocky Road Bar: Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.)

Arrange the ladyfingers in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in the oven for 10 minutes to dry them out slightly. Remove and let cool. Meanwhile, fill a saucepan with about an inch of water. Bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. In a metal bowl, whisk the yolks with 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar until smooth, about 1 minute. Place the bowl over the pot of barely simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar together steadily until they become fluffy and warm to the touch, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot of water and continue to whisk until you see traces of the whisk and the mixture is cooled, 2 to 3 minutes. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the cream, vanilla and 1/4 cup granulated sugar on high speed with the whisk attachment until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running on low, gently beat in the mascarpone in spoonfuls until mixed. Whisk in the egg mixture. In a medium bowl, combine the coffee, cognac and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is mostly dissolved. Using a small strainer, dust the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the cocoa. Gently dip the ladyfingers, one by one, in the coffee mixture and quickly remove so they don\u2019t fall apart. Line the bottom of the dish with about half of the cookies, filling in gaps with half cookies if needed. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the cookies. Dust with another tablespoon of the cocoa. Repeat another layer of cookies and then the remaining mascarpone mixture on top. Dust with the remaining tablespoon cocoa.

Reduce the heat to moderately low so that the water comes to a simmer. Begin pouring in the polenta taragna by the handful, in a thin stream, very slowly, and stir constantly with a long handled wooden spoon to avoid lumps. Keep the mixture at a bare simmer and stir frequently. (It is not necessary to stir constantly if the polenta is cooked on low heat.) After all the polenta is added, stir in 3 tablespoons of the butter and cook the polenta for 20 to 25 minutes. As it cooks, the polenta will thicken considerable; just keep stirring, and crush against the side of the pan any lumps that might form. The polenta is done when it comes away effortlessly from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in half of the cheese, the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, and pepper. Season to taste. Add remaining cheese and stir quickly, leaving some of the cheese unmelted. Transfer the polenta to a serving platter and serve immediately.

Bring to a simmer and cook until the mixture is the consistency of a loose maple syrup, about 8 minutes. Add the syrup to a heat-safe jar to cool while cooking the boba. Place the boba in a fine sieve and shake off any excess cornstarch.<br> Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the boba, stirring to prevent them from sticking together, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the boba float to the top and darken in color with translucent edges, about 4 minutes if the boba are fresh and about 7 minutes if they are frozen. Drain the boba and rinse with cold water (they will be chewy but will firm up as they cool).<br> Add the boba to the brown sugar syrup and let sit until the syrup is at room temperature, about 20 minutes.<br> For the tea: Divide the boba among 4 glasses using a slotted spoon and add 1 tablespoon of the syrup to each glass, letting the syrup streak and coat the inside of the glass. Divide the tea and milk evenly among the glasses and serve.<br> Whisk 1/3 cup water with 1 cup of the tapioca starch in a small bowl. The slurry may look separated but will come together in the next step. Add the brown sugar and 2/3 cup water to a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to medium high and whisk in the tapioca slurry until the mixture begins to just tighten and the water fully incorporates, about 30 seconds.<br> Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 cup tapioca starch using a heatproof spatula until it forms a ball of shaggy dough, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Dust a work surface with tapioca flour. Gather the dough together from the saucepan, transfer it to the surface and let cool, 3 to 4 minutes. Knead the dough until it is smooth, springy to the touch and no longer sticky, adding tapioca starch as needed, about 7 minutes. If the dough feels too dry, wet your hands and knead in water from your hands.<br> Divide the dough into 6 pieces and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Roll out 1 piece of dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch with a rolling pin. Use a 1/2-inch-wide bubble tea straw with the tip dusted in tapioca starch to cut pieces from the dough, making sure to dust the straw occasionally to prevent sticking. Gather the dough scraps into a ball and repeat the process. Discard any leftover dough after this step as it will be too dry to use again. Repeat with the remaining 5 pieces of dough.<br> Lightly dust a baking sheet with tapioca starch. Roll the boba pieces into pea-sized balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. If the dough feels too dry or is cracking, dampen your fingers with a little water and knead it. Use immediately or freeze the boba in a single layer until hard, about 2 hours. Transfer to a resealable freezer bag and freeze until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47363,&quot;All-Bran™ Chicken Roulades 1 pound thin-sliced, boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon pepper 1 small onion, chopped 3 tablespoons butter or margarine 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 cup Kellogg&#39;s?

For the mason jar salad: Start by placing 1 to 2 tablespoons of the salad dressing (or any amount you desire) in the bottom of a 16-ounce mason jar. Next, build the salad by placing the proteins--the chicken and garbanzo beans--in the jar first. After that, layer the remaining ingredients in the jar (try color coordinating for presentation): the red onion, zucchini, carrot, cucumber, bell pepper, pumpkin seeds and feta. Finish by packing the lettuce and kale on top. Seal and refrigerate. To serve, flip over on a bowl or plate, mix everything together and dig in. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 47365,&quot;Crisp Potato Cakes Smoked Salmon and Chives 6 large baked potatoes 2 bunches of chives 2 tablespoons of sour cream 2 tablespoons of olive oil 12 slices of smoked salmon 13 eggs 2 ounces of milk 2 ounces of butter Olive oil for sauteeing Instructions: Once potatoes have cooled, remove skin. With a box grater, grate potatoes into a mixing bowl. Add olive oil, sour cream and one bunch of chives minced. Finish with one egg, mix very well. Season with salt and pepper. Form by hand 4 large potato cakes. In a medium saute pan, heat olive oil approximately 2 ounces at a time to a slight smoke. Fry 2 potato cakes at a time. Lower heat and allow to crisp approximately 3 minutes per side. Once both sides are crisp and all 4 cakes are made, drain on a paper towel and reserve in a warm place. Crack twelve eggs and wisk with a fork. Add 2 ounces milk. Season with salt and pepper. In the same teflon pan add 2 ounces of butter and over medium heat slowly stir in cracked eggs and begin to scramble. Once eggs are finished fold in a julienne of smoked salmon and a handful of minced chives. For presentation place one warm potato cake in the middle of each plate. Then carefully spoon scrambled egg mixture on top and garnish with chives &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47366,&quot;New Potatoes with Grilled Onion Butter 1 1/2 pounds fresh small potatoes Salt<br> 4 cloves garlic<br> 3 dried bay leaves<br> 12 ounces cipollini or spring onions, peeled and halved crosswise<br> Canola oil, for grilling onions Freshly ground black pepper 1 stick (4 ounces) butter<br> 1 sprig fresh rosemary<br> Instructions: Preheat a charcoal or gas grill to high. Put the potatoes in a 2-quart pot. Add enough water to cover the potatoes by 2 inches and enough salt to make the water taste like seawater. Add the garlic and bay leaves. Bring the potatoes to a boil and then cook at a gentle simmer until they test tender when poked with a thin fork, 15 to 20 minutes, though it depends on the size and age of the potatoes. Drain the contents of the pot into a sieve set over a heavy bowl, filling the bowl with the hot water just to warm it. Throw out the water, drop the potatoes in the bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to keep the potatoes warm. As the potatoes cook, toss the onions with a little canola oil and salt and pepper and grill over medium-high heat until charred and soft. On the same grill, heat a cast-iron pan. Add the butter and cook until it browns. Remove from the heat, add the rosemary and give the pan a shake; the butter will foam. When it stops sizzling, add the onions to the butter and cook over low heat until they are very tender and the butter has taken on a pronounced oniony flavor. Remove the spent rosemary sprigs. Pour the butter and onion mixture over the warm cooked potatoes and serve right away. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 47367,&quot;Toasted Millet Tabbouleh 2/3 cup millet 2 cups loosely packed parsley leaves, coarsely chopped 2 Persian cucumbers, finely chopped (do not peel) 1 medium tomato, finely chopped 4 radishes, finely chopped 3 scallions, white and green parts, finely chopped 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the millet in a medium saucepan over medium heat and swirl until lightly golden and toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour in 1 1/2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer until most of the water is absorbed and the millet is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and cool. Combine the cooled millet, parsley, cucumbers, tomato, radishes, scallions, lemon juice, oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl. Serve at room temperature or chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 47368,&quot;Collard-Wrapped Bean Burritos 8 large collard green leaves (about 10 ounces) Kosher salt 1/3 cup reduced-fat sour cream 1/4 cup packed cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon chopped pickled jalapeno 1 teaspoon pickled jalapeno brine 1 1/2 cups frozen brown rice, thawed One 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained 1 medium ripe tomato, chopped 1 medium avocado, sliced 1/4 cup shredded Mexican-blend cheese Instructions: Remove the stems up to the leafy part of the collards. Lay each collard leaf, underside up, on a flat surface. Locate the thickest part of the stem and use a vegetable peeler to shave the top off for even thickness (this makes it easier to roll up the leaves). Fill a large wide skillet or pan with just enough water to coat the bottom. Arrange a few leaves at a time, overlapping, in a circle on the bottom of the pan and sprinkle lightly with salt. Repeat with the remaining leaves. Put the skillet over medium-high heat and as soon as steam appears, lower the heat to medium, cover and steam until the collards are green, tender and pliable, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and use tongs to transfer the leaves to a baking sheet to cool completely. Whisk together the sour cream, cilantro, 1 tablespoon water, pickled jalapeno and brine in a small bowl. Combine the rice, black beans, tomato and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and cut a slit in the middle to allow steam to escape. Microwave at 100 percent power until hot, stirring about halfway through, 4 to 5 minutes. Assemble the burritos: On a work surface, lay out two large leaves side-by-side vertically, slightly overlapped, making a 10-inch wide \wrap. (It&#39;s ok if the wrap is not circular.) Form 1/4 of the rice and bean mixture into a log across the leaves about 3 inches from the bottom, leaving a 1-inch border on each side. Drizzle with 1/4 of the sauce, then top with 1/4 each of the avocado and cheese. Fold the sides of the wrap over the ends of the mixture, then roll up tightly from the bottom. Repeat with the remaining wraps and filling. Cut each in half on the bias and enjoy or refrigerate whole for a few hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 47369,&quot;Baby Lamb Chops with Artichoke and Tarragon Dip 1 (15-ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts in water, drained 1 (6 ounce) jar marinated baby mushrooms and their liquids 1 shallot, coarsely chopped 4 sprigs fresh tarragon leaves, stripped, plus a few sprigs to garnish 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar Salt and pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for drizzling 16 baby lamb chops, cut by butcher 1/2 pound baby cut carrots, available in produce department 1/2 pound sugar snap peas 4 radishes, cleaned and trimmed, greens left on, halved lengthwise Instructions: Preheat the broiler or grill pan to high. In a food processor, combine the artichokes, marinated mushrooms, shallot, tarragon, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper and turn processor on and stream in about 1/2 cup of evoo until a spoonable, fairly smooth dip forms, about 1 minute. Scrape the dip into a serving bowl and place a demitasse (small) spoon in the dip so it can be easy applied to each individual cooked lamb chop. Drizzle chops with a few teaspoons of evoo and season with salt and pepper. Grill or broil 2 minutes on each side and remove to rest.

Lay the wheat tortilla on a flat surface. Spread the Oat Cheddar in a circle in the center (it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect). Place the rice on top of the Oat Cheddar, then the Cashew Queso followed by the chili. Place the 2 tostadas on top of the chili; these will separate the warm layer from the fresh layer and put the \crunch\ into the crunchwrap. Layer the fresh ingredients on top of the tostadas: Not-Avocado, tomato, cilantro, scallions and jalapeno. Now comes the fold. We are after a 6-sided hexagon shape. Fold one side of the wheat tortilla inward towards the center. Continue to make 5 more folds inward, working in a circle. Turn up the heat to medium on the pan. Place the crunchwrap, folds-down, in the pan. (It is important to cook the folded side first to create a good seal on the crunchwrap.) Cook on each side until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Cut in half with a sharp knife, hopefully hearing a crunch. Dip in your favorite creamy dressing, salsa or mayo! Bring 2 1/2 cups water to boil in a small pot. Add oats and turn down the heat to low, then simmer until the oats are tender. Pour the cooked oats into a blender along with the nutritional yeast, oil, turmeric, lemon juice, sea salt and garlic powder. Blend until the mixture is very smooth. This is the moment where things can be adjusted to taste, with more salt, nutritional yeast or lemon as you like. Place the mixture back into the pot on medium heat. As the mixture is heating, whisk in the tapioca starch. Continue to cook, whisking, until the mixture thickens and reaches a sticky fondue consistency, about 10 minutes Remove from heat and let cool (it will continue to thicken). Put this cheese in sandwiches, crunchwraps or puff pastry. Boom. Drain the soaked cashews of excess water. Add the cashews, most of the warm water, and the sweet potato, nutritional yeast, turmeric, oregano, garlic, pepper and cayenne to a blender. Blend on high speed until very smooth, adding more warm water if needed to reach a nacho-cheese-thick consistency. Pour on top of your favorite chips or add to a crunchwrap. Party. Place the sunflower oil, parsley, salt, garlic, rosemary, sage, tarragon and onion in a blender and blend on high until a smooth herb oil is produced. Set aside. Place the garbanzo beans, peas, nutritional yeast, lemon oil and herb oil in a food processor and process on high speed until what appears to be a bright green guacamole is formed. The mixture should take on a very avocado-like green color while some of the skins of the green peas will remain visible. This is fine, as it more closely resembles a roughly mashed avocado with different hues of green. The end product should taste fatty, smooth and rich. Spread as a base for Not-Avocado toast, or serve with chips or in a crunchwrap. Lasts for 1 week or more in the fridge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47371,&quot;Calabrian Spiedini 2 pounds ground pork 2 tablespoons grey salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 cloves garlic 1/2 cup California chili powder 1/2 tablespoon chili flakes 1/2 cup beer 1/4 cup fennel seed Instructions: Season the pork well with a good amount of black pepper and grey salt. Mince the garlic and then, sprinkle with salt to help the mashing process. Using the side of a knife, mash it into a paste (this process is helped along if you sprinkle the garlic with a little salt to help break it up). The mashed garlic flavor will spread throughout the sausage more easily than minced garlic. Add the garlic to the sausage, then add the California chili powder (this is a sweet chili that will give the sausage a strong red color). Add the chili flakes, beer, and fennel seeds and mix well. Cover sausage in a bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Chef&#39;s note: if you&#39;d like to test pork sausage for seasoning, fry a little in a small pan with some olive oil before tasting. Remember, you can always add more seasoning, but you can never take it away! To form spiedini: Preheat a grill. Just before your cookout, soak 12-inch wooden skewers in water for 1 hour so they won&#39;t catch on fire when you place them on the grill. Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. Form the sausage into baseball sized meatballs and place on the cookie sheet. To form the spiedini, flatten the balls into patties, place 2 skewers in the middle of a sausage patty, then wrap the patty firmly around the skewer. Wrap the spiedini in foil that you will use to bring them to the grill. To Grill spiedini: Place spiedini on the cooler part of the coals or on a medium grill. Drizzle with olive oil. Grill for about 10 minutes on each side, until well cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Dolcetto, Aglianico, Tempranillo]&quot; 47372,&quot;Emily&#39;s Spiced Ginger Cookies 4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 1 cup unsalted butter at room temperature, cut into cubes 2 large eggs 1 tablespoons vanilla extract 4 tablespoons chopped crystallized ginger Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

With an electric mixer, beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time until well incorporated. Scrape the bottom of the mixing bowl with a rubber spatula, add the vanilla extract and the crystallized ginger and mix well. Once the wet ingredients are incorporated, add the flour mixture in batches. Mix until the dough begins to form into a ball. Using an ice cream scoop, place the dough onto 2 parchment-lined sheet pans about 2 inches apart. Press the dough with the back of a spoon. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes.

Put the fennel halves, cut-side up, in a baking dish and drizzle with enough olive oil to come up half-way; season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Roast for 30 minutes or until completely tender \u2013 the roasted fennel is the base of the soup, so it&#39;s important the flesh is soft enough to be cut with a spoon. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium flame; add the onion and garlic, saute for 4 minutes until translucent. Toss the thyme into the pan, along with the mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes, until the mushrooms give off their liquid. Add the chestnuts and cook for a few more minutes until they have some nice color on them. Remove about 1 cup of the mixture to save as a garnish for the soup. Pour the stock into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring now and then. Remove from the heat and puree the soup until completely smooth, using a handheld or regular blender.

For the lemon cream: Pour the milk and heavy cream into a heavy bottomed saucepot and add vanilla and lemon liqueur. Add half the sugar to the pot and bring to a simmer (just below a boil). In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar and temper it by adding a small amount of the heated milk mixture to the bowl while whisking constantly (known as a liaison). Now pour the liaison (egg mixture) into the milk pot, stirring constantly. You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook. The idea of a liaison is to incorporate the eggs and avoid making them into scrambled eggs! You want the mixture to begin to thicken so it will coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and whisk in lemon zest, and allow to cool, then remove vanilla pod and discard, and refrigerate until chilled. Place nectarines cut side up in a pan and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Spoon brandy around nectarines, cover and heat nectarines and brandy briefly. Then remove cover and spoon warmed brandy over nectarines. * Remove from the heat and ignite with a long match to flambe. Alternatively, you can grill the brandy soaked nectarines until they begin to caramelize. Allow nectarines to cool to room temperature.

Coat a large Dutch oven generously with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Season the shanks generously with salt and add them to the pan. Brown well on all sides. This is an incredibly important step; do not rush it. Meanwhile, puree the onions, carrots, celery and garlic in a food processor until it becomes a coarse paste. Remove and set aside. Remove the shanks from the pan to a sheet tray. Discard the excess fat from the pan. Add a little more oil to coat the bottom of the pan and add the pureed veggies. Season with salt, to taste. Saute the veggies until they are very brown and aromatic, about 20 minutes. The brown veggies should form a sort of crust on the bottom of the pan, do not let this burn; it is where a lot of the flavor is! Don&#39;t rush this step either, since this is where you will develop the brown color and flavor. Add the tomato paste and brown for 5 minutes. Stir in the wine, chopped rosemary and thyme bundle. Stir frequently and cook until the wine has reduced by about half. Add the shanks back to the pot and pour in 3 to 4 cups of water. The shanks should be submersed, if they are not, add more water. Add the bay leaves to the pan, cover and put in the preheated oven. The cooking time will be about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Turn the shanks over about halfway through the cooking time. Check the shanks every 45 minutes or so. If the liquid has reduced too much add more water. Defat as you go. Remove the lid during the last 30 minutes of cooking time for maximum browning. When the shanks are done the meat should be incredibly tender and flavorful. Transfer to serving plates and garnish with Gremolata.

Transfer to a small bowl, fold in the lime juice and refrigerate. In a large stockpot over high heat, combine the water, celery, onion, carrots, lemons, ginger, lemongrass stalks, wine, sea salt and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a low simmer and add chicken breasts. Cover and cook for 15 to 17 minutes. Remove the chicken from the liquid and let rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes. While the chicken is resting, heat the grapeseed oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the red onion and cook until soft. Reduce the heat and add the black beans, tomatoes, green onion, parsley, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir occasionally, allowing the flavors to blend and the beans to warm, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and spoon the mixture onto a platter. Slice the chicken and serve on top of the beans with a drizzle of avocado yogurt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47403,&quot;Roasted Duck Legs and Potatoes 2 duck legs 2 baking potatoes or 1 pound other large white-skinned potatoes Few sprigs of fresh thyme Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On the stove, heat a small roasting pan (I use one like a slightly oversized tarte tatin pan) and sear the duck legs, skin-side down over medium heat until the skin turns golden and gives out some oil. Turn the legs over, and take the pan off the heat while you cut the potatoes into 1-inch slices across, then cut each slice into 4. Arrange these potato pieces around the duck legs, then let a few sprigs of thyme fall over the duck and potatoes, and season with salt and pepper, before putting into the preheated oven. Cook for two hours, occasionally turning the potatoes, for optimal outcome, which is tender duck legs and crispy potatoes, though both will be ready to eat after 1 1/2 hours. Making leftovers right: If you have even a small amount of meat left, you could bag and mark it up and store it in the freezer for up to two months for future use. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 47404,&quot;Full Moon Sundaes Fudge sauce, heated in small bowl in microwave Fudge swirl ice cream 4 Moon Pies, coarsely chopped Whipped cream Instructions: For each sundae, layer: hot fudge sauce, 1 scoop ice cream, moon pie pieces, a second scoop of ice cream, fudge sauce, whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 47405,&quot;Soujouk Flatbread 4 pounds unbleached bread flour 3/4 cup vegetable oil, plus additional for coating dough<br> 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1/8 cup salt<br> 1 teaspoon fresh active yeast<br> 1/3 cup vegetable oil 3 pounds lean ground beef<br> 2 1/2 pounds yellow onions, diced fine 3 1/2 pounds ground and strained fresh tomatoes 1 tablespoon salt<br> 6 garlic cloves, mashed fine<br> 1/4 cup lemon juice<br> 2 tablespoons soujouk spice 1 teaspoon fine ground red cl pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper<br> 1 cup shredded white low-moisture, low-sodium Lebanese cheese or queso fresco<br> Instructions: For the dough: Mix together the flour, oil, sugar, salt, yeast and 1 to 1/2 quarts water (as much as will bring the dough together).

Mix with wooden spoon until blended, cover with plastic wrap. Set aside at room temperature 10 to 12 hours. Mixture should double. Refrigerate if not ready to continue with recipe. Set 1/3 cup flour aside. Place remaining flour on a work surface. Make a well in center, and add risen flour-yeast mixture, remaining yeast, milk, egg yolks, 2/3 cup sugar, salt, lemon zest and butter. Work flour into other ingredients from outside to center, forming a sticky mass. Knead by hand or machine 10 to 15 minutes, adding more flour if needed, until barely sticky and very elastic. Place dough in lightly floured bowl. Cover. Refrigerate at least 1 1/2 hours. No more than 8 hours before serving, roll out dough to about 1/2 inch thick on floured surface. Allow to sit 20 minutes. Place remaining sugar on a salad-sized plate. Meanwhile, in a wok or large saucepan, heat oil 2 to 3 inches deep to 360 degrees (no hotter than 375 degrees). Using a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut 8 rounds, or use a 2 1/2-inch cutter to make 12 rounds. Scraps can be kneaded briefly, then rerolled. Place in oil, and fry until brown, 90 seconds or so on each side. Place cooked doughnuts on several thick pieces of paper towel to absorb excess oil, then immediately roll in sugar on plate. Using a pastry tube, fill warm doughnuts with alternate mixtures. Or poke a hole in each with the narrow end of a wooden spoon, and force in filling through a funnel. Serve with ice cream, if desired. Wash and zest 4 lemons. Add the zest to the milk and set aside. Segment the lemons and place into an airtight container. Cover the segments with 1/2 cup of the sugar and let sit overnight. It is important to measure out all your ingredients before you start this process as the pastry cream can curdle very fast. Add 1/41/4 cup of the sugar to the milk and zest and heat over medium heat. Whip the yolks and egg with the remaining 1/4 cup of the sugar the cornstarch. When the milk comes to a boil, temper the eggs by adding a small bit of the boiling liquid to the eggs, then add the egg mixture back into the pot and cook until the mixture is thick and the starch has been cooked out. Quickly remove the mixture from the pot and pour into a bowl set over ice. Whisk in the butter, lemon juice. Let the mixture cool. Cover with plastic wrap so a skin doesn&#39;t form. When ready to serve, whip cream to stiff peak, and whip pastry cream smooth and fold together along with the lemon segments. Be sure to wipe off any excess sugar attached to the segments before using. Cook sugar and water to soft ball stage and add one pint of huckleberries. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8 minutes. Strain the liquid and add it back to the pot along with the finely diced apple and orange zest. Cook the apples until dissolved. Strain the sauce and cool. Fold into the thick syrup the fresh huckleberries and use as the filling for the doughnuts. Cook lemon juice with 3/4 cup sugar and the vanilla bean to soft ball stage.

Bank the coals on 2 sides of the lower grate to prepare for the indirect cooking that follows. In a 12 by 9-inch, heavy-duty aluminum-foil pan (or something similar), combine the potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, garbanzo beans, and epazote. Position the pan in the center of the lower grate and surround with the coals. Pour water into the pan to about 1-inch from the top (it&#39;ll take about 5 cups). Position the cooking grate 8 inches above the coals and set an oven thermometer on it, if you have one. Grilling the meat: Sprinkle the lamb liberally with salt. Lay the roast in the center of the cooking grate directly over the soup, cover the grill, and cook, maintaining a moderately low temperature (between 250 and 300 degrees F), checking every 30 minutes and adding coals as needed. The lamb will be beautifully smoky-roasted, it&#39;ll register about 170 degrees F on a meat thermometer and be fall-apart tender in about 2 1/4 hours. Be sure to check the slow-simmering soup that&#39;s capturing all those lamb juices periodically, to ensure the liquid level remains more or less the same, adding more water if it&#39;s needed. Finishing the dish: With a couple of meat forks or spatulas, remove the roast to a platter. Sprinkle with salt and let rest, tented with foil, in a warm place for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, with the precision of a steady-handed circus performer, carefully remove the pan of soup from the bottom of the grill. Skim off the fat that is floating on the surface, then taste and season with salt, usually about 3/4 teaspoon. Stir in the cilantro and finely chopped chipotle and ladle into small, warm soup cups. Scrape the salsa into a serving dish and sprinkle with cheese. Remove the string from the lamb. Slice the lamb into good, thick slabs and arrange on a warm platter that&#39;s lined or decorated with parsley, banana leaves, or lemon leaves. Strew the olives around the platter and carry to the table with a flourish. Serve each guest a cup of soup, and pass the meat, salsa, and lots of warm tortillas for everyone to make delicious soft tacos. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 47426,&quot;Vegetable Salad in Squash Seed Sauce, Guatemala 1 pound green beans, cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 1 1/2 cups shelled squash or pumpkin seeds 4 medium tomatillos (about 1 cup), husked and quartered 1/2 cup roughly chopped yellow onions 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed 1 pound potatoes, peeled and cubed 2 teaspoons salt Instructions: In a large, dry skillet, toast 1 cup of the seeds over medium-low heat until golden and fragrant, about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove and let cool. Add the tomatillos, onions and garlic to the skillet and cook over medium-low heat until the skins are slightly charred, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. In a medium pot, combine the potatoes and 1 teaspoon salt with enough water, to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender. Drain. In a second pot, combine the green beans and remaining teaspoon of salt in water to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of liquid. To make the sauce, pulse the roasted squash seeds in a blender or food processor. Add the tomatillo mixture and the 1/4 cup of the reserved string bean cooking liquid. Puree on high speed until smooth, adding more reserved cooking liquid as needed. Season, to taste, with pepper and cayenne. Strain the sauce through a medium strainer. Combine the cooked potatoes and green beans in a bowl. Toss with the sauce and remaining 1/2 cup of nuts, and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving. Serve chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 47427,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Bacon Cheeseburger Casserole 8 strips bacon, chopped 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 2 pounds ground chuck (80 percent beef, 20 percent fat)<br> 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 2 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 2 teaspoons Mexican oregano<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups whole milk, at room temperature<br> 1 pint (2 cups) heavy cream, at room temperature<br> 2 tablespoons yellow mustard<br> Kosher salt 2 pounds frozen cheese ravioli, thawed 8 slices Swiss cheese 2 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped<br> 8 slices American cheese 8 ounces shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese blend 1 head iceberg lettuce, finely shredded (like straw)<br> 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion (like paper thin!)<br> 2 tablespoons pickle juice<br> Instructions: For the beef: In a large pan with straight sides on medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook, while stirring, until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Leave the bacon fat in the pan and add the olive oil, beef, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper. Brown the beef while breaking it up into bits, about 10 minutes. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a plate and reserve. Leave the fat in the pan for the sauce. For the sauce: Add the butter and flour to the already-hot pan from the beef. If the butter begins to brown, lower the heat while working it into the flour. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes, then raise the heat and slowly whisk in the milk. Once it begins to thicken slightly, add the heavy cream and continue to cook until the sauce reduces a bit more and thickens as well. Add the mustard. The sauce will not be thick like gravy, but not as thin as water either. Taste and season with a pinch of salt. For the casserole: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish, layer starting at the bottom with: a few spoonfuls of sauce to cover the bottom, half of the ravioli in 1 layer, the Swiss cheese, half of the beef, half of the tomatoes, half of the remaining sauce, the remaining ravioli in 1 layer, the American cheese, the remaining beef, the remaining tomatoes, the remaining sauce and the reserved bacon. Top with all of the shredded cheese blend. Bake until the edges are bubbly and the cheese begins to brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Toss the lettuce and onion in a large bowl with the pickle juice.

All methods of preparations are essentially the same except for the oven. If using an oven there is no need to preheat; adjust the top rack to the highest position near the broiler, leaving enough room for a baking sheet and the shrimp. If using a grill or grill pan, preheat the grill to medium-high heat. If an outdoor or open grill is being used, line the grill grates with aluminum foil and preheat to medium-high. Make the crust: Heat a saute pan over medium heat with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking the meat into small pieces, about 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the shallots and the garlic and cook until the sausage is browned and excess oil has rendered, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from the heat. In a medium bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning and lemon zest. Add the cooked sausage mixture (with drippings) to the breadcrumb mixture. Roughly combine to gauge moisture, then add up to 3/4 cup of the olive oil. Combine again, then add up to 1/2 cup of the white wine and combine well. If the mixture is still dry, a bit more of either can be added in small increments. The mixture should appear glossy and moist to the touch, but without excess liquid sitting at the bottom of the bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside. If using an oven, turn the broiler to high. Place the shrimp shell-sides down on a baking sheet and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Place the shrimp under the broiler for about 2 minutes, just to begin the cooking process. Remove and check to see that that shrimp have begun to turn opaque. Scoop spoonfuls of the crust mixture onto the shrimp, pressing down with the back of a spoon or spatula to compress the crust topping (some will fall around the shrimp, which is fine). If you are using a grill, drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil onto the shrimp in a separate dish and lightly season with salt and pepper. Using tongs or carefully using your hands, place the shrimp shell-side down on a preheated grill or grill pan or onto the aluminum foil on an open grill. After 3 to 5 minutes the shrimp should begin to curl at the tails, the shell should darken in color and the meat should begin to turn opaque. Proceed to scoop spoonfuls of the crust mixture onto the shrimp, pressing down with the back of a spoon or spatula to compress the crust topping (some will fall around the shrimp which is fine). For either method, after applying the crust, cook until the crust is golden brown and the shrimp are just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. The shrimp will cook quickly; make sure not to overcook. Remove from the heat and transfer to a plate or serving dish, covering with foil if the sauce is not yet ready. To make the sauce, heat a medium saute pan or saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and add 1/2 cup of white wine. Cook until reduced, 4 to 5 minutes, then add the parsley and the remaining tablespoon of shallots and continue to cook another minute or two. Remove from the heat and add the butter, one tablespoon at a time, stirring continuously. Once the butter is incorporated, add the chives or chervil and let steep about a minute before spooning the mixture over the crusted rock shrimp.

Add the egg yolks, one at a time, and continue to mix. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon olive oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on a work surface, then turn the dough out onto the work surface. Knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with some olive oil and wrap in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. Cut the ball of dough in half; cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine two or three times with rollers set on the widest setting, pulling and stretching the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Narrow the setting and crank the dough through again two or three times. Continue narrowing until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it). Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed and continue to roll out the rest of the dough. Beat the whole egg with 1 tablespoon water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter and a sheet of dough with flour, and lay out the long sheet of pasta on the counter. Brush the top with the egg wash, which acts as a glue. Drop tablespoons of the pea filling on half of the pasta sheet, about 2 inches apart. Fold the other half over the filling like a blanket. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into half-moons, and crimp the edges with the tines of a fork to make a tight seal. Dust the agnolotti and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent sticking, then lay the agnolotti out on the sheet pan to dry slightly while assembling the rest. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the agnolotti until they float to the top, about 4 minutes. Lift the agnolotti from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. To serve: Place agnolotti on a plate and pour shrimp sauce over them. Garnish with Opal basil buds and flowers and some black pepper, Parmesan, snow peas and a drizzle of basil oil. Combine the peas, ricotta, olive oil and some salt in a food processor and pulse together until well combined. Set aside.

Line the bottom and sides with parchment paper. For the tomato layer: In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and cool slightly. Stir in the tomatoes. Return the pan to the heat and add the red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture has formed a chunky sauce, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. For the bechamel sauce: In a 1-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Stir in the nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Simmer over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. For the pesto: In a food processor, combine the basil, Parmesan, pine nuts, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Pulse until finely chopped. With the machine running, gradually add the olive oil until the mixture forms a smooth paste. Stir the pesto into the bechamel sauce until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes. For the polenta: In a large, heavy saucepan, bring 6 cups water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil over medium-low heat. Gradually whisk in the cornmeal. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and the cornmeal is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. To assemble the torta: Working quickly, spread half of the warm polenta in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan. Add the pesto mixture and spread on top of the polenta. Spoon the remaining polenta on top and smooth with a spatula. Spread the tomato mixture on top. Cool the torta at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the layers have set, about 4 hours. Remove the outer ring from the pan, then remove the parchment paper. Place the torta on a platter and cut into thin wedges. Serve with grilled bread. Cook&#39;s Note: To toast the pine nuts, arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until lightly toasted, 6 to 8 minutes.

Melt the butter in a large pot. Stir in the brown sugar and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring, until reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them lengthwise, then lengthwise again, making long quarters. Cut the quarters into 1-inch pieces. Boil the potatoes until they give a bit when poked with a fork, about 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes and arrange in a single layer in a buttered 3-quart baking dish. Pour the syrup on top, making sure it covers the potatoes. Place the lemon slices on top and bake 35 minutes, spooning the syrup over the potatoes twice during that time. The potatoes are done when they are fork-tender. Remove from the oven, discard the lemon slices and stir in the pecans. Top with the marshmallows. Turn the oven up to 400 degrees F, place the baking dish back in the oven, and cook until the marshmallows puff and turn brown, about 10 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 47448,&quot;Spicy Asian Sesame Peanuts with Popcorn 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger 1 teaspoon five-spice powder 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes Kosher salt Vegetable or canola oil, for the baking sheet 1 large egg white 4 cups unsalted raw peanuts 1 1/2 cups popcorn 3 tablespoons crushed dried chilies Instructions: For the Asian sesame spice blend: Mix together the sesame seeds, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger, five-spice powder, red pepper flakes and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a small bowl and set aside.

Working from the top to the bottom, slice the peel off in strips, to reveal the orange flesh. Cut the white pith from the back of the peel with a sharp knife, and discard. Slice the orange peel into fine julienne strips, put it in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Drain, and rinse under cold running water. Repeat this process three times. Blanching the orange peel like this removes much of the bitter taste. Cut out the sections from the oranges into a bowl, squeezing any juice out of the membrane before discarding. Set aside.<br> Pour the sugar into a saute pan or large heavy saucepan. Melt the sugar and let it develop a deep amber color, without letting it burn. Pour over 1 cup water/250 ml water and any juice that has pooled around the orange slices. The caramel will seize up, so leave the pan on the heat until the water and juice dissolve into the caramel. Add the drained julienne of zests and boil until they turn translucent, become candy coated and a dark amber color, 5 to 10 minutes. The zests will be sweet and chewy with a faint hint of bitterness and intense orange flavor.<br> Add about 4 spoonfuls of this caramel with candied orange zest to the fresh orange slices, and toss. Cover, and set aside in a cool place until serving.<br> (Cool the remaining caramel and orange zest. If too thick, simply thin out with a bit of water to achieve a thick syrup. Store in a glass jar in the refrigerator; it will keep for at least 6 months.)<br> Serve the oranges with their caramel and candied peel sprinkled with lightly toasted almond slivers and slightly sweetened whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 47450,&quot;Baked Squash Gratin 1 (3-pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/4 cup purchased basil pesto 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, plus more for greasing Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Saute onions and garlic for 3 minutes until soft. Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper, and continue to saute until the spinach is limp, about 2 minutes. Add lemon juice, remove from heat and place in a colander, and squeeze out excess liquid. Set aside to cool. The filling needs to be cool and dry to prevent the phyllo from becoming soggy. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with feta, coriander, and nutmeg. Season, then fold in the cooled spinach mixture until well blended. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, brush 2 baking sheets with some melted butter. Unroll the phyllo dough and lay a sheet flat on a work surface. Take care to keep the phyllo covered with a damp, not wet, towel as you work to prevent drying out and becoming brittle. Brush the sheet with melted butter, then sprinkle evenly with some oregano and chives. Repeat with 2 more sheets of phyllo, stacking on top of each other. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the sheets lengthwise into thirds to form 2 1/2-inch strips. Do this with all the sheets of dough. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling near 1 corner of the layered phyllo strip. Fold the end at an angle over the filling to form a triangle. Continue to fold the triangle along the strip until you reach the end, like folding up a flag. Brush the top with butter and dust with Parmesan, place on prepared baking sheet, and cover while preparing the remaining pastries. Repeat until all the filling and phyllo strips are used up.
