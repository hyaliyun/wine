Break each egg into an individual small bowl and set aside. Fill a large (12-inch) saute pan about half full with water and bring to a boil. Carefully slide each egg into a separate corner of the pan and simmer for exactly 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the eggs to sit in the water for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place the slices of prosciutto on a sheet pan and roast for 5 minutes. Set aside. Place both halves of each toasted muffin on a dinner plate and, using a slotted spoon, slide a poached egg onto each half. Drizzle hollandaise sauce over the poached eggs and garnish with chives. Serve with a slice of prosciutto. Place the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in the jar of a blender and process on low for 15 seconds. Melt the butter in a small saucepan until it is sizzling hot. Remove the small clear insert in the top of the blender. With the blender on low, slowly add the hot butter to the egg and lemon mixture and blend for 30 seconds, until the sauce is very thick. Use immediately. \Barefoot Contessa Foolproof\ by Ina Garten ?

Shake the muffin tin so that the flour completely coats each cup, then shake out any excess. Set aside. Combine the hazelnuts, sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse until the hazelnuts are finely ground. Add the flour and pulse until completely combined. Add the butter and pulse until the butter is finely chopped and the mixture begins to come together, then add the vanilla and egg and pulse until a dough forms. Use a rubber spatula to transfer the dough to a medium bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and place a large baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Divide the dough evenly among the prepared muffin cups (about 1 scant tablespoon each), then use your fingers or the back of a small spoon to flatten the dough in each cup, coming slightly up the sides.

Put the pot over medium-high heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, season generously with salt, to taste, and stir to coat with the olive oil. Cook the onions for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently. The onions should become very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Pass the tomatoes through the food mill. Be sure to pass all of the pulp through the holes leaving only the stems and the seeds, and be sure to scrape the pulp off of the bottom of the food mill. That&#39;s all of the big money stuff! Add the tomatoes to the sauce pot and 1 can of water (about 2 to 3 cups). Season generously with salt and TASTE IT!!!! Tomatoes take a lot of salt. Season in baby steps and taste every step of the way. Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally and tasting frequently. Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need. This sauce can also be cooled and stored in the refrigerator for a few days or it can be frozen. ; Batter: In a mixing bowl, add the flour and salt and make a well in the center. Add the eggs, milk, club soda and 3 tablespoons of melted butter into the center of the well and whisk together until just combined. The mixture should be like VERY loose pancake batter. If the mixture is a little thick, whisk in a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using. Crepes: Melt about a 1/2 teaspoon of butter in a small nonstick saute pan. The butter should coat the bottom of the pan, if there is a lot of excess, wipe it out with a paper towel. Keep the paper towel handy in case you need it again (you will). Put the pan over medium heat. Fill a 2-ounce ladle, almost to the top, with batter and pour it into the preheated pan, tipping and rolling the pan, as you ladle the batter, to evenly cover the bottom. This will take a little practice, even when you are an experienced crepe maker the first couple always get wasted. Accept it and move on. When the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bottom begins to brown a little, turn the crepe over and cook it for about 1 minute on the other side. Remove the crepe from the pan to a plate and let cool. Stack the crepes as they are cooked between parchment paper squares. Repeat this process, until all the batter is used, wiping the pan with your paper towel or melting a little more butter to the pan, as needed.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until bubbling and browned. Meanwhile, place the blackberries, raspberries and strawberries in separate saucepans. Juice 1/2 lemon into each pan. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar and 1 tablespoon vanilla to each pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring, for 8 to 10 minutes. Make sure you watch the berries so they don&#39;t burn. If you like, use a spoon or spatula to crush the raspberries and blackberries to more of a paste. Combine the cream, mascarpone, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons vanilla in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip for about 1 minute. Mix in food coloring until you reach the desired color. To assemble: Place a Dutch baby on a serving plate and spread with the blackberries. Add a second Dutch baby and the raspberries. Repeat with a third Dutch baby and the strawberries. Top with the final Dutch baby (cooled so as not to melt the topping) and spread with the whipped topping. Garnish heavily with the rainbow sprinkles and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Cava]</p><p>&quot; 36899,&quot;Sticky Pepper-Glazed Ribs 2 tablespoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 racks baby back ribs (about 4 1/2 pounds total)<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, ground to a medium grind in a spice grinder<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 medium shallot, minced<br> 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup apricot preserves<br> 1/4 cup honey<br> 1/4 cup ketchup<br> 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 4 scallions, chopped<br> Instructions: For the ribs: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stir the chili and cumin together with 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle the mixture all over the ribs, then put the ribs bone-side down in a large roasting pan and cover tightly with foil. Bake until the meat is very tender but not quite falling off the bone, about 2 1/2 hours. For the sauce: Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the peppercorns, garlic and shallot and cook, stirring, until the garlic starts to turn golden, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar, preserves, honey, ketchup, vinegar, soy sauce and Worcestershire and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until syrupy, about 5 minutes. Finish the ribs: Preheat the broiler to high. Remove the foil and transfer the racks to a cutting board to cool slightly. Drain any fat from the roasting pan. Cut the racks into individual ribs and place back in the roasting pan. Drizzle the ribs with the sauce. Broil the ribs a few inches from the broiler, tossing occasionally with tongs, until bubbling and charred in spots, about 6 minutes. Transfer the ribs to a platter and sprinkle with the scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 36900,&quot;Champagne-Infused Blackberry Soup with Sour Cream Sorbet 2 cups water 1/2 cup sugar Juice from 1/2 lemon 3 cups blackberries 3 mint leaves 1/4 cup Champagne or sparkling wine 1 tablespoon sugar 1 cup water 1/2 tablespoon corn syrup Juice from 1 lime 1/2 cup sour cream Instructions: Soup: In a saucepan, bring water, sugar, blackberries and lemon juice to a boil over medium-high heat.

Rub in well. Drizzle some oil on top of each steak and rub into the steak. Repeat with the other side.<br> After applying spices, stack steaks in shallow pan and cover. Place in refrigerator. Allow to marinate for a minimum of 4 hours. In some cases, you may want to marinate overnight. Let steaks set at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.<br> Cooking the Steaks:<br> Let your charcoal burn down on your favorite cooker for about 1 hour until the coals are good and white. Get the cooker to 350 degrees F for optimum cooking temperature.<br> Place steaks on grill, close lid and let them cook for 6 to 8 minutes before turning. You are hoping to get good grill marks on the steaks at this time. After turning, cook to desired doneness. This is usually another 5 to 7 minutes.<br> After cooking to desired doneness, remove steaks from grill and place in aluminum pan and cover and seal the pan with foil. Place this in a warmer or on a warm part of the grill for 5 to 10 minutes. This seals in the juices and increases the tenderness.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 36904,&quot;Buffalo Chicken Wings 16 chicken wings (about 3 pounds) 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 4 teaspoons Frank&#39;s Hot Sauce, or 1 teaspoon Tabasco 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 cups crumbled Gorgonzola or other blue cheese 1 cup good mayonnaise 3/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons milk 3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Celery sticks, for serving Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Add the butter, onions, 1 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and most of the water evaporates, about 12 minutes. Add the dry mustard, onion powder, coriander, allspice, cloves, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet, cover with aluminum foil to stay warm and set aside. Reserve the skillet. For the stout BBQ sauce: Add the sugar and tomato paste to the same skillet, spreading the mixture into an even layer. Cook until just bubbly, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the beer and scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Whisk in the vinegar, coriander, dry mustard and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook until reduced by about a third, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl until smooth and free of clumps. Whisk the slurry into the sauce and simmer until it coats the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes more. Set aside.<br> For the burgers: Rip the corned beef into small 2-inch pieces and place in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until shredded into small pieces just larger than peas, then transfer to a large bowl. Using your hands, break the ground beef into small pieces over the corned beef. Add the dry mustard, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and gently combine the mixture with your hands until thoroughly combined. Form the meat into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.<br> To prepare the burgers, place a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and melt. Once the bubbles subside, place the patties into the skillet and gently press down. Cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned on the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip over. Mound 1/3 cup of the caramelized onions on top of each patty. Top each patty with 2 slices of cheese, allowing the cheese to hang over the sides of the onions. Cover the skillet and cook until the cheese fully melts and drapes over the burger, about 2 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to cook until the cheese gets a crispy, lacy edge, about 1 minute more. Place the patties onto the bottom halves of the burger buns. Generously spoon the stout BBQ sauce on top (about 2 tablespoons per burger). Place the top halves of the buns the patties. Serve immediately with french fries drizzled in more stout BBQ sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 36908,&quot;Chicken Pear Salad with Blue Cheese 6 cups torn salad greens or chopped romaine 1/2 cup reduced-calorie, fat-free or regular blue cheese salad dressing 1 1/4 cups cooked chicken strips 1 medium yellow or green bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 can (15 oz.)

It&#39;s best made with Italian Tipo \00\ flour, which is finer ground than normal flour, and it will give your dough an incredible super-smooth texture. Look for it in Italian markets and good supermarkets. If using white bread flour instead, make sure it&#39;s a strong one that&#39;s high in gluten, as this will transform into a lovely, elastic dough, which is what you want. Mix in some semolina flour for a bit of color and flavor if you like. Sift the flours and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a large measuring cup, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into the water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. Keep mixing, drawing larger amounts of flour in, and when it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean, flour-dusted hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough. Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and flour the top of it. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for about 1 hour until the dough has doubled in size. Now remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out with your hands - this is called punching down the dough. You can either use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in plastic wrap, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straightaway, divide the dough up into as many little balls as you want to make pizzas - this amount of dough is enough to make about six to eight medium pizzas. Timing-wise, it&#39;s a good idea to roll the pizzas out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Don&#39;t roll them out and leave them hanging around for a few hours, though - if you are working in advance like this it&#39;s better to leave your dough, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator. However, if you want to get them rolled out so there&#39;s 1 less thing to do when your guests are round, simply roll the dough out into rough circles, about 1/4-inch thick, and place them on slightly larger pieces of olive-oil-rubbed and flour-dusted aluminum foil. You can then stack the pizzas, cover them with plastic wrap, and pop them into the refrigerator. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Let the chicken season at room temperature for 1 hour. Fill a large deep pot with enough oil to cover the pieces of chicken (about 3 1/2 inches). Heat the oil to 375 degrees F over medium-high heat (at this temperature a droplet of water will sizzle immediately when it hits the oil). Season the flour with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour and then dip them in the beaten eggs. Working in batches if necessary, put the chicken into the oil, taking care not to over crowd the pan. (If all the chicken will not fit at one time, cook the larger pieces first.) Fry the chicken at about 350 degrees F (adding the chicken causes the temperature to drop) until the pieces are crisp and golden on 1 side, about 10 minutes. Turn the pieces of chicken and cook until the second-sides are crisp and the juices clear, about 7 minutes more. Add the garlic and herbs and fry until they too are crisp. Drain the chicken and herbs on a plate lined with paper towels. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and lemon juice and serve topped with fried herbs and garlic. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 36914,&quot;Chocolate Orange Crunch Truffles 4 oz. bittersweet chocolate, broken into small pieces 2 tbsps. heavy cream 1/3 cup Smucker&#39;s?

Marinate for 1 hour so the flavors can penetrate the meat. In the meantime, place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep food from sticking. Rub the peaches with oil and season with salt and pepper. Put the peaches cut-side down on the grill and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until the flesh softens slightly and caramelizes. Turn them over with tongs and grill the other side for 3 minutes to char the skin; remove to a platter. Grill the lime slices for 2 minutes each side until slightly charred. Scrape off the excess chili powder on the surface of the steak so it doesn&#39;t burn on the grill. Rub the steak with oil and season both sides with of salt and pepper. Grill the steak on the hottest part of the barbecue for 4 minutes per side, until well charred. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes. Cut the meat across the grain on the diagonal. To serve: put the greens on a platter and arrange the peach halves, lime slices, and steak on top. Sprinkle with the pecans and drizzle the salad with the olive oil. This homemade chili powder will add a smoky depth to chili and as a dry rub for steaks. Toast the ancho cl pieces over low heat in a dry skillet until fragrant, shaking the pan so they don&#39;t scorch. Put the chiles in a mini food processor and pulse to a powder. Add the remaining ingredients and buzz again to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 36920,&quot;Chocolate Truffle Squares 5 ounces good quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped into pieces no bigger than 1/4-inch 2 eggs, separated, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 egg white, at room temperature 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 cup (unsifted) unsweetened Dutch Process Cocoa 2 tablespoons all purpose flour 2/3 cup plus 1/4 cup sugar 3/4 cup lowfat (1 percent) milk 49 perfect fresh raspberries, 5 to 6 ounces 2 to 3 tablespoons red current jelly or raspberry preserves 9 x 9 inch cake pan Instructions: Baking pan or roasting pan at least 2 inches deep and large enough to hold the cake pan with at least 2 inches to spare on each side. Position the rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Line the bottom and sides of the pan with foil. Put a kettle of water on to boil for the bain marie when baking in the oven. Place chocolate in a large mixing bowl. Combine the 2 egg yolks with vanilla in a small bowl. Place the 3 egg whites in a medium bowl with cream of tartar. Set all 3 bowls aside. Combine the cocoa, flour and 2/3 cup sugar in a 1 1/2 quart heavy bottomed saucepan. Whisk in enough of the milk to form a smooth paste. Mix in the remaining milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, to prevent burning (especially around the bottom edges of the pot), until mixture begins to simmer. Simmer very gently, stirring constantly, for about 1 1/2 minutes, or until the mixture visibly thickens. Pour the hot mixture immediately over the chopped chocolate. Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Whisk in egg yolk mixture. Set aside. Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar at medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, beating at high speed until stiff but not dry. Fold a quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in remaining egg whites. Scrape mixture into the cake pan and spread evenly. Set cake pan in baking pan and place on oven rack. Pour enough boiling water into the baking pan to come a third to halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Bake for exactly 20 minutes. The cake will only be about 3/4 inches tall. The surface will spring back when gently pressed but cake will still be quite gooey inside. Remove cake pan and water pan from oven. Remove the cake pan from the water and cool completely on a rack. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight before serving. Refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze up to 2 months. After the truffle sheet is well chilled, lift the edges of the foil to remove the truffle sheet from the pan. Cut the sheet into 7 strips, each about 1 1/4 inches wide, using a long thin sharp knife dipping in hot water and wiped dry between each cut (the cake is very sticky) or cut with dental floss. Cut each strip into 7 squares. Transfer each square to a fluted paper candy cup and or arrange on a serving platter. If garnishing with raspberries, simmer the preserves for a minute or until thick and sticky. Touch the hot preserves with the bottom of each berry before placing it on the truffle square. Refrigerate until serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]&quot; 36921,&quot;Cucumber, Meyer Lemon and Lavender Granita 1/4 cup fresh Meyer lemon juice 6 cups roughly chopped English cucumber (about 2 pounds) 1/2 cup sugar 6 sprigs lavender 1 Meyer lemon, zested Fleur de sel, for garnish Instructions: In a blender, blend the Meyer lemon juice and cucumber together, creating cucumber water.

Remove silver skin from back of ribs, if desired. Set up the grill for indirect heat and if using wood chips, place soaked chips directly on charcoal, or in smoking box of gas grill. Rub the cut lemons over front and back of ribs squeezing to release as much juice as possible. Set aside for 5 minutes. Rub ribs liberally with spice rub and let sit, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes. Place ribs (bone side down) in the center of the cooking grate or in a rib holder/rack over direct medium Low heat, making sure they are not over a direct flame. Grill covered (at about 325 degrees F, if your grill has a thermometer) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until meat is tender and has pulled back from the ends of the rib bones. Do not open the grill for the first 30 minutes--this means no peeking; especially important if using wood chips. If the ribs start to burn on the edges, stack them on top of one another in the very center of the grill and lower your fire slightly. Twenty minutes before serving, unstack ribs, if necessary and brush with barbecue sauce. Remove ribs from grill and let rest 10 minutes before cutting into individual or 2 to 3 rib portions. Warm remaining sauce in a saucepan and serve on the side, if desired. Combine paprika, salt, sugar, brown sugar, cumin, chili powder, pepper, cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt and oregano in bowl; mix well. For a smoother rub, puree ingredients in a spice grinder until well combined and all pieces are uniform (the rub will be very fine and tan in color). This step is important if adding to any homemade barbecue sauce. Extra rub can be stored in an airtight container for up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 36949,&quot;Baked Mac and Cheese 3 tablespoons plain dry breadcrumbs, (see Tip) 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 teaspoon paprika 1 16-ounce or 10-ounce package frozen spinach, thawed 1 3/4 cups low-fat milk, divided 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese 1 cup low-fat cottage cheese 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper, to taste 8 ounces (2 cups) whole-wheat elbow macaroni, or penne Instructions: Put a large pot of water on to boil.

Combine 1 cup of the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water in a heavy-bottomed pot or pan. Place over medium-high heat and cook until the sugar begins to melt. Swirl the pan over the heat until the syrup darkens to a medium amber color, about 10 minutes; don&#39;t stir with a spoon. Remove from the heat and immediately add the lemon juice, swirl the pan again to combine, and then pour into the flan mold. Tilt the dish so that the caramel evenly coats the bottom and a bit up the sides, place in the roasting pan and set aside. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, bring a kettle of water to a boil for the water bath and keep it hot. Combine the cream, cinnamon, and vanilla in a small saucepan over medium-low flame. Bring the cream to a brief simmer, stirring occasionally. Take care not to let the cream come to a full boil to prevent it from spilling over. In a large bowl, cream together the whole eggs and yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar; add a pinch of salt. Whisk until the mixture is pale yellow and thick. Temper the egg mixture by gradually whisking in the hot cream mixture; don&#39;t add it too quickly or the eggs will cook. Pass the mixture through a strainer into a large measuring cup to ensure that the flan will be perfectly smooth. Pour the custard into the caramel-coated mold. To create the water bath: pour the hot (not boiling) water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the side of the mold; be careful not get water into the custard. Carefully transfer to the middle oven rack, and bake for 30 to 45 minutes, until the custard is barely set and just jiggles slightly. Let the flan cool in the water bath, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. When you are ready to serve, run a knife around the inside of the mold to loosen the flan. Place a dessert plate on top of the flan and invert to pop it out. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 36960,&quot;Cheese Grits 4 cups water or chicken broth, homemade or low sodium canned 3 cups whole milk 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 1/4 cups grits (not instant) 1 1/2 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces) 3 to 5 tablespoons unsalted butter Freshly ground black pepper 3 large eggs beaten (optional) Instructions: In a medium saucepan, combine the water or broth, milk, salt, and cayenne and bring to a boil. Slowly whisk in the grits and lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in the cheese and butter until evenly incorporated.

Pour into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for 24 hours. Using a backyard grill, start your charcoal with charcoal chimney (Never use lighter fluid). When all the coals are covered in a fine grey ash, dump them on 1 side of your grill. Using a stick or spatula push all the coals into a pile. Put your grate on the grill. Chicken: Open the beer and pour about a quarter of the beer out of each can. Literally rub the chicken cavities and exterior of the chickens with the jerk paste. Carefully put each can of beer into the cavity of the chickens, bring the legs around the can and truss together. Put the chickens on the opposite side of the fire. Sometimes you may need to put a brick or rock on the backside of the chicken to keep it stable and upright. Put the lid on the grill and make sure the vent holes are directly above the chicken to provide adequate drafting of heat and smoke over the bird. Keep the vent holes open all the way. Cook chickens for 4 to 5 hours at a temperature of 225 degrees F. You will want to rotate the birds a quarter turn every hour and add coals, when needed, to maintain the temperature. Be careful not to add too many coals at once when attempting to bring your temperature back up. You may get it too hot and will have a tough time bringing it back down. Open the lid only when you have to check the temperature. Remove the chickens from the grill and set aside for 10 minutes. Discard the beer cans and refrigerate the chicken until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 36962,&quot;Tarragon Chicken 2 teaspoons garlic oil 2 fat scallions or 4 skinny ones, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon freeze-dried tarragon 2 chicken breast fillets, skinless and boneless 1/3 cup vermouth or white wine 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt or 1/4 teaspoon table salt 1/2 cup heavy cream Fresh white pepper, to grind over 2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon, plus a pinch more for sprinkling Instructions: Heat the garlic oil in a frying pan or Dutch oven that has a lid and in which the chicken breasts will fit pretty snugly. Add the scallions, stir, then sprinkle in the freeze-dried tarragon, stir again and cook them in the garlic oil for a minute, stirring some more as they cook. Put the chicken fillets into the pan, curved side down, and cook for 5 minutes, watching the scallions don&#39;t burn. If they look like they&#39;re beginning to, scrape them from the pan and let them sit on the chicken pieces. Turn over the breasts, and add the vermouth (or white wine). Let the vermouth bubble up, then add the salt. Put the lid on, turn the heat down low and leave it to simmer gently for 10 minutes. Check the chicken is cooked through by making a small cut into the thickest part and ensuring the juices run clear - if not, simmer for a few minutes longer and check again. Remove the chicken breasts to warmed plates. Bring the remaining liquid to a boil, add the cream and stir well, then sprinkle in the fresh tarragon, stir again and give a good grind of white pepper. Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts, and give a final scattering of tarragon to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 36963,&quot;Cool Melon Cocktail 4 cups seedless watermelon chunks Instructions: Refrigerate melon chunks in a large covered container several hours or until very cold.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine 1 cup water, the butter, salt and sugar in a 4-quart pot and bring to a boil. Gradually add the flour while stirring constantly. Stir the mixture vigorously over low heat until it forms a loose dough. Be careful not to scorch the bottom of the pot. Remove from the heat and stir briefly to dry out, returning to the heat for 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl. Add 4 of the eggs one at a time and stir, waiting until each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Test the dough to see if the texture is correct: the dough should be suspended in a thread between two fingers when pinched and separated. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, add another egg.) Transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a straight pastry tip. Pipe out quarter-size rounds onto the baking sheet, spaced about 1-inch apart. Wet your fingertips with water and press down the tips of the rounds to flatten them. Make an egg wash by beating the remaining egg with a fork in a small bowl. Gently brush the egg wash over the tops of the dough rounds. Bake until the dough has puffed up and the tops are nicely browned, 8 to 12 minutes. Lower the heat to 300 degrees F and let sit in the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. A well-cooked profiterole should be hollow on the inside and still a little soft inside. Let cool completely. Whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks in a large bowl. Fit a second pastry bag with a straight or star tip and fill with the whipped cream. Cut the profiteroles in half horizontally and fill with the whipped cream. Top with the lid. Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to serve. For the chocolate sauce: Heat the cream in a pot until just scalded. Pour the cream over the chopped chocolate. Tap the bowl to allow the cream to settle. Wait 2 minutes, and then stir vigorously with a whisk until smooth and emulsified. Set aside to cool or until ready to serve. Serve about 1/2 cup of the sauce with the profiteroles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 36966,&quot;Black Bean Burgers 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large red onion, finely chopped<br> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped<br> 3 cups mushrooms, finely chopped<br> 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped<br> One 14-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed<br> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour<br> 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast flakes (optional)<br> 1000 Island Dressing, recipe follows 4 burger buns<br> 4 butter lettuce leaves<br> 4 teaspoons yellow mustard<br> 4 large tomato slices or 8 medium slices<br> 12 slices dill pickles<br> Handful of arugula<br> Salted potato chips, for serving (optional)<br> 4 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 1/2 teaspoons tomato ketchup<br> 1 teaspoon tomato paste<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons capers, finely chopped<br> 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> Small pinch sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br> Instructions: Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then saute the onions for 4 minutes, until they start to soften. Add the garlic, mushrooms and thyme and cook for a further 3 minutes or until most of the mushroom juice has evaporated. Stir in the drained beans and soy sauce and cook through for around 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat. Roughly mash the mixture with a potato masher, whilst keeping some texture; be careful not to over mash. Stir in the flour and nutritional yeast flakes, if using. Divide the mixture into 4 portions. Then, using your hands, mold each portion into a burger shape about 1/2 inch thick and 3 inches wide or wide enough to fit your bun. Put the burgers on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Allow to chill in the fridge for 1/2 hour, to firm up before cooking. To fry the burgers: Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a medium-large frying pan over a medium heat (you want to hear a nice sizzle) and cook the burgers for about 2 minutes on each side or until cooked through and crisp brown on both sides. To assemble the burgers: Spread 1 teaspoon of 1000 Island Dressing on the base of each bun, then lay a lettuce leaf on top. Add a burger, spread a thin layer of mustard onto each burger, add a slice or 2 of tomato, and then 3 thin slices of pickle. Add a few arugula leaves, then spread a little mustard on the underside of each burger top to complete. Serve with potato chips, if using. Mix all the ingredients together in a small serving bowl, whisking with a fork. This dressing is delicious spooned over veggie burgers or served as a dip with crudites. I also love it drizzled over a festive vegetarian nut roast the next day in a sandwich. Any unused dressing can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 36967,&quot;Salmon Cakes Vegetable or canola oil, for frying 3 (6-ounce) portions cooked salmon or 3 (6-ounce) cans salmon, drained well 1 1/2 cups cracker meal 2 large eggs, beaten 2 rounded teaspoons Old Bay seasoning blend 1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped 20 blades fresh chives, snipped or chopped 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh dill, a handful, finely chopped 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper sauce 1 lemon, zested and juiced Salad greens Coarse salt Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1/2 cup mayonnaise or reduced fat mayonnaise 1/2 cup chili sauce 2 tablespoons dill pickle relish Instructions: Heat a large, heavy skillet with 1 inch of frying oil over moderate heat.

Pour the mixture into the prepared plastic cups, filling them to about 1/4 inch from the brim. Freeze for 1 hour, then stir each one with a small spoon to incorporate the mixture again in case it has separated a bit while sitting; the limbers should be at a slurry stage at this point, which should prevent the mixture from separating again after reincorporating. Continue to freeze until fully frozen, at least another 7 hours. The limbers will keep in the freezer for up to a month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 36969,&quot;Savory Ramen Cake 3 large eggs, 2 whole and 1 lightly beaten 3 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces One 3-ounce package instant ramen noodles 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons Japanese mayonnaise, such as Kewpie 2 tablespoons tonkatsu or teriyaki sauce 1 tablespoon Asian hot sauce, such as sriracha 1/3 cup finely chopped napa cabbage 1/4 cup grated daikon radish<br> 1/4 cup bean sprouts 2 scallions, thinly sliced 1/4 cup shredded seaweed snacks 1 teaspoon togarashi or red cl flakes 1 tablespoon pickled ginger<br> 1 finger cl (or any cl of medium spice), thinly sliced Instructions: Bring a small pot of water to a boil over high heat; prepare a bowl of ice water.

Then add the chicken. Let the chicken marinate refrigerated overnight, or at least 1 hour. After marinating take the chicken out of the bag and dry it off with paper towels. Beat the egg, add the water and garlic powder, to taste. Don&#39;t be afraid of the garlic here, but don&#39;t go vampire hunting either. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium/medium-high heat. Be sure to watch the oil, if it begins to smoke - turn it down a notch. Dredge the chicken in the rice flour, then egg, followed by the panko. Place the cutlet into the pan and fry for 5 to 8 minutes on each side. The panko should be crispy and golden brown. Place on a drying rack and finish frying the other pieces.

Add the sour cream, lemon juice, blue cheese, scallions and garlic powder and pulse to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill 2 hours. Make the chips: Heat 1 to 2 inches vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Rest a cooling rack on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Spread some flour in a baking dish, add the beet slices and toss. Tap off the excess flour, then fry the beets in batches (don&#39;t overcrowd the pot), stirring occasionally to make sure they don&#39;t stick to each other, 3 to 5 minutes, or until the fizzling around the chips slows down. Transfer the chips with a slotted spoon to the rack and season with salt. Let cool at least 5 minutes; the chips will crisp up as they cool. Return the oil to 350 degrees F between batches. Replenish the oil, if necessary, and return to 350 degrees F. Dredge the sweet potato slices in flour and fry in batches, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the rack, season with salt and let cool. Serve the chips with the blue-cheese dip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 36984,&quot;Veal Rolls with Pancetta 1 pound veal scaloppine from the butcher counter 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, a couple of handfuls Salt and pepper 1 pound smoked fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced 1 (16 to 18-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced 1/3 pound pancetta, sliced like thin cut bacon at deli counter 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for drizzling 1 clove cracked garlic 1 (10-ounce) sack baby spinach or triple washed spinach leaves 1/4 to 1/3 cup white wine or dry vermouth Instructions: Arrange scaloppine on waxed paper or plastic.

Using a sharp boning knife, follow right along the breast bone on either side and remove both breasts. Trim fat along outside of the breast allowing approximately one third of an inch of fat overlap. Score fat on breast by making a diagonal cut, making sure not to cut the breast meat. About four strokes is sufficient. In a food processor, dice unpeeled ginger and garlic until coarsely chopped. Place in a stainless steel bowl. Add remaining ingredients. Place the two whole duck legs and the four duck breasts in the marinade. Remove the duck breasts after one hour. The legs should continue to marinate for an additional half an hour, and then be removed. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Using the carcasses of the duck, place the duck legs on the duck carcass. Place legs and carcasses in a roasting pan and roast for 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours. Check periodically to make sure the ducks are not getting too dark. They are ready when the leg wiggles freely to your touch, and they are a nice deep amber color. The skin should look crisp and rendered of fat. Cool. Once cooled, take your boning knife and cut through the skin right in the middle of the legs. Using your hands, separate duck legs. (Use your thumb to get under the oyster and gently pull leg from the bones.) Gently use your fingers to pull out the thigh bone. Trim legs a little to keep a nice triangular shape. For the breasts: Heat a large, 12 inch sautepan to medium high. (You can cook two duck breasts in one pan or cook one at a time in a smaller, 10 inch pan.) Add two breasts, skin side down to start rendering the fat. Cook over medium high heat for a couple of minutes. (You will need to remove the rendered fat as you go. Hold duck breast still with a pair of tongs and pour fat into a stainless bowl or other container. Return to heat). After the first couple of minutes on medium high heat, turn burner down to medium, so not to burn the duck. The duck should be a rich amber color. Continue cooking until the fat is almost completely rendered. You can check this by looking at the incisions of the fat. When there is only a thin, crisp skin, the duck is ready to be flipped. Turn duck over. Shut heat off and leave the breast to sit in the pan for about three to four minutes. Remove from pan and allow to rest for five minutes. Meanwhile, place the duck legs in a medium to medium small saute pan, skin side down and pan covered to heat and finish any additional rendering of fat, approximately five minutes. Slice duck breast into fairly thing slices, keeping the nice shape of the breast. With a spatula, pick up breast and fan it out onto the plate. Place duck legs on an angle near the top of the slices. Serve with Whipped Taro Root, Taro Chips, lots of julienned scallions and a little Duck Jus. Peel taro root. First, for the chips, take your peeler and peel approximately one cup of long taro shreds. Reserve for frying. Take the remaining taro and cut it up into rough 2 inch chunks. Place in a sauce pan, covering with cold water. Boil root until tender. Strain into a colander, reserving cup of the liquid. In a food processor, pulse taro, adding little dabs of butter as you go, along with some of the cooking liquid to make a smooth consistency. Remove and season with salt and pepper. For the chips: Heat a couple of cups of peanut or grapeseed oil to 350 degrees. Drops shreds into oil in small batches. Remove when crisp (the chips should still be light in color) and salt. In a heavy bottom sauce pan, heat oil. Add chopped duck body, leek, celery and carrot pieces and cook until vegetables are golden. Add white wine and chicken stock and reduce by half. Add soy marinade, cooking an additional few minutes. Skim off any fat and strain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 36986,&quot;Pasta and Potatoes with Provolone del Monaco Salt 200 grams broken up pieces of various pasta shapes 60 grams extra-virgin olive oil 1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped 1 onion, coarsely chopped 2 potatoes, boiled, peeled and coarsely chopped 120 grams provolone del Monaco, aged 6 months 1 sprig rosemary Instructions: In a pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta for 5 minutes.

For the brine: In a large pot on medium-high heat, add 6 quarts (24 cups) water and the salt, peppercorns, sage, thyme and lemon. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer and simmer until the salt is dissolved and the water is fragrant. Turn off the heat and let cool. Put the turkey in a brining bag, large plastic bag or a bowl large enough to fit it with still more space to give. Pour in the cooled brining liquid and seal or cover. If there&#39;s not enough room for all of the liquid in the brine, be sure to at least include the herbs, lemon and peppercorns in with the turkey for brining. Refrigerate for 3 days. When ready to cook, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and discard all of the brining liquid and solids. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. For the rub: In a medium bowl, mix the pumpkin pie spice, paprika, salt, cumin and pepper. Rub the mixture on all sides of the turkey and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Leave at room temperature for 2 hours. (If you have an extra day in your planning, leave it in the refrigerator overnight uncovered. This will help dry the skin more, then when ready to fry, remove from the refrigerator and let rest at room temperature for 2 hours.) Fill the fryer with vegetable or canola oil and heat to 350 degrees F according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions (see Cook&#39;s Note). Cook the bird for approximately 3 minutes per pound and then add an additional 5 minutes onto the cooking time. A 15-pound bird will take about 50 minutes. (Check the cooking times on your fryer; cook according to instructions and fry for the correct time according to weight.) Remove to a paper towel-lined platter and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour so the juices can redistribute, then carve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 37006,&quot;Gazpacho served in Bell Peppers 1 pound tomatoes 2 scallions 1 red bell pepper, seeds removed 1 celery stalk 1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced 2/3 cup lightly packed cilantro, stems discarded before measuring 1 to 2 jalapeno chiles, seeds removed 1/2 cucumber, skinned, seeds removed 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic or red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup canned tomato juice 4 bell peppers, any color, or assorted colors, tops sliced off, seeds and membranes hollowed out Instructions: Core tomatoes, then cut a small \X\ at the bottom.

Stir with fork until smooth. Set aside. In a small saute pan over medium heat, heat the oil and add the onion. Saute until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine beef, veal, pork, honey, cooked onions and egg. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the bread crumb-cream mixture to the meat, and mix well. With wet hands 9to keep the meat from sticking), shape a meatball the size of a golf ball. If the meat is too soft to shape, more bread crumbs may be added to the mixture. Continue shaping meatballs, placing on a plate brushed with water. There will be about 24 meatballs. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and add the meatballs. Saute, browning on all sides, until cooked through, about 7 minutes. Remove to a plate, and discard the fat from the skillet. Return skillet to heat, and add shallots, red pepper and plums. Saute until softened and lightly browned. Add chicken broth, then remaining 1/ 4 cup of heavy cream. Stir in plum sauce, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barbera]&quot; 37008,&quot;Beer Can Chicken 1 large whole chicken (4 to 5 pounds) 3 tablespoons Memphis Rub (or your favorite dry barbecue rub 1 can (12 ounces) beer Instructions: Remove and discard the fat just inside the body cavities of the chicken. Remove the package of giblets and set aside for another use. Rinse the chicken inside and out, under cold running water, then drain and blot dry inside and out, with paper towels. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the rub inside the body and neck cavities, then rub another 1 tablespoon all over the skin of the bird. If you wish, rub another 1/2 tablespoon of the mixture between the flesh and skin. Cover and refrigerate the chicken while you preheat the grill. Set up the grill for indirect grilling, placing a drip pan in the center. If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to medium. If using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box and preheat to high; then when smoke appears, lower the heat to medium. Pop the tab on the beer can. Using a &#39;church key&#39;-style can opener, make 6 or 7 holes in the top of the can. Pour out the top inch of beer, then spoon the remaining dry rub through the holes into the beer. Holding the chicken upright, with the opening of the body cavity down, insert the beer can into the cavity. When ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss 1/2 the wood chips on the coals. Oil the grill grate. Stand the chicken up in the center of the hot grate, over the drip pan. Spread out the legs to form a sort of tripod, to support the bird. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until fall-off-the-bone tender, 2 hours. If using charcoal, add 10 to 12 fresh coals per side and the remaining wood chips after 1 hour. Using tongs, lift the bird to a cutting board or platter, holding a large metal spatula underneath the beer can for support. (Have the board or platter right next to the bird to make the move shorter. Be careful not to spill hot beer on yourself.) Let stand for 5 minutes before carving meat off the upright carcass. (Toss the beer can out along with the carcass.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 37009,&quot;Cajun Mashed Potatoes 5 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks 2 sticks butter<br> One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon Cajun Seasoning, recipe follows 1/2 to 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, such as Lawry&#39;s<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons garlic powder 2 tablespoons paprika<br> 2 tablespoons black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and add the potatoes.

When the oil gets hot, add the pine nuts. Season them lightly with salt and cook them, stirring constantly, until they turn golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove them from the pan to a small bowl. Stir in the minced garlic, salt, to taste, and the mint.<br> In a large plate, combine the remaining olive oil, the zucchini slices, paprika and light sprinkling of salt. For best results, \dust\ the zucchini with the paprika but put it in a little strainer and sprinkle it evenly over the zucchini slices. Toss to coat them with the oil. Season them lightly with salt. Arrange them in a single layer on the hottest part of the grill and cook until they are tender to the touch and charred but not falling apart, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a pair of metal tongs to remove the zucchini from the grill and transfer them to a flat surface. Stack the slices and cut them widthwise into 1/2-inch slices, then make 1 slice down the middle, creating a 1/2-inch dice. Toss them in the bowl with the pine nuts, and then add the lemon juice. Dip a cloth into some oil and rub over the grill grates. Scatter the clams on the grill in a single layer. Have a pair of tongs and a large platter ready. Littleneck clams take a while to open up, about 10 minutes depending on size, but that&#39;s all a part of the fun - the suspense of waiting for them to open. Add a splash of water to help them along and steam. As they open, use the tongs to remove them from the grill and put them on the platter. When they are all opened, scatter the zucchini and pine nuts all around. Try to get the zucchini inside the shells directly on top of the clams and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 37035,&quot;Cinnamon-Pancetta Carbonara 4 slices bacon, chopped 4 slices pancetta, chopped 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 cups whipping cream 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan 6 large egg yolks 18 ounces fresh fettuccine Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives Instructions: Saute the bacon and pancetta in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes.

Combine the brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, cumin, mustard powder and 2 tablespoons salt in a small bowl. Rub the ribs all over with the cut sides of the lemon and then the spice mixture and place in a large roasting pan or resealable plastic bag. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Meanwhile, soak the wood chips in water 1 hour, then prepare your grill for smoking, filling the smoker box with one-quarter each of the wood chips and apple. About 30 minutes before smoking, remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature. Meanwhile, combine the apple juice, Worcestershire sauce and vinegar in a small spray bottle. Shake to mix. Once the grill reaches 250 degrees F, lightly brush the grates with vegetable oil and place the ribs on the cooler side of the grill, meat-side up. Spray with the apple juice mixture. Close the grill and let smoke 1 hour. Replenish the smoker box with another one-quarter each of the wood chips and apple. Flip the ribs so they&#39;re meat-side down with the opposite edge of the racks closer to the smoker box. Spray with the apple juice mixture; close the grill and let smoke 1 more hour. Repeat this process every hour until the ribs are dark brown and tender and the meat starts to shrink away from the bones, about 2 more hours. Remove the ribs from the grill and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. How to prep your ribs: Position the ribs meat-side down. Insert a paring knife under the membrane that covers the back of the rack. Loosen the membrane with the knife. Grab the membrane with your fingers and peel off completely. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 37044,&quot;Frozen Blueberry Daiquiris 1/2 cup (100 g) sugar 1 pint (335 g) blueberries 2 cups (480 ml) rum 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lime juice 2 cups (480 ml) ice Instructions: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar and 1/2 cup (120 ml) water and bring to a low boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves.

Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan, pressing gently to fit, trim the edge to within 1/2-inch of the pan, turn under, and crimp decoratively. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the pie shell with parchment paper and fill with pie weights, dry beans, or rice. Bake until the crust is set, about 12 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and weights and bake until lightly colored, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before filling. Combine the granulated sugar, cornstarch, milk, water, and pinch of the salt in a large, non-reactive saucepan, whisk to combine, and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally. As the mixture reaches a simmer and begins to thicken and turn clear, 4 to 5 minutes, whisk in the egg yolks, 2 at a time. Slowly add the lemon juice, whisking constantly, and add the zest and limoncello. Add the butter, 1 piece at a time, and whisking constantly, return to a simmer. Remove from the heat and pour immediately into the prepared pie crust. Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, and remaining pinch salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beating constantly, gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until glossy stiff peaks form, being careful not to over beat, as this will make the meringue difficult to spread. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Working 1 row at a time, pipe the meringue across the top of the hot lemon filling in a zigzag pattern, alternating direction with each row. Cover the pie filling completely, going out to the pastry edges, so the meringue does not draw up or weep during baking. (Alternatively, spread the meringue evenly over the pie filling using a rubber spatula, smoothing out to the pastry edges. Make decorative peaks in the meringue using a dull knife or the back of a spoon.) To quickly cook the meringue, preheat the broiler with the rack in the highest position. Place the pie under the broiler and cook until the meringue is set and golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes, watching carefully to avoid burning. (Alternatively, the meringue can be cooked in a preheated 325 degree F oven until set and golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes.) Transfer the pie to a wire rack to cool completely before serving. Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl. With your fingers, work the butter and shortening into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add 3 tablespoons of the ice water and work with your fingers just until the dough comes together, adding more water as needed, 1 teaspoon at a time, to make a smooth dough, being careful not to overwork the dough. Form the dough into a disk shape, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37047,&quot;Shellfish and Chorizo Paella with Saffron and Squid Ink Rice 4 plum tomatoes, sliced in half lengthwise 1 tablespoon honey 1/2 cup olive oil, divided 4 lobsters (1 1/2 pounds each) 1/2 pound chorizo, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 4 baby squid, cleaned Saffron rice, recipe follows Squid Ink Rice, recipe follows 2 cups chicken stock or clam stock 1 cup fresh peas 24 mussels, debearded and scrubbed 24 littleneck clams, scrubbed 4 tablespoons lemon aioli, recipe follows Chopped flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large Spanish onion, diced 2 cups long grain rice Large pinch saffron 4 cups hot chicken stock Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 medium Spanish onion, diced 2 cups long grain rice 2 tablespoons squid ink 4 cups chicken stock Salt and freshly ground pepper 4 cloves garlic, peeled 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 egg yolks 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon chopped lemon zest 3/4 cup olive oil Freshly ground white pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Toss the potatoes with the vinegar and place in a mesh strainer. Place a couple plates on top of the potatoes and weigh the potatoes down to try and squeeze out the excess water. Let sit for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Cut the remaining 3 potatoes into 6 pieces each. Place them in a saucepan with the garlic. Cover the potatoes with water by about 1-inch. Season the water generously with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and simmer until they are fork tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Strain and, while the potatoes are still hot, pass them through a food mill or mash with a potato masher. Combine the grated potatoes and the mashed potatoes. In a small dish, beat the 2 eggs and add to the potato mixture. Season with salt. Coat a large saute pan or cast iron pan with olive oil and bring to a medium high heat. Make a 3-inch patty with the potato mixture, cook it, and eat it to make sure that the potato mix is seasoned perfectly. Re-season if needed. Working in batches, make and cook all the pancakes, until they are brown and crispy and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Blot the pancakes on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.

Butter a 10-by-12-inch baking dish and place on a baking sheet. Set aside. Whisk together the eggs, milk, cream and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the cornbread, press to submerge, and let stand, stirring once or twice to soak the cornbread evenly and thoroughly. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, add the sausage, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Add the onion, bell pepper and poblano to the drippings in the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned in spots and soft, about 5 minutes. Stir the sausage and onion mixture into the cornbread mixture. Stir in the chopped cilantro, 3/4 cup of the Cheddar and 3/4 cup of the Monterey Jack. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish, dot with the goat cheese and sprinkle on the cotija and remaining 1/4 cups Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Bake until the edges are puffed and lightly golden brown and the center still jiggles slightly, about 40 minutes. For the tomato sauce: While the strata bakes, heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and chipotle and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced by half and thickened, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a blender and puree until creamy, venting the top of the blender to allow steam to escape. Return the sauce to the saucepan over low heat, and whisk in the crema and salt and pepper to taste; let the sauce heat through and then remove from the heat. Stir in the lime juice and cover to keep warm. Let the strata rest for about 10 minutes, then serve with the creamy spicy tomato sauce, garnishing each serving with some of the whole cilantro leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 37051,&quot;Chicken Proscuitto Tortelloni 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast 2 teaspoons minced garlic<br> 2 teaspoons chopped parsley<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil<br> 3 slices prosciutto<br> 3 ounces ricotta 1 tablespoon grated Pecorino-Romano 2 eggs<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 6 to 7 sheets fresh pasta Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the chicken breast length-wise down the middle. Place it on a small sheet pan and cover with 1 teaspoon each of the garlic and parsley; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle with the olive oil.

Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken on both sides until deep golden brown on the outside and done in the middle (or to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F), about 4 minutes per side. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes. For the dressing: While the chicken is cooking, pour the ranch dressing into a bowl. Add the salsa and cilantro and stir to combine. For the salad: Next, place the ears of corn in the skillet you used to cook the chicken and roll them around so that the flavorful oil/butter mixture coats the corn. Grill on a grill pan or cook in a separate skillet until the corn is still crisp but has color on the outside. Slice off the kernels with a sharp knife and set aside. Dice the chicken into cubes. On a platter, layer the shredded lettuce, diced chicken, tomatoes, cheese, corn, avocados, green onions, cilantro and crushed chips. Drizzle the dressing all over the top, saving some to serve on the side if you&#39;d like. Serve the salad in individual bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 37053,&quot;\Cuisinart\ Yellow Tomato Gazpacho 2 yellow bell peppers seeded, de-ribbed and coarsely chopped 2 small cucumbers, peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 1 yellow onion, peeled, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, peeled and cleaned 2 pounds yellow tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 1/4 cup sugar cane vinegar 1/2 cup fruity olive oil Ice cubes (optional) Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste Instructions: In a blender, or a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the yellow peppers and cucumbers, puree.

Place 2 fillets side by side on each square and fold up the outer edges. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of lemon juice over each fillet. Season with salt and pepper. Fold and pinch the aluminum foil extra tightly to create a watertight seal around each pair of fillets. Make sure the packet is airtight by pressing down on it gently with your hand. If air escapes easily, rewrap. Place foil packets on the top rack of the dishwasher. Run dishwasher for the entire \normal\ cycle. When cycle is complete, take out salmon, discard foil, place 1 fillet on each plate, and spoon a generous serving of dill sauce overtop. Don&#39;t have a dishwasher? Bake foil-wrapped packets in a preheated 400 degree F oven for 12 minutes. The Instruction Manual: 1. Seal individual-size fillets in aluminum foil. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COOK A WHOLE FISH. 2. Place fish packets on the top rack. 3. Add dirty dishes and lemon-scented soap. This optional step is not recommended for novices. However, as long as the salmon is tightly sealed in the aluminum foil, it will not absorb any soapy taste or smell. 4. Set the dishwasher to the \normal\ cycle. Modern dishwashers have \economy\ and \cool dry\ settings, which are undesirable because they conserve heat. However, on the other end of the spectrum, the \pots and pans\ setting tends to overcook the fish. 5. Run salmon through the entire wash-and-dry cycle: approximately 50 minutes for most models. I have poached salmon in almost every make and model, and although the temperatures and duration of the cycles vary with each machine, a little more or less \washing\ will not affect it greatly because salmon is extremely forgiving. 6. To heighten the drama for your disbelieving guests, and to prove that you have nothing up your sleeve, let them crowd around the dishwasher when you load the salmon. When the cycle is complete, invite them back to witness the unloading. 7. Troubleshoot. The only time I ever had a problem was on live national TV. Five minutes before going on the air I learned that the heating element in the on-camera dishwasher was broken. After a quick huddle with the producer, I was forced to make the most of the situation by baking the salmon in the (gasp!) oven. To avoid this pedestrian fate, ask yourself the million-dollar question: When your dishwasher last completed its cycle, were the dishes hot? As long as the answer is yes, you are ready to poach. Melt the butter over medium heat in a saute pan. Add the leek, jalapeno, and garlic and saute until the leeks are translucent but not brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add the stock. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. (Adjust heat as required to maintain simmer.) The liquid should reduce by half. Remove from heat and let cool. Transfer to a blender or food processor and add the dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Puree until smooth. Reserve and reheat just before serving. Stir in the sour cream at the last minute. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37059,&quot;Garlicky Pork Stew Salsa Verde 4 tablespoons vegetable oil One 4-pound pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound tomatillos, husked, halved if larger than a golf ball 1 clove garlic, sliced 1 large onion, diced 2 tablespoons cornmeal 2 cups chicken broth 2 tablespoons pickled jalapenos, chopped Juice of 3 limes 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves Cooked white rice, for serving Instructions: Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add the pork in a single layer and cook, turning, until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer the pork to a large bowl after each batch. Add the tomatillos and cook until softened and browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a clean bowl. Lower the heat to medium and add the garlic and onions and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir the cornmeal into the pot until thickened, then add the chicken broth. Return the pork to the pot and bring to a simmer. Put the blistered tomatillos, jalapenos, lime juice and half of the cilantro in a blender and blend until smooth. Add the sauce to the pot.

Line a sheet pan with parchment and coat with baking spray. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil. Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the cocoa and stir together. Add the boiling water, stir, return the mixture to a boil and allow to boil for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and pour the cocoa water over the flour mixture. Stir slightly to cool. Combine the buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla and beaten eggs in a pitcher. Stir the buttermilk mixture into the cooled flour/chocolate mixture and make sure it is thoroughly combined so you have a smooth, brown batter. Pour the batter into the prepared sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes. For the buttercream: Meanwhile, make the frosting by adding the powdered sugar, butter and vanilla to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a blade attachment. Beat on a medium-low speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Remove and add to a large resealable bag. Flatten as much as possible and place on a sheet pan or tray. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool completely. Cut the cake into 4 equal rectangles and remove from the pan. Wrap each in plastic wrap and add to the sheet pan or tray with the frosting. Complete the kit with a resealable plastic bag of sprinkles and freeze until ready to assemble. (Can be frozen for up to 1 month.) To assemble: Remove the kit from the freezer and allow everything to thaw for 2 to 3 hours. Assemble the cake adding frosting, caramel syrup and chocolate syrup between each layer.

In a plastic bag, marinate the fish in olive oil and your fresh herb of choice (cilantro matches well with the jicama slaw) for 2 hours in the refrigerator. Cut the lemon into small wedges and stuff them into the cavity of the fish. While the fish is marinating, make the Slaw: Julienne the jicama and the carrot. Mix in the scallion and cilantro. Combine the rice wine vinegar, fresh lime juice, sugar, and chili paste, if using, in a small bowl to dissolve the sugar and then toss with the vegetables. Place the slaw in the refrigerator and chill. To grill the snapper: Place the marinated fish into a grilling basket, making sure to wipe off any excess marinade which can cause the fire to flare up. Use a high heat, and grill fish for about 10 minutes per inch of thickness at its thickest point. Make sure you only turn the fish once. If you don&#39;t have a grilling basket, try wrapping the fish in a banana leaf, it will help prevent the fish from falling apart, while allowing the flavor of the grill to penetrate the snapper. To bake the fish: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Transfer the marinated fish to a large, well-greased oval ceramic casserole or roasting dish. A large oval saute pan also works well. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes per inch of thickness at the thickest part. The fish is done when the thickest part has a moist and juicy appearance. Do not cook until flaky, this means the fish is overdone and will taste dry. Check the readiness of the fish by gently lifting the fillet away from the bone along the dorsal fin near the head. An instant thermometer can also tell you when the fish is done. It should read approximately140 degrees F. To serve, spread the jicama slaw onto a large oval serving dish, and place the grilled fish on top for a wonderful looking (and tasting) dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 37063,&quot;Herbed-Parmesan Pumpkin Seeds 1 pumpkin Olive oil, for tossing Kosher salt Grated Parmesan Dried oregano Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300?

Line standard-size cupcake pans with 16 cupcake liners. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy milk and lemon juice; set aside until the mixture is curdled. In a medium bowl, melt the margarine in the microwave. Once melted, add in the cane sugar, applesauce, vanilla extract and the soy milk mixture. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into the wet mixture and whisk together until everything is evenly incorporated with few lumps remaining. Fill the liners three-quarters full and bake until golden and a toothpick comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool completely. To assemble: Using a large round frosting tip, pipe a generous amount of Creme Brulee Frosting onto each cupcake. Refrigerate the cupcakes until the frosting is pretty stiff, about 5 minutes. Place the raw sugar in a small bowl and dip the tops of the cupcakes in the sugar. Using a small kitchen blowtorch, torch the tops of the cupcakes (the raw sugar part only) until the sugar turns a dark caramel color. Combine 1/4 cup of the coconut milk with the soy milk, cane sugar, tapioca starch and salt. Whisk well to combine. Combine the remaining coconut milk with the brown sugar and vanilla in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring often. Add the coconut milk/tapioca starch mixture to the pan.

Add cream of tartar and beat at high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remianing 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Meanwhile, boil th esuagr mixture until it reaches 248 to 250 degrees F. on the candy thermometer. Do not let the temperature go above 250 degrees F. Turn off the heat and immediately pour the mixture into a glass measuring cup to stop the sugar from cooking. Pour a little of the sugar mixture onto the egg whites and beat them on low. Slowly add the rest of the sugar and then beat on high for 2 minutes. Beat on low until the mixture is cool. Add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the egg white mixture, beating continuously on low until all the butter is added. If the mixture starts to separate, beat on high for a few seconds until it solidifies. Beat until smooth, then add the flavoring. This icing can be stored at room temperature for 2 days or refrigerated for 10 days. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Moscato, Riesling, Prosecco]&quot; 37090,&quot;Warm Spinach and Artichoke Dip Crackers - 1 pkg Crunchmaster?

Once browned, add nutmeg, allspice, cumin powder, salt, saffron, cinnamon sticks, cardamom seeds, and peppercorns. Add approximately 5 cups of water to just cover the chicken and bring to a boil. Season with freshly ground pepper. Cover and simmer over low-medium heat for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the meat begins to pull away from the bone. When done, set the chicken aside and discard the broth. Fry the cauliflower in a large pot with 3 cups of canola oil until golden brown. Remove and let drain on paper towels. Once that is done, repeat this process with the eggplant. (Note, do not rinse the salt off the eggplant the guest believes that it removes flavor.) Set both the fried cauliflower and eggplant aside. Heat 3 tablespoons of canola oil in the pot that previously contained the chicken. When the oil is hot, not smoking, add the feathered onions and cook until they sweat, about 10 minutes. Add the cooked chicken, bone and all; cook together for a few minutes then cover and let steep with the burner off for 15 minutes. During this time, rinse the rice about 5 or 6 times until the water runs clear. Put the rice in a bowl, stir the spices into the raw rice, and mix well. Add the fried eggplant and cauliflower to the chicken mixture and then put the seasoned rice on top. Pour water into the pot to just barely cover the rice. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cover. Approximately 10 minutes later add a 1/4 cup of oil and re-cover. When the water is completely gone the dish is done, about 25 minutes or until rice is cooked. Remove the pot from the heat and let rest for about 10 to 15 minutes. Place a large serving plate on top of the dish and flip the pot and plate over. Very carefully, lift the pot off the plate and the layered dish is done, add a little garnish and it is ready to serve.

Transfer the crust to a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan. Trim the edges so the crust hangs over the pie pan by 1/2 inch. Tuck the edges of the crust under to be even with edge of the pie pan and press all around with the tines of a fork. Place the crust in the refrigerator for 1 hour or in the freezer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the tomatoes crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Using your fingers, push out as many of the watery tomato seeds as you can. Lay the slices flat on a paper towel-lined sheet tray and sprinkle all over with the salt. Let drain for 30 minutes, then pat very dry. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. While the tomatoes are draining, in a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, whole egg, egg yolk and hot sauce, if using. Stir in the Cheddar, blue cheese, parsley, dill, black pepper and scallions. Sprinkle the cornmeal over the bottom of the crust. Pat the tomato slices dry once again, then place a third of the tomatoes in the bottom of the pie crust, overlapping them slightly to fit. Top with half of the mayonnaise mixture. Repeat with another layer of tomatoes and another layer of mayonnaise mixture. Place the remaining tomatoes on top, pressing the last layer gently into the mayonnaise mixture. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and wrap just the edges of the crust with foil to avoid burning. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake until the mayonnaise mixture is puffed and golden brown and the center is no longer wobbly, about 30 minutes more. Let cool for 1 1/2 hours. Top with additional herbs, if desired, then slice and serve. Combine the flour, shortening, butter and salt in a large bowl. Using a pastry cutter, gradually work it all together until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat the egg with a fork and add it to the mixture along with the vinegar. Add 5 tablespoons cold water. Stir until it comes together, adding another tablespoon or two of water if it needs the moisture. Form the mixture into 2 balls and wrap them in individual plastic bags. If using immediately, chill for 20 minutes in the refrigerator before rolling out. If freezing, remove from the freezer 30 minutes before you are ready to use them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37116,&quot;Grilled Potato Wedges with Smoked Paprika Mayonnaise Dressing 4 large Russet potatoes, cut into wedges and par-cooked Canola oil, for brushing Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar Juice from 2 grilled lemons 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish 2 tablespoons smoked paprika Handful flat-leaf parsley leaves, for garnish Instructions: Preheat a charcoal or gas grill to high heat.

Add the cream, milk, vanilla beans, corn cobs and kernels, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a scald, being careful not to curdle the cream. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks with the sugar in a large bowl, until fully incorporated, reaching a creamy, golden consistency. Once the milk mixture comes to a boil, strain it into a large bowl. Remove the corn cobs, kernels and vanilla beans. Remove the vanilla bean seeds by scraping the beans with the back of your knife. Add the seeds to the milk mixture. Discard the corn cobs and use a ladle or a wooden spoon to push any liquids through the remaining solids, into the milk mixture. Discard the solids. Add the salt. Slowly add the milk mixture to the eggs, whisking constantly as you pour, tempering it to make sure the eggs don&#39;t scramble. Quickly wipe out the original saucepan and return the milk mixture to the pan. Put the pan over medium heat, stirring consistently until you reach a thickened consistency, that coats the back of a spoon, about 3 to 5 minutes. Strain the ice cream mixture into a new bowl and immediately put the bowl over an ice bath, stirring, to cool quickly. Once chilled down completely, pour it into an ice cream machine and spin according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Remove the ice cream to a large container and put it in the freezer to help set up the right consistency. For the popcorn: Heat the olive oil in a medium-size saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the popcorn kernels and cover with a lid. Cook according to the package directions until the corn is fully popped. Once popped and still hot, salt generously. Set aside. Use a spoon to shape a scoop of ice cream onto each serving plate. Spoon some of the candied bacon generously over the ice cream on each plate and garnish with the popcorn. Taste! To a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, add oil and bacon. Render the bacon until crunchy, about 7 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally to be sure it&#39;s not sticking to the pan. Once fully crisp, pour off a little excess fat. Add the brown sugar to the bacon in the pan and stir it to dissolve and caramelize. Stir in the lemon juice and cream, and stir well to combine.

Bring to a boil and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup. Strain the mixture into a blender and discard the solids. Add the vinegar and salt to taste and blend to combine. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until emulsified; add the honey to taste. For the dough: Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups flour and the salt, stirring until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups flour. Continue adding the flour (up to 1/2 cup), 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until the dough comes away from the bowl but is still sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead with lightly floured hands. Start by slapping the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself (use a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape the dough from the surface). Repeat until it&#39;s easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading normally until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in volume, 3 hours. Press it with your finger to see if it&#39;s done; an indent should remain. Prepare the charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash). Add to the grill and create a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, leaving the other half with no coals. Remove the dough from the bowl, divide in half and shape each half into a ball. Brush with oil and set aside for 30 minutes. Stretch and shape each ball of dough into a 12 by 10-inch rectangle or round on a flat surface. Brush the tops of each with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let rest for 15 minutes. Place on the grill directly over the coals, oiled side down, and grill until lightly golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip over and grill for 1 minute longer. Place the flatbreads on a flat surface and divide the Monterey Jack cheese evenly over the top. Arrange the cut figs on top and the blue cheese around the figs. Return to the grill on the opposite side of the coals, for indirect heat, close the cover and cook until the cheese has melted and the figs are heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the grill and drizzle with some of the red wine vinaigrette and garnish with parsley leaves.

Once the bourbon is mostly absorbed, add the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly. Wait until the liquid has evaporated, before adding another 1/2 cup. (You will have to babysit this a bit, but just be patient.) After you have added about 4 cups of the broth, add the broccoli, asparagus and peas. Continue adding the broth in 1/2 cup increments; you will notice the mixture starting to thicken. Stir and add the remaining broth. When the rice is tender, after about 45 minutes, stir in the goat cheese, orange zest, orange juice, and the remaining 1 tablespoon bourbon. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 37185,&quot;Almond Cake with Key Lime Buttercream and Raspberry Compote 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus for greasing pans 1 1/4 cups sugar<br> 8 eggs, separated 1 cup almond meal<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 4 1/4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/4 cup evaporated milk<br> 1/4 cup almond liqueur<br> 1 cup water 3/4 cup sugar<br> 1/4 cup almond liqueur<br> 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature 1 cup cream cheese, room temperature<br> 4 cups powdered sugar, sifted<br> 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice Zest of 2 limes<br> 1 pint raspberries 1/2 pint blackberries<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1/4 cup water<br> Juice of 1 lime<br> Blackberries Raspberries White chocolate curls, fans, etc., optional<br> Powdered sugar Instructions: For the almond cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with butter and line with parchment. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, fully combining before each addition. Keep mixing until light and pale. Add the almond meal and mix to combine. In another bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder to combine. Set aside. Combine the evaporated milk and almond liqueur. Set aside. With the mixer on low speed, alternate adding one-third of the flour mixture and one-half of the evaporated milk mixture to the creamed butter. Start and end with the flour, and do not overmix. With a hand mixer or stand mixer, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until stiff. Gently fold into the batter. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake until the tops are golden and spring back when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then run a paring knife or mini offset spatula around the pans and unmold the cakes onto a rack. Let cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. For the almond liqueur simple syrup: Whisk the water and sugar together in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn off the burner and let cool for about 20 minutes Once cooled, stir in almond liqueur. Reserve. For the key lime buttercream: In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and cream cheese together until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Mix in the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, and then add the lime juice and zest. Scrape down the bowl and mix for another 5 minutes, until satiny and fluffy. Reserve. For the raspberry compote: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the raspberries, blackberries, sugar, water and lime juice. Cook until you can start to crush the berries with the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Cook for another 5 minutes to thicken a bit. Remove from the heat and set aside. To assemble: Slice each cake horizontally into two equal layers. Place the first layer, cut-side up, on a cake board. Using a pastry brush, brush the surface with about 3 tablespoons of the almond syrup. Transfer the buttercream to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip and pipe a border around the edge of the cake. With a mini offset spatula, spread a thin layer of buttercream in the center of the cake layer. Then, staying inside the piped border, spread a thin layer of the raspberry compote on top of the buttercream. Place another cake layer, cut-side up, on top. Repeat with the rest of the layers. To decorate the top of the cake: Pipe a border of buttercream beads around the edge and then spread with a thin layer of buttercream. Top with blackberries, raspberries, and white chocolate decorations if using. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 37186,&quot;Gluten-Free Pear and Almond Cake 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil, plus more for oiling the parchment paper 1 1/2 cups almond meal 1/2 cup gluten-free rolled oats 1/4 cup gluten-free oat flour 3 tablespoons brown rice flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 large egg 2 large ripe Anjou pears 5 tablespoons maple syrup, plus more for drizzling 1/4 cup maple sugar 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract Pinch sea salt Chopped almonds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 12-inch square piece of parchment paper, and press it into a 9-inch round cake pan. (Don&#39;t worry about the sides overlapping-this is what creates a rustic edge.) Set aside.<br> Process the almond meal, oats, oat flour, rice flour and baking powder in a food processor until the oats are ground. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl; set aside.<br> Beat the egg in another medium bowl; set aside. Peel and roughly chop 1 of the pears. Process the chopped pears, coconut oil, maple syrup, maple sugar, vanilla, almond extract and salt in a food processor until smooth; add the mixture to the bowl with the egg, and whisk to combine. Pour the pear-egg mixture into the flour mixture, and stir to combine. Transfer the batter to the prepared cake pan, and lightly spread it out.<br> Working quickly, peel, quarter and core the remaining pear. Cut each quarter into 4 long slices, arrange them in a circle on top of the batter and sprinkle with chopped almonds. Bake the cake until the edges are deep golden and a toothpick comes out clean, 50 minutes. Set aside to cool.<br> Drizzle the cake with maple syrup, and serve warm or cool. Leftover cake can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37187,&quot;Warm Cherry Tomato Salad 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 pints cherry tomatoes, rinsed and stems removed 6 scallions, sliced on an angle 2 tablespoons kosher for Passover red wine vinegar, a generous splash Salt and pepper 1/2 cup coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Heat a medium skillet over medium high heat.

Let sit 10 minutes to dissolve; you will see a few bubbles but the mixture won&#39;t be foamy. Whisk together the granulated sugar, zest, eggs and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Add the bread flour, whole-wheat flour, milk powder and the egg mixture to the yeast mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Fit the bowl in place on a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on medium speed until the dough comes together but is still slightly tough, about 3 minutes. Increase the speed to high and add 7 tablespoons of the butter, a tablespoon at a time (the dough will look broken after each addition, but it will eventually come together), and beat until the dough is smooth, elastic and very tacky but pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 12 minutes. (This may seem like a long time, but the texture of the bread improves with a long knead time.) Alternatively, knead the dough on surface lightly dusted with bread flour, adding 1 tablespoon of the butter at a time, until smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in volume, 35 to 50 minutes. (Check it at 35 minutes: It should smell buttery and yeasty, and if it&#39;s doubled, it&#39;s done. If not, check again in 10 minutes.) Meanwhile, whisk together the dark brown sugar, cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until no lumps of sugar remain. Smash in 8 tablespoons of the remaining butter and stir until completely combined. Set aside until ready to assemble. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Gently deflate the dough by lifting it up around the edges and letting it fall back into the bowl, turning the bowl and repeating if needed. Transfer to a clean work surface lightly dusted with bread flour. Roll into a 12-inch square, pushing the edges towards the center to make the straight sides. Spread the butter mixture over the dough in an even layer leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edges. Tightly roll into a log, pressing the sides occasionally to keeps them flush. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and freeze for 20 minutes to firm up the dough.<br> Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Cut the dough log crosswise into 8 equal pieces and arrange, cut-side up, in the pan, gently shaping each cinnamon roll to make them fit in the pan. Let rise, uncovered, in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in volume and the rolls reach the top of the pan, 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. Cover tightly with foil. Fold an 18-inch piece of foil in half lengthwise, then fold it in half again lengthwise and finally once more in half lengthwise, making a 4 1/2-inch wide foil sling for the pan. Place a rack in a 6- or 8-quart Instant Pot? and fill with 2 cups water. Place the cinnamon rolls in the center of the sling and lower into the pot. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on the high-pressure setting for 40 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for natural release. After 15 minutes, being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, cream, vanilla and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until smooth and creamy, adding more cream if necessary.<br> Transfer the pan to a rack set inside a baking sheet, remove the foil and let cool 20 minutes in the pan. Invert onto a serving plate or platter. Drizzle the icing over the top and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37189,&quot;Egg White and Frittata 2 medium sized zucchini, cut in 1/4-inch slices Olive oil, for grilling 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt, plus more for seasoning 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper, plus more for seasoning 2 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup diced pancetta, (6 slices) 1 teaspoon minced garlic 2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced 1 tablespoon chiffonade fresh mint leaves 1 tablespoon chiffonade fresh basil leaves 12 egg whites 1/4 cup Swiss cheese Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Brush zucchini with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill over medium heat in a grill pan until tender and marked. Allow to cool and dice. In a 12-inch cast iron skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add pancetta and cook until crisp. Add garlic and allow to cook until fragrant. Stir in the grilled zucchini, tomatoes, and fresh herbs. Slightly beat egg whites in a large bowl and add to the pan. Turn the heat off, stir in the Swiss cheese and season with coarse salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Place in oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until egg is set. Remove from the oven and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 37190,&quot;Pistachio-Stuffed Figs 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 cup/30 g chopped pistachios or almonds 2 tablespoons flour 8 small fresh figs and/or apricots Whipped cream or creme fraiche, for serving Instructions: Heat the oven to broil. Mash together the butter, sugar, pistachios and flour and chill for 1 hour. Cut a cross from the top about three-quarters of the way down into the figs. Divide chilled filling into as many balls as you have figs, and poke the filling into the openings of each fig. Broil until the nut mixture is golden and the figs hot, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve with whipped cream or creme fraiche. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 37191,&quot;The Best Creme Brulee 2 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 12 tablespoons sugar<br> 7 large egg yolks<br> Instructions: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 300 degrees F. Line a large heavy roasting pan (a turkey roasting pan works great) with a clean kitchen towel and place 4 six-ounce ramekins on top of the towel spaced a few inches apart. Heat the cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Using the back of a paring knife, scrape the vanilla seeds from both halves of the pod. Add the seeds and pod to the cream. Whisk in the salt and 3 tablespoons of the sugar and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat.<br> Vigorously whisk the yolks and 3 more tablespoons of the sugar in a large bowl until pale yellow and very thick and creamy, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, you can use an electric mixer on high speed and beat until pale yellow and very thick and creamy, about 1 minute.<br> Whisking the yolks constantly, add a couple of teaspoons at a time from 1 cup of the hot cream, then increase to a steady stream until the cream is fully incorporated. (Don&#39;t pour too much hot cream at once or you&#39;ll end up with scrambled eggs.) The yolks are now tempered. Whisk the tempered yolks back into the remaining hot cream until combined. Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a large measuring cup or medium pitcher for easier pouring; discard the vanilla pods.<br> Skim the foam off the top of the custard by placing a clean paper towel on top and lightly pressing down so it touches the surface and absorbs some of the liquid. This will make for a completely smooth and silky custard. Fill the ramekins with the custard, about 3/4 cup per ramekin.<br> Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan halfway up the sides of the ramekins without getting any water in the custard. Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake until the custard is set around the edges but still has a slight jiggle in the center, 35 to 45 minutes. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and transfer the ramekins to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes. Then refrigerate until very cold, about 3 hours.<br> Just before serving, evenly spread 1 tablespoon of the sugar over the top of a custard. Hold a kitchen torch 2 inches above the surface. Starting in the center of the ramekin, move the flame in a circular motion and work your way out to the edges to caramelize the sugar. Repeat with the remaining sugar and custards.<br> Alternatively, arrange a rack in the top position of the oven and heat the broiler on high. Place the ramekins on a rack set inside a baking sheet and broil until deep golden brown, 15 to 60 seconds, checking every 10 seconds.<br> Freeze the custards for 5 minutes before serving (see Cook\u2019s Note).<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37192,&quot;Classic Strawberry Shortcake 2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling 1 tablespoon baking powder Fine salt 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 1/3 cups heavy cream, plus more for brushing 1 large egg 1/4 cup honey One 16-ounce container strawberries, trimmed and chopped (about 3 cups) 1/3 cup mint leaves, torn, plus more for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Whisk together the flour, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, the baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add the butter and work it into the flour, using your fingers or a pastry cutter, until the butter pieces are the size of small peas. Whisk together 1/3 cup of the cream with the egg and 1/3 cup water in a small bowl. Add to the dry mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until a stiff batter forms. Drop 6 mounds onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between each biscuit. Brush with a bit of cream and sprinkle with sugar. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet. While the biscuits bake and cool, combine the honey with 1/3 cup water and a pinch of salt in a small saucepot. Gently simmer, stirring, over medium heat until the honey is dissolved and the mixture is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Cool, and then toss in a medium bowl with the strawberries and mint. If time allows, set aside for at least 30 minutes to allow the strawberries to release their juices. To assemble, whip the remaining 1 cup cream with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar to soft peaks in a medium bowl. Split each biscuit and place the bottom half on a plate. Top evenly with the berries and accumulated juices and then the whipped cream. Place the top of the biscuit on the shortcake and garnish with fresh mint. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 37193,&quot;Salsa di Parmigiano 1/2 pound Parmesan, not too dry 1/2 pound Asiago cheese, not too dry 2 teaspoons minced garlic 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons chopped green onion 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Remove any rind from the cheeses and chop the cheeses into rough 1-inch chunks.

Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer to reconstitute the mushrooms. Add the sherry to the pot with the onions, to deglaze the pan, then stir in the wine. Remove the mushrooms from their broth with a slotted spoon to a cutting board. Chop them, and add them to the onions. Add all but the last 1/2 cup of the mushroom liquid to the soup, about 1 cup. Add herb bundle and the beef stock to the pot and simmer the soup for 30 to 45 minutes. Cool and refrigerate for a make-ahead meal. Reheat over medium heat, covered, and prepare the croutons when ready to serve. Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Toast the bread on a rack over a baking sheet, until deep golden brown. Butter the bread, using the 2 tablespoons of remaining butter and liberally rub them with the cut garlic. Top the toasts with the cheeses and return them to the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Toasts may be arranged on top of crocks of soup, put on baking sheet, then topped with cheese and baked to brown, for a more dramatic presentation. Ladle the soup into serving bowls and serve with the cheese toasts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Barolo, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 37197,&quot;Flounder Milanese 6 flounder or sole fillets (1 3/4 pounds total) 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 extra-large eggs<br> 1 1/4 cups seasoned dry bread crumbs, such as Progresso<br> Unsalted butter<br> Good olive oil<br> 6 ounces arugula or mixed salad greens for 6<br> Lemon Vinaigrette, recipe follows 2 tablespoons drained capers<br> Freshly grated Italian Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, and fleur de sel, for serving<br> 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 cup good olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F and place a sheet pan in the oven.

Roast the sweet potatoes until very tender, about 1 hour. Let cool, peel, then puree in a food processor until smooth. Set aside 1 cup of the puree for the cupcakes and reserve the remaining puree for another use. Make the cupcakes: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line mini muffin tins with paper liners, and coat the liners and the top of the tin with cooking spray. Halve each marshmallow on the diagonal with kitchen shears; set aside. Whisk the flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cayenne together in a large bowl. Beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar in another large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and creamy. Add the 1 cup of reserved sweet potato puree, and beat until incorporated (it&#39;s OK if the batter curdles). Beat the eggs in 1 at a time. Beat in the vanilla. Adjust the mixer speed to medium-low, and beat in the flour mixture in 3 additions, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed, until just incorporated. Divide the batter evenly among the cups of the prepared muffin tins. Bake until the tops spring back when pressed, 18 to 20 minutes, rotating the tins halfway through. Let the muffins cool in the tins for a few minutes, then transfer them to a rack. While the cupcakes are still warm, top each with a marshmallow half, cut-side down. Let the cupcakes cool completely. (They can be cooked and cooled a day ahead and stored at room temperature in an airtight container.) Preheat the broiler. Transfer half the cupcakes to an unlined baking sheet, and broil, rotating the sheet as needed, until the marshmallows are toasted and golden. Repeat with the remaining cupcakes. This can be done up to 2 hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 37199,&quot;No Work Salmon Chowder 15 ounce can salmon, drained and patted dry 10 ounce package frozen corn, thawed 2 cans (14 1/2-ounce each) stewed tomatoes, chopped 2 bottles (8 ounces each) clam juice Whole peeled garlic clove, smashed 1/2 cup long grain rice Salt and Tabasco sauce Instructions: Combine all of the ingredients and simmer, about 20 minutes, covered until rice is tender.

If you make this with fresh crusty bread or the bread has staled a bit but not hardened, the juice from the tomatoes should be enough to tenderize the bread&#39;s crusty edges. Preheat grill to medium-high and oven to 425 degrees F. Using a damp towel, brush mushroom caps to clean. Using a pastry brush, coat the caps with extra-virgin olive oil and grill with lid down or roast about 5 to 6 minutes, turning once, until tender but still firm at center. Wring the spinach out in a clean kitchen towel. Separate the spinach with your fingers and combine with artichokes, ricotta cheese, egg yolk, grated garlic, salt and pepper, to taste, and nutmeg. Remove mushroom caps from grill. To portion-control the filling, divided the stuffing into 4 parts then just split each of those evenly between 2 caps. Sprinkle the caps with Parmigiano and cook 5 to 6 minutes more in the preheated oven to set filling and lightly brown tops. Do not seed tomatoes. Chop and place in a salad bowl.

Note that the artichokes should be snug to prevent from tipping over while cooking. Use scissors to trim the sharp tips of the leaves. Use a serrated knife to cut off the top inch of each artichoke, then use the tip of a knife to cut out the hairy choke in the center of each. You may need a spoon to help scoop it out. Zest the lemons into a medium mixing bowl and set aside. Remove the ends of the lemon and cut in half across the equator. Push the stem of each artichoke into a lemon half to create a wider base for the artichokes once inside the pot. To the mixing bowl with the zest, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, parsley and some salt and pepper and stir to combine. Using a small spoon, pour the breadcrumb mixture into the core of one of the artichokes until it meets the top leaves. Next, sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture around the outside layers, making sure to fill in between all of the leaves. Gently tap the artichoke stem against the counter to ensure the breadcrumbs are settled into place. Repeat with the rest of the artichokes and the remaining breadcrumb mixture. Carefully place the stuffed artichokes (and lemon bases) into the stockpot. Pour the vegetable stock into the pot, making sure not to get the tops of the artichokes wet. The cooking liquid should not be high enough to touch the stuffing. Place the whole garlic cloves into the pot and turn the heat to medium high. Once the cooking liquid begins to simmer, place the lid on the pot and cook until the artichokes are tender and a leaf is easy to remove, 35 to 40 minutes. Using tongs, remove the artichokes from the pot. Discard the lemon bases, garlic cloves, and cooking liquid. Serve the artichokes immediately with marinara sauce for dipping, if desired. Place a saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Pour in the red wine and cook for 1 minute to reduce. Using your hands or a potato masher, crush the tomatoes and add to the saucepot, including any juices from the can. Stir to combine. Add the basil sprig. Bring the sauce to a simmer and reduce the heat to medium low. Cook until the sauce is thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 37222,&quot;Hickory Smoked Chicken Wings with Jerk Sauce and Lime 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons Jamaican yellow curry powder<br> 2 tablespoons Thai fish sauce<br> 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice<br> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon palm sugar 1 teaspoon dried Thai chilies, ground<br> 1 tablespoon cilantro, roughly chopped, plus more for garnish 1 tablespoon garlic powder<br> 1 tablespoon onion powder<br> 1 tablespoon ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon chopped lemongrass<br> 1 tablespoon coriander seeds<br> 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 4 pieces star anise<br> 2 cloves garlic, crushed<br> 2 kaffir lime leaves, chopped<br> 30 jumbo chicken wings<br> 1/2 cup lime juice 1/2 cup ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup cafe black pepper<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons Jamaican yellow curry powder<br> 1/2 tablespoon Thai fish sauce<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 gallon soy oil Lime halves, for serving Instructions: For the marinade: Whisk together the vinegar, curry powder, fish sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, palm sugar, Thai chilies, cilantro, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, salt, lemongrass, coriander, granulated sugar, star anise, garlic and kaffir lime leaves in a large container. Add the chicken wings and enough water to fully cover. Refrigerate overnight. Transfer the chicken wings to hotel pans in a single layer skin-side up, making sure to remove as many seeds or herbs from the marinade as possible. Refrigerate uncovered 1 to 3 hours so the chicken wings lightly dry and build a pellicle. Prepare a smoker with hickory wood and heat it to 225 degrees F. Transfer the wings to the smoker and smoke until just barely cooked on the inside, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Let cool. For the jerk sauce: Whisk together the lime juice, ground black pepper, cafe black pepper, curry powder, fish sauce and salt to taste in a small bowl.

Lay the lasagna sheets out on a cutting board and cut into long strips about 1 1/2 centimeters (3/4-inch) wide. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a small food processor or a mortar and pestle, combine the basil, tarragon, Pecorino, walnuts and garlic and blitz to finely chop. Add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper and continue to blitz until well combined but still a bit textured. Heat the butter in a saut pan over medium heat and add in the shallot. Season with salt and pepper and cook until tender and just slightly golden, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the porcini mushrooms from their liquid and reserve both. Gently squeeze the mushrooms to remove excess water and roughly chop. Add to the pan and continue to cook on medium heat until the mushrooms are lightly golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the white wine and cook for 2 minutes, or until most of the wine has been absorbed. Pour 1/2 cup of the porcini steeping liquid into the pan, being careful to leave any grit that may have settled at the bottom of the liquid behind and discard the rest. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by about half. Place a large pot of water over high heat, season well with salt and bring to a boil. Cook the pasta for 2 to 3 minutes, or just until al dente. Reserving approximately 1 cup of cooking liquid, transfer the pasta from the pot directly into the mushroom mixture and stir in the herby pesto. Add a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking liquid to bring everything together and turn the heat down to low and allow the pasta to keep warm while you make the crunchy topping. For the topping: Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add in the panko and cook, stirring constantly, until golden and crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer the panko to a small bowl and allow it to cool slightly before tossing in the Pecorino, lemon zest and herbs. Then season to taste with salt and pepper. Add a splash more of the pasta cooking liquid to the pasta if it seems a bit thick. Serve immediately sprinkled with the topping and additional Pecorino, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 37242,&quot;Buttered Pasta for Children 1 pound bowtie pasta 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Freshly grated nutmeg Freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil over high heat and salt it generously. Add the pasta and boil, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 12 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander, leaving 3 to 4 tablespoons pasta water in the bottom of the pot. Return pot to a low heat. Whisk the butter in bit by bit, letting each piece melt completely before adding the next, to make a creamy sauce. Toss the pasta in the sauce. Season with salt and pepper and nutmeg if desired. (Add a little warm water if the pasta looks shiny.) Transfer to warmed bowls and serve warm, with Parmesan sprinkled over each dish if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti]&quot; 37243,&quot;Ricotta Tart: Torta di Ricotta 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup (stick) unsalted butter 1 egg 4 tablespoons milk or water 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 1/2 cups flour 1 1/2 pounds ricotta 1/2 cup sugar 4 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 egg Salt Water Instructions: For the pasta frolla: Combine sugar, butter, egg, milk, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and mix well. Fold in the flour but do not over mix; make sure that the mixture remains cool and does not become pasty. Shape into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes, or until firm. For the Ricotta Filling: Place the ricotta in a large bowl stir in the sugar, then the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla being careful not to over mix. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut off 1/2 of the pasta frolla and reserve. Roll 1/2 of the dough into a 14-inch disc and line a 9-inch cake pan with it. Allow the dough to hang over the edge of the pan. Roll out the reserved dough into a 10-inch circle. Reserve. Pour the ricotta filling into the crust base. Lay the reserved 10-inch circle of dough on the top of the filling. Trim the excess so there is a 1/2 to 3/4-inch overhang. Take the flap of dough left on the edge of the ring and roll it on itself so that it rests completely within the pan. In a small bowl, beat together the egg with a pinch of salt and a few drops of water to make an egg wash. Brush the surface of the torta with the beaten egg mixture. Place the torta in the lower third of the oven and bake for about 45 minutes until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan. Serve warm, or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37244,&quot;Latke Corned Beef Sandwich with Apple and Sour Cream Slaw 3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled 1/3 cup matzo meal 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 2 eggs 1/2 red onion, minced (about 1/2 cup) 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed 1 pound lean corned beef, thinly sliced Apple and Sour Cream Slaw, recipe follows 1/4 cup sour cream 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon yellow mustard 1/2 tablespoon honey 1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/8 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 4 Granny Smith apples, coarsely grated on box grater 1 shallot, grated(1/4 cup) Instructions: Grate the potatoes on a box grater, using a large grate, into a large bowl.

Cover, and bring to a strong boil, which may take nearly 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, and continue boiling gently, still covered, for about 5 minutes. Set aside, covered, for 30 to 45 minutes, until the lobsters in the pot are cool enough to handle. Retain the broth for use in the sauce. Break off the tails and claws from each of the lobsters, and crack the shells, taking care to retain any liquid released and add it to the broth. Remove all the meat, split the tail in half lengthwise, and remove and discard the intestinal tract. Cut each half tail into 3 or 4 pieces, and halve the claw meat. Arrange all the meat in a gratin dish lined with plastic wrap. Set aside. The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and refrigerated. Reserve the shells for the sauce. For the Americaine sauce: Heat the olive oil in a very large saucepan. Cut the lobster bodies open, and remove and reserve any liquid tomalley or row in a bowl. Cut each body into 4 or 5 pieces and add to the pan along with the shells from the tails and claws. Saute over high heat for 10 to 12 minutes, until the shells begin to brown and become crusty, and most of the moisture has evaporated. Add 2 tablespoons cognac to the pan and carefully light it to flambe the shells. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook with the shells for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato, thyme, tarragon, bay leaves, tomato paste, wine, and reserved lobster broth. Bring to a boil and boil gently for 40 to 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Strain the mixture through a colander set over a bowl, and shake the colander to get out as much juice as possible. Strain the juice again through a very fine strainer. Pour the liquid into a saucepan and reduce it to about 3 cups. Mix the potato starch (or arrowroot or cornstarch) with the water and stir it into the boiling reduced liquid. Return it to a boil and stir in 1/2 cup heavy cream, remaining 2 teaspoons cognac, and salt and pepper to taste. The sauce is now ready. Break cold butter into pieces and distribute them on top of the sauce. When the butter has melted, spread it lightly over the surface of the sauce with the tines of a fork. This will prevent the sauce from forming a skin or discoloring. The butter will be stirred into the sauce at serving time. Prepare the lobster: When you are ready to complete the recipe, melt 4 tablespoons butter. Unwrap the plastic wrap from the reserved lobster and pour the butter gently over the meat. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle on the tarragon. Bring the plastic wrap back over the lobster meat so the meat is held tightly together and can soak up the butter. For the souffle: Make the bechamel sauce by melting 3 tablespoons butter in a saucepan and cooking until it is light brown in color to give some intensity to the sauce. Add the flour and mix well. Stir in the milk and season with salt and pepper. Mix well with a whisk, bring to a boil, and boil for about 30 seconds. Continue whisking while adding 4 egg yolks to the hot bechamel and stir well to incorporate. (Reserve the remaining 2 egg yolks for another recipe.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly butter a 6 or 7-cup gratin dish and sprinkle with 2 to 3 tablespoon of the grated Parmesan, tilting the dish so the cheese sticks to the butter and coats the bottom and sides. Tap out and reserve any excess cheese for use on top of the souffle. Beat the 6 egg whites until firm but not dry. Add about 1/3 of the egg whites to the bechamel and mix with a whisk to incorporate. Add the remaining whites and the Gruyere and fold in with a rubber spatula. It is important to work quickly so the beaten egg white gets incorporated into the mixture without getting grainy. Pour into the prepared dish and sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan. Place in the center of the oven and bake for about 35 minutes, or until golden, crusty, and brown. While the souffle bakes, place the lobster meat into a 170 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or just until warmed through, leaving it in the plastic wrap. The lobster should be warm but not hot. If heated too fast or at too high a temperature, it toughens. Just before serving, heat 6 soup plates in the oven. Divide the lobster meat among the warm soup plates, bring the sauce to a boil, and spoon it over the lobster meat in each plate. Spread the meat to create a little space in the center of each plate. Spoon about 1 cup of the souffle, along with some of the crust, into the middle of each plate. Garnish with truffle slices, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 37259,&quot;Maple Hot Toddy 1.5 oz Crown Royal?

Using clean hands, add the butter and toss until just coated. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is in clumps the size of quarters, about 2 minutes. The butter clumps should go from small chunks to larger chunks. Add the shortening, toss until just coated in flour, then rub it into the flour mixture until the mixture forms pea-size pieces (some big chunks should remain) and comes together in fist-sized clumps when squeezed, about 1 minute. Drizzle in half the ice water and rake through the mixture with your fingers until just moistened. Drizzle in the remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time and comb through the mixture with our fingers to moisten. The mixture will eventually come together; the dough is moist enough when it is moistened through but is not wet when pressed. (Do not overwork the dough or it will become tough.) While rotating the bowl with one hand, use the palm of your other hand to push the dough along the side of the bowl to gather it into a ball. Turn the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, press it into a flat disk and close in the wrap. Place in the coldest part of the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the dough and form a crust. Press it into a 9- or 10-inch pie pan and bake until golden brown, 10 minutes. Remove and let cool. For the peanut butter crumble: Mix the peanut butter and confectioners&#39; sugar with a spoon or stand mixer over low speed until it is a crumble consistency. Set aside. For the whipped cream: Add the confectioners&#39; sugar to the cream and whip at high speed with a stand mixer until fluffy. For the pudding: Whisk together the milk, granulated sugar and 2 eggs in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Mix the 3 egg yolks with the vanilla, salt and cornstarch in a small bowl. Slowly stir the egg yolk mixture into the milk mixture until it firms up. Stir in the butter until combined. Remove from the heat and set aside. If everything else is done, place the mixture in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool. To assemble the pie: Layer about one-third of the peanut butter crumble in the bottom of the pie crust, followed by half of the cooled pudding, and half of the whipped cream. Repeat this process again and top with the crumble. Keep the pie in the refrigerator until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37264,&quot;Fresh Raspberry and Blueberry Tarts 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 8 ounces cold butter, diced into cubes 1/4 cup cold water 1 cup fresh raspberries 1 cup fresh blueberries 1/2 cup sugar 1 lemon, zested 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar Pinch salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 4 tablespoons cold butter, diced 1/2 cup creme fraiche 2 tablespoons lavender honey Instructions: To make Tart Dough: In a food processor bowl, add all ingredients.

Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in another bowl, mix together the flour, cumin, curry powder, salt and turmeric. Make a small well in the center of the dry ingredients and gradually pour in the wet ingredients. Stir until a firm dough is formed, adding an additional tablespoon or so of warm water if the dough is too dry. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, then transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Let the dough rise for an hour in a warm place. Meanwhile, for the filling: Coat the bottom of a medium pot with the vegetable oil and set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent and aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute 1 minute more. Add the curry powder, cumin, allspice, turmeric and bay leaf and cook for another 30 seconds to toast the spices. Add the chickpeas and stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid has thickened and the chickpeas are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt. For the slaw: Combine the cilantro, carrot, green mango, cucumber and black pepper in a large bowl. Toss with the lime juice and season with salt. Set aside until ready to serve. Once the dough has risen, pinch it into six pieces and roll the pieces into golfball-size balls (roughly 1 3/4-inch). Transfer to a greased baking sheet and cover with a damp towel. Leave to rest for 15 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into a 1/8-inch-thick oblong disc. Fill a deep frying pan with 1 to 2 inches of vegetable oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. In batches, shallow-fry the discs of dough until golden but still pliant, 30 to 45 seconds per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and season.

You may need a little more warm water to make moist, smooth dough. Traditional sopes forming method: Make balls the size of a walnut, a few at a time, and keep the dough in a plastic bag to prevent it from drying out. Moisten a cloth napkin or tea towel and spread out on a flat surface. Roll each ball of dough in moistened palm of you hand until smooth, lay on the damp towel, cover with a plastic bag, and press down with your hand to flatten to the size of a silver dollar. To shape the patty, flatten again with a small can or flat-bottomed glass into a perfectly smooth circle 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter. It should be about 1/4-inch thick. Peel the plastic bag off the top, then lay the tortilla in your hand and peel off the damp cloth. Smooth any rough edges with your fingers and the tortilla is ready to fry. Quick sopes forming method: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick. Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out sopes. Re-roll unused dough. Heat a cast iron skillet and add enough canola oil to coat the bottom of the pan. When hot, slide the patties into the hot oil and fry until they are a light golden brown and slightly crisp on top, about 1 minute on each side. Drain on paper towels and make a slit on the side as soon as they have cooled enough to handle. Fill with chorizo and potatoes filling. These do not keep well; they must be eaten immediately. Begin by cooking potatoes in a pot of water, when tender remove and set aside. In a large saute pan add a little oil. While shaking, add chorizo and cook for 4 minutes. When crispy, add garlic, onion, and all the peppers. Cook for 8 minutes. At that point, add the chicken stock and cook for 3 more minutes. Then add the potatoes, cilantro, and scallions; cook for 3 minutes more and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Cut into 8 cubes, each one approximately 1 1/4 inches square. Season well with salt and pepper. Place in a mixing bowl, and add the tawny port. Stir in the tarragon leaves, reserving a few for garnish. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 6 hours (try to marinate it as long as possible). When ready to cook, prepare a charcoal fire. While the fire is getting hot, prepare the sauce. Remove the salmon cubes from the marinade and reserve cubes. Pour the marinade into a small saucepan. Add the shallot and beef stock. Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any foam that forms on the surface. Boil the liquid until it is reduced to a glaze. Reduce the heat to low, and begin whisking in the cold butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. (Make sure that the sauce doesn&#39;t \break. When all the butter is incorporated, you&#39;ll have a smooth, medium-thick, tan-colored sauce.) Strain it into a clean saucepan and keep warm over very low heat, stirring occasionally. When the sauce is almost ready, grill the reserved salmon cubes: First dry them very well, then toss them with the vegetable oil to prevent sticking. Place them on the grill and cook, turning them with tongs, until charred on the outside, still rosy-pink on the inside, about 5 minutes. (Alternatively, you could place the oiled cubes under a preheated broiler, turning, until just done.) Place each salmon cube on a small plate. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Drizzle each cube with a half teaspoon of the sauce (reserve the leftover sauce for another use). Sprinkle each cube with a few flecks of the reserved tarragon leaves, finely minced. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 37312,&quot;Fried Bagels Bagels, cut in half Olive oil Instructions: Squirt olive oil over bagel or brush bagel with olive oil.

Add the minced wild boar and mix with the vegetables. Add the nutmeg, salt, pepper, and 1 cup wine. Allow the wine to reduce. Then add the tomato paste and mix well with the meat. Add the remaining 1 cup wine. Let the sauce simmer on medium heat for about 20 minutes. Serve the sauce with pasta or with polenta. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 37327,&quot;Nutmeg Vanilla Sauce 2 cups milk 1/2 teaspoon freshly (preferred) ground nutmeg 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 6 egg yolks 2/3 cup sugar Instructions: Heat the milk, nutmeg, and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat, whisking occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat and let the flavors infuse for 10 minutes. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. In a thin stream, whisk the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Pour the egg-cream mixture back into the saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to 180 degrees F. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat and pour it though a fine-meshed strainer into a container in an ice bath to cool. Keep chilled and serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 37328,&quot;Mixed Green Salad with Sherry Vinaigrette 1/3 cup sherry vinegar 1 large clove garlic 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 (4.5-ounce) bag mixed baby greens, rinsed and spun dried 1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, halved 2 ounces feta cheese, coarsely crumbled Instructions: Blend the vinegar, garlic, oregano, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a blender until the garlic is finely chopped. With the blender running, slowly blend in the oil. Toss the baby greens, bell pepper, olives, and cheese with enough vinaigrette to coat.

This may not be done ahead of time since its flavor, freshness and presentation rely on lastminute preparation and assembly. Always work with an absolutely clean area and plastic gloves would be welcome at this time. Cut the salmon fillet by hand, using a very sharp knife, into an even dice 1/4-inch thick. Mix the fish in a bowl with the olive oil, ginger, chives, salt and pepper and let marinate for a few minutes. Mix the diced cucumber with the sesame oil in a bowl and season lightly with salt and pepper. Place a wreath of red leaf lettuce around a serving dish. Use a pastry ring to create a layered look for the final presentation of the tartar. Place the ring in the center of the plate and fill the lower portion of the ring with cucumber salad. Smooth the layer evenly and add a layer of salmon tartar on top of the cucumber. Top the salmon with some fresh herb leaves and serve immediately. Garnish with chopped chives and finely chopped zest of lemon and lime. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37330,&quot;Winter White Coq Au Vin One 4 to 5-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces Salt and freshly ground black pepper All-purpose flour, for dredging 1 stick butter EVOO, for drizzling 1 cup freshly peeled or defrosted drained pearl onions 3 to 4 cloves garlic, sliced 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves Baguette, warmed 2 ribs celery heart with leafy tops, finely chopped 1 baby fennel or 1/4 small bulb, thinly sliced 1 leek, thinly sliced 1 large fresh bay leaf One 750 milliliter-bottle dry white wine, such as white Burgundy 1 cup creme fraiche 2 to 3 cups chicken stock, if needed 1/4 cup Dijon mustard Instructions: Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in the flour. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken, working in batches, and then transfer to a plate. Add a drizzle of EVOO to the pot along with the remaining butter, onions, garlic, celery, fennel and leeks. Sprinkle the vegetables with some salt and pepper and cook until lightly browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in the bay leaf and wine, return the chicken to the pot and cook, partially covered, over a low, rolling simmer, 30 minutes. Stir in the creme fraiche, reduce to a simmer and continue to cook, 30 minutes longer. If the liquid gets too low, add the chicken stock.

Pour the chilled fruit and grated chocolate into the egg mixture ad spoon as much as possible into the pineapple shells. Cover each with clear plastic and place in the freezer to harden. The remaining cream mixture can be placed in a mold and frozen. Serve when thoroughly chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37332,&quot;Red and White Checkerboard Cookies 1 4-ounce bar white chocolate, chopped 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 large egg, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon finely grated blood orange zest 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons red gel food coloring 1 cup red or white sanding sugar Instructions: Put the white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until melted. Let cool slightly. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla, then mix in the melted white chocolate. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the flour in two batches until just combined. Remove half of the dough; beat the orange zest and food coloring into the remaining dough. Wrap the plain dough and red dough separately in plastic wrap, flatten each into a rectangle and chill until firm, at least 1 hour. Working on 2 separate sheets of floured parchment, roll out each piece of dough into a rough 5-by-10-inch rectangle (about 3/8 inch thick), then trim each piece to form a 4 1/2-by-9 1/2-inch rectangle. Using a sharp knife, cut each rectangle lengthwise into nine 1/2-inch-wide strips. (If the dough gets too soft, refrigerate until firm.)<br> Lay 3 alternating color strips together (white-red-white). Using a wet finger, moisten the sides and tops so the strips adhere without gaps, pressing to seal. Top with 3 strips in the opposite pattern (red-white-red). Top with 3 more strips, repeating the first pattern. Repeat to build another log, starting with a red-white-red pattern. Wrap the logs and chill for 2 hours. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350? F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment. Unwrap the dough. Lightly brush the logs with water, then firmly press the sides in the sanding sugar. Using a sharp knife, trim the ends of the logs, then slice into 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick cookies, about 24 per log. Arrange the cookies 1 1/2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake 2 of the pans (refrigerate the other), switching positions halfway through, until the cookies are just set but not browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the pans, then remove to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining baking sheet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37333,&quot;Muttachar (Spiced Eggs) 1 tablespoon oil 1 small onion, chopped 1 green cl, seeded and chopped 1 ripe tomato, sliced 1/2 green mango, sliced (optional) 1 pint (2 cups) each coconut milk and water 1/4 teaspoon each tumeric, paprika and ground coriander Salt 10 fresh curry leaves Handful chopped fresh coriander (cilantro) Juice of 1/2 lemon 4 eggs Instructions: In a heavy frying pan heat the oil and saute the onion until golden. Add the cl, tomato and mango and fry a little longer. Pour in the coconut milk and water and bring to a boil. Add the tumeric, paprika, ground coriander, and salt and simmer 5 to 10 minutes.

This cut should evenly divide the meat of each chop into 2 equal flaps, which remain attached to the bone. Spread each chop out in the shape of a butterfly. Place the chops between sheets of wax paper, and pound each flap with a mallet or the side or back of a heavy cleaver. Pound until each flap is an even 1/4-inch thick. Mix together the 1/4 cup rice-wine vinegar, soy sauce, sugar and a few drops of Japanese sesame oil. Place the pounded pork chops in a wide, shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Marinate in the refrigerator, turning occasionally, for 2 hours. When ready to cook, heat the peanut oil in a wok, deep-fryer, or deep, wide pot to 365 degrees. While the oil is heating, remove pork chops from the marinade and shake off liquid. Dredge chops in flour, making sure to cover all spots of the meat and bone. Then dip the chops in the beaten egg, and let the excess egg drip off. Finally, dip the chops in the panko crumbs, making sure to cover the entire meat and bone. When the oil is hot, add the pork chops (if your frying vessel is not large enough, you should do this in 2 batches). Deep-fry until chops are golden brown on the outside, just cooked through on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes altogether. Remove and drain on paper towels. While the pork chops are cooking, make the watercress salad: Toss together the watercress, tomato, scallion, bean sprouts, rice-wine vinegar and sesame oil. (Make sure the salad has a light taste of the sesame oil; if not, add a little more.) Season with salt. Place each chop on a large dinner plate and season with coarse salt. Strew each chop with the watercress salad and serve immediately. *panko crumbs are Japanese bread crumbs -- light, airy, remarkably crisp. They are available at Japanese groceries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 37335,&quot;Sweet Onion Mignonette 2 large sweet onions 2 cups red wine vinegar<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Peel the onions and slice them in half.

If using a charcoal grill, build the coals evenly along the bottom. Place a small saucepot on the grill. Add the strawberries, honey and lemon juice and bring to a simmer. Cook until the strawberries release their juices and begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Puree in a blender until smooth and chill until completely cool, about an hour. For the ice cream: To a 32-ounce freezer-safe mason jar with straight or tapered sides, add the cream, honey, sugar and salt. Pour in the chilled strawberry puree. Top with the lid and vigorously shake into a loose, drippy whipped cream, 3 to 5 minutes. (This will take less time if you use a mason jar that was in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes beforehand.) Make sure the lid is only loosely on, then freeze for 3 hours for soft serve, longer for scoopable ice cream.

Arrange all the tomatoes and cherries in a single layer, flesh-side up, on a large serving platter or individual plates. Sprinkle them with the sugar. \Herb\ the mozzarella: Use a pair of scissors to coarsely cut the tarragon, basil and parsley into pieces and toss in a medium bowl with the Parmesan, olive oil and a pinch of salt. The herbs should feel slightly dampened and sticky from the olive oil. If not, add more olive oil by the tablespoon as needed. Press both sides of the mozzarella slices into the herb mix to coat them, then intersperse the cheese pieces amongst the tomatoes on the serving platter or plates. Season the dish with salt and spoon all the dressing over the tomatoes and cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 37354,&quot;Paella 1 pound tomatoes 9 cups low-sodium chicken broth 3 cups short or medium-grain rice 20 threads saffron 2 sprigs rosemary, leaves stripped from sprigs 3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided 1 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on, chicken thighs and legs 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on, chicken thighs and legs<br> 1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and halved 1 cup chopped red bell pepper 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced Instructions: Spritz 4 to 5 pieces of newspaper with vegetable oil and put in the bottom of a charcoal chimney starter. Fill the chimney with half of the charcoal and light the newspaper.<br> When the charcoal is lightly covered with gray ash, carefully pour onto the bottom grate of a kettle grill and spread evenly. Top with the remaining unlit charcoal, spreading evenly so as not to suffocate the lit charcoal. Set the second grate in the kettle and cover until ready to cook. Meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and remove the seeds to a fine mesh strainer set over a small bowl to catch the juice. Grate the seeded halves on the large hole side of a box grater and discard the skins. Combine the reserved juice and grated tomato and set aside. Warm the chicken broth in a kettle or 4-quart saucepan over high heat until it reaches 200 degrees F. Remove the broth from the heat and cover to keep warm.<br> Combine the rice, saffron, rosemary, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and paprika in a small mixing bowl.<br> Heat the olive oil in the paella pan on the prepared grill. Season the chicken on all sides with the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt. Once the olive oil shimmers, add the chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides, approximately 5 to 6 minutes per side. Move the chicken to the outer edges of the pan. Add the green beans, red bell pepper, green bell pepper and garlic to the center of the pan and cook until they begin to soften and darken in color, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juice and cook until most of the liquid has dissipated and the tomatoes thicken and darken, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Add the rice mixture to the center of the pan and cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute.<br> Redistribute the chicken pieces on top of the rice. Add 4 cups of the warm chicken broth and stir to distribute the rice evenly in the pan, making sure that all rice is completely submerged in liquid. From this point forward do not stir the paella. After 8 to 9 minutes, when all of the liquid is absorbed and the rice appears dry, add an additional 4 cups of broth. Continue to cook without stirring, until the liquid is absorbed, about 8 to 9 minutes. The rice should be firm to the bite and the grains have a tiny white dot in the center. Add the remaining cup of broth as needed, until the rice is cooked through. Watch the fire to make sure it is heating evenly and adjust the pan to prevent uneven cooking.<br> Remove the pan from the heat, cover with a tea towel and rest for 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Tempranillo, Pinot Noir]&quot; 37355,&quot;Harvest Focaccia 1 3/4 cups lukewarm water 2 1/4-ounce packets active dry yeast (1 1/2 tablespoons) 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon turbinado sugar 1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/4 cups bread flour 1 stick cold unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces 2 cups (about 1 pound) seedless red grapes 2/3 cup raisins 1 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, cracked with a heavy pan 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper Instructions: Put 1 3/4 cups lukewarm water (105 degrees F to 110 degrees F), the yeast, 1/2 cup olive oil and 1 tablespoon each turbinado sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Mix on medium speed until the yeast and sugar dissolve, then let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add both flours and mix on medium speed to make a smooth but sticky dough, about 4 minutes. Poke the butter pieces into the dough, spacing them evenly apart. (Do not mix.) Cover the dough with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Mix the dough with the dough hook on low speed just until there are streaks of butter throughout, about 1 minute. Put the grapes and raisins in a microwave-safe bowl, cover loosely and microwave until juicy, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then strain through a sieve, discarding the liquid. Brush a rimmed baking sheet with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Divide the dough in half and transfer one piece to the baking sheet, leaving the other in the bowl. Cover both pieces of dough loosely with parchment paper; set aside until plump and airy, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, put a pizza stone or inverted rimmed baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Spread the dough on the baking sheet so it fills the pan, dimpling it with your fingertips. Scatter half of the grape-raisin mixture evenly on top. Put the remaining piece of dough on top and stretch and pat it to cover the bottom piece of dough. (Don&#39;t worry if the dough tears.) Scatter the walnuts and the remaining grape-raisin mixture on top; dimple the dough all over with your fingertips, poking the topping into the dough. Cover loosely with parchment and set aside until the dough rises above the sides of the baking sheet by about 1/2 inch, 35 to 40 minutes. Mix the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the coriander, rosemary, the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and the pepper; sprinkle over the dough. Place the baking sheet on the hot stone and bake 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and bake until the focaccia is golden and springs back when pressed, 20 to 30 more minutes. Brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil; let cool in the pan 15 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool slightly or let cool completely and freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 37356,&quot;Greek Saganaki 8 (1/2-inch) slices Kasseri cheese Salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 cups brandy 1 cup flour 4 tablespoons butter 2 lemons, juiced 8 rounds of pita bread, brushed with olive oil, grilled and quartered 1 cup Kalamata olives Instructions: Season both sides of the cheese with salt and pepper.

Add the water to cover and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer, cover the pan, and continue simmering until the chicken is just tender, about 35 minutes. Strain, reserving the broth. Remove the stems from the dried chiles. Slit them open, and remove seeds and veins, reserving the seeds. Toast the chiles for about 50 seconds on each side; if you&#39;re using guajillos, toast them longer, until they are almost charred, about 2 minutes. Rinse the chiles in cold water, cover with hot water, and leave to soak for about 30 minutes. Put the reserved cl seeds into an ungreased frying pan and toast over fairly high heat, shaking them around from time to time so that they brown evenly. Then raise the heat and char until black. Cover with cold water and set aside to soak for about 5 minutes. Strain and put into a blender jar. Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the blender jar along with the water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram, and oregano. Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seeds until a deep golden color, a few seconds. Strain, putting the fat back into the pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as smooth as possible. Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the chiles and chocolate, 1 by 1, strain, and put into the blender jar, blending after each addition and adding water or broth, as necessary, to release the blades. Heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to cook the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put a few of the chiles and about 2 cups of the water in which they were soaking into the blender jar and blend until smooth. When you have blended all the chiles, add them to the fried ingredients together with the chocolate and cook for 5 minutes longer. Add about 4 cups of the chicken broth and continue cooking for 35 minutes. Skim the fat that forms on the top if you are going to make tamales or mole. It is added to color and flavor the masa.

Cut the meat into cubes around 5/8-inch thick and transfer to a large ovenproof casserole or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Combine the beef with the liquid, thyme, ginger, onion, garlic, bay leaf, and allspice berries, then adjust the seasonings with salt, and pepper. Bring the ingredients to a boil, skim the froth from the top of the liquid, cover with a lid, reduce the heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Peel the yams, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin. Cut the yam into pieces the size of large potato wedges. Cut the sweet potato and pumpkin into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Discard the pumpkin seeds. Bash the green onions with a heavy knife to release their flavor. Dice the chiles (wear gloves), and add with the vegetables to the pot along with the coconut milk and lima beans. Stir the ingredients, and simmer gently, covered, for another 25 to 35 minutes, or until the meat and vegetables are tender, and cooked through. Add the greens around 13 minutes before the cooking time is up. For the dumplings: Mix the flour and salt together in a mixing bowl, and then gradually stir in the water to form a dough. Pull off 24 small pieces from the dough 1 piece at a time, and roll them into rounds or long pointy-ended ovals. Cook&#39;s Note: If you want bigger dumplings, use a double-sized piece of dough, and roll it into a round, pressing a small indentation into the top of it with your thumb. Drop the dumplings into the hot pot immediately after rolling, around 8 minutes before the cooking time is up. Taste the dumpling, and add extra salt, and pepper, if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 37373,&quot;Leeks Veritablement a la Grecque 1 pound leeks uniform size (each not more 1 1/4 inches in diameter) 2 cups water 1/4 cup olive oil 3 sprigs fresh marjoram, or 1 teaspoon dried 1 cinnamon stick 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 3 sprigs fresh oregano, or 1/2 teaspoon dried Salt to taste 1 cup tomatoes, diced 1/3 cup kalamata olives, pitted and halved 1/4 to 1/2 pound feta cheese, crumbled Fresh marjoram and fresh oregano, minced, to taste Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the leeks. Trim off the root end, and cut each leek so it is approximately 6 inches long. (Discard the dark green part of the leek.) If the leeks are more than 1 1/4 inches in diameter, cut them lengthwise into halves or quarters. Wash the leeks by making thin, lengthwise slits and placing the leeks under running water. Arrange the leeks in a gratin pan. In a saucepan combine the water, olive oil, marjoram, cinnamon, vinegar, oregano, and salt to taste. Bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the liquid over the leeks to just cover. Arrange a piece of foil over the grain pan, and bake 35 minutes, or until leeks are tender. Transfer the leeks to a serving platter. Return the cooking liquid to the saucepan, and reduce to 1/2 cup. Strain it over the leeks. Chill, covered, for 2 hours or overnight. Just before serving, strew the leeks with the tomatoes, olives, cheese and fresh herbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 37374,&quot;Potato and Caramelized Onion Tart 1/2 box instant pie crust mix 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 large onions, thinly sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 russet potato, sliced thinly 4 ounces cream cheese, softened 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning 1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare the pie crust according to package instructions. Flatten into a disk and chill in the refrigerator while preparing the filling. In a large saute pan over medium heat, heat the canola oil. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are dark golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. In the meantime, using the slicing blade attachment of a food processor, or with a box grater, slice half the potato into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Place in cold water to avoid browning. (Reserve the remaining half of potato for another use, such as Round 2 Recipe Open Faced Roast Pork and Onion Sandwich.) In a small bowl, stir together the cream cheese, Italian seasoning, mustard and season with salt and pepper. Remove the pie crust from the fridge and roll into a 12-inch round about 1/4-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the cream cheese mixture in an even layer over the pie crust, making sure to leave a 1-inch border around the edge. Dry the potatoes thoroughly and place an even layer on top of the cream cheese, overlapping slightly to fit and keeping 1/2-inch from the edge of the cream cheese. Over the top of the potatoes place an even layer of caramelized onions. (Reserve 1/2 cup of the onions for another use, such as Round 2 Recipe Open Faced Roast Pork and Onion Sandwich.) Fold over the edges of the crust to create a 1-inch-wide border around the tart filling. Bake until the crust is golden and the potatoes are cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 37375,&quot;Red cl-Jicama Salad with Orange and Red Onion 3 oranges 1/2 cup Mellow Red cl Salsa Juice of 1 lime About 1 teaspoon salt 1 small (1-pound) jicama, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes 1 medium-size red onion, thinly sliced 1/2 small fresh pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch pieces (optional) 1 small head romaine, tough outer leaves removed, inner leaves sliced crosswise, 1/2-inch wide 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: With a zester or vegetable peeler, remove the zest (colored peel only) from half of an orange.

Cook, tossing occasionally, until tender and golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Push to one side of the griddle and Scrape the griddle clean. Combine the beef, Worcestershire and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl and mix with your hands to combine. Form into 2 oval patties about 1/2 inch thick each, slightly larger than the size of the slices of toast (they will shrink a little as they cook). Season both sides of the patties with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a couple cranks of black pepper. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter on the grill over medium to medium-high heat. Add the patties on one side of the griddle and press to flatten with a metal spatula. Cook, flipping once, until browned and almost cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Meanwhile, lay the Texas toast down on the other side of the griddle. Toast one side, 1 to 2 minutes, then remove to your cutting board. To assemble, spread the toasted side of 2 pieces of bread with half of the mayo mixture. Add a slice of Swiss cheese to each, then a burger patty. Top with the onion mixture and the American cheese.

Spray three 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and lightly coat them with coconut flour. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the coconut oil, coconut sugar, honey and eggs until creamy. (Don&#39;t worry if the mixture looks broken; the batter will become smooth as you add more ingredients.) In a large bowl, whisk together the coconut flour, oat flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, ground ginger and baking powder. Add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until evenly incorporated. On low speed, mix in the coconut milk until combined and then gradually add the remaining half of the dry ingredients. Turn the machine off and scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure all the ingredients are incorporated. Fold in the carrots and applesauce. Divide the batter among the prepared cake pans. Bake until the cakes begin to pull away from the sides of the pans and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Run a paring knife around the edge of the pans and then invert the cakes onto 2 racks. Let cool completely. (Do not move the cakes around too much; they are delicate.)

Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, cooking until it&#39;s soft and a little brown around the edges, about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the guava paste, tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, star anise, allspice, and curry powder. Simmer until the guava paste has melted, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and let the sauce cool slightly. Discard the star anise, transfer the mixture to your blender and puree. With the motor running add the lime juice and rum. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside, or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Whisk the olive oil, garlic, lime juice, salt and pepper together in a large bowl. Add the mangoes, peppers, red onions, chiles and cilantro and toss to coat. Add the beans and gently toss everything together. Heat your broiler to high. Line a large flameproof baking dish or rimmed flameproof baking sheet with a double layer of aluminum foil and grease the foil with some olive oil or nonstick cooking spray. Place the salmon in the prepared baking dish and tuck about 2 inches of the tail-end under the fish, so you have a somewhat uniform shape. Pour the barbecue sauce over the salmon and cook it under the broiler until the sauce caramelizes and chars around the edges and the salmon is firm and flakes easily, 8 to 12 minutes for rare (the salmon will still be pink in the middle) or 12 to 15 minutes for well done (the salmon will be cooked throughout). Spread the salsa on the serving platter and carefully lift the salmon out of the baking dish and arrange it on top of the salsa (use 2 large spatulas to transfer it). Squeeze a few lime wedges over the fish and serve with additional lime wedges on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37390,&quot;Spinach and Three Cheese Calzone 1 package rapid-rising dry yeast 3/4 cup warm water 1 tablespoon sugar 3 cups flour 1/4 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon salt Egg wash Cornmeal, for dusting 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 pound baby spinach, washed and dried Salt and pepper 15 ounces ricotta 1 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 cup shredded fontina 1 egg 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Instructions: For Dough: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook, bloom the yeast by combining it with warm water and sugar. Stir gently to dissolve, then let stand 5 minutes until foam appears. Turn mixer on low and slowly add the flour, 1 cup at a time. Pour in 1/4 cup olive oil and add salt. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and fold over itself a few times. Form dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil so it doesn&#39;t form a skin. Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it. If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen. When ready, knead the dough gently and divide in 4 balls. Sprinkle the rounds lightly with flour, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes. This will relax the dough, making it easier to stretch. In the meantime prepare filling. For Calzones: Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. If you don&#39;t have a stone, simply grease a baking pan. Roll or spread the dough discs into 10-inch circles, leave the dough slightly thick so that the filling will not ooze out. Spoon a quarter of the filling onto 1 side of the dough round and brush the outer edge with egg wash to help form a seal. Fold dough over to enclose the filling and form a large turnover. Roll up the edges with your fingers to close tightly and prevent leaking. Cut a few slashes in the top to allow steam to escape during baking and brush with egg wash. Repeat with remaining rounds. Sprinkle a pizza peel (or prepared baking pan) with cornmeal and carefully transfer the calzones. Bake directly on pizza stone for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown. Let the calzones rest 10 minutes before cutting to allow the cheese to set. Serve with basic tomato sauce if desired. For Filling: In a saute pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic and cook 2 minutes until lightly browned. Add the spinach, season, and continue to cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a colander and squeeze out the excess liquid. If necessary, drain the ricotta in a sieve to remove excess moisture also. Calzone filling should be fairly dry, because it may leak out or make the dough mushy.

Add the honey and brown sugar and whisk to thicken. Simmer for another 3 minutes, then remove from heat. Pour glaze into a small bowl and set aside. For the beer bacon bbq sauce: Heat a large pot on high heat, then add the butter and let it melt for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add the onions and garlic. Saute until translucent. Add the beer and bacon and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Add the apple cider vinegar and reduce by a quarter, then add ketchup, molasses, granulated sugar, brisket drippings, chili powder, Worcestershire, salt and pepper and cook on low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let cool for 10 minutes, then puree in a blender until smooth, and season with salt and pepper to taste. For the ribs: Whisk together the salt, pepper, cl powder and garlic powder in a small bowl. Drizzle a little canola oil over the ribs, front and back, then rub the oil in. Holding your hand high, season both sides of the ribs with rub. Be sure to get an even coating on both sides, along with the sides of the ribs. Soak 5 to 6 paper towels with canola oil, then open the smoker lid and place soaked paper towels in the smoker with 1 chunk hickory, 2 small chunks apple wood and a few handfuls charcoal. Light the paper towels. Let the coals burn down for 20 to 30 minutes. Add a couple more chunks hickory, apple and charcoal, then let smoker come up to 250 degrees F. Place a small pan of water on smoker rack, then place ribs in smoker. Let cook 30 to 40 minutes. Add another chunk of each wood and more charcoal; repeat this process every 30 to 45 minutes. At 2 hours into the cooking process, spritz ribs with apple cider vinegar, then spritz every 30 minutes until the third hour of cooking. At the third hour, wrap the ribs in foil and place back on the smoker. At the 4 1/2-hour mark, take the ribs out of foil and glaze with the honey bourbon. Let glaze set in for 20 to 30 minutes in the smoker meat-side up. Let ribs rest for 10 to 15 minutes, then slice. Drizzle ribs with Beer Bacon BBQ sauce and toss. Garnish the ribs with sliced scallions. For the Southwestern Green Chili Mac &#39;n&#39; Cheese: Meanwhile, heat four cups half-and-half to a gentle boil in a medium-large saucepot. Add the garlic, chipotle sauce, cumin, seafood seasoning and thyme, then add the American cheese, whisking until smooth and melted. Fold in the pasta and green chiles and heat through until lightly bubbly. Add the shredded jack, Cheddar and Gouda. If the pasta is too thick, add in another cup or two of half-and-half to smooth it out. Season to taste with salt and fresh ground pepper. Garnish with toasted buttered breadcrumbs and a sprinkle of Korean cl flakes. If you prefer baked mac &#39;n&#39; cheese, place pasta into a casserole dish, sprinkle a handful of extra Cheddar and jack cheeses on top and bake at 350 degrees F until browned and bubbly, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 37393,&quot;Homemade Sausage Patties 1 slice bacon, thinly sliced* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 small onion, finely chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons plain dried bread crumbs 2 teaspoons brown sugar 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces 72% lean ground pork 1 egg yolk 1 tablespoon water Instructions: In a small saute pan, cook the bacon over medium heat until rendered but not crispy, about 3 minutes.

Mix together the flour, olive oil and salt in a bowl using an electric mixer. With the speed on low, drizzle in the yeast/water mixture and mix until totally combined. Cover the bowl with a towel and set in a warm, draft-free place. Allow to rise for 1 to 2 hours. Pour the black beans into a saucepan. Add the taco seasoning and heat up the beans over medium-low heat. Use a potato masher to mash the beans to the desired texture. Continue cooking/heating over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beans are no longer runny (they should be the texture of refried beans). Set aside. In a small skillet, heat the canola oil over medium heat. When hot enough to fry, drop in the tortilla strips in batches, frying them quickly and removing them from the oil with a fork when crisp--30 to 45 seconds per batch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside. Position an oven rack in the bottom position in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Oil a baking sheet with some olive oil. Remove half of the pizza dough from the bowl. (Place the remaining half in a large plastic bag and refrigerate, saving it for another use.) With your hands, spread the dough out on the oiled baking sheet, making sure it&#39;s relatively thin. Spread a layer of refried beans all over the pizza crust. Sprinkle the grated Cheddar and Monterey Jack over the top. Place the baking sheet on the bottom rack in the oven and bake for about 25 minutes, watching to make sure the crust doesn&#39;t burn. Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle on the shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and cilantro leaves. Mix together the sour cream and hot sauce in a small bowl, adding enough hot sauce to make the mixture pourable. With a spoon (or you can put it in a pastry bag), drizzle the mixture over the finished pizza. Sprinkle with the tortilla strips.

Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and repeat with the remaining cakes. Loosely cover with foil to keep the cakes warm. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook the pancetta until browned and crispy, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. To assemble, fill a small saucepan with 3 inches of water, and add the lemon juice and salt. Bring the water to a simmer over medium heat. Crack an egg into a small heatproof bowl and use the bowl to slowly slide the egg into the water. Use a wooden spoon to carefully stir the water around the egg. Cook the egg until the white has set and the yolk is still soft, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Remove the egg from the water with a slotted spoon and drain it on a paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining eggs. To serve, place one stuffing cake on a plate. Top with 2 slices of pancetta, a poached egg and a generous drizzle of hollandaise sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 37414,&quot;Strawberry-Lychee Sorbet 1 20-ounce can lychees in syrup, drained, liquid reserved (about 1 1/2 cups) 2 pounds strawberries, hulled 1 cup sugar 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Put the lychee liquid in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.

Form a ring with the foil measuring about 7 inches in diameter. Fill a 6- to 7-quart slow cooker with 1/2 inch of water and place the foil ring in the bottom. For the crust: Add the gingersnaps to a food processor and process until crumbs form. Add 1/4 cup of the melted butter and a pinch of salt and pulse to combine. You want the mixture to look like wet sand. Brush an 8-inch springform pan with the remaining melted butter. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and halfway up the sides of the pan. For the filling: Wipe out the food processor, add the cream cheese and brown sugar and pulse until smooth. Scrape down the sides, add the pumpkin puree, sour cream, vanilla extract and pumpkin pie spice and pulse until thoroughly combined. Add the eggs, pulsing until smooth and uniform. Pour into the crust. Gently place the cheesecake on the foil ring in the slow cooker. Place a few layers of paper towels under the lid and cook on low heat for 4 hours. Allow the cake to cool in the slow cooker, about 2 hours. Remove the cheesecake, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Before serving, run a small knife around the edge of the cheesecake and remove the outer ring. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 37416,&quot;Deep Dish Plum and Almond Pie 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons anise seeds, optional 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced, at room temperature (1 1/4 sticks) 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups sliced almonds, with skin, plus 1/4 cup for top 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced and at room temperature 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 large egg 3/4 pound firm-ripe Italian, prune or Angeleno plums (about 10), pitted and halved or quartered Ice cream or whipped cream Instructions: Crust: If using the anise seeds, lightly toast them in skillet over medium heat until aromatic, 2 minutes. Grind in a spice mill or mortar and pestle until fine. Combine the butter and sugar in a food processor until creamy. Add the egg, anise seed if using, vanilla and salt and pulse to combine. (This may look rough and curdy, but don&#39;t worry, it all comes back together.) Add about half of the flour and pulse quickly 3 to 4 times to incorporate. Scrape down the edges of the processor and add the remaining flour. Pulse just enough to make a coarse, crumbly dough. Press dough into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch spring form pan to form a thin, even layer (see photo), using waxed paper to smooth. Freeze crust while you prepare the filling.; Filling: Pulse 1 1/4 cup almonds in a food processor until very finely ground (take care not to over process the nuts or they can get oily). Transfer nuts to a bowl. In the same processor, combine the butter and sugar until smooth. Add the cinnamon and continue to pulse until evenly combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and pulse in the egg. Add the reserved almonds and pulse until just blended. Arrange the plums cut side down, over the crust. Spread the filling on top and smooth with a small offset spatula. Sprinkle with the remaining almonds and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake pie until the filling puffs and is golden but still slightly soft in the center, 1 hour 15 minutes for a glass bottomed pan, or 1 hour 30 minutes for an aluminum pan. If the crust begins to over brown, cover the pie with foil during the last 15 minutes of cooking. When pie is done, turn off the oven and prop door open. Cool pie in the oven for 15 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets and set aside. Melt chocolate in a double boiler set over barely simmering water or in the microwave at 50 percent power. Allow to cool to room temperature. In a mixer, beat the butter and sugar until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each egg is added. Beat in the vanilla and the espresso. Gradually add the flour, beating well after each addition until just combined and scraping down the sides of the bowl, as necessary. Add baking soda and salt. Mix in the melted chocolate and then the nuts. Drop the batter by 2 tablespoons onto the greased cookie sheets, leaving 2 inches between each cookie. Bake until soft and lightly crisped around the edges, about 12 minutes, rotating pans halfway through cooking. Cool on wire racks. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 37422,&quot;Fresh Homemade Strawberry Jello 2 1/2 pounds strawberries (fresh or frozen) 1 cup, plus 2 tablespoons sugar 3 packets unflavored gelatin, such as Knox (for a vegetarian alternative try using agar-agar) 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: In a saucepan cook the strawberries and 1 cup sugar over medium-low heat. If you are using fresh strawberries you may need to add 2 tablespoons of water. Cook until the fruit is softened. Frozen and VERY ripe fruit will cook faster. Use a regular or immersion hand blender to puree the fruit. Strain the seeds and return to the pot. Using a chinoise strainer will make the job go much faster. In a small bowl, pour the 3 packets of gelatin over 1/2 cup of water, making sure no dry powder remains. Let the gelatin sit until it \blooms\ and absorbs all the water. Heat the strained puree to a simmer, turn off the heat and add the bloomed gelatin. Stir until the gelatin is melted and evenly distributed in the puree. Choose a mold that fits at least 5 cups. I used a silicone mold, such as the Lekue Imperial Monarch Mold. Fill the mold with 3/4 of the puree. Set the mold in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or until a skin is formed on the top. Pour half the remaining puree into a bowl. Whip the heavy cream with 2 tablespoons sugar and add it to the puree in the bowl. Gently fold the cream into the puree. Add the cream/puree mixture to the mold, refrigerate for about 15 minutes, or until it has set slightly. Add the remaining strawberry puree to the top. Set in the refrigerator for about 3 hours or until well set. To un-mold the jello: fill a large vessel with hot water. Dip the jello into the hot water, being careful not to get water over the lip of the mold. You may need to use a knife to carefully separate the edge of the mold from the jello. Let the mold sit in the water for 15 to 30 seconds. Set the jello on a platter. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Use a thin bladed knife dipped in hot water to cut the jello. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 37423,&quot;Justin&#39;s Favorite Pudding with Strawberry Sauce 4 egg yolks 2 tablespoons cornstarch 4 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup sugar 1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped 1 cup white chocolate chips 1 pound frozen strawberries, thawed 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 lemon, juiced Whipped cream, to garnish Fresh strawberries, to garnish Instructions: In a medium-sized bowl, beat together egg yolks and cornstarch. Set aside. In a large saucepan bring the cream, sugar and vanilla bean and seeds to a boil over medium-low heat. Add the white chocolate chips, then reduce the heat to low. Temper the egg yolks with a little of the cream mixture, then pour the egg yolks back into the cream. Simmer until the mixture thickens, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the pudding into 6 (6-ounce) ramekins. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours. Add the strawberries, sugar and lemon juice to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Strain the mixture with a fine mesh strainer into a bowl. Top the puddings with the coulis and garnish with whipped cream and fresh strawberries before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 37424,&quot;Individual Pecan Pies with Sweet Tea Caramel Sauce 2 tablespoons finely ground pecans 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Pinch salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small chunks 1 egg white, chilled 2 tablespoons ice water, only if needed 1 cup pecan halves 2 eggs 1/4 cup light brown sugar 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 stick unsalted butter, melted 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 cup dark corn syrup 1/4 teaspoon salt 6 earl grey tea bags 2 cups water 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 quart vanilla bean ice cream Instructions: In a food processor combine the ground pecans, flour, salt, and sugar. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the egg white and blend it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount of dough together, if it is crumbly, add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Lightly coat a 12-cup muffin tray with nonstick spray. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about a 2 foot square, then use a small bowl 3-inches in diameter or a large 3-inch ring mold as a guide to cut out circles. They should be slightly larger in diameter than the muffin tin hole, so when pressed in, the edges come half-way up the sides of the tin. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, mix the eggs until frothy then blend in sugars. Stir in the melted butter, vanilla, syrup and salt until well blended. Arrange the pecans on the bottoms of the tart shells. Pour in the filling to fill the shells almost to the top. Bake until the filling is set and slightly puffed, about 25 to 30 minutes. Test for doneness by sticking a thin knife in the center of the pie, if it comes out pretty clean, you&#39;re good to go. Transfer the pies to a rack and cool. While the pie is baking, make the Sweet Tea Caramel Sauce. Begin my making the tea. Bring 2 cups of cold water to a boil in a large heavy saucepan. Add the tea bags, cover and let steep for 20 minutes. Remove the tea bags (squeeze them out) and then return to a simmer until it has reduced by half - so you have 1 cup of really strong tea remaining. Add the 1/2 cup of sugar to the saucepan and continue to simmer over medium heat. Cook, swirling the pot around, until the mixture is a deep caramel color and looks like syrup, about 10 minutes. Carefully pour in the cream, be careful as it will bubble up, and continue to cook for 1 more minute. Serve with individual pecan pies and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 37425,&quot;Chocolate Carrot Cake Nonstick cooking spray 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon apple pie spice 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1 1/4 cups vegetable oil 4 large eggs 1/2 cup applesauce 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups finely grated carrots (about 4 medium carrots) 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 24 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 16 marshmallows 5 to 6 drops orange gel food coloring Instructions: Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two 9-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Coat the parchment with cooking spray and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, apple pie spice and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the granulated sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, applesauce and vanilla in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Fold in the carrots with a rubber spatula. Divide the batter between the prepared pans; bake until each cake pulls away slightly from the side of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then invert onto the rack to cool completely; remove the parchment. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Heat the heavy cream until almost simmering in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat, add the chocolate and butter and let sit, without stirring, 5 minutes; stir until smooth. Let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Place one cake layer on a platter. Spread the top with 1 cup frosting; refrigerate until the frosting is set, about 10 minutes. Top with the second cake layer and spread a thin layer of frosting on the top and side; refrigerate until set, about 10 minutes. Cover the cake with the remaining frosting. Make the web topping: Beat the marshmallows and food coloring in a large bowl with a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on low speed until the marshmallows break up, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until glossy and smooth. Using two forks, pull out about 1 tablespoon of marshmallow at a time, stretch into thin strands and drape over the top of the cake to create a web.

Let stand for 3 minutes. Combine the flours and salt in a large bowl. Pour the cool water and the yeast mixture over the flour, and mix with your fingers to form a shaggy mass. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes. It should be supple and resilient, but not too smooth at this point. Let the dough rest on the work surface for 20 minutes, covered with plastic wrap or a light towel. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes. Don&#39;t overknead it: The dough should be smooth, stretchy, and resilient. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it in the bowl to coat with oil, and cover it with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature ( 75 to 77 degrees F) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until nearly doubled in volume. Gently deflate the dough and fold it over itself in the bowl. Reshape it into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1 1/4 hours or until it has nearly doubled again. Gently deflate the dough again, reshape into a round, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour. Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface and divide it into 3 equal pieces (about 10 ounces each). Gently stretch one piece into a rectangle, leaving some large bubbles in the dough. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a log by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the baguette while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure. Set aside on the work surface to relax before elongating it, and repeat the shaping process with remaining pieces of dough. Now elongate each baguette, starting with the first one you shaped, by rolling it back and forth on the work surface. Begin with both hands over the center of the loaf and work them out to the ends until the loaf reaches the desired length. (Don&#39;t get carried away, or the baguettes won&#39;t fit in your oven!) Place the finished loaves on a peel or upside down baking sheet lined with parchment paper and generously sprinkled with cornmeal or on a baguette pan. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic or a floured cloth and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes until the loaves are slightly plump but still not doubled in volume. The final rise is short, because you want the baguettes to be slightly under proofed; this will give them a better oven spring, resulting in loaves with a light, airy crumb and more flared cuts. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat, and place an empty water pan directly under the stone. Use a very sharp razor blade or lame to make 3 to 5 slashes, depending on the length of your loaves, on the top of each baguette. The cuts should run from one end of the loaf to the other, rather than across it, and the blade should be held at a 30 degree angle to the loaf so that the cuts pop open in the oven. Be careful not to press down too hard, or you may deflate the loaves. Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves. Gently slide the loaves onto the preheated stone, or place the baguette mold in the oven. Pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and quickly close the oven door. After 1 minute, mist the loaves and oven walls 6 to 8 times and close the door. After 2 more minutes, spray the loaves and the oven walls again. Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer until the loaves are golden brown and crisp. Move them to a rack to cool. Enjoy your baguettes still slightly warm with some soft, ripe French cheese and a glass of wine. Note: If cake flour is not available, you can use the same amount of unbleached allpurpose flour, but cake flour will give the baguette a lighter texture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 37432,&quot;Eggnog Yogurt With Granola 3 cups rolled oats 1 cup pistachios 1/3 cup wheat germ 2 tablespoons sesame seeds 1/2 cup pure maple syrup 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom Kosher salt 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes 1/2 cup dried cranberries 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots 2 1/2 cups low-fat Greek yogurt 3/4 cup eggnog Freshly grated nutmeg Honey, for drizzling (optional) Instructions: Make the granola: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like crumbly sand. Add the cheese and pulse again until combined and cheese is worked into the mixture and cut into small chunks. Turn the mixture out into a bowl, drizzle in 6 tablespoons cold water, and mix in with a rubber spatula until the flour is moistened. Add another tablespoon of water, only if needed. Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a ball and flatten to a disc. Rest the dough to relax the gluten, 30 minutes. For the filling: Combine the Granny Smith apples, Braeburn apples, sugar, flour, light brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl and toss to combine. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Adjust the baking racks to the center of the oven. Roll out 1 disc of the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch round. Transfer to a 9-inch pie dish. Add the apples in an even layer and dot with the butter. Lightly brush the edges with egg wash. Roll out the next dough round, slightly smaller than the first. Cover the top of the apples with the second pie dough, pressing the edges to seal the crust. Trim the crust so you are left with a 1-inch overhang. Tuck the crust underneath itself so it&#39;s flush with the edge of the pie plate. Crimp the edges decoratively. Brush the pie with the egg wash and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Make 5 air slits in the center of the pie. Place the pie on baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for 45 minutes longer. Cool to room temperature, at least 3 hours, before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 37435,&quot;Turkey Burger 2 pounds ground turkey 2 ounces egg whites 2 ounces carrot, grated and blanched 2 ounces spinach, blanched 2 ounces ice Salt Pepper Instructions: Combine turkey and ice in a food processor until incorporated.

Beat the butter and both sugars in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs and vanilla mixing until fully incorporated. Slowly add the flour mixture, and continue beating just until the dough comes together, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Divide dough in half, pat into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Generously flour a clean work surface. (For a nice, even layer of flour, lightly sift flour over the work surface.) Gently roll chilled dough about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into desired shape using a cookie cutter, working quickly enough so dough remains chilled. If dough gets too soft, refrigerate on a lined baking sheet until firm again, about 30 minutes. Transfer cut cookies to un-greased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. Refrigerate the formed cookies for at least 30 minutes. Lightly dust off excess flour with a dry pastry brush. (Excess dough can be pressed into a disk, chilled and rerolled.) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bake the cookies, until the bottoms are golden, about 12 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37440,&quot;Apple Crisp 8 granny smith apples, peeled, cored, and sliced 3/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon cornstarch 3/4 cup flour 1 cup brown sugar 3/4 cup butter 1/2 cup walnuts Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the apples with the sugar, cinnamon, and cornstarch until well coated. Place in a 9 by 12-inch baking dish. Put the flour, brown sugar, and butter in a food processor, and pulse until crumbly. Add the nuts and pulse, to coarsely chop them. Place the topping onto the apples and bake for 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 37441,&quot;3-in-1 Sugar Cookies 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon finely grated orange zest Coarse sugar, aka sanding or crystallized sugar Royal Icing, recipe follows 5 tablespoons meringue powder (egg white powder) 6 tablespoons water 1 pound confectioners&#39; sugar (about 3 3/4 to 4 cups or 1 box) Food coloring, as desired Instructions: Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and both sugars in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 30 seconds. Add the egg yolks, vanilla and orange zest mixing until fully incorporated. Slowly add the flour mixture, and continue beating until the dough comes together, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. For rolled cookies: Roll about a tablespoon of dough by hand into a ball. Dip 1 side of the balls into some coarse sugar and place them sugar-side-up on an ungreased baking sheet, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. For sliced cookies: Divide dough in half, roll by hand into 2-inch-wide logs, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Cut the logs into 1/4-inch-thick cookies and place them on ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. For cutout cookies: Divide dough in half, pat into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Roll dough between lightly floured parchment, or waxed paper, until about 1/3-inch thick. Transfer sheets to a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Cut into desired shape using a cookie cutter, place them on ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. (Gather the dough scraps together, pat into a disk, chill and reroll.) Refrigerate cookies while preheating the oven to 375 degrees F, for at least 30 minutes. Bake the cookies, until the bottoms are golden, about 10 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month. Combine all the ingredients, except the food coloring, in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix slowly until stiff enough to form peaks. The icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is overbeaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting. Alternatively, combine ingredients in a large bowl, and beat with hand beaters on low speed until the frosting thickens to stiff peaks. Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. (Adding too much color reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days.) Store icing, covered, with plastic film on the surface of the icing.

When the fennel turns light brown, add the cinnamon, salt, chili powder, and red pepper flakes and toss. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put into a food processor with the small bowl attachment and blend until the spices are evenly ground. Makes about 1 cup. For the brine: Combine all the ingredients, except ice, in a stockpot, bring to a boil, and stir to dissolve the solids. Remove from the heat, add ice, and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Put the chickens in the brine, cover, and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours. Turn the chickens once half way through brining. Remove the chickens from the brine and pat them dry. Remove the backbones and split the chickens in half. Coat with 1/2 cup toasted spice rub on all sides, pressing into the skin. Put the chickens on a cookie sheet and put them into the refrigerator, uncovered, overnight to dry. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a 14 to 16-inch saute pan or roasting pan over medium-high heat and add the butter. When it is melted place the chicken halves in the pan, skin side down. Cook on the stove for approximately 5 minutes, basting with the pan juices. Put chickens into the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn the chickens over on a cookie sheet to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter. Put the roasting pan back on the stove, heat the pan juices to simmering, add the thyme and vinegar, and reduce by half. Spoon some of the vinaigrette over the arugula. Serve with tomato slices and Olive Oil Braised Potatoes. Spoon the rest of the sauce over the chicken and dig in. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 37443,&quot;Ham-Cheddar Biscuit Sandwiches All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 recipe Buttermilk Biscuit Dough, recipe follows 1/2 cup whole-grain mustard<br> 8 thin slices city ham<br> 4 cups shredded sharp white or yellow Cheddar<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 cups all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<br> 1 1/2 cups cold buttermilk<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

On a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick. Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness. When the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear. Using tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Slide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired. Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it&#39;s shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 37454,&quot;No-Churn Cereal Milk Ice Cream 3 cups heavy cream 1 1/2 cups sweetened cereal, such as Honey Bunches of Oats<br> One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br> Instructions: Chill a 9-by-5-inch metal loaf pan in the freezer for 20 minutes.

In a shallow dish, beat together with a wire whisk: eggs, half-and-half, vanilla, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon. In a second shallow dish combine flakes and nuts. Add 2 tablespoons butter to warm skillet. Place a cookie sheet lined with foil (for easy clean-up) near the stove. Coat 4 to 6 slices of bread in egg, depending on the size of your skillet, then coat bread in cornflakes and nuts. Cook slices 2 minutes on each side and transfer toast to cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining slices and transfer toast to oven. Bake 10 minutes, with already cooking bacon. While bacon and toast are in oven, combine fruit, sugar and liqueur in a serving bowl and reserve. Remove toast and bacon from oven. Warm syrup in a small pitcher in microwave 15 seconds on high. Serve toast and bacon on plates with optional garnish of mint and edible flowers. Pass syrup and topping at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 37476,&quot;Bacon-Wrapped Water Chestnuts Two 8-ounce cans whole water chestnuts, drained and rinsed 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 14 slices bacon, cut crosswise into thirds 1/3 cup ketchup 1/3 cup firmly-packed dark brown sugar1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce Nonstick cooking spray Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine the water chestnuts and soy sauce in a resealable plastic bag and let marinate at room temperature, tossing and massaging the bag occasionally, for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Wrap each water chestnut in a piece of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Set a cooling rack into a rimmed baking sheet and arrange the bacon-wrapped water chestnuts on top. Bake until the bacon renders its fat and is crisp, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and 1/3 cup water in a bowl to make a sauce. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully lift the cooling rack off the baking sheet. Drain away any fat in the baking sheet and wipe dry with paper towels. Line the baking sheet with foil and lightly spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray. Carefully transfer the bacon-wrapped water chestnuts to the bowl with the sauce, swirling to fully coat, then spread out on the baking sheet. Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake, tossing every few minutes, until the sauce is reduced to a sticky glaze, about 15 minutes. Immediately transfer the bacon-wrapped water chestnuts to a warm serving platter. Sprinkle with pepper and serve while hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37477,&quot;Cathead Biscuits 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 3 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3 tablespoons vegetable shortening<br> 5 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter, cubed 1 cup buttermilk<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
