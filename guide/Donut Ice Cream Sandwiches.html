salted caramel ice cream, softened<br> 1 cup rainbow sprinkles<br> Instructions: Place the chocolate in a glass bowl and melt it over a double boiler (or in the microwave) until completely smooth. Set aside. Slice the glazed donuts in half horizontally. Add a large scoop of the ice cream to the bottom half of each donut and use an offset spatula to spread the ice cream to the edges. Press on the top halves of the donuts and roll the sides in the sprinkles. Drizzle the sandwiches with the melted chocolate. Place the sandwiches on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until the ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. At this point, enjoy the sandwiches or wrap individually in plastic wrap and freeze until ready to eat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 23128,&quot;Blueberry Cobbler with Lemon Honey Ice Cream Unsalted butter, for buttering the baking dish 8 cups blueberries 1/3 cup sugar<br> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 lemon, juiced<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 2 tablespoons milk<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 2 eggs, lightly beaten<br> Lemon Honey Ice Cream, for serving, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups milk 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1/4 cup honey<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons lemon zest<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 5 egg yolks<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. For the blueberry filling: Add the blueberries, sugar, flour, cinnamon and lemon juice to the prepared baking dish; toss to combine. Set aside. For the cobbler topping: In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, melted butter, milk, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and eggs. Stir to combine, then dollop the batter over the blueberries to cover. Bake until the berries are bubbling and the topping is golden, about 45 minutes. Serve a la mode with the Lemon Honey Ice Cream. In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and heavy cream and slowly warm over low heat until small bubbles form around the edges. Add the honey and stir to mix. In a medium bowl, whisk to combine the sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice and egg yolks. Slowly add the egg yolk mixture to the milk and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and chill in the refrigerator until cold, about 1 hour. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream machine, process for about 30 minutes, and then freeze until frozen through, another 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 23129,&quot;Wonton Soup 6 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth 1 cup shredded cabbage 1/2 cup shredded or diced cooked pork 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon sesame oil 16 wonton wrappers 1/4 cup chopped scallions Instructions: Place broth and cabbage in a large saucepan and set pan over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine pork, soy sauce and sesame oil. Pulse 3 or 4 times until the pork is finely minced but not a paste. Arrange 16 wonton wrappers on a flat surface. Spoon filling onto the center of each wrapper, to within 1/4-inch of the edges (about 1 teaspoon per wrapper). Wet your fingers with water and pull up corners of the wontons to create individual \purses. Pinch the edges together (with wet fingers) to seal. Place stuffed wontons in simmering broth. Cook 5 minutes, until wontons are tender and translucent. Remove from heat and stir in scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 23130,&quot;Spicy Lamb and Soba Noodle Salad 1/4 cup, plus 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 tablespoon five-spice powder 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 1/2 pounds lamb tenderloin 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 2 teaspoons sugar 2 red jalapenos, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon honey Kosher salt 3/4 pound soba noodles 3 green onions, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro Instructions: Whisk together 1/4 cup of the oil, five-spice powder and garlic in a medium baking dish, add the lamb and turn to coat in the mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Whisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, jalapeno, honey and remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil in a large bowl and let sit while you prepare the noodles. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the soba noodles and cook until just tender, approximately 5 minutes. Drain well, place in the bowl with the dressing, add the green onions and cilantro and mix until combined. Let sit at room temperature while you cook the lamb. Can be made 8 hours in advance and refrigerated. Serve at room temperature or cold. Heat the grill to high. Remove the lamb from the marinade and season with salt. Place the tenderloins on the grill and cook until golden brown and slightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn over and continue grilling for 2 to 3 minutes for medium-rare doneness. Remove from the grill, let rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 1/4-inch thick slices. Transfer noodles to a large platter and top with the sliced lamb. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 23131,&quot;Chocolate Toffee Bites 2 cups sugar 1/2 cup butter 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped Instructions: Place the sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and caramelize on high heat stirring constantly. It will turn amber brown in about 5 minutes. When it is a uniform caramel color, add the butter, and stir it in. Once mostly combined, add the chocolate, and stir to blend. Pour it out onto a silpat or parchment lined sheet pan, and spread it with an offset spatula 1/8-inch thick. Let cool and break into small pieces. Store in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Port, Tawny Port]&quot; 23132,&quot;Slow-Cooker Buffalo Chicken Chili 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth One 15-ounce can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed<br> Two 4-ounce cans chopped green chiles<br> 1/2 cup Buffalo wing sauce<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 3 stalks celery, diced<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 1 rotisserie chicken, skin discarded, meat shredded<br> 1 jalapeno, seeds and membranes removed, minced<br> 1 medium yellow onion, diced<br> Instructions: For serving: steamed rice, celery leaves, crumbled blue cheese, shredded Cheddar, hot sauce, chopped fresh cilantro and cornbread In a slow cooker insert, combine the chicken broth, beans, chiles, wing sauce, salt, pepper, garlic, celery, bay leaf, shredded chicken, jalapeno and onion and mix. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours.<br> Serve over white rice with desired toppings: celery leaves, blue cheese, Cheddar, hot sauce, cilantro and cornbread. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 23133,&quot;Lemon Curry Corn Fritters 3 tablespoons mild yellow curry powder 1 lemon, zested 1 tablespoon sugar 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons water Pinch salt 1 (16-ounce) bag frozen whole corn kernels, thawed 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 shallot, diced 8 slices pancetta, diced 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 eggs 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 scallions, cut into 1/8-inch rounds Vegetable oil, for shallow frying Instructions: In a small bowl, mix all the ingredients for the curry paste together until smooth and set aside. Cook the whole corn kernels according to bag directions. Drain the water and set aside. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and heat over a medium-high heat. Add the corn, shallots and pancetta and saute for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pancetta should be lightly cooked, but not crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, reserved curry paste, soy sauce, eggs and salt and pepper. Stir in the corn mixture and the scallions. If the batter is a little dry, add a touch of water until you get a smooth consistency. In a large frying pan heat enough vegetable oil (about a 1/8-inch) for shallow frying, over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, (the oil is ready when you drop in a tiny bit of batter and it sizzles immediately) put a large tablespoon or so of the batter carefully into the oil and lightly press flat. Add about 4 more tablespoons, being sure to leave enough space in between each for easy turning. Fry until golden, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side. Remove the fritters with a slotted spatula to a paper towel lined plate. Pat dry with another paper towel and cover to keep them warm. Repeat until all of the batter is cooked. Arrange the fritters on a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23134,&quot;Cocoa Gingerbread Men 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process) 1 tablespoon ground ginger 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup molasses 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1 large egg 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh orange juice Instructions: Whisk the flour, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, the ginger, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, molasses and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until light in color, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and beat until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low; gradually add the flour mixture, beating until just combined. Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; shape into disks. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture. Alternatively, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor fitted with the metal blade until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade and bring the dough together by hand. Form the dough into a disk, wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. Roll the dough on a lightly-floured surface into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan and trim the edges, leaving about an extra inch hanging over the edge. Tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to form a thick edge that is even with the rim. Flute the edge as desired. Freeze the pie shell for 30 minutes. Arrange the racks in the center and lower third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Put a piece of parchment paper or foil over the pie shell and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on a baking sheet on the center rack until the dough is set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and lift the sides of the parchment to remove the beans. Continue baking until the pie shell is lightly golden brown, about 10 more minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. While the crust is baking make the filling: Combine the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and, stirring constantly, continue to boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts, bourbon and vanilla. Set it aside to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. (If the crust has cooled, return it to the oven for 5 minutes to warm through.) Whisk the beaten eggs into the filling until smooth. Put the pie shell on a baking sheet and pour the filling into the hot crust. Bake on the lower rack until the edges are set but the center is still slightly loose, 40 to 45 minutes. (If the edges get very dark, cover them with aluminum foil half way during baking.) Cool on a wire rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 23149,&quot;My My&#39;s Strawberry Layer Cake 1 (18.5 oz.) box white cake mix (without pudding) 1 (3 oz.) package strawberry Jell-O 1 Tbs. self-rising flour 4 tsp. granulated sugar 3/4 cup vegetable oil 4 eggs 1/2 cup water 1/2 of a 10-oz. package of frozen strawberries, thawed and well-drained (reserving all the juice and the remaining berries)<br> Reserved strawberries and juice, above 2 (1 lb.) boxes confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter Red food coloring (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Reserve. In a saute pan over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add pears and nuts and saute for approximately 5 minutes, or until pear begins to brown. Add Poire William, let it heat for 5 seconds, then ignite with a flame. Stand back! If flame does not burn out after 10 seconds, smother with a lid. Remove from heat and let cool. Place a small bowl of warm water beside wonton wrappers. Put a single won ton wrapper in the palm of your hand and spoon 1 teaspoon of pear mixture onto the center. Dip your finger in water and trace a circle around the pear mixture with your wet finger (water is the glue of wonton wrappers). Pinch and seal wrapper around pear mixture like a small beggar&#39;s purse. If you are not going to fry the wontons immediately, cover with a damp dishtowel and refrigerate. Pour peanut oil into a pot or heavy skillet until it is 1-inch deep. Turn heat to medium- high and heat oil. When you think oil is ready, drop in a tiny piece of a wonton skin. If oil sizzles immediately, you are ready to rock. If oil begins to smoke at any time, remove pan from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Fry as many wontons at 1 time as your skillet will accommodate\u2014without letting them touch. Fry or 30 seconds, or until the bottom side is golden brown. Then turn over for 15 more seconds, or until top side is the same color. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a large brown paper grocery bag, or paper towels, to drain excess oil. Proceed to next batch. Place powdered sugar in a small strainer and hold strainer over wontons. Tap strainer gently to dust won tons with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar.

Line a 12-by-17-inch baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray. Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, salt and eggs in a large bowl and mix until well combined; set aside. Melt the butter and chocolate in a double boiler, then whisk together until fully combined. Pour the chocolate mixture into the sugar mixture and mix until fully combined. Fold in the flour and cocoa. Pour the batter into the prepared baking sheet and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely. For the bombe: Using a 4-inch ring cutter, cut a round from the baking sheet of brownies. Slice the remaining brownies into approximately 3-by-4-inch rectangles. You should have 10 rectangles. Keep 5 rectangles as they are and cut the other 5 in half to make triangles. Line a 2 1/2-quart (about 9 inches across) freezer-safe bowl with plastic wrap. Place the brownie round in the bottom of the bowl and, alternating between the rectangles and triangles, fill the sides of the bowl. Press the brownie pieces into the bowl so that the interior of the bowl is lined with brownies. Break off any excess that extends above the edge of the bowl. Make sure to press the seams together so there are no cracks. Break the remaining brownie pieces into small crumbles and reserve. Wrap a 5-inch freezer-safe bowl in plastic wrap from the bottom, combining the loose ends of the plastic wrap at the top. Spread the softened ice cream inside the large bowl over the brownie layer. You should have about a 2-inch-thick layer of ice cream. Place the 5-inch bowl inside the ice cream layer, pushing it into the ice cream slightly to create a well. Cover the top with plastic wrap and freeze until the ice cream is firm, about 2 hours. In a large chilled bowl, combine the heavy cream, granulated sugar and cocoa. Whip the cream with a whisk or electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form. Remove the bombe from the freezer and remove the small bowl. Pour the hot fudge into the well, then fill with the whipped cream. Combine the reserved brownie crumbles and walnuts and sprinkle over the top of the bombe. Cover with plastic wrap and push down to press the brownie crumbles into the bombe. Freeze until the whipped cream is frozen, about 2 hours. Remove the bombe from the freezer and place the bowl side into a large bowl of hot water for 1 minute. Remove the plastic wrap. Invert the bombe onto a large platter or plate. Remove the glass bowl and plastic wrap. Garnish with a sprinkle of cocoa powder. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 23161,&quot;Profiteroles with Ricotta Mascarpone 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 1/2 teaspoons plus 3 tablespoons sugar Pinch of salt 1/2 cup all purpose flour 3 large eggs 1 (8-ounce) container mascarpone cheese 3/4 cup ricotta cheese 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella) 1/4 cup whipping cream 1/4 cup hazelnuts, toasted, husked, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Bring to a gentle boil, stirring to dissolve the salt, then turn off the heat and cover. Allow to cool completely, then place in the fridge to chill. Brine the turkey: Remove the turkey from its packaging and remove the bags inside that hold the neck and giblets. Rinse the neck and giblets and put them in a plastic bag in the fridge; you&#39;ll need them for the gravy. Rinse the turkey thoroughly with cold water. Place the turkey in a large brining bag or pot. Pour in the maple-whiskey brine and refrigerate 16 to 18 hours so the brine can work its magic. Roast the turkey: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. After the turkey has brined, remove it from the brining bag and rinse it thoroughly again, inside and out. Pat dry. Truss the turkey or tuck the legs and wings, whichever you like. Place breast-side up on a rack in a large shallow roasting pan. Cover the pan with heavy-duty foil so that it&#39;s well sealed. Roast 7 to 8 minutes per pound (about 1 hour 50 minutes for a 15-pound turkey and about 2 1/2 hours for a 20-pound turkey). Remove the turkey from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Remove the foil. (Put stuffing in the bird if you wish at this point.) Brush the butter all over the skin of the turkey, getting in the crevices. Insert a probe thermometer into the thigh, near the hip joint. Place the turkey, uncovered, back in the oven. Continue roasting, basting or brushing with the juices in the pan every 30 minutes, until the thermometer registers 165 degrees F and the juices are no longer pink. This will take about another 10 minutes per pound (about 2 1/2 hours for a 15-pound turkey and 3 to 3 1/2 hours for a 20-pound turkey). Remove the turkey from the oven and cover lightly with foil until you are ready to carve. Pour the pan drippings into a fat separator and set aside for gravy. Maple-Whiskey Gravy Place the giblets and neck in a small saucepan of water over medium heat and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to medium low and simmer 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the giblets are cooked. Remove the giblets, set aside and keep the water in the saucepan. In the turkey roasting pan (which should not have been cleaned!), add the turkey fat. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk into the fat to form a paste. If the paste is too thick or clumpy, add a little more fat. If it&#39;s too greasy, sprinkle in more flour. Whisk and cook the roux over medium-low heat until it is deep golden brown. Pour in the chicken broth, whiskey and maple syrup, whisking the whole time. Allow the gravy to cook and thicken for several minutes, whisking occasionally. If it gets too thick or if it&#39;s too salty, thin it with a little giblet water. If the gravy is too thin, keep cooking it until it thickens up. Taste, then add salt and plenty of pepper. Chop the giblets and add them in, if you like. Remove as much of the neck meat as you can and add it to the gravy. Serve immediately! &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 23176,&quot;One Day Citrus Cured Salmon 2 pounds salmon (skin on) Zest of one lemon, lime and orange 3 tablespoons citrus-flavored liqueur 1 teaspoon orange extract 2 cups brown sugar 2 cups kosher salt 1/4 cup coarsely ground black peppercorns Instructions: Place salmon on a sheet pan covered with plastic (skin side down).

Simmer uncovered for 50 to 60 minutes, until the rice is very tender. Drain well and place the rice back in the pot. Cover and allow to steam for 10 minutes. While the rice is still warm, place it in a mixing bowl. Peel the oranges with a sharp knife, removing all the white pith. Cut between the membranes and add the orange sections to the bowl with the rice. Add the olive oil, orange juice, raspberry vinegar, grapes, pecans, cranberries, scallions, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and the pepper. Allow to sit for 30 minutes for the flavors to blend. Taste for seasonings and serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 23179,&quot;Chocolate Hazelnut Spread with Crepes 4 ounces peeled toasted hazelnuts 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 1 tablespoon cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 12 ounces milk chocolate, chopped and melted 2 eggs 1/2 cup whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Unsalted butter 2 bananas, sliced Confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: In a food processor, grind the hazelnuts into a paste. Add the oil, sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla and continue processing. Add the melted chocolate and blend well. Strain the mixture through a fine strainer to remove any large grains of nuts. The mixture will be thin and a little warm. Pour into a jar to let cool and thicken slightly. Keeps 1 month, covered, at room temperature. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Whisk in the salt, granulated sugar, and flour. Set aside for 30 minutes, if you have got the time. In a nonstick 8 to 10-inch omelet pan, melt about 1/2 teaspoon butter over medium heat. When it foams, pour or ladle in about 1/8 cup (2 tablespoons) batter. Lift and swirl the pan so the batter coats the bottom. Replace the pan on the burner and cook just until set and the underside is lightly browned. Using a spatula or your fingers, flip the crepe, and cook until the other side is lightly browned. Transfer to a platter. Repeat until the batter is used up. One by one, spread each crepe with a thin layer of the chocolate hazelnut spread, then some banana slices, and roll up like a cigar or fold into quarters. Place 2 crepes on each of 4 serving plates. Sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve. Notes about the recipe: While in Italy we discovered Nutella, a chocolate hazelnut spread that comes in a jar like peanut butter. We can&#39;t get enough of it but also have trouble finding it. So I figured out how to make my own! This recipe makes more hazelnut spread than you need but it keeps and is great to spread on toast, inside croissants or on brioche. I&#39;ve even caught family members just spreading it on a banana as they peel it down, one schmear per bite. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 23180,&quot;Supreme Hoagie 1 Sandwich roll, sliced lengthwise ?

Grill or broil the corn until it is dark brown on all sides. Cut the kernels off the cob and reserve. Once the kernels have been removed from the cob, run your knife along the cob to get any residual pieces of the kernels. Reserve. Coat a large wide pot, over medium-high heat, with olive oil. Toss in the garlic and crushed red pepper. When the garlic becomes golden and is very aromatic, remove it from the pan and discard. Toss in the cherry tomatoes and roll them around in the oil. Add 1 cup of stock and season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium and let the tomatoes cook until they start to burst and give off their juices. This will take about 8 to 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the corn kernels to the pot with the tomatoes. Stir to combine and add 1/2 cup of stock if the liquid level is very low. Drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or longer if using dried pasta. Toss the shrimp into the pot with the tomatoes and stir to combine. Drain the pasta from the cooking water, reserving 1/2 cup water, and toss immediately into the pot with the tomato mixture. Add in 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, if needed.

Starting at the thin, narrow end of the steak, slice it in half horizontally to within 2 inches of the opposite wide end. Open it up like a book so you have one long piece. Pound the steak with a mallet to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Whisk together the oil, vinegar, honey, red pepper, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Combine the marinade with the meat in a large resealable plastic bag and flip over several times to make sure the meat is well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours, flipping several times. For the herb paste and sauce: Combine the basil, parsley, red pepper, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. With the motor running, slowly pour in 1/4 cup of the oil. Remove 2 tablespoons of the herb paste from the processor and mix with the remaining 1/4 cup oil in a small bowl; reserve this sauce for finishing. Prepare an outdoor grill for direct and indirect grilling. (If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling.) Remove the steak from the marinade and pat dry. Spread it flat on a work surface. Cover the steak with the remaining herb paste, leaving a 1-inch border along the edges. Layer with the ham, mozzarella and salami, then sprinkle with the mushrooms and roasted peppers. Arrange the hot peppers in a line along the edge of one of the short ends (when you roll up the steak they will be in the middle). Roll up the steak like a jelly roll, starting at the short end with the hot peppers. Tie the roll closed around the circumference with butcher&#39;s twine at 2-inch intervals. Tie one more piece of twine lengthwise around the meat. Put the steak on the direct heat side of the grill and cook, turning, to brown all 4 sides, about 2 minutes per side. Move the steak to the indirect heat side of the grill, cover and cook, turning occasionally, until the very center reads 115 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer for a steak that is well done on the outside and medium rare in the center, 25 to 30 minutes more. (Test frequently; the time will vary based on the temperature of your grill.) Let the steak rest 5 to 6 minutes. Untie the steak and cut it into 6 thick slices.

Meanwhile, make the filling: In a large bowl, combine the peaches, blueberries, bourbon, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla. Mix well to coat the peaches and blueberries evenly. Set aside. Make the topping: In a second large bowl, combine the flour, oats, sugar and salt. Add the cold butter cubes and cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender, 2 knives or your hands. Mix until the texture is coarse and clumps in your palm when you squeeze a handful. Add the heavy cream and mix just until the dough comes together a bit more. Pour the filling into a 12-inch cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven with a fitted lid and spread it out evenly. Spoon the topping mixture evenly over the filling, then cover with the lid. Place the skillet adjacent to the hot coals in a place where it will get a good amount of radiant heat so the topping cooks through evenly without burning. Use a metal shovel to pile hot coals on top of the lid (this will distribute heat from the top). Cook 45 to 50 minutes, rotating the skillet 90 degrees every 10 minutes so the cobbler cooks evenly. (Feed the fire with more wood as needed.) Change out the hot coals on top 2 or 3 times during cooking so the top stays hot throughout. When the cobbler is done, the fruit will be bubbling around the edges and the topping will be light and fluffy. Serve the cobbler straight from the pan with vanilla yogurt on the side. You can also bake the cobbler, uncovered, in a 375 degrees F oven, 30 to 35 minutes.

Add the shortening and pulse a few times until combined. Add the butter and pulse just until coarse crumbs form. Add the vinegar and 3 tablespoons ice water; pulse until the dough comes together but is slightly crumbly. Pinch the dough \u2014 if it\u2019s too crumbly, pulse in more ice water 1 teaspoon at a time. Turn out the dough onto a large sheet of plastic wrap. Wrap the dough, then flatten into a disk. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 13-inch round. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself, then crimp the edges. Refrigerate the crust until firm, at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375? F. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork, line with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Place the crust on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until golden brown around the edges, about 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and continue baking until the crust is a deep golden brown on the bottom, 20 to 30 more minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool while preparing the filling but leave the oven on. Make the filling: Whisk the egg yolks in a medium bowl until smooth; set aside. Whisk the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan to combine. Whisk in the water and lemon juice and turn the heat to medium. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, whisking, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Slowly whisk about one-quarter of the sugar mixture into the egg yolks. Whisk in another one-quarter of the sugar mixture until smooth, then pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Continue cooking, whisking constantly to keep the egg yolks from scrambling, about 1 more minute. Stir in the butter and lemon zest until the butter melts; remove from the heat. Immediately make the meringue while the filling is still hot: Combine the egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Very slowly beat in the sugar; continue beating until firm glossy peaks form, about 4 minutes more (do not overbeat). Give the lemon filling a quick stir, then pour into the crust. Immediately spread the meringue on top of the hot filling, spreading it all the way to the crust; use the back of a spoon to make swoops and peaks. Bake until the meringue is golden brown in spots, 5 to 7 minutes; do not overbake to avoid weeping. Remove the pie to a rack and let cool 1 hour, then refrigerate until completely cooled before slicing, about 4 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 23239,&quot;Lemon Meringue Beehives 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 cup flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup creme fraiche 1 egg yolk 3 eggs 3/4 cup sugar 1 1/2 lemons, zested 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 3 lemons) 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter 1/2 cup egg whites (from about 4 eggs) 1/2 cup sugar Instructions: Pastry Bases: Mix the butter, flour, and salt until sandy in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. In a separate bowl, blend the yolk and creme fraiche. Add to the flour mixture and mix until barely combined. Form into a disk, wrap, and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. Lemon Curd: Bring 2 inches of water to a simmer in a saucepan. Whip the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the lemon zest and juice and place the bowl over the simmering water (without letting the bowl touch the water; pour some out if needed). Cook until thickened, whisking occasionally, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Let cool to room temperature, cover, and freeze overnight or up to 3 days. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Flour a work surface and roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thick. Prick all over with a fork then cut out 2-inch rounds. Transfer to the cookie sheet. Bake until light golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes and let cool. (The whole recipe can be made up to this point up to 3 days in advance.) Up to 6 hours before serving, assemble the dessert. Arrange the pastry rounds in a pan that will fit in your freezer (use two, if needed). Use a small ice cream scoop to place a ball or scoop of frozen lemon curd (it won&#39;t be frozen solid) onto each round. Place back in the freezer while you make the meringue. Meringue: Whip the egg whites until foamy, then add the sugar and continue whipping until stiff and glossy. Transfer to your pastry bag. Pipe meringue around the base of each pastry round, spiraling around and up the lemon curd ball and gradually enclosing the top to create a beehive. Fire up your kitchen torch and brown until lightly browned all over. Return to the freezer until ready to serve, up to 4 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 23240,&quot;Profiteroles with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce 1/2 recipe Pate a Choux, recipe follows 1 egg, beaten Store-bought vanilla ice cream Store-bought chocolate sauce 1 cup water 1 teaspoon salt 3 teaspoons sugar 6 tablespoons butter, cut in pieces 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, sifted 4 eggs, beaten Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. With a rubber spatula, scoop the pate a choux into the pastry bag and pipe out approximately 16 (1 1/2-inch rounds) spaced 1 to 2 inches apart on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Brush lightly with the beaten egg and place in the oven. Cook until golden and puffed, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a baking rack. Split the profiteroles nearly in half, leaving a little hinge at the back, and cradle a small scoop of vanilla ice cream inside each. Divide the profiteroles between bowls and pour over some chocolate sauce. Serve cold. In a small saucepan over high heat, bring the water, salt, sugar, and butter to a boil, making sure the butter is completely melted. Off the heat, add the flour all at once and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon. Return to the heat and continue beating until the dough forms a solid, smooth mass and pulls away from the sides of the saucepan. Take off the heat and empty the dough into a clean mixing bowl. Little by little add the beaten eggs, beating vigorously in between each addition, until the dough forms a smooth, supple mass. Divide the dough into 2 even quantities, 1 part to be used for the profiteroles, the other for gougeres. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 23241,&quot;The Bomb Bakers 1 1/4 cups kosher salt 6 medium russet potatoes, washed 2 tablespoons garlic salt 2 tablespoons seasoned salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Horseradish Sour Cream, recipe follows 2 cups sour cream 4 tablespoons prepared horseradish Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In large mixing bowl dissolve 1 cup kosher salt in 8 cups of water.

Then with the processor running, drizzle in the cold vodka 1 tablespoon at a time until it forms into a ball. Take it out and divide into two pieces, 1/3 and 2/3. Place on a piece of plastic wrap and pat each piece into a disk. Wrap and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out the larger pie crust on a lightly floured surface slightly larger than your pie tin. Place into the tin, trim the edges and crimp the edges decoratively. Put into the refrigerator while you roll out your top crust and prepare your filling. Repeat the same method for rolling out the top crust. Use small star and heart cutters to cut a pattern for the top crust. For the filling: Stir the granulated sugar, flour and orange zest in a medium bowl. Gently toss the strawberries and rhubarb together in a large bowl. Pour the dry ingredients over the strawberries and rhubarb and toss to coat. Put the fruit into the pie crust and dot with the butter slices. Cover with the top crust and seal the edges with egg wash. Adhere the decorations to the crust with egg wash. Sprinkle the crust with a little sugar. Cover the edges of the pie crust with foil or a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from burning. Bake until the crust is browned and the juice bubbles through the slits, 40 to 50 minutes. For the Chantilly cream: Add the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla seeds and lime zest to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.

Push the meat (not patting it) together gently and shape into patties no bigger than the size of your burger buns. They should be loosely compacted; they should look rustically rough, not smooth and that way a good crust will develop and there will be lots of nooks and crannies for the cheese to melt into. They should be about 1/2-inch thick and about 4 inches wide. Make sure they fit your buns! Once shaped, chill the uncooked burgers in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat, or warm your largest cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Sprinkle both sides of the burgers generously with salt. This is not only for flavor, but also to build a good crust. Using a spatula, place the burgers on the grill or in the skillet; they should sizzle upon contact. If you are cooking inside, open your window, because it might get a little smoky! If using a grill: Cook 2 minutes on the first side for medium-rare or 3 minutes if you like them medium-well. Flip the burgers, and top each one with a slice of cheese. Cover, if possible, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer, depending how well done you like your burgers and the heat of your grill. If using a skillet: Cook 4 minutes for medium-rare, or 5 minutes for medium-well on the first side. Flip the burgers, and top each one with a slice of cheese. Cover, if possible, and cook for 4 minutes longer. A meat thermometer inserted in the middle of the burger should register 135 to 140 degrees F for medium-rare. Remove the burgers from the heat and grind freshly ground black pepper on top of each burger. While the meat rests, toast the buns. Spread both cut sides of the buns with a little softened butter. Lower the heat to medium, add the buns cut-side down, and let them toast until golden brown. Place each burger on a bun, top with Ketchup Chutney or Roasted Red Pepper and Walnut Dip and pile you&#39;re your favorite toppings. Dig into a little slice of summer heaven right from your kitchen! Warm the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Keep your lid handy. Add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds; they should start enthusiastically popping upon contact with the oil, so cover the pot until the spluttering subsides, about 30 seconds. Add the onions and saute until soft and just starting to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, and saute until the garlic is soft, about 2 minutes longer. Add the Garam Masala, paprika and turmeric. Stir and cook about 30 seconds. Then add the vinegar (standing back so you don&#39;t inhale the fumes!) and cook 1 minute more. Add the tomatoes, molasses, 1/2 teaspoon salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Stir, bring to a boil, and then cook at a generous simmer about 10 minutes until thickened. You can puree it if you like. Set it aside to cool and then jar. Store in the refrigerator.<br> Combine the cinnamon sticks, cloves, green cardamom seeds, black cardamom seeds, if using in a spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind until fine. Store the spice mix in an airtight container away from direct sunlight.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roast the red peppers. Place each bell pepper over the open flame of a gas burner or grill, cooking until the skin blackens and blisters. Rotate the peppers and blacken all the way around, about 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can roast the peppers in the oven by placing the bell peppers on a baking sheet and placing under the broiler, turning frequently, until the peppers are blackened and blistered all over. Put the blackened peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside to steam. Toast the walnuts. Spread the walnuts on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Pop into the oven until light golden brown and aromatic, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Peel the red peppers using a paring knife. Discard the peels, stem and seeds. Throw the roasted red peppers, walnuts, lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, olive oil, paprika, cumin, red pepper flakes and garlic into a food processor with a teaspoon of salt, and run until the dip is smooth.

Place the softened butter in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Whip the butter until it&#39;s fluffy. Add the parsley, red pepper flakes, black pepper, garlic, lemon zest and the juice of half the lemon. Mix it until it&#39;s totally combined, scraping the sides as needed. Add more parsley, more lemon juice, more pepper or salt if you&#39;d like. Lay out a long piece of plastic wrap and scoop the butter mixture in a long strip down the middle of it. Carefully pull one side of the plastic wrap over the butter, squeezing it gently to form it into a log. Continue to roll the log of butter into a roll. When it&#39;s all rolled up, twist the ends (like a piece of candy) until they become very taut (this means the butter is pressing together inside the plastic to form a cohesive roll). Place the roll of butter into the fridge so it will harden, or into the freezer if you need to speed along the process. For the steaks: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the steaks. Melt the butter in a heavy ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. When it&#39;s melted and golden brown, sear the steaks for about 45 seconds per side. Set in the oven to finish, about 3 minutes.

Cheetos? 4 large eggs, lightly beaten Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup ranch dressing 2 tablespoons Vietnamese hot sauce, such as sriracha Instructions: Put the unwrapped mozzarella blocks in the freezer for 30 minutes to firm. Meanwhile, pour the cheese-flavored snacks into a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Reserve 1 cup for sprinkling at the end and transfer the rest to a large bowl. Put the eggs in a separate large bowl. Unwrap the cold blocks of mozzarella and use a long, thin knife to cut them in thirds lengthwise through their narrow sides (like sandwich bread), so you have 6 thinner blocks of mozzarella. Using a 2 1/2-inch-wide heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out 2 hearts of cheese from each thin block; you should have 12 hearts total. Using the tip end of the heart cutter, cut out a deeper cleave in the top of each cheese heart to make the heart shape more defined. Save the scraps for another use. Dip each cheese heart in the beaten egg, then toss in the cheese dust until fully coated. Repeat 2 more times to create a very thick coating, then transfer to a baking sheet. Freeze the cheese hearts for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days. Pour enough oil into a large heavy pot to come 2 inches up the side and attach a deep-frying thermometer to the pot. Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F. Using a slotted spoon or strainer and working in 3 batches, lower the hearts into the oil and fry until browned at the edges and the cheese is fully melted, about 4 minutes. Lift the hearts from the oil and transfer to paper towels to drain. Transfer the hearts to a platter and sprinkle with the reserved cheese dust. Pour the ranch dressing into a small serving bowl and pour the hot sauce in the center of the ranch dressing. Drag the tip of a knife straight through the center of the dressing and hot sauce to form a heart shape.

Combine yeast, honey and warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Let sit for 5 or 6 minutes, or until mixture begins to foam. While yeast mixture is sitting, combine whole-wheat flour, all purpose flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a bowl and whisk to combine. Add flour mixture and oil to yeast mixture and mix on low speed until just incorporated and dough begins to form. Switch to dough hook and mix on low to medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until dough is smooth but still pliable. If the dough is very sticky, add all-purpose flour, by the tablespoon, as necessary. Remove the dough from the bowl and roll into a long log. Cut log into 16 pieces and roll each piece into a 10 by 1-inch tube. Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Twist each dough stick several times and arrange sticks on cookie sheets, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart. In a small bowl beat the egg with water and brush on dough. Combine 1 tablespoon salt with sesame seeds and sprinkle evenly among dough pieces. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a golden crust has formed but pretzels are still soft inside. Remove from oven and cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23259,&quot;Eight-Layer Chicken Chili Dip 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium red onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 tablespoon chili powder Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken 1 cup sour cream 1 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and stems Juice and zest of 1 lime 1 cup frozen corn, thawed 1 green bell pepper, chopped 1 1/2 cups crumbled cornbread 3 medium tomatoes, chopped One 14-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed 1 1/2 cups shredded yellow Cheddar Tortilla or corn chips for dipping Instructions: Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, add half of the onion and the garlic and cook, stirring, until soft and just begins to brown, about 4 minutes.

Transfer to a mixing bowl and add the sage, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly and keep in a mason jar. For the braised bison: Preheat a grill for cooking over medium-high heat and preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Place the bison on a cookie sheet and cover it with oil. Cover with about 5 tablespoons dry rub, thoroughly covering the entire cut. Sear the meat all over on the grill, about 5 minutes per side, then transfer to a Dutch oven and add enough stock to cover the meat halfway. Cover with foil, then the lid and bake until tender, about 12 hours. Remove the meat from the hot stock to a cookie sheet and let rest, at least 20 minutes. For the cl reduction: Deseed chiles and toast them. Char onion and tomatoes. Put chiles, onion, tomatoes and garlic in a blender along with 2 cups bison stock left behind from cooking the bison and blend until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste. Use tongs to pull the meat apart and use your hands to separate the fat (discard the fat). Cut meat into smaller pieces and return to the Dutch oven with the hot stock and 1 cup cl reduction. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 23267,&quot;The Best Pepper Steak 1 1/2 pounds flank steak 4 cloves garlic One 1 1/2-inch piece ginger 7 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 1/4 cup Shaoxing wine or dry sherry 1 tablespoon sugar Freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup beef broth 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 2 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 medium white onion, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 large red bell pepper (about 8 ounces), cut into 1-inch pieces 1 large green bell pepper (about 8 ounces), cut into 1-inch pieces 1 tablespoon cornstarch Sliced scallions, for topping Toasted sesame seeds, for topping Steamed white rice, for serving Instructions: Freeze the flank steak until the meat is slightly frozen and firm enough to thinly slice with ease, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Finely grate 2 cloves of the garlic into a large bowl. Peel the ginger and cut it in half. Finely grate one of the ginger halves into the same bowl; reserve the remaining ginger. Whisk in 3 tablespoons of the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of the Shaoxing wine, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the sugar and several large grinds of pepper to combine. Set aside. Thinly slice the flank steak against the grain on a very slight bias into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Cut any extra-long pieces in half; the strips should be no longer than 3 to 4 inches. Add to the bowl with the marinade and stir to combine. Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. About 30 minutes before finishing the dish, use tongs to transfer the steak to a large baking sheet lined with several layers of paper towels and arrange in a single layer. Lay additional paper towels on top to help absorb any excess marinade. Set aside to take the chill off the meat. Whisk together the beef broth, sesame oil, remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce, remaining 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar and a couple large grinds of pepper in a medium bowl; set aside. Finely mince the remaining 2 cloves garlic and add to a small bowl. Finely mince the remaining ginger and add to the same bowl. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil starts to shimmer, add a third of the steak strips in a single layer and cook until well-browned on the first side, about 1 minute. Flip and cook until browned on the second side, about 1 more minute. Transfer to a large plate. Cook the remaining steak in 2 additional batches, adding 1 1/2 teaspoons of canola oil per batch. Transfer to the plate. Lower the heat to medium high. Add the onion and a splash of water to the empty skillet and cook, scraping up any browned bits and stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the red and green bell peppers and cook, stirring frequently and adding another splash of water if the skillet starts to get too brown on the bottom, until the vegetables are crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 1 minute. Return the steak to the skillet and stir to combine. Whisk the cornstarch into the sauce, then pour it into the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thick and glossy, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pepper steak to a large serving platter and top with sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately with a side of steamed rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23268,&quot;Homecoming Punch One 64-ounce container cranberry juice cocktail, chilled One 12-ounce can frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed One 12-ounce can frozen pink lemonade concentrate, thawed 2 cups brandy 1 bottle extra-dry sparkling wine or Champagne, chilled 4 cups ice cubes Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a large pitcher or punch bowl with 4 cups of ice. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Prosecco, Cava]&quot; 23269,&quot;Cheesy Bacon and Egg Brunch Casserole 8 slices bacon 1 medium onion, chopped (1 cup) 1 loaf (8 ounces) Italian bread, cut into 1-inch cubes (5 cups) 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded Cheddar cheese 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 1 cup cottage cheese 5 eggs 1 1/2 cups milk 1/2 teaspoon McCormick?

Rub both sides of the meat with the vegetable oil, then season both sides generously with salt and black pepper, coating the surface evenly. Set aside to rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. (The seasoned meat can also be transferred to a large resealable plastic bag and stored in the refrigerator overnight. Let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before cooking.) While the meat rests, add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, garlic, scallions, lemon zest and juice, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper to a food processor. Pulse, stopping to scrape the sides as needed, until the herbs are finely chopped, about 10 times. Transfer the herb mixture to a small bowl and whisk in the olive oil. Set aside. Set a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat until just starting to smoke, about 3 minutes. Add the steak and cook until seared on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip the steak and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into the center of the steak registers between 120 and 125 degrees F, about 3 minutes more. Transfer the steak to a clean plate and spoon 1/2 cup of the herb oil over top. Set aside to marinate for 5 minutes. While the steak marinates, heat the broccoli rabe to the same cast-iron skillet over high heat. Cook, using tongs to toss the broccoli rabe, until it\u2019s vibrantly green and starting to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the kale and continue cooking and tossing until the kale is wilted and the broccoli rabe is crisp-tender, about 2 minutes more. Add 1/4 cup of the herb oil and toss to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat. Thinly slice the rested steak against the grain. Transfer the steak to the skillet on top of the greens and spoon the remaining 1/4 cup of herb oil over the steak. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 23275,&quot;Buttermilk Biscuits 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more, for dusting 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon fine salt 7 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, sliced 3/4 cup buttermilk, plus more, for brushing Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Rub 2 tablespoons of the cold butter into the flour with your fingertips until completely absorbed. Work the remaining 5 tablespoons of cold butter into the flour with your fingertips until pea-sized bits of butter remain. Use a rubber spatula to stir the buttermilk into the flour until the mixture comes together into a shaggy dough. Dust a cutting board or work surface with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Pat the dough into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold dough in thirds, like a letter, and then pat into a 3/4-inch thick rectangle. Cut biscuits out using a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter and put on the prepared baking sheet. Press together the remaining scraps of dough and cut out more biscuits. Brush the biscuit tops with buttermilk. Bake until the tops are lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool on the pan at least 5 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23276,&quot;Chocolate Peanut Butter and Jelly Rolls 10 large eggs, separated, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Pinch salt 3 ounces dark unsweetened natural cocoa powder Peanut Buttercream: 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter (or almond butter) 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 tablespoon heavy cream 6 ounces (3/4 cup) jelly (your choice of flavor; my favorite is strawberry) 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup peanut oil or canola oil Instructions: For the cake: Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two 9 1/2-by-14-inch jelly-roll pans with parchment paper, leaving 1 inch of paper hanging over on all sides (this will help you lift the cakes out of the pan after baking). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the yolks and 1 cup of the sugar on medium speed until the mixture is thick and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and mix for 1 minute. Scrape into a medium mixing bowl and set aside. Wash the stand mixer bowl and whisk very well (even the smallest amount of yolk will prevent the whites from whipping properly). Put the whites and salt in the mixer bowl whisk at medium speed until he whites become frothy. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar. Increase the speed to high and whip until the whites become glossy and almost firm (the whites should not become dry). Remove the bowl from the mixer. Sift the cocoa over the egg yolk mixture and gently fold in one-third of the whites (this will help to prevent overmixing). Add the remaining whites and carefully fold until there are no visible streaks of white. Divide the batter between the two pans. Smooth the batter evenly with an offset spatula. Bake the cakes just until they have risen and feel like soft marshmallows, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pans to wire racks and let the cakes cool to room temperature. Chill the cakes until cold, about 30 minutes. While the cakes are cooling, prepare the buttercream. For the peanut buttercream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and peanut butter on medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Turn the speed to low, add the confectioners&#39; sugar, salt and vanilla and mix for another 2 minutes. Add the cream, turn the speed to high, and beat for 1 minute. Cover and set aside. When cooled, remove the cakes from the refrigerator. Gently lift one cake from the pan, using the overhanging parchment as handles, and place it on a cutting board. Carefully separate the paper from the cake. Lay a piece of parchment on top of the cake and quickly flip the cake over. Remove the parchment and replace with a clean sheet of parchment. With a rolling pin, firmly roll over the cake to even it out and thin it out. Trim each cake to a 12-by-9-inch rectangle. Place in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes; this firms it up, and if the cake is stuck to the parchment this allows you to flip one more time to release the paper. Repeat with the remaining cake. Spread a thin layer of jelly over the surface of both cakes. Divide the buttercream between the cakes and spread it evenly over the jelly, leaving a border at the top of one long side. (The rolls look best when the cake layer and buttercream layer are the same thickness.) Begin rolling up the cakes, one at a time, starting at a long side. The first roll is the most important-keep it tight. Continue rolling toward the top. It&#39;s best to go slowly and carefully. When you completed rolling a cake into a log, place it in the center of a new sheet of parchment. Take the paper above the roll and cover the roll with a little overlap. Now take a flat-edge utensil, like a bench scraper or a long spatula, and force it underneath the roll and push tight. This helps fill in any air pockets in the roll. Chill the rolls 15 to 20 minutes or overnight before cutting them; the colder, the better. For the chocolate shell: Put the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set it over a pan with 3 inches of simmering water. When the chocolate is completely melted, stir in the butter and oil. Set aside in a warm place.<br> Remove the paper from the rolls. With a sharp knife, cut each roll into 6 even pieces; each will be about 2 inches wide. Place a screen over a sheet pan to allow excess chocolate to drip off. Working with one piece at a time, place a piece into the chocolate shell. Flip the piece over using a fork. Lift it out of the chocolate and tap off excess chocolate before setting it on the screen. Continue until each roll is completely coated.

Add the butter and swirl to coat the pan. When the butter shimmers, add the bananas and the macadamias and saute, stirring, until golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the rum and then flambe the bananas and the macadamias. When the flames are extinguished remove the pan from the heat. Place a scoop of the Brown Sugar Ice Cream in a martini glass. Coat the ice cream with the warm flambe sauce and garnish with a banana chips. In non-reactive medium saucepan, combine the milk, brown sugar, vanilla bean, and heat over medium heat until scalded. Turn the heat to low and simmer until the mixture is reduced by 1/3, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to steep at least 1 hour, refrigerated, and preferably overnight: the longer it steeps the more flavor will develop. Strain the mixture, return the milk to the saucepan, and bring just to the point of boiling. Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with cold water and add ice. In a non-reactive medium bowl, combine the yolks and the sugar and whisk to blend. Add 4 ounces of the scalded milk mixture to the yolk mixture, mix well, and transfer the tempered yolk mixture to the saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Do not overcook or the eggs will scramble. Strain the mixture into a medium bowl, and place it in the bowl of ice water to cool. When cool, add the cream, and stir to blend. Freeze in an ice cream maker following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Do not over harden; the ice cream should have a soft consistency. Transfer to the freezer. After slicing the banana, peel off the rind and place the strips on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In a small mixing bowl, whisk the lemon juice, sugar, and water together. Brush the banana pieces with the lemon mixture. Place in a pre-heated 200-degree oven and bake for about 2 hours. As the banana pieces are heated they will darken slightly. After 2 hours, remove from the oven and let cool to allow the banana chips to become firm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 23328,&quot;Spring Goddess Salad 1/2 red onion, halved, thinly sliced 2 hearts romaine, chopped 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 English cucumber, including peel, sliced 1 anchovy fillet, rinsed, patted dry, and roughly chopped 1 garlic clove 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large bowl combine onion slices and romaine.

Saute the onions with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and half of each of the mushrooms. Turn up the heat and cook the mushrooms, stirring frequently, until golden. Pour in the wine and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Meanwhile, place the Ancho chiles over a burner and toast all over just until soft and the skin is slightly bubbly. Roughly chop half the chiles and add to the pot, reserving the rest. Add the chicken stock to the pot and boil about 12 minutes. Transfer to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. (For a smoother sauce, pass through a sieve.) Return the sauce to the stove and bring to a boil. Stir in the remaining butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, and remove from heat. (For a thinner, more rustic sauce you can eliminate this butter.) Stir in the lime juice, season with salt and pepper and reserve. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Season the chicken breasts well with salt and pepper. Heat a large dry skillet over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the olive oil and place the chicken in the pan, skin side down. Fry until the skin starts to brown and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes, and then turn and briefly sear the other side. Transfer to a baking dish (set the pan aside) and bake until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, finish the sauce by thinly slicing the remaining toasted Ancho peppers. Reheat the pan used to brown the chicken and saute the remaining mushrooms over medium-high heat until the edges are brown. Then add the sliced Anchos. Stir and toss 1 to 2 minutes longer. Stir into the reserved sauce. Coat the serving plates with the sauce.

Using a hand mixer, whip the egg whites on low speed until frothy. Gradually add the sugar, and then whip on high speed until stiff peaks form. The egg whites should be glossy and thick. Fold half of the almond mixture into the egg whites and then add the rest. Fold the mixture 15 to 20 times; the batter will be thick and fall slowly when dripped from the spatula. Pipe 1-inch circles onto baking sheets lined with silicon mats or parchment paper. Let rest until a skin forms on top and is dry to the touch, 15 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time. If you are baking two sheets at a time, the bottom and top sheets should be rotated to prevent over browning on the bottom. If only baking one sheet at a time, bake on the bottom rack first for 5 minutes with an empty sheet on top. After 5 minutes, rotate the sheet and move the bottom sheet to the top and the top sheet to the bottom. You will know the macarons are done when you can touch them and the top of the macaron is set does not slide around under your finger. The macarons must be set before you take them out of the oven. If the macaron tops slide, put them back in the oven on the middle rack for another 2 minutes. Let them cool for about 10 minutes on the baking sheet and then take them off.

Toss the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Grill until slightly charred on both sides and just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes total. Transfer to a mixing bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of the miso Caesar dressing. Brush the inside of the baguette with the remaining oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place cut-side down on the grill and cook until lightly charred and warmed through, about 3 minutes. Cut into 4 equal pieces. To assemble, divide the grilled romaine and radicchio among 4 large plates. Scatter an equal amount of shrimp on each plate and sprinkle everything with the remaining Parmesan. Serve with the grilled bread and remaining miso Caesar dressing on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 23373,&quot;Cranberry-Almond Granola 2/3 cup frozen unsweetened apple juice concentrate, thawed 1/2 cup maple syrup 1/3 cup almond oil or canola oil 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 5 cups rolled oats (not quick-cooking) 1 cup toasted wheat germ 1 cup whole almonds, coarsely chopped (4 1/2 ounces) 1/2 cup sunflower seeds (2 ounces) 1 cup dried cranberries, divided Instructions: To Make Ahead: Store granola in airtight containers for up to 2 months. If you&#39;ve never made your own granola, you&#39;ll be amazed at the difference in freshness and flavor-and at how easy it is. Use this recipe as a starting point for your own creativity: substitute dried blueberries or chopped dried apricots for the cranberries, or walnuts or hazelnuts for the almonds. Position racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven; preheat to 325degreesF. Coat 2 large baking sheets with sides with cooking spray. Whisk apple juice concentrate, maple syrup, oil and brown sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; stir in cinnamon and salt. Mix oats, wheat germ, almonds and sunflower seeds in a large bowl. Stir in the juice mixture; toss to coat. Spread the granola evenly on the prepared baking sheets. Bake the granola for 15 minutes, stirring once or twice. Reverse sheets top to bottom and back to front. Continue baking until lightly browned and aromatic, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes more. Transfer the baking sheets to wire racks; stir 1/2 cup dried cranberries into the granola on each sheet. Let cool completely.

Run your fingers down the thyme sprigs to release their leaves and sprinkle them all over a large plate. Add a little salt and pepper and then squish the lamb chops or cutlets into the mix, turning them over to coat both sides. (This will give a lovely crust when cooked.) Fry them in the pan until they are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook, depending on how you like them done, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer them to a plate to rest for a few minutes, covered with foil (this will make them much more tender and juicy). Meanwhile, trim and slice the spring onions. Add the spring onions and salmonds to the frying pan and cook over medium heat, stirring every now and then, until the onions are wilted and the almonds golden, 1 to 2 minutes. For the couscous: Meanwhile, put some water on to boil. Pour the couscous into a medium bowl and just cover with the boiled water. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for about 5 minutes. For the glaze: Combine the maple syrup, balsamic vinegar and butter in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer, leaving it to bubble away for about 3 minutes, stirring from time to time. Once thickened and syrupy, remove from the heat and keep warm. Check that the couscous grains have absorbed all the water and are tender, then fluff it up with a fork. Crumble the feta cheese in, season with salt and pepper and add a good drizzle of oil. Stir together and re-cover to keep warm. Divide the couscous among four serving plates. Sit the rested lamb chops on top and drizzle the glaze (and any resting juices) over. Scatter over the spring onion and almond mix. Rip up the mint leaves and scatter them over the top. If using, top with the pomegranate seeds and serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 23383,&quot;BBQ Ribs with Killer Mac and Cheese 2 cups white vinegar 1/2 cup paprika 1/2 cup kosher salt 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 2 small or 1 large yellow onion, large diced 1 head garlic, sliced in half horizontally 2 racks pork spareribs (2 1/2 to 3 pounds each) Killer Mac and Cheese, recipe follows Olive oil, for cooking 1 Spanish onion, small diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 green bell pepper, core and seeds removed, small diced 1 jalapeno pepper, stem and seeds removed, small diced One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes 14 ounces ketchup 1 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup hot sauce 1/4 cup molasses 2 teaspoons ground black pepper, plus additional as needed 1 teaspoon liquid smoke 1 lemon, juiced Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 6 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 onion, cut into 1/4 inch dice Kosher salt 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 quart whole milk, plus more as needed 1/4 cup dijon mustard Tabasco or other hot sauce 1 pound medium shells or other short pasta 2 cups grated Cheddar (about 8 ounces) 2 cups grated fontina cheese (about 8 ounces) 1 cup grated Parmesan (about 4 ounces) Instructions: For the boil: Add the vinegar, paprika, salt, Worcestershire, cayenne, cumin, black pepper, onion and garlic to a large pot, then add the ribs and cover with water until just submerged. Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the ribs are tender, but still on the bone, 45 minutes to 2 hours. For the sauce: Meanwhile, add olive oil to coat a medium pot and turn the heat to medium-high. When the oil is shimmering, add the onion and cook until it begins to soften, a few minutes. Then add the garlic, bell pepper and jalapeno. Cook until the vegetables soften, about 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, hot sauce, molasses, black pepper, liquid smoke, lemon juice and 1 cup water and stir to combine. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until it coats the back of a spoon, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Heat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Remove the ribs from the pot and place on the grill. Cook until browned and grill marks appear, about 10 minutes. Flip over and grill on the opposite side. Brush the tops liberally with BBQ sauce and cook until the alternate side has grill marks. Flip again and coat with sauce. Continue to brush with sauce and flip every few minutes, until the sauce begins to caramelize, and a deep crust is formed. Remove the ribs from the grill and slice ribs to serve.<br> Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the bacon and set the pan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels. Do not discard the bacon fat: Reserve that deliciousness! Add the butter and onion to the pan with the bacon fat; season with salt and cook until the onion is soft and aromatic, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture looks like wet sand, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk, mustard and a few shakes of Tabasco. Season with salt and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer until the mixture is slightly thicker than heavy cream, 6 to 8 more minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook 1 minute less than the instructions on the package suggest. Taste it: It should be toothsome, with just a little nugget of hard pasta still in the center-this is al dente. Drain the pasta. Add the Cheddar, fontina and Parmesan to the milk mixture and whisk to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed, adding a little more milk if the mixture seems too thick. Stir in the cooked bacon and pasta. The mixture should be very creamy and flavorful. Serve immediately. (If making ahead, transfer to a baking dish or ramekins, then reheat in a 375 degree oven.) &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 23384,&quot;Hominy-Jalapeno Cornbread Cooking spray 1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda Kosher salt 1 egg 1 cup milk 1 cup sour cream or plain Greek yogurt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup canned hominy, drained 1/2 cup pickled or roasted peppers, drained and chopped 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped 1 jalapeno pepper, minced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Butter a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg until well combined. Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and cream together until fully combined. Add the bananas and mix for about a minute to smash the bananas thoroughly. Add the sour cream, eggs and vanilla and, you guessed it, mix. Finally, add the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Tip: Do not overmix the batter, as it can make the crumb tough and result in large \worm\ holes. Melt the chopped chocolate over a double boiler or microwave it in a glass or plastic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring between intervals so the chocolate does not burn. Allow the chocolate to cool slightly. In a medium bowl, mix 1 cup of the batter with the chocolate until well combined. Pour the banana batter into the prepared pan. Pour the chocolate batter in the center of the batter and swirl throughout the batter with a spoon to create the marbling effect. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes (okay, maybe one crumb. Or two). Allow the loaf to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer it from the pan to a cooling rack to continue cooling to room temperature, and you&#39;re done! Slice, sprinkle with flaked sea salt and a touch of chili powder. Boom.

Add the pasta and cook about 2 minutes less than the time for al dente on the package. Drain. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half the shrimp, season with salt and cook until they&#39;re nicely browned and opaque, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, turning once. Remove them to a plate and set aside. Repeat with more butter and oil, the remaining shrimp and some salt. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil to the skillet. Throw in the garlic and stir to prevent it from burning, then stir in the wine. Let the liquid reduce a couple of minutes. Stir the tomatoes with their juices, 3/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper to taste and the red pepper flakes into the sauce. Simmer for about 7 minutes. Grab 2 large sheets of heavy-duty foil and overlap them by about 8 inches on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour the drained pasta onto the foil. Spoon the tomato sauce and sauteed shrimp on top, making sure you include all the juices. Tightly wrap the foil into a packet, rolling up the sides so it won&#39;t leak. Bake for 15 minutes. Open the foil packet right before serving, drizzle with the warm heavy cream and sprinkle with the basil, parsley and cheese. Be sure to get some of the sauce with each serving.

In a bowl, mix together the almonds, honey, canola oil and hazelnut oil. Spread the almonds on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper, sprinkle with salt and toast in the oven for approximately 10 minutes or until fragrant and lightly caramelized, watching them closely and stirring halfway through if necessary. Let cool for 1 minute. Cook&#39;s Note: Cool no longer than 1 minute, as the almonds will cool and harden, which makes getting them off the paper very difficult! In a food processor, add 3/4 of the roasted almonds. Process on high speed for 5 minutes or until you have the desired consistency. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and process again to the desired smoothness. Add a few drops of oil if it&#39;s too thick. Adjust the seasoning, to taste. With a knife, chop the remaining almonds and keep aside to use as a garnish. For the grape jelly: Rinse the grapes and put them in a big pot with the sugar and lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring often, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for about 20 to 25 minutes or until it starts to thicken. Skim the surface regularly to ensure a clear jam. Let it cool for 1 hour. Pour the mixture in a clean jar and reserve in the refrigerator. Grape jelly will keep for a week. For the duck foie gras: Season the foie gras with salt and pepper. In a pan on medium heat, saute the foie gras 20 seconds on each side or just until golden brown. Remove from the pan and set aside in a warm place. Add the brioche bread to the pan to soak up the remaining juices and duck fat and lightly toast on each side, about 2 minutes in total. When ready to plate, spread the almond butter on a slice of bread, cover with a slice of foie gras. Garnish with the grape jelly and the reserved crushed almonds. Notes The almond butter can keep in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 months. Notes Hazelnut oil can be substituted with macadamia nut oil or grilled sesame oil. Roasted pecans, hazelnuts, macadamia, brazil nuts or peanuts work well, too. Combining different nuts is also fun to experiment with. The nut butter can also be flavored with spices like orange zest, cardamom, or cinnamon. The first and most important thing to consider when making a batch of peanut butter is buying fresh peanuts, or other nuts. Because nuts have such a high oil content, they can go rancid if stored improperly, or for too long. Buy your nuts from a busy store with a good turnover and you should have no problem.

Line a standard muffin pan with 12 cupcake liners.<br> Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and eggs into the bowl of an electric stand mixer. Whip the ingredients for 8 minutes on high speed. Scrape down the bowl, and add the liquid shortening and milk. Mix 8 more minutes at medium speed. Gently fold in the instant espresso granules. Fill the cupcake liners three-quarters full with batter and bake until golden brown and baked through, about 25 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the caramel filling: Stir the dulce de leche, toffee bits and instant espresso granules together until fully combined. Place in a pastry bag with a round tip large enough to allow the toffee bits to pass through without becoming lodged.<br> For the buttercream: Bring the sugar and 2 ounces water to a boil in a medium saucepot. Place the egg whites into the bowl of an electric stand mixer. When sugar syrup reaches 238 degrees F on a candy thermometer, begin whipping the egg whites. Cook the sugar syrup to 250 degrees F, and slowly pour the syrup into the whipped meringue. Whip on high speed until the meringue cools and stiff peaks are formed. Mix in the softened butter and coffee extract. Place into a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. For the pipettes: Bring the sugar and 2 ounces water to a gentle simmer. Remove from the heat and stir in the instant espresso granules. Fill 12 chemistry pipettes with the syrup.

Stir together and let sit until the mixture becomes frothy and foamy and smells very yeasty, about 10 minutes. Put the flour in a mixing bowl and make a well in the center. Add the olive oil, salt and the activated yeast mixture. Stir until the dough comes together and forms a ball. Dust a clean work surface with flour and knead the dough until it is tight and firm, 5 to 7 minutes. Place the dough back in the mixing bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the topping: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the bacon in a large, wide pan and give it a couple drops of olive oil. Bring the pan to a medium heat and cook the bacon until it is brown and crispy. Remove the bacon from the pan and reserve on paper towels. Add the onions to the pan, season with salt, cover and cook until the onions have wilted and are very soft, about 10 minutes. Remove the lid and cook the onions until they are very soft and caramelized. This will take awhile, maybe up to 45 minutes. Stir the onions occasionally paying attention not to let them burn, but don&#39;t rush it! When the onions are really brown and sweet, remove them from the heat and reserve. Combine the creme fraiche and fromage blanc. Divide the dough into 4 even balls and roll them out until they are 1/8 to 1/16-inch thick. Place them on a sheet tray and bake them in the oven for 4 minutes. Remove the dough from the oven. Schmear each dough evenly with the cheese mixture, place an even layer of the caramelized onions on the cheese and sprinkle the bacon on top of the onions. Return the dough to the oven until the dough is crisp on the bottom and the toppings are bubbly, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with chives and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 23395,&quot;Agua Fresca 1 large ripe cantaloupe or honeydew, seeded and diced; or 1 small watermelon, seeded and diced; or 1 pineapple, diced, or other fruit, similarly prepared 1/4 cup sugar, more or less, optional Chopped fresh mint, optional Juice of 1 lime Instructions: Puree fruit in a blender, adding just enough water or water and ice to blend.

Combine the masa mix, salt and warm water in a large bowl and mix until a smooth dough forms. Pull off pieces of dough and roll them into balls about the size of a ping pong ball. Cut a quart size resealable plastic bag open down both sides, to form a rectangle. Use the bag to line the tortilla press as you shape the tortillas so they do not stick: Lay 1 side of the plastic over the bottom of the press. Place a ball of dough in the center, and fold the other side of the plastic over the dough. Shut the top of the tortilla and press firmly down on the dough to shape the tortilla. Meanwhile, pour 2 inches of vegetable oil into a large deep pot and heat to 350 degrees F. Drop a tortilla into the hot oil and, using a metal spatula, repeatedly douse the tortilla with the hot oil until it begins to puff up. Flip it over and, using the spatula, make an indentation in the center of the tortilla to form a taco shape. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Fill each taco with 2 tablespoons of shredded chicken, guacamole, beans and cheese or your favorite filling.

Add the beef; cover and let sit in the refrigerator at least 4 hours or overnight. (This is a really important step: it makes a huge flavor difference.) For the stew: Remove the beef from the marinade. Strain the veggies and bay leaves from the marinade and discard. Reserve 2 cups of the marinade. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a large, wide pan or Dutch oven with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Sprinkle the beef with salt and toss with the flour; do not flour the beef until you&#39;re ready to brown it. Add the flour-coated beef to the hot pan, but be sure to not crowd the pan; you will need to work in four batches. Brown the meat well on all sides, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the pan to a baking sheet. After the first two batches, deglaze the pot with 1/2 cup of the reserved marinade, scraping up any browned bits. Drain the liquid into a small bowl. Add more olive oil to the pan to coat and cook the remaining two batches of meat. Add the meat to the baking sheet. Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup marinade, scraping up any browned bits. Add the bacon and cook until it gets brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Toss in the mushrooms, carrots, celery, garlic and onions, and season with salt. Cook until the mixture starts to soften and becomes very aromatic, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the remaining 1 cup marinade and deglaze the pan, stirring up any browned bits, 1 minute. Add the beef. Stir to combine and cook until the wine has reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Add enough of the beef stock to just cover the surface of the beef. Toss in the bay leaves and thyme bundle. Cover the pan, bring the liquid to a boil and put in the oven. Cook the beef for 2 hours. During the last hour of cooking time, add the potatoes. Cover the pan with the lid and put the stew back in the oven to cook for an additional hour. Remove the pot from the oven and skim off any excess grease from the surface of the stew. Garnish with the chives and serve with crusty bread to sop up all the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 23404,&quot;Bnh Xo\u202f 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup rice flour 1 tablespoon cornstarch 2 teaspoons turmeric powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt About 11 ounces beer 8 ounces coconut milk 3 scallions, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon baking soda 8 ounces medium shrimp (41/45 or 51/60), peeled and deveined High-heat cooking oil, such as peanut, canola or grapeseed oil, for frying 1/2 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced 4 cups bean sprouts 1 Persian cucumber, thinly sliced 6 leaves green leaf lettuce 3 sprigs mint 3 sprigs cilantro 13 sprigs Vietnamese basil 8 to 10 perilla leaves 12 rice paper rounds Nuoc Mam Dipping Sauce, recipe follows, for serving 1/2 cup julienned carrot 1/2 cup julienned daikon 1/2 cup fish sauce 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup lime juice 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 to 3 Thai chiles, finely chopped 1 to 2 cloves garlic, minced Instructions: For the batter: Whisk together the all-purpose flour, rice flour, cornstarch, turmeric and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the beer and coconut milk. Let rest for 15 to 30 minutes so the flour can absorb all the liquid. For the filling: While the batter rests, bring a small saucepan three-quarters full of water to a simmer. Stir in the pork and baking soda. Simmer until the pork is cooked through, opaque and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Cut the shrimp in half lengthwise if the shrimp are thicker than 1/2 inch. To make the crepe: Stir the scallions into the batter. Heat a 9-inch nonstick pan on medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/4 cup of the sliced onions, 3 to 5 slices of pork and 3 to 5 pieces of shrimp. Saut until the pork is light brown and the shrimp are half cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle in 6 to 8 ounces batter and rotate the pan so the batter is distributed evenly and covers the bottom. After you see the edges crisp and start to pull away, lower the heat to medium and cook for about 1 minute, allowing the bottom to sear, crisp and brown. Top with about 1 cup of the bean sprouts and cover with a lid to steam the sprouts and cook the top of the crepe, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the lid and place a few drops of oil around the crepe between the edges of the crepe and the pan to crisp up the crepe for 2 to 3 minutes. Once the bottom is golden brown, slide the crepe onto a plate, then fold in half. Repeat with the remaining filling and batter, adding additional oil. For the vegetable plate garnish: Arrange a plate with the cucumbers, lettuce, mint, cilantro, basil, perilla leaves and rice paper. Serve the crepes with the vegetable plate and Nuoc Mam Dipping Sauce. Combine the carrot, daikon, fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, rice vinegar, chiles, garlic and 1/2 cup water in a bowl and stir to dissolve the sugar completely.

Put all of the dry ingredients in a large bowl; then add the warm sugar mixture, stirring until all of the ingredients are well blended. The dough will appear crumbly but will hold together when rolled out. Use the dough immediately, while it is still warm. If it starts to crumble, place it in a warm oven for 1 to 2 minutes until it softens a bit.<br> To make decorated cutout cookies; Roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut out gingerbread women and men with cookie cutters. Place the cookies on foil-lined cookie sheets and bake until golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool the cookies on racks before decorating.<br> To decorate, tint a recipe of royal icing to your desired colors. Keep the icing covered with a damp towel while you are working to prevent it from drying out. To cover a cookie with icing, thin some of the icing with a little water and spread it on the cookie with a knife or metal spatula. Leave some of the icing thick for piping borders or other designs, using the #2 tip. Add dragees, edible glitter, colored sprinkles, or other decorations to the wet icing. To attach candies to un-iced cookies, brush a thin layer of clear piping gel on the cookie with a small paintbrush and add decorations. Royal icing is very versatile. It is pure white and dries very hard, so it is perfect for making flowers and bows and delicate piped work. It can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 weeks. You should stir the icing to restore its original consistency after storage, but do not rebeat. Royal icing does not work well in high humidity.<br> Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat slowly until they are all blended. Then beat at medium speed until the icing forms stiff peaks, about 5 minutes. Add more sugar if the icing is not stiff enough, or a few drops of water if it is too stiff. Use immediately or cover the bowl with a damp cloth to prevent drying when not in use. Allow at least 24 hours for royal icing decorations to dry, at room temperature.

Combine the brown sugar, sorghum and butter in a saucepan and heat on medium until the butter melts, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, bring to a simmer and cook about 1 minute. Lower the heat and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until a soft ball forms when the caramel is dropped in the glass of ice water, or the temperature reads 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 20 minutes. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes before dipping the apples. Skewer each apple through the core with a craft stick. Holding an apple by the stick, dip it in the caramel and roll to coat; allow the excess caramel to drip off. Dip in the popcorn or the burned peanuts and place on a sheet of wax paper to cool. Repeat with the remaining apples. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 23417,&quot;Shrimp and Chorizo Skewers 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 teaspoons paprika 1/2 cup olive oil 1 pound Spanish chorizo, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces 2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on 20 (6-inch) bamboo skewers, soaked in water Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 lemons, cut into small wedges Instructions: In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, paprika and olive oil. Set aside Put a slice chorizo into the curve of a shrimp. Thread a skewer through the shrimp starting at the tail and working your way up through the chorizo into the shrimp. Repeat with remaining shrimp and chorizo. Pour half of the marinade on the bottom of a large baking dish and spread out to evenly coat the bottom of the dish. Put the finished skewers on top and brush the remaining marinade evenly over the top of the skewers. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.

Butcher&#39;s twine Instructions: Punch holes at the top edge of a thin 8-inch square pan so that you will be able to lace 7 strings from one side of the pan to the other. Place the laced pan in a pan deep enough to catch any leaking syrup. Dissolve 2 1/2 cups of sugar in 1 cup water and cook without stirring to the hard-ball stage, 247 degrees to 252 degrees. Pour the syrup into the laced pan. It should reach a level about 3/4-inch above the strings. Cover the surface with a piece of foil. Watch and wait. The syrup may take as long as a week to crystallize. Lift out the laced pan. Cut the strings and dislodge the rock candy.

(This will help lower the pan into the Instant Pot and then lift it out after cooking.) Butter the bottom and sides of a metal or silicone round pan that fits inside a 6- or 8-quart Instant Pot. Combine the butter and cream cheese in a large bowl and whisk together until very smooth and creamy. (If lumpy, microwave in 10-second intervals, stirring until smooth.) Add the creamed corn and whisk again until thick. Add the cornmeal, parmesan, egg, sugar, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and whisk to combine, switching to a rubber spatula when the mixture becomes too thick to whisk. Stir in the milk, pepper Jack and cheddar until combined. Pour the batter into the pan and cover with foil; tightly crimp the edges. Pour 2 cups water into the Instant Pot and fit with a rack or trivet. Lay the foil strip under the pudding pan and use the ends to lower the pan into the pot (leave the foil strip in place). Put on the lid, making sure the steam valve is in the sealing position. Set to pressure-cook on high for 50 minutes. When the time is up, let the pressure release naturally, about 20 minutes.

Slice the root end off the entire head of garlic and turn it upside down, wrap it in aluminum foil and mold the foil so it supports the garlic to allow the cut end to stand upright in the oven. Pour 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil on the garlic so it slips between the skin and the cloves and wrap with the foil so it is enclosed. Roast for about 1 hour and set aside until it is cool enough to handle. To make the olive salsa for the chicken topping, in a small bowl combine the tomato, basil, parsley, peppercorns, olives and 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil. Gently squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from the skins into the mixture. Fold everything together and set aside to let flavors integrate. For the rice accompaniment to the chicken, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and stir in the basmati rice, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper, allowing rice to toast for a few minutes. Then add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer covered and undisturbed for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. In a large saute pan, heat the chicken broth over medium high heat. Add the basil, tarragon and parsley, bring to a boil to integrate flavors, then reduce heat. This is your poaching liquid.

Cover the bottom of the pan with the pound cake, using any extra pieces to line the sides of the pan if desired. Toss the strawberries with the granulated sugar and rum in a medium bowl, and then layer them on top of the pound cake. Scoop the ice cream onto the berry layer, packing it in tightly. Spread with an offset spatula to make a smooth top. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Unmold the cake by running a knife around the edge of it, then unhinge the springform and remove. Invert the cake onto a sheet of plastic wrap and remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment. Place a plate on the bottom and invert once more. For the strawberry whipped cream frosting: Add the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, strawberry jelly and vanilla to a large bowl and whip with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. This makes enough frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake with additional to pipe decorations if desired. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the whipped cream frosting. Sprinkle with the amaretti cookies. If the cake begins to get too soft, put it back into the freezer for a few minutes. Freeze another 1 1/2 to 2 hours or overnight.

Using a large knife and imagining that you are creating two large steaks from each head of cauliflower, trim a little off each end so that when you split the cauliflower in half, each half will lie flat. Cut the cauliflower in half. You should yield two \steaks,\ each weighing about 14 to 15 ounces. Repeat with the other cauliflower. Bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a pot large enough to hold the cauliflower steaks. Add salt until the water tastes like mild seawater. (How will you know? Take a little water with a spoon and taste a drop of it.) Layer a baking sheet with a kitchen towel. Add the cauliflower steaks to the boiling water and cook until they are slightly tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 6 to 8 minutes. Use a large slotted spoon or spatula to carefully transfer the steaks to the baking sheet to drain. In a container large enough to fit the cauliflower snugly, whisk the coconut milk together with the coriander, red pepper flakes and a generous pinch of salt. Submerge the steaks in the coconut milk marinade and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours. For the vinaigrette: Whisk together the lemon juice, mustard and vinegar in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Set aside. For the gremolata: Combine the parsley, lemon zest and garlic in a small bowl. Set aside. Finish the cauliflower: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the cauliflower steaks from the coconut milk marinade and arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Season with salt. Place in the oven and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Heat the broiler and place the cauliflower under the broiler for a few minutes, until the top chars. Transfer the steaks to a serving platter (or individual plates) and drizzle liberally with all of the vinaigrette. Top with all of the gremolata. Add a pinch more salt if desired.

Taste for seasoning and stir in the parsley. Reserve the remaining basil for serving. For the eggplant: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 15-by-10-by-2-inch flameproof baking dish and set aside. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or deep fryer to 365 degrees F. Combine the fontina and shredded mozzarella in a bowl and set aside. Combine the breadcrumbs and panko in a large shallow baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Place the flour in a medium shallow baking dish or large plate and season with salt and pepper. Whisk the egg and 2 tablespoons of water together in another medium shallow baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Season each eggplant slice on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge each eggplant slice in the flour, tapping off the excess, then dip it in the egg and dredge it in the breadcrumb mixture. Shake off any excess breading and transfer the eggplant to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining eggplant slices. Fry the eggplant slices in batches until tender and golden brown on each side and tender, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a baking sheet lined with paper towels and season with salt. Lay 8 slices of the fried eggplant in the prepared baking dish, top each slice with about 1/4 cup of the roasted red pepper tomato sauce, 1/4 cup of the combined cheeses and a tablespoon of the remaining chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper. Take 4 of the topped eggplant slices and place them on the other 4 so you have a total of 4 eggplant stacks. Top each stack with one more eggplant slice, 1/4 cup of the sauce, some of the basil and a few thin slices of the fresh mozzarella. Bake until the cheese melts, 8 to 10 minutes. Place under the broiler and broil until the fresh mozzarella is golden brown, about 30 seconds.

Season, to taste, with a couple pinches of salt. Sauce can be made ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to use. Bring to room temperature before using. Cut the brioche into about 1/3 to 1/2-inch thick slices and then use a small glass to cut out as many circles as possible, about 3 inches in diameter, from each slice. Place the bread \buns\ in an airtight container until ready to use so that they stay moist and soft. Make the burgers: Preheat the grill. Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and work together until they are fully incorporated. Using a small ice cream scoop, scoop the mixture into little balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches big and place them on a parchment paper-lined baking pan. Using your hands, flatten burgers to about 1/2-inch thick and just a couple inches in diameter. Once the grill is hot, place them on the grill and cook, about 2 to 3 minutes per side or until fully cooked through; cook time varies based on how hot your grill is. Place the cooked mini burgers on top of the cut brioche and add a piece of lettuce and a tomato slice.

Spoon leveled 1/3-cup portions of meringue onto the parchment, leaving ample space between each portion. Use a small offset spatula to smooth each portion of meringue into a 5-inch round.<br> Use a 3-tablespoon ice cream scoop to scoop 4 leveled mounds of meringue around the perimeter of each 5-inch round. Use the offset spatula to lightly smooth out the mounds so they touch each other and mimic the look of snow drifts. If needed, use the back of a spoon to create a large divot in the center of the meringue so there is enough room to pour in the creme anglaise later.<br> Fit a large pastry bag with a 1/4-inch round tip and scoop the remaining meringue into the bag.<br> Invert a second large baking sheet and top it with a piece of parchment. Spread out half of the black sanding sugar onto one corner of the parchment. Pipe one 2 1/2-inch-long by 1 1/2-inch-wide teardrop-shaped mound of meringue for the black swan&#39;s body, two 2-inch-long by 1-inch-wide teardrop-shaped mounds for the black swan&#39;s wings and one 3-inch S-shaped swan neck with head directly onto the black sanding sugar. Use a wooden toothpick to pull out the top of the head to create a beak. Sprinkle the meringue pieces with the remaining black sanding sugar. Use a pastry brush to brush away the excess sanding sugar, but reserve to use later. On the remainder of the parchment, pipe five 2 1/2-inch-long by 1 1/2-inch-wide teardrop-shaped mounds of meringue for the white swans&#39; bodies, ten 2-inch-long by 1-inch-wide teardrop-shaped mounds for the white swans&#39; wings and eight 3-inch S-shaped swan necks with heads (you will have extra heads/necks, in case of breakage). Again, use a wooden toothpick to pull out the top of each head to create a beak. These do not spread much while baking, but leave at least 1/4 inch of space between each piece of meringue.<br> Bake both baking sheets of meringue until dry and crisp, 3 to 4 hours. Cool completely on the baking sheets.<br> For the creme anglaise: Whisk together the milk, vanilla and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low.<br> Whisk together the granulated sugar and egg yolks in a medium bowl until well combined, then whisk in 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Slowly whisk in the remaining hot milk, then pour the mixture back into the saucepan and continue cooking at a slow simmer, whisking constantly, until the custard thickens to the consistency of thin gravy, 8 to 10 minutes. Strain the sauce into a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until completely chilled. For the whipped cream: Put the heavy cream in a medium bowl and whisk vigorously to stiff peaks. To assemble: Use a small offset spatula to gently loosen the meringue pieces from the parchment. Transfer the 6 lakes onto individual plates. Spoon 2 leveled tablespoons of the whipped cream onto each swan base. Gently insert a swan head/neck toward the tip of each base, then press 1 set of wings onto the sides of the whipped cream. Repeat this process to build 5 additional meringue swans. There should be 5 white swans and 1 black swan. For the black swan, sprinkle a thick layer of the excess black sanding sugar all over the whipped cream before inserting the head/neck and wings.<br> Pour the chilled creme anglaise into the center of each lake, then top each with a swan. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve immediately.<br> The meringues can be baked up to 1 day in advance (avoid baking in humid weather); keep them overnight in the oven with the oven turned off.

Separate the eggs, putting the whites in one large bowl and the yolks in another. Add the cream of tartar to the whites, and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, and gradually add 1/3 cup of the sugar. When all the sugar is in, turn the speed back up to medium-high and continue to beat until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 4 minutes. Add the remaining sugar and 1 tablespoon of the vanilla to the bowl with the yolks, and beat with the electric mixer until the mixture is pale yellow and very thick and a bit of the batter dropped on top of the rest sits there for a few seconds before sinking in, about 5 minutes. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt over the mixture, and fold until blended. Fold in about 1/3 of the whites until the batter has lightened in texture. Fold in the remaining whites in two additions until smooth and no streaks of white remain. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake until the cake is browned and the top springs back to the touch, about 35 minutes. Immediately turn the pan over onto a cooling rack, and let the cake cool completely in the pan. Run a thin spatula around the outside edge and the inside ring; gently working around the cake, pull with a spatula until it releases from the pan. Scrape out the crumbs from the bottom and sides of the pan (it doesn&#39;t have to be totally clean, but you don&#39;t want the crumbs to absorb the soaking milks), then put the cake back in the pan. Using a long skewer, poke holes all over the top of the cake (around 60 is good), going all the way to the bottom of the pan. Whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, cream and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla in a medium bowl. Slowly pour the mixture over the cake, letting it run down the sides of the cake, making sure the cake is well coated. (It may seem like a lot of liquid, but be sure to use it all so the cake is moist throughout.) Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. One hour before serving, remove the cake from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature to warm slightly. For the frosting: Meanwhile, bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Set a large stainless-steel bowl over it (do not let the bowl touch the water); add the sugar, egg whites, 1/4 cup cold water, vanilla, cream of tartar and salt, and whisk until the ingredients are combined. Then, with the bowl still over the simmering water, beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until thick, glossy, stiff peaks form, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat, and let stand a few minutes. To assemble: Run a thin spatula around the outer edge and the inside rim of the pan, gently pulling to release the cake. Turn it out onto a rimmed serving plate. Generously frost the top, the sides and the inside ring, using a small offset spatula or spoon. Microwave the dulce de leche in a small microwave-safe dish until it&#39;s loose enough to drizzle, about 8 seconds. Drizzle the cake with the dulce de leche, letting it gently drip down the sides. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23492,&quot;Maple Syrup Roasted Sweet Potato Pancakes with Citrus Brown Sugar Sauce 1 (8-ounce) sweet potato, peeled and quartered 3 ounces maple syrup 5 ounces bread flour 5 ounces cake flour 4 ounces granulated sugar 2 ounces light brown sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Salt 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 11 ounces whole milk 4 large eggs, separated 2 ounces unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 4 ounces unsalted butter 6 ounces light brown sugar Zest and juice of 1 lemon Zest and juice of 1 lime Zest and juice of 1 orange 2 ounces (1/4 cup) dark rum Instructions: For the pancake batter:<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

If you don&#39;t have a double boiler, improvise one by using a saucepan and a stainless steel bowl: Nestle the bowl into the saucepan, allowing a few inches of space to remain between the bottom of the bowl and the bottom of the saucepan. Keep an extra bowl of a similar size on hand to transfer the chocolate for cooling. Rest the chocolate thermometer on a towel. Line a baking sheet with foil. Pour a couple inches of water into the bottom half of the double boiler and heat over medium-low to just below a simmer. Put the chocolate in the top half of the double boiler and set over the hot water. Slowly melt the chocolate, stirring with a heat-resistant rubber spatula. As the chocolate melts, check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 82 and 86 degrees F. If it starts to rise above this temperature, quickly transfer the chocolate to the bowl on reserve and stir briskly to reduce heat. Return bowl to double boiler to maintain heat between 82 and 86 degrees F. Remove bowl from over the hot water just before all the chocolate melts. Stir vigorously until the chocolate melts completely. Check temperature again. Stir in the oil until evenly blended. Chocolate is now tempered and ready to use.

Simmer over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes until the mixture is reduced to a wet paste, about 2 tablespoons. Add the cream and continue to simmer until reduced again to about 2 tablespoons. Cream is added to make the sauce more stable and less likely to separate. Reduce the heat to low and remove the bay leaves. Whisk in the chunks of butter in small batches. The butter should melt without the sauce getting too hot, producing a creamy emulsified sauce. Do not let the sauce go over 130 degrees F, where it will separate. If the sauce starts to break, remove from heat, add 2 ice cubes and whisk until it cools down and comes back together. Season with salt and pepper, fold in the chives, and serve immediately. Keep covered in a warm place for a few hours, if needed. Serve with fish or vegetables. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23496,&quot;Chilaquiles 6 to 7 guajillo peppers or red New Mexican dried chilies About 2 tablespoons safflower or vegetable oil<br> 1 onion, chopped<br> 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped<br> Ten 6-inch corn tortillas<br> Naturally flavored neutral cooking spray<br> About 1/2 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika, pimenton<br> 1 scant teaspoon (1/3 palm full) oregano<br> 4 large cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1/2 cup water<br> 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock<br> 1 can (28 ounces) fire-roasted or diced tomatoes<br> About 2 teaspoons honey<br> 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder, optional<br> 1 small red onion<br> A handful cilantro<br> 3 to 4 radishes About 4 ounces cotija cheese or queso fresco<br> About 6 ounces Monterey Pepper Jack cheese<br> 4 pats butter, about 1 teaspoon each<br> 4 large eggs<br> Pickled sliced jalapeno peppers, mild or spicy<br> Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Pour the oil into a wide, shallowish frying pan, Dutch oven, or wok, and put it over medium heat. Add the anchovies and cook for about 3 minutes, pressing and pushing with a wooden spoon, until the anchovies have almost \melted. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes or jalapenos and cook, stirring, for another minute. This is probably the stage at which you will want to salt the boiling water and adding the spaghetti to cook, following the package instructions. Going back to the sauce, add the tomatoes, olives, and capers to the pot with the anchovies and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring every now and again, by which time it will have thickened slightly. Taste for seasoning. Just before the pasta is ready, remove and reserve about an espresso cupful of cooking water. When the pasta is cooked as desired, drain and add the spaghetti to the tomato sauce, adding a little reserved pasta water, if needed, to help amalgamate the sauce. Scatter with chopped parsley, if there&#39;s some to hand, and serve in slatternly style, preferably with an unfiltered cigarette clamped between crimson-painted lips. Make Ahead Note: The sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Transfer the sauce to a nonmetallic bowl to cool, then cover and refrigerate as soon as possible. Reheat gently in large saucepan, frying pan, or wok, stirring occasionally, until piping hot. Freeze Note: The cooled sauce can be frozen in a resealable container for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and reheat as above. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 23556,&quot;Apple Cranberry Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 4 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 14 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter, diced 1 large egg, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water 2 1/2 pounds baking apples like Golden Delicious, Cortland or Mutsu 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 cups (about 8 ounces) frozen cranberries, thawed and drained 3/4 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions: For the crust: Whisk the flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of cold butter. (If the butter gets too soft, refrigerate the mixture for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Use a fork to stir in the egg and water mixture until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more cold water.) Divide the dough into two equal-sized disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. For the filling: Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges and place in a bowl with the lemon juice and cranberries, tossing to combine. Add the sugar and toss again to combine evenly. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apple mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low, cooking until the apples soften and release most of their juices and the cranberries have burst, about 7 minutes. Strain the apple mixture into a colander set over the bowl, shaking it to collect as much of the juice as possible. Pour the liquid back into the skillet, add the cinnamon and ginger, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Return the reduced juice and the apple mixture to the bowl and toss to recombine. Chill the filling until it cools completely, at least an hour and up to 2 days. To assemble the pie: On a lightly floured surface, roll each disk into an 11- to 12-inch circle. Lay each dough circle between two pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Place a baking sheet on a rack positioned in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish with one of the dough discs and trim it to leave a 1/2-inch overhang on all sides. Stir the cornstarch into the filling and add it to the pan. Use a chef&#39;s knife, pizza cutter or fluted dough cutter to cut the second round into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lay strips of dough, evenly spaced, across the entire pie. Weave more strips of dough perpendicular through the previous strips to make a lattice or basket weave design across the entire pie. Trim the excess ends from the strips of dough. Pinch the bottom crust edge and lattice edge together, and flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes. If the edges begin to brown too fast, cover them with strips of aluminum foil. Let the pie cool 1 hour before serving. Once completely cooled, the pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23557,&quot;Pesto Pasta With Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Broccoli 1 lb. corkscrew pasta Kosher salt 4-oz. jar sun-dried tomato halves, drained and cut in 1/4\ slices<br> half a 16-oz. bag frozen broccoli florets 1 cup prepared basil pesto (recipe follows) 2 cloves garlic 1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted in a skillet until lightly browned 1/4 cup manchego cheese, cut in pieces 3 cups basil leaves, tightly packed 1/4 cup olive oil salt to taste Instructions: PASTA: Put broccoli in a microwave safe bowl with two tablespoons of water, cover loosely with plastic wrap and microwave until tender, about 4 minutes.

Line 2 (12-capacity) muffin pans with cupcake papers; set aside. In a large bowl, use a hand held electric mixer to beat together cake mix, chocolate milk, oil, and eggs on low speed for 30 seconds. Scrape sides of bowl with a rubber spatula and beat for 1 minute more on medium speed. Use a ladle to fill each lined cupcake cup 2/3 full. Use oven mitts to place cupcakes in preheated oven and bake for 21 to 26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcake comes out clean with no wet batter. Use oven mitts to remove from oven and let cool completely before filling and frosting, about 30 minutes. For filling combine pudding mix, milk, and peanut butter in a bowl. Whisk for 2 minutes until smooth and thickened. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Spoon filling into a pastry bag fitted with a medium plain tip. Fill cupcakes by inserting tip into tops of cupcakes and squeezing a couple of tablespoons of filling into each. Spread 2 tablespoons frosting on each cupcake top. Using red gel frosting, draw squiggly lines on the frosted cupcakes so that they look like veins. Place a plastic eyeball in the center of each cupcake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23561,&quot;Chicken Pot Pie with a Tater Tot Crust 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter 4 celery stalks, chopped<br> 3 carrots, chopped<br> 1 leek, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups chicken broth<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/2 cups frozen peas<br> 3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken meat One 2-pound bag frozen tater tots<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Place four 6-ounce ramekins in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Bring a kettle or saucepan with water to a boil. Bring the heavy cream to a light simmer over medium heat in a small saucepan. Whisk the sugar, salt and egg yolks in a large bowl or measuring cup. Slowly pour the hot cream into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly until it thickens. Stir in the vanilla extract. Pour or ladle the custard evenly into the ramekins. Carefully pour enough boiling water into the baking dish to come two-thirds of the way up the ramekins, making sure to keep the water out of the ramekins. Bake until the custard is set and firm when shaken, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the custards and let cool to room temperature on a rack, then chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour and up to overnight. For the berry coulis: Add the berries, sugar, lemon zest and juice and mint to a food processor and puree until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. When ready to serve, sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of sugar over a custard. Using a kitchen torch, caramelize the sugar by keeping the flame close to the sugar but moving it constantly to get an even color. Repeat with the remaining custards. Alternatively, sprinkle sugar over all the custards and place on a baking sheet under the broiler for 4 to 5 minutes, depending on your broiler. Serve immediately with the berry coulis, a few fresh berries and a sprig of mint on top! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23565,&quot;Lobster Salad on Crispy Baguettes 3 pounds cooked lobster meat, picked over for shells and chopped 1/2 cup celery, finely chopped 1/2 cup red onion, finely chopped 3/4 cup mayonnaise, light or regular 1/4 cup lemon zest Salt and pepper 1 fresh baguette, white or whole-wheat 1/2 cup olive oil 1 bunch fresh chervil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Whisk together the eggs with 1 tablespoon cold water in another medium bowl. Arrange the zucchini in a single layer on a baking sheet, flesh-side up, and sprinkle with salt. Submerge the zucchini wedges in the egg mixture. Remove the pieces one by one, shaking off the excess egg, then roll in the breadcrumbs, pressing well so they are coated on all sides and the breadcrumbs adhere. Arrange in a single layer on the same baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours. Fry the lemon and herbs: Pour the oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pot with a fitted lid and attach a deep-fry thermometer. Heat to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Drop the thin lemon rounds into the oil and fry until lightly browned and crisped, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove them with a slotted spoon and spread on one half of the lined baking sheet to cool. Raise the oil to 350 degrees F. Herbs tend to splatter when they hit hot oil, so have the fitted lid for the pot ready in one hand. Dry any excess moisture from the herbs, then drop the parsley and the basil in the oil with your other hand and immediately cover and fry until they turn darker green, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with the slotted spoon and spread on the other half of the baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat the same process with the oregano. Bring the oil back to 350 degrees F. Test the oil by dropping in one piece of zucchini. It should rise to the surface fairly quickly, begin to bubble and fry gradually. Line two baking sheets with kitchen towels. Drop half the zucchini into the oil and gently, slowly \swirl\ the oil with the slotted spoon as they fry so they cook evenly. Cook until light to medium brown, 2 to 3 minutes, then remove them slowly with the slotted spoon and lay them out on a kitchen towel to cool. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining zucchini. Layer the zucchini with the herbs and lemon slices on a large serving plate, and serve with the lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 23568,&quot;Apple Pie Shortbread Cookies 1 cup refrigerated apple cider 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 large egg yolk 2 teaspoons apple pie spice 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading and stamping Granulated sugar, for rolling 3/4 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar 1 tablespoon refrigerated apple cider 1 1/2 to 3 teaspoons warm water Instructions: Make the cookies: Bring the cider to a boil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook until syrupy and reduced to about 1 1/2 tablespoons, 12 to 14 minutes. Set aside until cooled slightly but still liquidy. Beat the butter, egg yolk, apple pie spice and salt in a large bowl with a wooden spoon until creamy and smooth. Mix in the reduced cider to combine, then mix in the confectioners\u2019 sugar. Add the flour and mix until most of the flour is absorbed and it\u2019s difficult to stir. Turn out the dough and any flour from the bowl onto a clean work surface. Gather and gently knead the dough a few times, dusting the dough and surface with flour as needed, until the dough comes together and is soft but not sticky. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 18 pieces (about 1 1/2 tablespoons each) and roll each into a ball. Place on the baking sheet and refrigerate until slightly firm but with some give for stamping, about 30 minutes. Put a few tablespoons of granulated sugar on a large plate. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, gently reroll the dough ball if misshapen, then place on the sugared plate. Sprinkle the top of the dough ball with sugar and then lightly dust with flour. Lightly dust a 3-inch cookie stamp with flour and press on the dough ball until the cookie is 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Lift the stamp to release the cookie; if it\u2019s stuck to the stamp, gently pull on an edge to release. Repeat with the remaining dough balls; arrange on 2 unlined baking sheets. Refrigerate the stamped cookies until firm, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350? F. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are firm around the edges and just beginning to lightly brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool a few minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Make the glaze: Mix the confectioners\u2019 sugar, apple cider and 1 1/2 teaspoons warm water in a medium bowl until smooth. Add more water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until the glaze is the consistency of heavy cream. Dip the stamped side of each cookie in the glaze, then let the excess drip off; return to the rack, glaze-side up. If the glaze is too thick and hides the stamp design, adjust the consistency with more water before continuing. Let stand at room temperature until set, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23569,&quot;Grilled Baby Lamb Chops with Crispy Rosemary 1/4 cup olive oil 4 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thin 4 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves 2 lemons, zested 8 single lamb chops Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat; add the sliced garlic and cook until it just begins to turn brown. Add the rosemary and continue cooking until rosemary is crispy and garlic is nicely brown. Let cool and stir in lemon zest. Prepare a hot grill. Season lamb chops with salt and pepper. Brush with oil of the marinade and grill to desired doneness; medium-rare is recommended.

(I happen to love brown sugar in my cooking, but you can decrease it or omit it if you like.) Cut 1 of the onions into quarters and put it in the food processor with the spices. Blend the ingredients until totally combined and then pour it over the pork shoulder. Now rub it into every nook and cranny of the meat, tucking it under folds and in crevices. Let no stone go unturned. Cut the remaining 3 onions into wedges and make a bed of onions in a large Dutch oven. Place the pork on the onions and add a couple of cups of water. Cover tightly and roast until fork-tender, 6 to 7 hours, turning every hour. Crank up the heat to 400 degrees F, remove the lid and roast skin-side up for another 15 to 20 minutes to get the skin crispy. Let the pork rest for 15 minutes before shredding. Shred the pork (2 forks work well) and put the meat into a pan or serving dish. Pour the juices and onions over the meat. Serve with lime wedges, sour cream, pico de gallo, tomatillo salsa ... whatever makes your skirt fly up! &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 23585,&quot;Bird&#39;s Nest Cookies 1 cup flaked coconut 3/4 cup butter, softened 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups M&amp;M&#39;S?

Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt and black pepper. Place the garlic cloves, bay leaves, and sprigs of thyme on each of 2 leg portions. Lay the remaining 2 leg portions, flesh to flesh, on top. Put the reserved fat from the chicken in the bottom of a glass or plastic container. Top with the sandwiched leg portions. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt. Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator. Remove the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and chicken fat and reserve. Rinse the chicken with cool water, rubbing off some of the salt and pepper. Pat dry with paper towels. Put the reserved garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and chicken fat in the bottom of an enameled cast iron pot. Sprinkle evenly with the peppercorns and salt. Lay the chicken on top, skin side down. Add the olive oil. Cover and bake for 12 to 14 hours, or until the meat pulls away from the bone. Remove the chicken from the fat. Strain the fat and reserve. Pick the meat from the bones and place it in a stoneware container. Cover the meat with some of the strained fat so that there is a 1/4-inch layer of fat on top. The chicken confit can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. The excess oil can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator and used like butter for cooking. The tinge of chicken taste in the oil is wonderful and I use the oil to roast potatoes, cook green beans, and pan-fry veal. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Gris, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 23587,&quot;Pineapple Upside-Down Cake Jars 1 stick plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 2 cups chopped fresh pineapple<br> 2 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2/3 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 large egg<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/3 cup whole milk<br> Cherry Glaze, for topping, recipe follows 1/2 cup cherry preserves 2 tablespoons pineapple juice<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Strain tea leaves and reduce to 3/4 cup. Grind spice to powder. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a large heat-proof mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Place the cream in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Warm just until bubbles form around the edge. Remove from heat and, whisking constantly, pour into the egg and sugar mixture. Add the spice powder and the reduced tea liquid. Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well combined. Pour the mixture through a very fine sieve into 6 flameproof creme brulee dishes, filling them only half full. Place the dishes into a shallow baking dish large to hold them without crowding. Place the dish on the middle rack oven. Working quickly to preserve the heat, finish filling the dishes with the custard mixture, making sure that it comes right to the top of each dish. Then carefully fill the baking dish with very hot tap water so it comes halfway up the sides of the filled dishes. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the custard is set in the center. Remove the custards to a wire rack to cool. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until ready to use. When ready to serve, preheat the broiler.

Cover with a piece of wax paper. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) until the onions are soft and translucent, 7 minutes in an 1,100-watt oven or 10 minutes in a 700-watt oven. (When removing the wax paper, be careful to avoid the hot steam.) If the onions are still a little raw, microwave again, covered, in 30-second increments. While the onions cook, toss the eggplant, zucchini and yellow squash slices with 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few turns of black pepper in a large bowl. Add the plum tomato slices, and gently toss. Alternating vegetables, shingle slices in a circular pattern over the cooked onions in the pie dish. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Cover with wax paper.

Line 12 (1/2-cup) muffin cups with paper liners. Whisk the flour with the cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Beat the butter with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium-high and gradually add the sugar. Beat until light and smooth, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low and beat in the whole eggs and yolk 1 at a time, incorporating each fully before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Bring water just to a boil in a small saucepan and remove from the heat. With the mixer at low speed, beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture in 4 additions. Drizzle in the hot water, about 2 tablespoons at a time, and mix briefly to make a smooth batter. Divide the batter among the muffin cups filling them 2/3 full. Bake until the centers of the cupcakes spring back when pressed gently, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the tin on a rack for 10 minutes then remove from the tin and cool completely before frosting. For the frosting: Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring cream to a boil. Pour cream over chocolate and shake the bowl gently so cream settles around the chocolate. Set mixture aside until the chocolate is soft, about 5 minutes. Whisk gently until smooth, taking care not to incorporate too many air bubbles. Stir in 1 of the flavorings, if desired. Dip the tops of the cooled cupcakes into the frosting. (Frosting can also be chilled and whipped, then piped or spread onto the cupcakes.) Set them upright and let stand 1 or 2 minutes, until frosting is slightly set, then decorate with fresh berries, candies, or chopped pistachios, if desired. Let cakes stand on rack until frosting is completely set. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 23624,&quot;Knead Not Sourdough 17 1/2 ounces bread flour, plus extra for shaping 1/4 teaspoon active-dry yeast 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 12 ounces filtered water 2 tablespoons cornmeal Instructions: Whisk together the flour, yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the water and stir until combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature for 19 hours. After 19 hours, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Punch down the dough and turn it over onto itself a couple of times. Cover with a tea towel and allow to rest 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, shape the dough into a ball. Coat hands with flour, if needed, to prevent sticking. Sprinkle the tea towel with half of the cornmeal and lay the dough on top of it, with the seam side down. Sprinkle the top of the dough with the other half of the cornmeal and cover with the towel. Allow to rise for another 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size. Oven baking: While the dough is rising the second time, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a 4 to 5-quart Dutch oven in the oven while it preheats. Once the dough is ready, carefully transfer it to the pre-heated Dutch oven. Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 210 to 212 degrees F, another 15 minutes. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and allow to cool at least 15 minutes before serving. Outdoor coals: Heat charcoal in a chimney starter until ash covers all of the coals. Place 20 to 24 coals on a Dutch oven table. Place a cooling rack (or other wire rack that is at least 2-inches high) directly over the coals. Set a 5-quart Dutch oven on top of this rack and allow to preheat during the last 30 minutes of the second rise. Carefully transfer the dough to the Dutch oven and cover with the lid. Place 20 coals on top. Bake until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 210 to 212 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and allow to cool at least 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23625,&quot;White Beans and Kale 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 bunch Tuscan kale, tough stems discarded, thinly sliced (about 8 cups) One 15-ounce can cannellini beans, undrained 2 strips lemon zest, removed with a vegetable peeler Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives Lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the tomatoes in a single layer on it. Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake until the tomatoes have decreased in size and look slightly dry, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Raise the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Grease a bundt pan with cooking spray. Arrange the dough in the prepared pan so the ends touch each other, then pinch the ends together so the dough makes one large ring. Using a knife, make a few slices in the top of the dough. Bake until the bread is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 200 degrees F, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then remove the bread to a wire rack to cool completely. To set up the 3-step breading process, gather 3 medium shallow bowls or plates. In the first, add the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. In the second, add the eggs and 2 tablespoons of water and whisk well. In the third, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan and oregano and stir to combine. Pat the eggplant dry with paper towels. Dredge one round in the flour, shaking off any excess. Now, using your other hand (keeping one hand dry and one hand wet), dip into the egg mixture to coat completely. Finally, dredge in the breadcrumb mixture and coat completely. Set on a parchment-lined baking sheet and repeat the process with the remaining eggplant. Add 1/2 inch of vegetable oil to a 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet, set over medium-high heat and heat to 375 degrees F. In batches, fry the eggplant until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to dry. Slice the bread ring horizontally to build your giant sandwich. Layer on the mozzarella, pepperoni, eggplant, roasted red pepper, oven-roasted tomatoes and banana peppers. Carefully slice the sandwich into 8 pieces and enjoy!

Slowly beat the hot milk into the eggs in a medium mixing bowl. Pour the entire mixture back into the pan and place over low heat. Stir constantly with a whisk or wooden spoon until the custard thickens slightly. Be careful not to let the mixture boil or the eggs will scramble. Remove from the heat and pour the hot custard through a strainer into a large clean bowl to cool slightly, then stir in the sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon rose water. Cover and refrigerate until cold or overnight. Stir the chilled custard, then freeze in 1 or 2 batches in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Add 2 tablespoons crushed candied rose petals to the machine when the ice cream is semi-frozen. Allow the machine to mix in the flowers. When finished, the ice cream will be soft but ready to eat.

As soon as the water boils, remove from the heat and let the pot stand for 5 minutes, then remove the fish with a skimmer and lay it on absorbent paper to drain and cool. When the baccala is cool enough to handle, remove all the bones, a necessarily manual operation. Do not remove the skin, however. Put the milk in a pan over low heat, and heat it until it is hot, taking care not to boil or burn it. Meanwhile, crumble the baccala by hand and put it in a bowl. Use a pestle to pulverize the fish, stopping every now and then to whisk in, alternately, trickles of oil and hot milk. Go back and forth between using the pestle and whisk. Continue to beat tirelessly; the process should take about 15 minutes. Salt is not normally necessary, but do add some black pepper. If the mixture gets too cold to mix well during the mashing, reheat it in a bain-marie until it is sufficiently malleable. You should also reheat it until it&#39;s warm when you are about to serve it. Accompany it with croutons of fried white bread or fried polenta. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Priorat]&quot; 23637,&quot;Rainbow Sodas 3 cups sugar 3 cups water 2 cups watermelon cubes 1 cup blackberries and blueberries<br> 1 cup raspberries and strawberries<br> Club soda or sparkling water, for serving Instructions: Combine 1 cup of the sugar, 1 cup water and the watermelon in a small saucepan.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat. Add the sausages and saute until golden brown, breaking the sausage into pieces, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan over medium heat. Add the spinach and cook until the spinach wilts and the juices evaporate, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Squeeze the spinach to drain as much liquid as possible. Into a large bowl, add egg yolks and beat lightly. Stir in the ricotta, mozzarella, and 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese. Add the sausage, the spinach and prosciutto to the mixture and stir to combine. Roll out larger piece of dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 17-inch round. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch springform pan. Trim the dough overhang to 1 inch. Spoon the ricotta mixture into the dough-lined pan. Roll out the remaining piece of dough into a 12-inch round. Place the dough over the filling. Pinch the edges of the doughs together to seal, then crimp the dough edges decoratively. Brush the beaten 1 large egg over the entire pastry top. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan over the top. Bake on the bottom shelf until the crust is golden brown, about 1 hour. Let stand 15 minutes. Release the pan sides and transfer the pizza to a platter. Cut into wedges and serve. Blend the flour, the butter, the shortening and salt in a food processor until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in the eggs. With the machine running, add the water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough forms. Gather the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 2 pieces, with 1 piece twice as large as the second piece. Flatten the dough pieces into disks. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to roll out, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 23678,&quot;Spaghetti and Turkey Meatballs 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 5 cloves garlic (4 smashed, 1 minced) 1 28-ounce can plum tomatoes, crushed by hand 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves 1 small piece parmesan rind (optional) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3/4 pound 93% lean ground turkey 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for topping 1 slice stale whole-wheat bread, crust trimmed, bread chopped 1/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping 1 large egg white, lightly beaten 12 ounces whole-wheat spaghetti Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

(Make sure to wash your hands after you handle raw poultry.) Mix the balsamic and the rosemary and pour over the chickens. Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, remove the chicken and discard the balsamic. In a clean bowl, toss the chicken with the buttermilk. Remove the chicken pieces, reserving the buttermilk. Pour Arborio Rice Coating into a large plastic bag or container. Add the chicken in batches, shaking to coat. Put chicken back in buttermilk, adding more buttermilk if necessary to coat all the pieces. Dip the chicken pieces in the rice mixture to dredge them, then carefully dip them in the buttermilk again, and then dip a second time in the rice mixture. Pat well to remove excess flour. Refrigerate coated chicken for at least 1 hour to allow coating to adhere to flesh of the chicken. Heat about 2 inches of peanut oil in a heavy skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat to 335 degrees F. Slip some of the chicken pieces skin side down into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd; fry in batches (or 2 separate skillets) if necessary. Cook until chicken is cooked through and golden brown, about 10 to15 minutes per side. Drain thoroughly on a wire rack or crumpled paper towels and serve. Can be eaten hot, cold, or at room temperature. Put the rice in a blender and grind until very fine. Shake out into a large bowl and add the semolina, flour, salt, and pepper. Toss until well blended. Store in a sealed container in the freezer to maintain maximum freshness. Chef&#39;s Note: This is one place I do use table salt. In general I prefer kosher salt and gray salt, but kosher salt is too heavy and will not stay distributed throughout the coating.

In a large measuring cup, combine the water, milk, melted butter, sugar and salt. Slowly add the liquid to the flour mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Stir vigorously until the mixture is smooth. (The dough should be loose and sticky, not runny.) Cover and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes or until doubled in volume. Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat; spray liberally with nonstick spray. Place six 4-inch tart rings on the griddle; spray the inside of each ring liberally (see Cook&#39;s Note). Using a large cookie scoop or 1/2 cup measuring cup sprayed with nonstick spray, fill the rings halfway with batter. (I spray my fingers and use them to push the batter to the edge of the rings, since it doesn&#39;t spread as easily as, say, pancake batter.) Griddle the muffins for ten minutes. Flip the muffins, using tongs or a spatula, and griddle for another 10 minutes. (I find that the griddle oil starts to blacken at this point, and if I&#39;m feeling like a perfectionist, I&#39;ll remove the muffins to a cooling rack, wipe down the griddle, and respray it to keep the muffins from getting too dark on the reverse side.) For the hollandaise: Place the egg yolks, lemon juice, and a pinch each of salt and white pepper in a blender; blend until combined. With the blender running, slowly pour in the melted butter. Blend until emulsified, about 30 seconds. For the poached eggs: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add 1 tablespoon water to 6 cups of a standard muffin pan, then crack an egg into each cup. Bake for 11 minutes for a soft yolk; the exact time will vary depending on your oven and preferred level of doneness. To assemble: Slice an English muffin in half. Top with a slice of tomato and a strip of bacon. Using a rubber spatula, slide a poached egg from the muffin pan and place it on top of the bacon. Drizzle with hollandaise sauce, and serve with the top half of the muffin on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 23691,&quot;Homemade Italian Sausage 5 pounds pork shoulder 1 cup cold water 2 tablespoons salt 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 2 tablespoons fennel seeds 1/2 cup grated pecorino romano cheese 1/2 cup chopped parsley 1/2 pound hog sausage casing Instructions: Trim the meat of all gristle but remember to not trim too much fat as the mixture should be approximately 80 percent lean to 20 percent fat. Cut the meat into chunks and pass through a meat grinder using the largest die. Pass the meat through again, this time using the medium die. Pass the sausage meat through one more time on this medium die. In a large bowl mix the ground meat with the water, salt, pepper, fennel seed, cheese and parsley. Wash the casing well under cold running water and allow water to run through the casing so that any holes may be detected. Fit the grinder with the sausage stuffing attachment and place the casing over the stuffing tube by feeding it on and bunching it up on the tube.. Place the meat in the hopper on top and begin to push the sausage meat down into the hopper so that it begins to feed into the casing. As the meat feeds into the casing, allow the casing to slide into your open hand. Catch the stuffed sausage as it comes out of the machine. Go at a slow and steady pace so that the sausage is fully, evenly, stuffed and without air pockets. To make individual links, twist the sausage every few inches as it is stuffed and let the finished ring of sausage lay on the work space as you finish the process. Continue until the meat is finished.

Make the glaze: In a small bowl, stir the ingredients together until smooth, adding lemon juice as needed until the glaze is pour-able. Set the wire rack holding the cake on a sheet pan. Drizzle the glaze generously over the top of the cake, letting it trickle down the sides. Using a flexible spatula or pastry brush, gently spread the glaze over the sides of the cake, reusing any glaze that drips onto the baking sheet. Let set for at least 30 minutes before serving, or until the glaze is hardened. Transfer the cake to a serving platter, removing the pan bottom and parchment paper if desired. In a medium saucepan, bring the jam and water to a boil, stirring to break up any lumps. Working quickly, add the strawberries all at once and fold together with a spatula until evenly coated. Pour into the sunken center of the cake and gently spread into a circle on the surface, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border all around. Let cool until set, about 30 minutes. Use a very sharp knife for slicing the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 23699,&quot;Fresh Cranberry Cosmo 1 ounce vodka 2 1/2 ounces Cranberry Granita, recipe follows 1/2 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice 2 cups water 5 1/2 ounces cranberries, approximately 1 1/2 cups, washed and sorted 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon lime zest Instructions: Place all of the ingredients into a cocktail shaker and shake until the granita melts completely.

Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods. Sterilizing Tips: Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed. To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes. Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes. As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands. After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 23705,&quot;Roasted Root Vegetables With Garlic 20 cloves garlic, peeled 12 fingerling potatoes, washed and cut into chunks<br> 12 whole shallots, peeled<br> 8 small turnips, washed<br> 2 whole rutabaga, washed and cut into chunks<br> Olive oil, for drizzling Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Mix in the yeast and the 1 tablespoon sugar. Set the yeast aside for 10 minutes until bubbling. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the flour, remaining 1/3 cup (67 g) sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, salt, and allspice. Grate the zest of the orange into the stand mixer bowl, then juice the orange into a measuring cup to measure out 1/4 cup (59 g) of orange juice. If the orange doesn\u2019t have enough juice, simply add a bit of water until it meets 1/4 cup. Fit the stand mixer with the dough hook. Pour the yeast mixture into the bowl, turn the speed to low, and pour in the orange juice. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the softened butter and let knead until the dough starts to come together into a ball, about 2 minutes, then gradually bump the speed up to medium and let knead for a final 4 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic and let the dough rest in a dark and warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Line two 13 x 18-inch (33 x 45 cm) half-sheet pans with parchment paper. Punch the dough down and let it rest for 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions (about 115 g each), and form into balls. Evenly space 6 of the balls on one baking sheet, then use your palm to flatten them. To form the crossbones, take the remaining 2 portions of dough and divide each one into 3 portions (about 39 g each), for a total of 6 small portions. You\u2019ll be using each portion to form the crossbones. For each skull and crossbone set, use one of the small dough portions. Pull off 5 grams of the dough and roll it into a smooth ball (the \u201cskull\u201d) and place it on the empty lined sheet pan. Divide the remaining 34 grams of dough in two and roll each piece into a 6-inch (15 cm) snake with your hands. Lay a snake on the work surface, spread open your fingers, and roll with your fingertips so that some parts of the snake are lower than the others, to create a bone shape. Repeat this process with the remaining dough until you have six small balls and a set of crossbones for each roll. Place the skull and crossbone sets on the second baking sheet, lightly spritz two large pieces of plastic wrap with nonstick cooking spray, then loosely cover each baking sheet and place both baking sheets in a dark warm place to rise for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Brush the risen rolls with the egg wash, then gently take the crossbones and crisscross them on top of each roll, gently brushing each piece with egg wash to hold them all together. Then place the little ball that represents the skull on top of the crossbones, making sure it\u2019s in the center of the crisscrossed bones. Bake until lightly golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the sugar and cinnamon. Transfer the baked rolls to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Brush each roll with melted butter, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and tap off any excess. Serve the rolls warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23733,&quot;Citrus Vanilla Panna Cotta on Oat Granola Base with Dried Fruit and Apple Compote 1/2 vanilla bean 1/4 cup sugar 3/4 cup 2 percent milk 1/2 lemon, zested 1/2 navel orange, zested 1 1/2 sheets gelatin 2 cups cold water 5 ounces natural dairy base product (recommended: QimiQ) 2 gelatin sheets 1/2 cup orange juice 1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled Lemon juice<br> 1/4 cup Simple Syrup, recipe follows 2 cups apple cider 2 cups cranberry juice 3/4 cup oats 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 1 tablespoon bread flour<br> 1 tablespoon applesauce<br> 1 tablespoon light brown sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons Granny Smith apple concasse (see method below) 1/4 cup apple cider<br> 1 navel orange, juiced<br> 1/2 teaspoon honey<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon raisins, cut into 1/4-inch dice if needed<br> 1 tablespoon dried cranberries, cut into 1/4-inch dice if needed<br> Kosher salt 6 ounces dark chocolate couverture 3/4 cup reserved simple syrup 1 teaspoon light corn syrup 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup water Instructions: Scrape the pods from half of the vanilla bean into the sugar and mix the vanilla in with the sugar to help remove any lumps and to evenly distribute the vanilla. Combine milk, vanilla sugar, and both zests in a small saucepan. Scald mixture over medium heat, cover, and let infuse for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bloom gelatin in water. Whisk dairy base in a medium mixing bowl until smooth. Remove gelatin sheets from water, reserving the water, squeeze out all excess liquid, and stir into milk mixture. Strain milk mixture into dairy base and stir until no lumps appear, being careful not to create air bubbles. Using a ladle, fill 4 individual flex pan molds about 3/4 of the way full. Cover and refrigerate until set. Bloom gelatin in reserved water. In a small saucepan, bring orange juice to a boil then remove it from the heat. Remove gelatin sheets from water and squeeze out excess liquid. Stir into the hot orange juice. Cool orange juice mixture to about room temperature. Once cooled, ladle on top of set panna cotta to fill the flex molds all the way. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.<br> Using a sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut 4 (1/16-inch thick) slices from the middle of the apple, ensuring slices are even in thickness and are large enough to accommodate a leaf cutter; pieces on outer edges of apple (which will not accommodate cutter) must be reserved in lemon juice for further use in apple raisin cranberry compote. Using a leaf cutter, center the cutter on each apple slice and press firmly to ensure sharp cutout. Dip cutout apple leaf in simple syrup and place dipped cutout onto a silicone baking mat. Bake for approximately 30 to 45 minutes until golden brown (to insure even cooking, rotate pan as needed). Heat apple cider in a saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. Cool and transfer to a squeeze bottle. Heat cranberry juice in a saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. Cool and transfer to a squeeze bottle. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Toast oats on a baking sheet in the oven until slightly brown. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Combine remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add toasted oats to mixture and blend well. Press oat mixture into fluted molds (about same size as panna cotta molds) and bake for approximately 5 minutes until browning occurs. Let rest a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes and then transfer for use as base in assembling dessert. Using a chef&#39;s knife, cut reserved, already peeled apple into precise 1/4-inch dice, avoiding any peelings, core, or seeds. Reserve. In small saute pan, combine cider, orange juice, honey, and cinnamon. Over medium-high heat, bring mixture to a boil and reduce by half. Add the reserved diced apples, raisins, and cranberries. Bring compote to a simmer and cook until apples are tender. Adjust seasoning with salt, to taste. Using bain-marie set-up, slowly heat 4 ounces chocolate until melted smooth. Using seeding method, add remaining chocolate and stir until smooth. Make a parchment piping bag. Fill piping bag 3/4 full with chocolate, folding opening to avoid spilling. Cut a small opening at the tip of the piping bag. Pipe a triangular shape onto a clean, dry, dessert plate, being sure to start and end where panna cotta will rest. Pipe second line, interweaving between first line. Once chocolate cools, carefully fill with apple cider reduction and cranberry reduction, alternating sauces. Repeat process for remaining 3 plates. If any undesired results occur, wash and dry plate, and repeat process. Simmer both ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until slightly golden brown and caramelized. Remove from heat and cool until slightly thickened.<br> Using a large spoon, drizzle even lines onto a silicone baking mat. While caramel lines are still warm, mold around handle of wooden spoon, into even spirals. Let cool, and remove from spoon. Using kitchen shears, cut spiral to desired length ensuring clean edges. Repeat the above steps until you have 4 uniform spirals. To serve: Carefully pipe the chocolate onto the plate in a ribbon design (start the piping at the 10 o&#39;clock position). Place the granola base onto the plate in the 10 o&#39;clock position covering the starting point of the chocolate. Dip a round cutter into warm water and use it to cut out the panna cottas, making sure not to break them. Once they are cut, unmold them from the flex pans and place on top of the granola base with orange side down. Top the panna cotta with about 1 tablespoon of the fruit compote. Using squeeze bottles with very thin tips, pipe sauces into piped ribbon, alternating sauces. Lastly garnish the panna cotta with the sugar spirals. Stick it straight through the compote and into the top of the panna cotta, being careful not to break the sugar. Rest apple chip upright against panna cotta and serve. Place sugar and water in saucepan. Over medium-high heat, bring to boil. Remove from heat when boiling. Use 1/4 cup for apple chip production.

Roll 1 sheet of pie dough out on a lightly floured work surface into an 8 3/4-by-12 3/4-inch rectangle, trimming and squaring off the edges as needed. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and prick all over with a fork. Top with another layer of parchment and another baking sheet; this will keep the dough from rising when baking. Bake until the dough is just starting to brown and cook through, 10 to 14 minutes. Remove the top baking sheet and parchment, then continue to bake the crust until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with the remaining 2 pieces of pie dough.<br> For the pecan pie layer: Meanwhile, whisk together the brown sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla, salt and eggs in a large bowl until smooth and combined, then stir in the chopped pecans.

Add 1 tablespoon of the garlic and 1 tablespoon of the ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the 1/4 cup of sliced scallions and the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low so that the broth just simmers. Allow broth to simmer for at least 20 to 30 minutes while the wontons are being assembled. In a small mixing bowl combine the remaining teaspoon of minced garlic, remaining tablespoon of chopped ginger, 3 tablespoons of finely chopped scallions, the pork, egg yolk, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil and crushed red pepper. Mix until thoroughly combined. Working on a flat work surface, lay out a few of the wontons. (Keep remaining wonton wrappers covered with plastic wrap.) Fill a small bowl partially with cool water and set aside. Using a teaspoon measure, place a heaping teaspoonful of the meat filling in the center of each wonton. Using your fingers, lightly wet the edges of the wonton. Bring 2 opposite corners of the wonton together to form a triangle and enclose the filling, pressing edges firmly around the mound of filling to eliminate any air pockets and seal. Moisten opposite corners of the long side. Curl moistened corners toward each other, overlapping one on top of the other, and press the edges together to seal. You should now have a rounded stuffed wonton with a triangle poking up at the top. Assemble the remaining wontons in the same manner. When the wontons are all assembled, set aside. Add the sliced bok choy, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots to the broth and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Using your hands or a slotted spoon, gently add the prepared wontons to the simmering broth. Increase the heat slightly so that the broth returns to a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally (very gently), until the wontons float and the pork filling is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
