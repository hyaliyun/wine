Now place the pan on high heat. Once it comes to a boil, drain. Put the fruit in a bowl of ice water and allow to cool. Now remove the fruit from the ice water and set it aside on a towel. Place the fruit on a cutting board and trim off both ends of the fruit. In a small saucepan mix together the sugar and orange juice. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Lower the heat to a simmer. Skim as necessary and add the fruit. Simmer 50-60 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure the fruit is not sticking to the bottom. Take the fruit out and separate on a plate lined with parchment paper. Reserve and use as desired For the graham cracker/nut pie crust: Combine all of the above ingredients together in a bowl.

Cook the potatoes in a large pot of well-salted boiling water for 10 minutes (the potatoes will not be cooked through). Mix the butter with the olive oil, cilantro, chipotle powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Drain the potatoes and toss with the chipotle oil mixture. Transfer the potatoes to the grill. Grill the potatoes, covered, turning once or twice until tender, about 5 minutes total. Return the potatoes to the bowl and toss again with the chipotle oil mixture. Season with the 1 tablespoon salt and pepper. Serve warm. Cook&#39;s Note: If you are using an outdoor grill, try use larger-size potatoes so they don&#39;t fall through the grill grate. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 18704,&quot;Chocolate-Orange Martini 1 tablespoon finely grated orange chocolate 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 2 orange slices<br> 1/2 cup premium chocolate ice cream, such as Haagen Dazs, at room temperature for 5 minutes 1 ounce orange vodka<br> Instructions: Gently stir together the chocolate and sugar and put it on a plate.

Place the peppers on the grill until the skins are charred then, using tongs, transfer them to a plastic bag to rest and peel them when cool. Place the whole fillet on a utility platter, brush with melted butter, and season with salt and pepper. Sear filet on all sides on hot part of the grill. Move to indirect for medium rare. Alternatively you can sear the fillet in a pan with oven safe handles and transfer pan to a preheated 425 degree F oven for about 30 minutes to reach the same internal temperature. Allow meat to rest before slicing. (On the episode we skewered the beef tenderloins on the sterilized shafts of old golf clubs, grilled them on the skewer, and sliced servings right off the skewer. If you have a rotisserie skewer, you can do something similar.) In the blender, combine the peeled peppers with the scallions, garlic, cilantro, and lime juice. Blend these until a smooth consistency is achieved then, with the blender running, pour the olive oil in a thin stream through the feed opening. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Slice bread in half lengthwise, brush with oil, and season with garlic powder. Grill briefly, cut side down.

Set aside to cool. In a big bowl, combine the crabmeat, 3 tablespoons of the mayonnaise, herbs, bread crumbs, and the cooled Sauteed mixture. Mix well. If it seems dry, add more mayonnaise. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Make balls from crab mix into 8 equal portions. Pat each into a disk. Chill again until ready to cook. Preheat grill for 20 minutes before you need to cook vegetables. Prep all the vegetables then toss in olive oil, salt, and pepper in separate bowls. Grill them over medium high heat until they are tender but not mushy, about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the heat of the grill. As they come off grill, toss them in a bit more olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Serve warm or at room temperature. Fry the crab cakes over medium high heat in olive oil until golden brown. Serve with the grilled vegetables and Saffron Aioli. Use garlic that is fresh and firm. If garlic has sprouted, split the cloves and remove green germ. In food processor, puree garlic until chopped fine. Season with salt and pepper and add the saffron and egg yolks. With motor running slowly, add the olive oil in a thin steady stream. When it is done, it should be like a thick mayonnaise. Add lemon juice and cayenne and taste for seasoning. Alternatively, you can make the aioli in a mortar and pestle, which is the traditional way.

Pulse in the butter until it turns to loose crumbs. (Do not overmix.) Add 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water through the top and pulse until the dough comes together and forms a loose ball, adding additional ice water as needed. Remove the dough and form it into a disc. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. For the batter: Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot and begins to smoke lightly, add the asparagus and cook over high heat until the excess water is cooked out and the stems are softened slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt. Remove from the skillet and arrange in a single layer on a kitchen towel to drain and cool. Place a baking sheet in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch pie dish with butter or nonstick cooking spray. Turn the dough onto a floured surface. Roll the dough into an 11- to 12-inch round. Roll the dough up around the rolling pin and roll it back over the pie dish. Press it gently into the bottom and up the sides. (Ideally, there should be about an inch of excess dough hanging over the sides.) Pinch the dough up to create a crimped top edge. Line the dough with a piece of parchment paper, then fill it with pie weights or dry beans and bake until light brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and cool at least 15 minutes. Whisk the cream cheese with the eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk in the heavy cream, Worcestershire, hot sauce, nutmeg and black pepper to taste.

Add water to cover and bring to a simmer. Cook until tender, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Add red chili powder and salt, to taste. Gradually add white cornmeal and stir, until filling is about the same consistency as \runny oatmeal.\ Remove from the heat and let sit while you make the masa. Mix the cornmeal and baking powder in a large bowl. Add the water and oil and mix. Masa must be a bit thicker than a pancake batter. Add small amounts of additional water and blue corn meal to achieve needed consistency. To assemble, lay corn husk out flat. Place masa inside middle of corn husk about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick. (depending upon amount of filling used). Leave outer edges uncovered about 1-inch on each side. Place filling in center of Masa and fold in each side. Next fold the bottom upward. Place tamale in 2nd corn husk and repeat with tamale in opposite direction of first husk. Fold and tie with small strips of corn husks. Place in boiling water for 60 to 90 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 18730,&quot;Linguine with Caramelized Onions and Anchovies 1/4 cup, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided 1 pound dried linguine 1/3 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 8 cups thinly sliced onions 2 tablespoons thinly sliced garlic 2 (2-ounce) cans flat anchovy fillets (not packed in salt variety), well drained 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1/2 cup lightly toasted bread crumbs Instructions: Set a large, 1-gallon stock pot with a pasta insert 3/4 full with water over high heat and bring to a boil. Add 1/4 cup of the salt to the water as it boils. Place the linguine in the salted water and return to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook the pasta until nearly al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and set aside, reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. While the pasta cooks, set a 14-inch saute pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil and butter to the pan and, once the butter melts, add the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened and caramelized, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the garlic and anchovies to the pan, stirring until fragrant and the anchovies have melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the drained pasta and the reserved pasta cooking water to the pan and season with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, pepper, and parsley. Cook, tossing to combine, until the pasta is heated through and the water is nearly evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, sprinkle with the toasted bread crumbs and toss to combine. Serve while hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]</p><p>&quot; 18731,&quot;Corn and Black-Eyed Pea Salad 1 (15-ounce) can black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained 1(16-ounce) bag frozen pepper stir fry, thawed and chopped (recommended: Bird&#39;s Eye) 2 cups frozen corn kernels, thawed 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon hot sauce 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning 1/3 cup honey mustard dressing Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the black-eyed peas, pepper stir fry, corn, garlic, hot sauce, Cajun seasoning and honey mustard dressing.

Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Put a rack as close to the bottom as possible, and put a pizza stone on the rack. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a very thin round. Sprinkle some corn meal onto the pizza peel. Transfer the dough to the pizza peel. Drizzle some olive oil over the dough, and season with salt and pepper. Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone and bake until the bottom is crisp and the edges browned, about 10 minutes. While the pizza dough cooks, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the canola oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and sugar and cook slowly until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; set aside. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and slowly cook until the fat is rendered and the bacon is golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Reserve the bacon fat in a small bowl. Remove the pizza dough from the oven. Top it with the Cheddar, cooked bacon and the onions, and return it to the oven to melt the cheese and finish cooking the dough, about 5 minutes. While the pizza finishes cooking, pour 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat into a medium nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter. Add the cl and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Whisk the eggs together in a bowl until very smooth, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into the pan and stir constantly with a rubber spatula until soft curds form, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the goat cheese pieces and remove from the heat. Remove the pizza from the oven to a cutting board. Top with the scrambled eggs. Drizzle some of the herbed creme fraiche over the eggs, and scatter the remaining herbs over the top. Slice and serve. (You can also slice the pizza into wedges, plate them, and top each serving.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 18733,&quot;Espresso Brownies Nonstick vegetable oil cooking spray 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons water 1/3 cup vegetable oil 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons espresso powder 1 (19.8-ounce) box brownie mix (recommended: Duncan Hines) 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with nonstick spray. Whisk 1/3 cup of water, oil, eggs, and 2 tablespoons espresso powder in a large bowl to blend. Add the brownie mix. Stir until well blended. Stir in the chocolate chips. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 35 minutes. Cool completely. Meanwhile, dissolve the remaining 2 teaspoons of espresso powder in the remaining 2 tablespoons of water in a medium bowl. Whisk in the vanilla. Add the powdered sugar and butter and whisk until smooth. Pour the glaze over the brownies. Refrigerate until the glaze is set. Cut into bite-size pieces. Arrange the brownies on a platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 18734,&quot;Spinach Tofu Soup 1 whole chicken 12 cups water 16 ounces tofu, cubed 1 bunch spinach, de-stemmed and cleaned 1/2 cup diced Virginia ham, pre-cooked White pepper, to taste Instructions: Cook entire chicken in simmering water for 8 hours. While cooking, add water to keep chicken covered. Remove chicken, leaving only the chicken stock. Add a pinch of salt. Bring chicken stock to a boil and add spinach. Turn heat off as soon as spinach is added. Add tofu, Virginia ham, and pinch of white pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18735,&quot;Three-Cheese Bacon Pizza 1 pound prepared pizza dough, at room temperature All-purpose flour, for dusting 4 slices bacon, chopped 1 8-ounce can tomato sauce 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic, grated 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (about 4 ounces) 1 cup shredded white cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces) 1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Put a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 475 degrees F for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the dough into a 9-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Lightly dust a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet with flour; lay the round of dough on top and set aside. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring, until crisp, about 6 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Combine the tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic and oregano in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Slide the dough directly onto the hot stone or baking sheet and bake until lightly golden and puffy, about 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly, then carefully slice the crust in half horizontally with a serrated knife to make 2 thin crusts. Turn the crusts cut-side up. Spread with the sauce mixture, then top evenly with the mozzarella, cheddar and bacon. Slide the pizzas back onto the hot stone or baking sheet; bake until the cheese melts and the crust is golden, about 8 more minutes. Sprinkle with the parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 18736,&quot;Roasted Chicken Thighs with Root Vegetables 8 small skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 3/4 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 rutabaga (about 1 pound) 1 turnip (about 8 ounces) 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 3 tablespoons country Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons horseradish 1/4 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450?. Generously season the chicken thighs on both sides with salt and pepper. Place skin-side down in a large ovenproof nonstick skillet and set over medium-high heat. Cook until the skin is very golden, about 10 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate. Meanwhile, peel the rutabaga and turnip, cut in half and thinly slice. Arrange about half of the vegetables in the drippings in the skillet, going around in concentric circles and overlapping slightly to make an even layer. Sprinkle with half each of the parmesan and rosemary and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Repeat with the remaining vegetables, parmesan and rosemary; season with salt and pepper. Pour the chicken broth over the vegetables and cook until the broth is bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the chicken skin-side up on top of the vegetables. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the mustard and horseradish in a small bowl. Serve the chicken and vegetables with the mustard sauce on the side. Sprinkle with the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18737,&quot;Spice-Roasted Cauliflower and Jerusalem Artichokes 1 head cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets 1 pound Jerusalem artichokes, cut into 1-inch dice Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1 tablespoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper Finely chopped fresh chives, for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the cauliflower and Jerusalem artichokes; toss them generously with olive oil and salt. In a small bowl, combine the cumin and cayenne and add to the vegetables. Toss well to thoroughly combine. Spread the veggies on a baking sheet in one even layer-use two baking sheets, if necessary. Roast 20 minutes, then stir the veggies so they have the chance to brown all over and rotate the pan to ensure even cooking. Roast another 20 minutes, then stir and rotate again. Roast the vegetables for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until they are brown, tender and smell wonderful-almost like popcorn! If they aren&#39;t lovely and brown, let them continue to roast for another few minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Remove the veggies from the oven, sprinkle with chives and transfer to a serving dish. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 18738,&quot;Seafood Parrillada 1/4 cup olive oil 1/2 pound fresh salmon 3/4 pound scallops 1/2 pound calamari rings 1 pound large shrimp, cleaned, tail on 2 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning 2 cups diced red bell peppers 1 cup diced green bell peppers 1 cup diced yellow bell peppers 1 cup diced tomato 1/2 cup diced onion 2 cups sliced mushrooms 2 cups sliced zucchini 1/4 cup light soy sauce 1/2 cup white wine Instructions: In large skillet add the oil and heat.

Serve with rice, salad, and tortillas. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 18739,&quot;Fresh Crab and Pea Risotto 6 to 8 cups good seafood stock (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons good olive oil 1/2 cup small-diced shallots (2 large) 1/2 cup chopped fennel, cored 1/2 cup seeded and small-diced poblano pepper 2 teaspoons minced garlic (2 cloves) 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 1/2 cups Italian Arborio rice (10 ounces) 1 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio 1/2 cup creme fraiche Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 16 ounces very good fresh lump crabmeat, picked through for shells 1 cup frozen peas, defrosted Minced fresh chives and freshly grated lemon zest, for serving Instructions: Heat the stock in a medium saucepan and keep it simmering over low heat. In a medium (10 to 11-inch) pot or Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots, fennel, and poblano pepper and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the garlic, thyme, saffron, and red pepper flakes and cook for 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat all the grains with butter and oil. Add the wine and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes, until almost all the liquid has been absorbed. Add 1/2 cup of the simmering stock to the rice and cook, stirring frequently (see Cook&#39;s Note). When the stock is almost completely absorbed, continue adding stock, 1/2 cup at a time, simmering the risotto until the stock is absorbed each time before adding more stock. Cook until the rice is al dente; it should take between 25 and 30 minutes. When the rice is done, stir in the creme fraiche, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Fold in the crabmeat and peas and cook over low heat for 2 minutes, until the crabmeat is warmed through. Add just enough simmering stock to make the risotto moist and creamy. Serve hot in large, shallow bowls and sprinkle with chives and lemon zest. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 18740,&quot;Broccoli Chowder with Cheddar Toasts 2 strips bacon, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup) 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon celery seed 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 cups milk 4 small red-skinned potatoes (about 6 ounces), scrubbed and quartered 1/2 head broccoli (about 10 ounces), broken into florets, stem peeled and sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 baguette, sliced into eight 1/4-inch-thick pieces 4 ounces Cheddar, cut into 8 thin slices Instructions: Cook the bacon in the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat until it renders slightly, about 2 minutes.

Soak the casing in cold water for 30 minutes to soften, then run water through it to remove excess salt and check for leaks. (You can buy casings from most butchers.) Blend the chiles. Remove the seeds from the chipotles, and finely chop in a food processor with the garlic, vinegar and tequila. Chop the pork. Cut any silver skin off the pork butt, then cut it into 3-inch chunks. Grind the meat. Grind the pork in a meat grinder (or mixer with a grinder attachment) with a 316-inch die. Use the feed tube to push the meat through gently. Season the meat. First, \de-bling\ (take off your rings!); you&#39;ll be mixing with your hands. Combine the dry spices-cumin, salt, chili powders, onion, paprika, oregano and white pepper-in a small bowl. Then season the pork in layers: Place half the ground meat in a large bowl, cover with half the spice mixture and half the garlic-vinegar mixture, then add the rest of the meat, spices and garlic mixture. Combine everything with your hands; it&#39;s the best way to make sure all the meat gets seasoned. Thread the casing. Remove the die from the grinder and attach the sausage-stuffing tube, then slide the whole casing onto the tube, leaving enough at the end to tie into a tight knot. Stuff the casing. With the mixer on low, gently feed the sausage mixture into the tube, using one hand to guide the casing out at the right speed; be careful not to overstuff or tear the casing. Form the links. Turn off the mixer after you get about 3 to 4 feet of sausage and cut and tie off the casing. Retie the casing on the stuffing tube and continue making the remaining sausage. Pinch and then twist the long pieces of sausage about every 8 inches to form links. Place the linked sausages on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate overnight to dry. Grill the sausage. Preheat one side of a grill to medium-high and the other to low. Lightly brush the grill with oil, then grill the sausages until they&#39;re browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Move to low heat and continue grilling until they&#39;re cooked through, 5 to 7 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 18748,&quot;Chipotle Salsa Two 15-ounce cans diced tomatoes One 10- or 15-ounce can diced tomatoes with green chiles<br> 1/4 cup fresh lime juice<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1 to 3 (depending on your heat tolerance) chipotle peppers in adobo (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems roughly removed<br> 1 medium onion, diced<br> Instructions: Add the diced tomatoes, diced tomatoes with green chiles, lime juice, cumin, salt, sugar, black pepper, chipotle peppers, cilantro and onions to a food processor and blend until totally combined. Give it a taste to check for seasoning. Make the salsa several hours before serving, as it will give the flavors a chance to dance!

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F/ 230 degrees C /Gas mark 8, and butter and flour the cake tin.<br> For the filling: Cream the butter and cinnamon together in a large bowl or in an electric food mixer until soft. Add the brown sugar and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy and then stir in the chopped toasted pecans. Set aside (not in the refrigerator).<br> For the dough: Sift the flour, baking powder and cinnamon together into a large bowl.<br> Add the caster sugar, then add the butter and, using your fingertips, rub it in until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Whisk the beaten egg and milk together in a separate bowl, then make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in most of the liquid (all but 2 fluid ounces/60 ml). Using one hand with your fingers outstretched like a claw, move your hand around in one direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) until the dough comes together. Cook&#39;s Note: You may need to add the rest of the milk as the dough should be soft and a little sticky.<br> To make the buns: Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and dust with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough until it is a 14 by 10- inches/35 by 25 cm rectangle and about 3/4-inch/2 cm thick.<br> Spread the filling all over the rectangle, then with the widest end facing you, roll up the dough away from you so that it resembles a Swiss roll. Cut the &#39;log&#39; 11 times to make 12 slices, each 1 1/4-inches/3 cm thick. Place the pieces cut-side facing up, with a tiny bit of space between each &#39;swirl&#39;, in the prepared cake tin.<br> Bake in the oven 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C/Gas mark 6 and cook for a further 25 to 35 minutes or until risen, golden brown and cooked in the centre. They should have joined together to make a lovely cluster of buns.<br> Allow the buns to stand in the tin for 2 to 3 minutes before carefully turning out and cooling on a wire rack. When cool, transfer to a serving plate or cake stand.<br> For the icing: Sift the icing sugar (confectioners&#39;) into a bowl, add 1 tablespoon boiling water and mix well, adding another 1/2 to 1 tablespoon boiling water, if necessary, until the icing is soft, but not too runny. Drizzle the icing over the buns.<br> To serve: Break each bun off with your hand or cut into slices.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18750,&quot;Lemon and Veal Parcel 4 ounces water 4 ounces sugar 7 lemons 1 ounce powdered sugar 4 lemon leaves 1 pound veal fillet 4 basil leaves 1 pound sliced parma ham 8 ounces ground pork meat 8 ounces zucchini 8 ounces eggplant 8 ounces potatoes 8 ounces mixed bell peppers 8 ounces cherry tomatoes 2 ounces olive oil 2 cloves garlic Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.

Pour on the marinade, cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours, or overnight. Preheat the grill or broiler until very hot. Grill the chicken breasts, skin side down on the grill, or skin side up in the broiler, 2 to 3 minutes. Then turn and cook the other side. Keep turning the chicken every minute or 2 to avoid blackening or sticking; total cooking time is 10 to 12 minutes for small breasts and 18 to 20 for larger breasts. (We always cook chicken breasts with the skin on for flavor. For skinless chicken, we just remove it before serving.) Serve hot on top of red rice and black beans. Top with the Orange Salsa. Combine the orange juice, lime juice and cl(s) in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the chili(s) is plump, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Transfer the citrus mixture to a blender.

Dip the softshell into the tempura batter, shaking off any excess. Remove the basket from the fryer. First, carefully holding the top of the softshell, drag the legs through the oil first, for 1 minute. This will allow the individual legs to fry separately instead together. Then lay the softshell, top side down, into the oil. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden, flip the softshell over and continue frying for additional 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the fryer and allow to drain on a paper-lined plate. To assemble, toss the salad ingredients in a large bowl. Mound the salad in the center of the platter.

Transfer to a bowl and cover with hot water; let sit 30 minutes to soften, then drain and peel; set aside. Meanwhile, wrap the thyme, bay leaves and juniper berries in a square of cheesecloth and tie closed; set aside.<br> Butterfly the brisket: With your knife parallel to the cutting board, slice the brisket in half horizontally almost all the way through, leaving one side attached; open like a book. (If the brisket is triangular, cut from the pointed side toward the wider side.) Pound with the flat side of a meat mallet until about 3/4 inch thick, if needed.<br> Season the brisket with salt and pepper and arrange with the wider of the two short sides in front of you. Arrange the carrots and parsnips horizontally across the brisket, close to the side in front of you. Starting from this side, roll the brisket over the vegetables to make a tight log and set seam-side down. Tie in 2-inch intervals using kitchen twine, then tie across the length, tucking in the ends. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat.

With a sharp knife, score the fat on the top of the ham. Place the ham on a large rimmed baking sheet. Whisk together the brown sugar, salt, black pepper, cumin, ginger, mustard powder, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the dry rub mixture for the glaze. Season the ham with the remaining dry rub. Place plastic wrap over the ham and put it in the refrigerator for 8 to 12 hours. Allowing the seasoning to penetrate the ham overnight will give it a fuller flavor. Preheat your charcoal grill to 300 degrees F for indirect heat. Place the baking sheet with the ham on the grill grates, with the ham flat side down. Cover the grill and let the ham cook for 2 hours. Heat the butter, thyme, honey, vinegar, and reserved dry rub together in a medium saucepan until the butter melts. Stir together until smooth.

Remove the parchment paper. Using the towel, fold the long end of the cake towards the center, continuing to roll the cake into the towel (this will help shape the cake when the buttercream is added). Transfer to a rack, seam-side down, to cool completely.<br> For the black sesame buttercream: Put the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on low speed until combined, then add the sesame paste, milk, vanilla and salt and increase the speed to medium. Beat until smooth.<br> For the decorations: Combine the coconut with the matcha powder in a medium bowl. Shape the marzipan into mushrooms. Assembly: Unroll the cake on a clean work surface and remove the towel. Spread a third of the buttercream on the inner side of the cake, frosting all the way to the edges. Gently roll back into a log. Trim the ends of the roll, then cut a quarter of the log off on a diagonal. Place the larger log on a large serving platter. Attach the smaller log to the side of the cake with some buttercream to resemble a branch on the yule log. Spread the remaining buttercream on the buche de Noel to cover, but leave the cut sides unfrosted to show the swirl. Run an offset spatula or spoon over the buttercream for the appearance of rough tree bark. Sprinkle the matcha coconut around the cake to resemble moss. Place the marzipan mushrooms around the cake, gently pressing them into the frosting.

Place a roasting pan in the oven for 5 minutes to preheat. In a mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, garlic, and olive oil and stir to coat the potatoes and garlic. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to the roasting pan and roast, stirring occasionally until potatoes are soft when pierced with the tip of a knife and the garlic cloves are very soft and sweet in flavor, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and keep warm. To make mushrooms: In a 12-inch saute pan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook for about 3 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and cook about 1 minute longer. Add the mushrooms and thyme. Cover the pan and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and have released their juices. If the mushrooms seem dry during cooking, add about 1/4 cup of the chicken stock. When the mushrooms are soft, add the rest of the chicken stock, raise the heat to high, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 6 minutes. There will be quite a bit of liquid in the mushrooms. Remove them from the heat, cover, and set side to keep warm. To make the chicken: Heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place the chicken breasts in the pan, skin side down. Cook for about 6 minutes, until golden brown. Turn and cook until the juices run clear when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 6 more minutes. Add the rosemary and cook, basting frequently, for 6 to 8 minutes longer, until the chicken is cooked through and nicely browned. Transfer to a serving platter and set it aside, covered, to keep warm. Pour off any oil in the pan and add the wine and Cognac. Raise the heat to high and deglaze the pan by scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Add the stock and cook until the sauce is reduced nearly by half or thickened and richly flavored, about 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Season with the chives, salt, and pepper. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve, passing the mushrooms and potatoes on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 18852,&quot;Peanut Butter Ice Cream Sauce 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Mix the peanut butter and sweetened condensed milk in a small saucepan over low heat. Gradually stir in the butter. Continue to cook, stirring, until the sauce is smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Let the sauce cool; it will start to thicken as it cools.

In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup water, the butter and the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, add the flour all at once and stir it vigorously with a wooden spoon. Cook until the mixture has formed a ball with a slightly sweaty sheen to it, and has pulled away from the pan. Transfer to a mixing bowl and let cool for 3 to 4 minutes; the mixture does not have to be cold, just cool enough not to cook the eggs when added. Using an electric mixer, or lots of good old-fashioned elbow grease, beat in the eggs one at a time; do not add the second egg until the first is fully incorporated. Add in the cinnamon and beat for another second to combine. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag equipped with a large straight tip, and pipe 1-inch balls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Be sure to leave at least 1 inch between each of the balls?they grow! When done, dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each ball where the pastry bag released the dough. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through to ensure even cooking. When done, the puffs should be light, airy and dry inside. Cool on a rack. For the chocolate sauce: Fill a saucepan with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil. Put the chocolate in a metal or heatproof glass mixing bowl and place on top of the saucepan with the boiling water. Pay careful attention that the mixing bowl does not touch the surface of the boiling water. Add the cream, butter, corn syrup and cinnamon and stir until the chocolate has melted and everything is combined. This is a pretty quick process. Once the chocolate has melted, remove it from the double boiler set-up. When ready to serve, cut the profiteroles in half horizontally and fill them with ice cream. Top with warm chocolate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 18857,&quot;Turkey-and-Quinoa Stuffed Eggplant 4 small Italian eggplants, halved lengthwise 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3/4 cup panko 2 cloves garlic (1 smashed, 1 minced) 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1 onion, chopped 1/2 teaspoon herbes de Provence 1 pound ground turkey 1 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1 cup frozen cooked quinoa, thawed Instructions: Place a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.

In a bowl, combine the orange, lime, and grapefruit juice and whisk together. Wash and pat the pig dry with paper towels. Sprinkle inside and out with the salt and pepper and place it in a large roasting pan, belly side up. Place the grapefruit, oranges, limes, onion, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme inside the cavity and skewer it closed. Turn belly side down and place a ball of wood or a rolled up piece of aluminum foil about the size of a lemon in the pigs mouth. Skewer the legs into position by pulling the forelegs forward and bending the hind legs into a crouching position (this will help a large pig fit in a home oven, if it fits already, this is not necessary). Cover the tail and ears with small pieces of foil to prevent them from burning. Place the pig in the oven and baste with the citrus juice mixture. After the pig has roasted for 15 minutes, baste it again with the citrus juice mixture and reduce the heat to 325 degrees. Roast for 20 minutes per pound longer, basting generously every 15 or 20 minutes with the juice mixture and then the pan juices. To test for doneness, prick the thigh with the tip of a sharp knife to see if the juices run clear. The internal temperature should read 165 degrees on a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the leg. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes, loosely tented with a large piece of aluminum foil. Distribute the parsley and watercress sprigs loosely around the edges of a large warmed oval platter. Halve the trimmed blood oranges and place them around the edges of the platter, nestled in the greens. Remove the foil from the tail and ears and replace the wood or foil from the mouth with a lemon, lime, or apple.

Add the lemon juice to deglaze the pan. Cut the additional raw endive leaves into a julienne and lightly dress with some of the Lemon Vinaigrette. Put a dollop of the caramelized endive in the middle of each plate. Place a small amount of the raw endive salad on top the cooked endive and then top with the tuna. Place additional raw endive salad on top of the tuna and drizzle some additional dressing around the plate. Garnish with a pinch of fleur de sel. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, lime zest, white pepper to taste, and salt. Whisk until the salt has fully dissolved. While still whisking, slowly pour the olive oil into the bowl. When all of the oil is incorporated, the dressing is finished. Slice the scallops into very thin pieces, about 1/16 to 1/8-inch thick. Gently clean all dirt off of the truffle. Cut the entire truffle into julienne pieces. Place 2 scallop slices in the middle of each plate so that the slices are next to each other. Place Crispy Shallot rings next to the scallops on 1 side only. Cover the tops of the scallops with the black truffle. Finish with a sprinkle of fleur de sel and a light drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Peel off the outside skin from the shallots. Cut the shallots into rings and then separate the layers of the shallots. Place the rings into a container and cover with the milk. Let marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours. When ready to cook, heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a large, heavy Dutch oven. Take the shallots out of the milk and dredge them in the flour. Carefully add to oil and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden and crispy. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the spinach to the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer spinach to a napkin-lined tray to drain. Shuck all of the oysters, reserving them in the shell. Place 1/4 cup salt in the middle of each plate and position 2 oysters on each bed of salt. Place a small amount of creme fraiche on top of the oysters, then 1 or 2 pieces of wilted spinach on top of the creme fraiche. Then put a dollop of caviar (about 1/2 ounce per plate) on top of the spinach. In a large stockpot, bring the water and salt to a boil. Add the lobster to the boiling water and cook for 7 to 10 minutes. Take out of the boiling water and place into an ice water bath to chill. When the lobster has cooled, remove from the ice water. Remove the tail from the head by holding the head with 1 hand while your other hand gently twists off the tail. Remove the tail meat from the shell. Cut the tail meat into medallions about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick, yielding 8 medallions. Cut off the top and bottom of the oranges. Remove the skin from the orange so there is no pith left. Then cut out the segments of the orange, removing any seeds. Cut each segment into 3 to 4 pieces. Put a dollop of the Carrot Curry Puree in the middle of each plate. Place 1 lobster medallion on each side of the puree. Place 1 chervil leaf at each corner of the lobster. Scatter the diced blood oranges next to the chervil. Lightly drizzle the Blood Orange Juice around the plate. Peel and roughly chop the carrots. Heat a saute pan over medium heat and then add the butter and shallots. Saute until the shallots are tender and translucent. Add curry powder and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the carrots and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Add chicken stock and deglaze the pan; bring to a simmer and continue to cook until the carrots are tender. Transfer mixture to a blender* and season with salt, if needed. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. Place the juice into a mixing bowl and then add the zest and oil.

Whisk in 2 tablespoons olive oil, the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Place the steak in a large resealable plastic bag, pour in the marinade and seal, squeezing out the air. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day. Prepare the herb butter: Mix the butter with the chives, parsley, chervil, a pinch of salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and the lemon juice in a bowl. About 30 minutes before cooking, remove the meat from the bag (discard the marinade), dry it well and bring to room temperature. Heat a large heavy skillet over high heat, about 2 minutes. Rub the steak with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt over the surface of the pan; add the meat and set a heavy skillet on top to weigh it down. Sear for about 7 minutes; turn the steak, replace the weight and cook until a thermometer inserted into the side reads 110 degrees for medium-rare, about 5 minutes. Transfer the steak to a cutting board; brush with some of the herb butter, tent with foil and let rest for about 10 minutes. Thinly slice against the grain; top with more herb butter and drizzle with the pan juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18918,&quot;The Best Chicken-Fried Steak Four 3- to 4-ounce cube steaks (see Cook&#39;s Note) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 2 1/4 cups whole milk<br> 1 1/2 cups cornstarch<br> 1 tablespoon Hungarian paprika<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 cup buttermilk<br> 1 large egg, beaten<br> 1 tablespoon hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s RedHot<br> 4 1/2 cups vegetable oil Instructions: Liberally sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper (see Cook&#39;s Note). Put them on a rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and let sit at room temperature while you make the gravy. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the flour until combined and cook until golden and bubbling, about 1 minute. Whisk in the whole milk, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, whisking frequently, until the gravy boils. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, whisking occasionally, until the gravy thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm; it will seem loose but will thicken as it sits. Whisk the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, cornstarch, paprika, garlic powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Whisk the buttermilk, egg and hot sauce in a medium bowl. Working with 1 steak at a time, dredge in the seasoned flour, turning to coat and packing into the crevices. Shake to remove any excess and return to the rack. Repeat with the remaining steaks. Pour 3 tablespoons of the buttermilk mixture into the seasoned flour and work it in with your fingers; it should feel like wet sand with some clumps. (These clumps will give the steak a crispy, shaggy crust.) Dip the dredged steaks into the remaining buttermilk mixture, allowing any excess to drip off. Pack the moistened flour firmly onto each steak. Very gently shake off any excess and return to the rack. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Pour the oil into a large cast-iron skillet fitted with a deep-fry thermometer (the oil should come about halfway up the sides). Heat the oil over high heat until the thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Fry the steaks in 2 batches until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Whisk the warm cream gravy to loosen it and serve over the chicken-fried steak. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir]&quot; 18919,&quot;Tortas Ahogadas 3 1/2 ounces arbol chiles 1 cup white vinegar 2 sprigs oregano 1 clove 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds 1 clove garlic, minced Salt Olive oil, to coat pan 2 pounds pork, thinly sliced 4 sub rolls 2 cups refried beans, hot 2 Roma tomatoes, sliced 2 avocados, sliced 1 white onion, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons oregano, chopped Instructions: Devein the chiles and soak in hot water for 30 minutes.

Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Push one stick into the top of each apple, then place on the baking sheet with the stick standing straight up. Place the cookies in a large resealable plastic bag and roll with a rolling pin to crush. Set aside. In a large saucepan over low heat, combine the sugar, buttermilk, butter, baking soda, and vanilla and bring just to a boil, stirring constantly. Attach a candy thermometer to the pan, and continue to boil and stir until the mixture reaches 238 degrees F, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Dip each apple, one at a time, immediately into the caramel, leaving a 1/4-inch ring of green by the stick, and return the apple to the baking sheet. If the caramel starts to solidify while you are dipping apples, stir in heavy cream, a few drops at a time, until the caramel reaches a spreadable consistency. After all the apples have been dipped, lightly sprinkle them with sea salt. Allow the caramel to set, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the white chocolate chips on high in 30-second intervals, stirring until melted. Dip each apple into the melted white chocolate, leaving a 1/4-inch ring of caramel exposed. Immediately dip the white chocolate-covered caramel apple in a layer of crushed cookie topping, leaving 1/4 inch of the white chocolate exposed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 18934,&quot;Smoked Pork Loin with Raspberry Chipotle Glaze 1 (4-pound) pork loin Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed 3 tablespoons dry spice rub for pork 1 (10-ounce) jar seedless raspberry jam 1 (5-ounce) bottle chipotle hot pepper sauce (recommended: Tabasco) Instructions: Preheat stovetop or outdoor smoker to approximately 230 degrees F.

Lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan, preferably a light-colored aluminum or steel pan. (Dark pans cause over-browning.) Heat a large skillet over medium heat, add the butter, and cook until the butter foams and turns amber brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the butter into a large bowl and set aside until cool enough to touch. Meanwhile, sift the flour, baking powder, nutmeg and salt together into a bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer, or using a hand mixer, combine the brown sugar with the butter and mix until combined. Add the eggs and vanilla, and mix until smooth, thick and light, 3 to 5 minutes. (You want to make sure the mixture is very light and airy, like frosting.) Stir in the sifted flour mixture and mix by hand until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it into an even layer, smoothing the top. Scatter the hazelnuts, pressing lightly to submerge them about halfway in the batter. Bake until the surface wrinkles evenly and turns nut brown, about 35 minutes.

Rub all over the oxtails. Add the garlic, onions and thyme, cover and marinate for 4 to 5 hours. This will ensure that all the flavor of the spices will be deeply embedded in your oxtails for a finger-licking flavor. When ready to cook, heat a large pot and then add the olive oil and heat until hot. Add the oxtails and fry, stirring every 5 minutes, for 15 minutes. Add the butter beans, scallions and bell peppers, cover the pot and cook over medium heat for 1 hour 30 minutes, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes. Add desired small portions of water when needed (make sure that the water is barely above the oxtails at all times) throughout the cooking period. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. You may add additional seasoning salt or other spices, if desired. Mix in the cornstarch and let simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 more minutes.

Season oysters evenly with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Top each shell with equal amounts of parsley and green onions. On an open flame grill, heat coals or gas to a medium to hot. Depending on the grill, there are 3 methods of completing this dish. Ideally, the bacon should sit above the oysters, cooking on an elevated metal mesh that allows the bacon grease to drip into the oyster cavity. The oysters should be placed directly above the flame. If an elevated mesh apparatus or shelf is unavailable, the bacon can be elevated with crumpled aluminum foil, allowing the same dripping effect. If foil is unavailable, place the bacon strips around the edge of the shells so that they are allowed to cook separately from the oysters while still producing drippings. Cook the oysters for 8 to 20 minutes. For best results, make sure that at least some bacon fat has found its way into the oyster cavity. Serve as appetizers eaten off the shell or with a small cocktail fork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 18946,&quot;Sweet Strawberry Tartlets 1 1/2 cups hulled quartered strawberries 1/2 cup sugar, plus 3 tablespoons 5 ounces Maria crackers* (about 1 pack or 32 crackers), or graham crackers 1/4 cup, packed minced piloncillo** (about 2 ounces), or packed brown sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cubed 1 (8-ounce) bars cream cheese, room temperature 1/2 cup sour cream 1 envelope whipping powdered topping (about 1/4 cup powder) 6 individual tart tins with removable bottoms or 1 (9-inch) tin Nonstick cooking spray<br> Instructions: Mix the strawberries and 3 tablespoons of the sugar in a small bowl.

Combine the flour, granulated sugar, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut in the lard with 2 knives until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of lard (do not overmix). A little at a time, stir in 1/2 to 1 cup ice water until the dough holds together when squeezed; the amount of water will vary depending on the humidity. (You can also make the dough in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.) Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; use the plastic to help form each half into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Make the filling: Combine the apples, flour, turbinado sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, lemon juice, green chiles and pine nuts in a large bowl and toss. Let sit 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate, then spoon the filling into the crust. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round; lay the dough over the filling. Press the 2 crusts together around the edge, then fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers. Cut a few slits in the top crust or prick with a fork to let steam escape.

Then cut each half lengthwise into 1/2 inch-thick slices (about 16 slices). Arrange the eggplant slices on several baking sheets and sprinkle generously all over with kosher salt. Set aside to let the bitter juices weep from the eggplant, about 1 hour. Transfer the eggplant to a colander in the sink, and rinse well under cold running water. Transfer eggplant to a work surface and blot very dry with paper towels. In a large bowl, whisk together the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, breadcrumbs, oregano, thyme, and season with pepper to taste. Place the flour in a medium lipped plate or bowl. In another medium bowl, whisk the egg and milk together. Dredge an eggplant slice in the flour, then dip it in the egg, and finally dredge it in the breadcrumb mixture. Shake off any excess breading and transfer the eggplant to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining eggplant. In a large straight-sided skillet, pour the oil to a depth of 1/2 inch. Heat the oil over medium heat until it registers 400 degrees F on a deep frying thermometer. (The oil must be heated to 400 degrees F. since when the breaded eggplant is added it drops the temperature to the proper frying temperature of 375 degrees F.) Working in small batches, fry the eggplant slices, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Using tongs, transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and season with salt to taste. Repeat with the remaining eggplant. The eggplant can be fried up to 2 hours before serving. When ready to serve preheat the broiler. Arrange the hero rolls, split-side up, on a baking sheet and toast under the broiler. Cover each roll with about 4 slices of eggplant, overlapping them slightly.

Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Place all the remaining meatball ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Stir well with a wooden spoon to combine, then form the meat into balls by rolling about 2 tablespoons of meat between your hands. Place meatballs on a plate as they are formed. (Hint: if your hands are slightly damp, the meatballs will roll more easily and will not stick to your hands!) When all the meatballs are formed, gently place the balls into the sauce 1 at a time using a long handled spoon. Be careful - bubbling sauce splatters! Simmer the sauce uncovered, and allow the meatballs to sit undisturbed for 10 minutes before stirring. Stir the meatballs into the sauce when they rise to the top. Simmer for an additional 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pan. While sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water until al dente. Strain and toss with the olive oil. Keep warm until ready to serve. Heat the olive oil in a 5-quart pot over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, salt, crushed red pepper, oregano and black pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Place the tomatoes in a large bowl and squeeze to break into small pieces. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, and sugar to the pot with the onions, and stir well. Add the Parmesan rind. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally with a long-handled wooden spoon, until flavors have come together and sauce is thickened. Stir in the basil and let sit for 10 minutes before using. Remove from the heat, and use as needed. You can store this sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or freeze it for up to 3 months. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Garnacha]&quot; 18975,&quot;Summertime Pasta Salad with Fresh Tuna Salt 8 ounces penne 1 pound fresh tuna steak, about 3/4-inch thick 1/4 cup olive oil 1 package (10 ounces) frozen corn, thawed and patted dry 1 jar (6-7 ounces) roasted red peppers or fried sweet peppers with onions, chopped 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 1/4 cup mayonnaise, optional 2 tablespoons snipped chives Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Transfer the batter to the greased skillet and bake until golden brown on top, 22 to 25 minutes. Let cool. Keep the oven at 400 degrees F. Meanwhile, lightly grease two 9-inch springform pans with cooking spray. Put a pan over medium-high heat and add just enough oil to coat the bottom. Add the sausage and cook until crisp around the edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. To the same pan, add the onion, green pepper, celery and garlic and cook until the veggies are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Crumble the cooled cornbread into a large mixing bowl. Add the cooked veggies and sausage and mix together gently. Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl. Add it to the cornbread mixture with the sage, soup base or bouillon, pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt; mix together gently. Add the broth 1/4 cup at a time until the dressing reaches the desired consistency. It should be loose but not runny--3/4 to 1 cup will be plenty. Transfer the dressing to the prepared springform pans. Bake until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 18977,&quot;Apple Turnovers with Caramel Sauce and Ice Cream 3 sweet and tart apples, such as Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, peeled, cored and cut into pieces 1/4 cup sugar or cinnamon sugar 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 (17.3-ounce) package all-butter frozen puff pastry (2 sheets), thawed (recommended: Pepperidge Farm) 1 egg, beaten, for egg wash Sugar Vanilla ice cream, for serving Caramel Sauce, recipe follows, for serving 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 1/4 cups heavy cream Instructions: For the filling: Put the apples in a medium saucepan and add 1/3 cup water, the sugar and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Cover, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the apples are very tender, stirring frequently, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gently mash the apples until the mixture is very soft, but still chunky. Cool completely. Position 1 rack in the top third of the oven and 1 rack in the bottom third. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. For the pastry: Stack the pastry sheets together, and then roll them out on a lightly floured surface to a 15-inch square. Cut the pastry into 9 (5-inch) squares. Put 1 generous tablespoon apple filling in the middle of each square. Lightly brush the edges of each square with the beaten egg. Fold half of the pastry square over the filling, forming triangles. Press and pinch the pastry edges with fingertips or a fork to seal tightly. Chill the turnovers slightly to firm the dough, about 15 minutes. Remove the turnovers from the refrigerator. Make small slits or holes on top of each triangle with a sharp knife or a fork so the steam can escape. Lightly brush the pastry triangles with beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with sugar. Transfer to the baking sheets. Bake the turnovers until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a generous drizzle or pour of Caramel Sauce. Combine the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. This is the only time you can stir the sugar. If you stir it while it&#39;s cooking, it turns to rock candy. Place the saucepan over medium to low heat until the sugars start to dissolve, 5 to 10 minutes. Then turn the heat up to medium-high and cook until the sugar starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Do not stir while this is happening. You&#39;ve got to watch the pot, because it goes from caramel to burnt really quickly. And be careful, the mixture is extremely hot! Turn off the heat and stand back to avoid splattering. Slowly add the cream. Don&#39;t panic - the cream will bubble violently, and the caramel will solidify. Just give it more time to liquefy again-trust me! Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature, at least 4 hours. It will thicken as it sits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 18978,&quot;Moroccan Lamb Tagine with Honey and Apricots 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, trimmed of fat (about 1 1/2 pounds) 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 1/2 cups diced onions 3 large garlic cloves, minced 1 cup chicken broth 8 threads Spanish saffron, crushed 16 fresh cilantro sprigs, tied together with a cotton string 1 cup dried, pitted apricots 1/2 cup golden raisins 1 onion, halved and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons honey 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper Cilantro sprigs, for garnish Moroccan Vegetable Couscous, recipe follows Moroccan Yogurt with Preserved Lemon Dip, recipe follows 6 tablespoons olive oil 1 red bell pepper, halved 3/4 pound fine-grain couscous, (dried but not processed) 1 red onion, peeled and quartered 2 small carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thick slices 1/4 pound cauliflower florets, cut into quarters 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 zucchini, quartered lengthwise and sliced 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes and their juices 1 (16-ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed well 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 tablespoon butter 1/4 cup sliced almonds 1 cup yogurt 1 cup sliced cucumber 1/4 cup mint, chopped 3 tablespoons preserved lemon, minced, skin only Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cut lamb into 1 1/2-inch cubes and place in a medium-sized bowl. Season the lamb with turmeric, ginger and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat a tagine or Dutch oven over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil and half of the seasoned lamb. Cook the lamb until browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the lamb from the pan and set aside. Repeat with remaining oil and lamb. Return the seared lamb to the pan and add the diced onions. Cook, stirring to get the browned bits off the bottom of the pan, for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken broth, saffron, and cilantro bundle and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender. Pour 1 cup of boiling water over the apricots and raisins and let sit for 20 minutes. Strain and set the fruit aside. Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat, place it on a clean plate, and keep warm. Bring the remaining liquid in the pan to a simmer. Add the sliced onions, apricots, raisins, honey, cinnamon, ground pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Return the liquid to a simmer and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until mixture is slightly thickened. Add the cooked lamb back into the sauce and cook to heat through, about 2 minutes. Garnish with fresh cilantro sprigs. Serve with Moroccan Vegetable Couscous and Moroccan Yogurt with Preserved Lemon Dip. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Toss the red pepper halves and onion quarters with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium bowl. Arrange pepper and onion, cut sides down, on a small baking sheet, drizzling any remaining olive oil onto the baking sheet as well. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the skin is browned and bubbly. Peel, seed, and dice the red bell pepper and dice the onion. Set aside. Rinse the couscous in a fine-meshed strainer under cold running water until completely soaked. Drain and place in a medium bowl. Allow couscous to stand and swell for 5 minutes. Arrange a vegetable steamer or other steamer insert with small holes in a large stockpot with water, making sure the water doesn&#39;t touch the bottom of the steamer. Bring the water to a boil and add the couscous to the vegetable steamer. Cover tightly and steam for 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender and fluffy. Remove from the steamer, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the carrots and cauliflower, and cook until lightly brown and softened, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic, zucchini, tomatoes and juices, garbanzo beans, chopped red onion and bell pepper, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon and salt and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to medium. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 7 to 10 minutes. Adjust the seasonings with the salt and pepper. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley, and cover to keep warm. In a small skillet heat the butter over medium heat. When foamy, add the almonds and cook until toasted, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Arrange the couscous on a large serving platter and top with the vegetable mixture, tossing gently. Sprinkle toasted almonds over the top and serve immediately. Put the yogurt in a cheesecloth lined strainer over a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight to drain. Put the drained yogurt in a medium bowl and stir in the cucumber, mint, and lemon. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18979,&quot;Meaty Grilled Pizza 2 sausage links 6 slices Canadian bacon<br> 1 small yellow onion, cut into rings<br> 1 portobello mushroom cap All-purpose flour, for dusting 8 ounces pizza dough, rested at room temperature for 4 hours<br> 2 tablespoons cornmeal, for dusting 1/2 cup pizza sauce<br> 12 to 14 slices pepperoni<br> 8 ounces smoked mozzarella, shredded<br> Olive oil, for drizzling<br> Fresh basil, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium heat. Grill the sausage, turning, until cooked through. Cut into slices. (Alternatively, remove the sausage from its casings, cook on a griddle on the grill and crumble.) Meanwhile, put the Canadian bacon, onion slices and mushroom cap on the grill. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and grill until the onion and mushroom are slightly charred and tender, another 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes, then roughly chop. To set up the pizza stone on the grill, stack 2 bricks on top of each other on one side of the grill and 2 more bricks on top of each other on the other side of the grill, about 12 inches apart to create a platform for the pizza stone. Put the pizza stone on top of the bricks to elevate it over the grates. The stone should be 5 to 6 inches above the grates. Raise the heat to medium high, cover and preheat for 30 minutes to allow the pizza stone to get nice and hot. On a floured work surface, press the pizza dough into a round 12 to 14 inches in diameter and about 1/4 inch thick. Dust a pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet with the cornmeal. Transfer the dough to the pizza peel or baking sheet. Top the dough with the sauce and spread it out with a spoon into a thin layer. Top with the pepperoni, sausage, Canadian bacon, onions, mushroom and mozzarella. Carefully slide the pizza onto the pizza stone. Cover the grill and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 12 to 14 minutes. Garnish with a drizzle of olive oil and the basil. Slice and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barbera, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]</p><p>&quot; 18980,&quot;Duck with Pear Sauce and Wilted Greens 1 (8-pound) whole duck Vegetable oil 1 1/2 cups dry white wine (about half a bottle) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/4 cups chicken stock<br> Pear sauce, recipe follows 1 tablespoon pear brandy 1 tablespoon butter Butternut squash Barley Risotto, recipe follows Wilted greens, recipe follows 4 ounces whole, blanched, peeled hazelnuts, toasted 6 pears 1 small butternut squash Vegetable oil, to oil baking sheet 1 cup barley 1 1/2 cups water Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons butter 2 bunches cleaned, dried Swiss chard Canola oil, for wilting greens Instructions: Remove the breast and the legs from the duck (you can ask your butcher to do this for you). Remove the skin from the legs and reserve with the neck, heart, and gizzard. Heat an 8-inch saute pan over high heat. Add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add the duck legs and sear until well browned on all sides, but not cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Lower the heat to medium-low, pour off any excess fat and add the white wine. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover with a tight lid and cook slowly over low heat for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat falls off the bones. Remove the legs from the liquid and remove all the meat from the bones and set aside. Pour the braising liquid into a shallow container and remove the fat - if you refrigerate the braising liquid overnight the fat will solidify and be easy to remove. There should be at least 1 cup of braising liquid left after the removal of the fat, if not, add chicken stock to make up 1 cup. Add the braised meat back to the braising liquid and cook over low heat, just until the meat is heated through. Set aside and keep warm. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the duck breasts, skin side down, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook without turning for 20 minutes, lowering the heat if the skin gets too dark and removing excess fat from the pan as it renders from the duck. During the last few minutes of cooking, season the flesh side with salt. Turn the breasts over and cook for 3 minutes. The duck breast should be medium rare to medium to be perfect. Remove the duck breast from the pan and let rest on a plate, reserving any juices that accumulate. Slice each breast into 4 to 6 slices. Remove the stewed duck meat from the braising liquid. Add the Pear Sauce to the braising liquid and strain through a fine strainer. Add any juices from the duck breast, the pear brandy and the butter and whisk well. Place a scoop of Barley Risotto slightly off center. Place some of the braised meat in front and the Wilted Greens on either side of the risotto. Place slices of the duck atop the braised meat. Drizzle the meat with the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts and place the dried pear slices into the risotto. Using a juicer, juice 2 pears to get 1/2 cup of juice. The pears can also be grated into a bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel. Once the pulp is in the towel, close the towel and squeeze all the juice out into the bowl. Thinly slice the remaining 4 pears lengthwise. Place in a food dehydrator and dry until crisp according to manufacturer&#39;s recommendations. Save the best looking dry pear slices to garnish the plate. Using a spice grinder grind the dried pears to a powder. Add 1/2 cup of the pear powder to the 1/2 cup of juice and let sit. The juice will thicken quickly and be about the consistency of peanut butter. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Halve the butternut squash lengthwise and scoop out the seeds and discard. Lightly oil a sheet pan, place the squash flesh side down, and roast until soft, about 45 minutes. Set aside to cool, then scoop out of the skin and puree until smooth using a food mill or food processor. Refrigerate. Soak the barley in the water, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Pour the barley and the soaking water into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer until softened, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the butternut squash puree and season with salt and black pepper and keep warm until needed. Add butter right before serving. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add enough canola oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add the greens and cook, tossing often, just until greens are wilted and stalks are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Set aside and keep hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 18981,&quot;Braised Pork Cheeks with Baby Bok Choy and Carrots 2 trotters (pig&#39;s feet), split Salt and pepper 1/4 cup Chinese rice wine<br> 10 dried shiitake mushrooms 1 onion, peeled and quartered 1 medium turnip, quartered<br> 6 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 2 stalks lemongrass 2 kaffir lime leaves, torn<br> One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and smashed<br> 1 piece star anise 2 tablespoons sweet soy sauce (see Cook&#39;s Note) 10 to 12 pork cheeks, preferably local Canola oil, for searing and sauteeing 1 pound multicolored baby carrots, halved lengthwise<br> 4 heads baby bok choy, halved lengthwise<br> 1/4 head red cabbage, julienned<br> Jasmine rice, for serving Scallions, sliced on a bias, for serving<br> Cilantro leaves, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the roasted trotters, wine, mushrooms, onion, turnip, garlic, lemongrass, kaffir leaves, ginger, star anise and 2 gallons of cold water to a stock pot. Bring to a decent simmer and cook on medium-low heat, skimming occasionally, until reduced by a third, about 2 hours. Strain the stock through a fine mesh strainer, discard the solids and stir in the sweet soy. You will want to drink this straight. Do not do this. Fight the urge. You just made pretty awesome pork stock. Preheat the oven again to 350 degrees F. Heat a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Season the pork cheeks with salt and pepper and sear until they begin to get color and crust, about 4 minutes per side. Place the cheeks in a single layer in a large oven-safe pan or a casserole dish. Cover the cheeks about 3/4 of the way with the pork stock and cover with foil. Cook in the oven until the meat just pulls apart with a fork, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Cooking time will differ depending on the size of the cheeks, so check them at the 1 1/2-hour mark. Reserve about a cup of the braising liquid. You just braised pork cheeks! Excellent work. We are close to the eating part. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add a splash of canola oil and the carrots and saute until they begin to crisp on the outside, about 5 minutes. Add the bok choy and cook just until it wilts, about 4 minutes. Add the cheeks and a splash of the braising liquid, then gently heat through until the cheeks are hot to the touch. Add the cabbage. Serve the pork cheeks and vegetables over jasmine rice and garnish with cilantro and scallions. Eat the great food you just made. Share it with a friend, or don&#39;t.

Let stand for 5 minutes to bloom. Microwave the mixture until the gelatin liquefies, about 20 seconds. Stir to make sure the gelatin is completely dissolved. Combine the tequila and lime juice in a liquid measuring cup and stir in the gelatin mixture. Cut 1/4 inch off the stem end of each jalapeno and use a 1/4-teaspoon measure to scoop out the ribs and seeds from each. Stand the jalapenos cut-side up in a plastic container large enough to fit them in a single layer, wedging them as much as possible so they stay in place without causing them to break or change shape. Pour some of the gelatin mixture into each, filling them just to the top (about 2 tablespoons in each). Refrigerate until the gelatin is set, at least 6 hours and preferably overnight. Combine the lime zest, sugar and salt in a small bowl and rub with your fingers until the lime zest is evenly mixed in. Using a paring knife, trim off and discard the tapered end of each jalapeno, then cut the jalapenos in thirds crosswise. If not serving right away, put the jalapeno pieces on a baking sheet and return to the fridge to chill until ready to serve, up to 2 hours. When ready to serve, spread a bed of finely crushed ice on a rimmed serving dish so that it creates a flat surface and arrange the jalapeno pieces on top.

Beat together the vanilla and 2 eggs in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once they are incorporated, increase the speed to medium and, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, slowly pour in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, increasing the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning and scraping down the sides of the bowl and the beaters as needed. Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together on a clean surface. Divide into 2 pieces. Shape each piece into a flat square and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to overnight. To cut and bake the forest: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment. Dust your work surface with flour and roll out a piece of dough until about 1/4-inch thick. Keep the other piece refrigerated while you work. Punch out shapes in the dough with tree cookie cutters of various sizes and cut off the dough trunks; for every 3D tree you will need 2 tree cutouts of the same size so punch out the shapes in pairs. For our forest we used 4-inch, 6-inch and 8-inch cutters. Put the trees on the prepared baking sheets and chill while you roll and cut trees from the remaining dough. Combine the scraps of the 2 squares. Chill again, reroll and cut out more trees You should have 8 to 10 pairs of trees, depending on the size of your cutters. Freeze the cutout cookies for at least 30 minutes. Rearrange the cookies on the baking sheets so that the pairs are next to each other. For the first cookie of each pair, use a sharp paring knife to cut a 1/2-inch-wide slot from the bottom to a little more than halfway up the cookie. For the second cookie of each pair, cut a similar slot but from the top of the tree down to a little past the middle. You will fit the cookies together with these slots after they are baked. Return the cookies to the freezer for 30 minutes more. Whisk together the remaining egg with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Brush a thin layer of egg wash on the cookies right before baking. Bake the cookies, rotating the baking sheets front to back and bottom to top about halfway through, until golden brown and dry on top, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets set on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and vanilla in a large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water, if needed. Remove a third of the royal icing and place it in a pastry bag fitted with a small no. 4 round tip. Color the remaining icing with the green food coloring, one drop at a time, until it&#39;s a shade you like. If the frosting is still very stiff, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of water. Fill a second pastry bag fitted with another small no. 4 round tip with the green frosting. Use a sharp paring knife to shave the cookie edges so they are smooth and flat: Pay attention to the tree bottoms (so the trees will stand straight) and the inner edges of the slots. Assemble the trees by sliding the top-slot trees into the bottom-slot trees. Shave the cookies as needed for a smooth fit, then disassemble them and place the pieces on a flat surface. Don&#39;t worry if a tree breaks; glue the pieces together with green royal icing. To decorate the forest: Decorate each cookie with the green icing, leaving a blank strip up the center without icing; this is where the pieces will fit together. We used a zigzag line of green on each side. Sprinkle with white sprinkles while the icing is still wet. Let set until firm, 30 to 45 minutes. Turn the cookies over and decorate the backs in the same fashion. Let set until firm, 30 to 45 minutes. Assemble the trees. Pipe a thin line of white icing on the outer edges of the trees for snow. Let set before serving, 30 to 45 minutes. Arrange the trees on a serving platter to create a forest. Sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar for snow. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18993,&quot;Strawberry Lemonade 2 pints strawberries, hulled and halved 3 cups sugar, plus more if needed 2 cups freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 8 to 10 lemons) Instructions: In a blender or food processor, puree the strawberries with 1 cup of the sugar and 1 cup of water. In a large container, mix together 11 cups water, the remaining 2 cups sugar, the lemon juice and the strawberry mixture. Stir and taste, adding more sugar if you like. Refrigerate until well chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 18994,&quot;Double Cut Veal Chop Saltimboca 1 cup pure olive oil 1 bunch fresh sage, leaves only 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 6 double cut veal rib chops, bone in 6 slices fontina cheese 12 small slices prosciutto Gray salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat a grill on high heat. Heat the olive oil in a small sauce pot over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating prepare a plate lined with paper towels and set aside. When the oil is hot but not quite smoking add the sage leaves, stand back as they will crackle and pop. When the leaves are fried crisp remove to the paper towel using a mesh skimmer, set aside to cool. Line a cookie sheet with plastic wrap and lightly drizzle with olive oil. Using a small paring knife cut a slit in the veal chop, between the bones, but on the meat side. Using your fingers make a pocket in the veal and transfer to the plastic lined tray. On a large plate or clean cutting board lay down the fontina slices, top each with 2 slices of prosciutto and 3 to 4 sage leaves. Roll the fontina slice up with all the ingredients inside making a small package. Using 1 hand, open up the pocket in the veal chop while stuffing the cheese and prosciutto package inside with the other hand. Brush the chops with the olive oil and season generously with gray salt and black pepper. Grill the chops over high heat for about 6 to 7 minutes on each side until nicely marked and move to indirect heat for about 8 to 10 more minutes or until desired doneness. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 18995,&quot;Parsley-Lemon Pesto 2 bunches fresh flat-leaf parsley, washed and thoroughly dried Juice of 2 lemons Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup/125 ml freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 1 cup/250 ml extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Put the parsley on a cutting board and with a mezzaluna or sharp knife, finely chop.

Add the beef; cover and let sit in the refrigerator at least 4 hours or overnight. (This is a really important step: it makes a huge flavor difference.) For the stew: Remove the beef from the marinade. Strain the veggies and bay leaves from the marinade and discard. Reserve 2 cups of the marinade. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a large, wide pan or Dutch oven with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Sprinkle the beef with salt and toss with the flour; do not flour the beef until you&#39;re ready to brown it. Add the flour-coated beef to the hot pan, but be sure to not crowd the pan; you will need to work in four batches. Brown the meat well on all sides, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the pan to a baking sheet. After the first two batches, deglaze the pot with 1/2 cup of the reserved marinade, scraping up any browned bits. Drain the liquid into a small bowl. Add more olive oil to the pan to coat and cook the remaining two batches of meat. Add the meat to the baking sheet. Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup marinade, scraping up any browned bits. Add the bacon and cook until it gets brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Toss in the mushrooms, carrots, celery, garlic and onions, and season with salt. Cook until the mixture starts to soften and becomes very aromatic, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the remaining 1 cup marinade and deglaze the pan, stirring up any browned bits, 1 minute. Add the beef. Stir to combine and cook until the wine has reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Add enough of the beef stock to just cover the surface of the beef. Toss in the bay leaves and thyme bundle. Cover the pan, bring the liquid to a boil and put in the oven. Cook the beef for 2 hours. During the last hour of cooking time, add the potatoes. Cover the pan with the lid and put the stew back in the oven to cook for an additional hour. Remove the pot from the oven and skim off any excess grease from the surface of the stew. Garnish with the chives and serve with crusty bread to sop up all the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM]&quot; 18997,&quot;Bobby Flay&#39;s Dessert Pizza 1 store-bought pizza dough Canola oil, for brushing 1 1/2 cups mascarpone cheese 2 tablespoons honey 2 plums, cut in wedges and grilled 1 cup raspberries 1 cup blackberries Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Prepare the grill for direct and indirect cooking. Once the grill is hot (you can hold your hands an inch over the grates for no more than 2 seconds), stretch and shape the dough into a 12-inch round on a flat surface. Brush the top with oil and toss on the grill, oil-side down. Cook until the bottom is golden brown, 1 minute. Check the bottom of the dough to see if it is getting browned. If it is on one part, but not the other, use a spatula or tongs to rotate the dough 90 degrees and cook for another minute. If it is still not beginning to brown, cover the grill and continue to cook a minute at a time until the bottom has browned evenly. (It should only take a couple minutes if you have a hot grill.) The top of the pizza dough will also start bubbling up with air pockets. Once the pizza dough has browned on the bottom, flip over and grill until golden brown and the dough is just firm, another minute or so. Remove to a sheet pan. Cover the grill so it retains the heat for the next step. Combine the mascarpone cheese and honey. Smear the mascarpone over the pizza and scatter the plum wedges and berries on top. Put the pizza on the sheet pan back on the grill, close the cover and cook just to warm the fruit, about 2 minutes. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 18998,&quot;Pumpkin Mousse 1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin 3 cups heavy cream 3/4 cup superfine sugar 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 1 tablespoon vanilla extract Ginger snaps, for garnish Instructions: Combine pumpkin, 1 cup cream, sugar and spice in a medium saucepan.

Stir often as the caramel slowly melts. When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and stir. Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take 1 to 2 minutes. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don&#39;t let it sit too long-- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it. Take one eighth of the mixture and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll with the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long. Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on waxed paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center rolls sit out for 1 to 2 hours to firm up. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and working quickly, \paint: a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn the center over, caramel side down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto waxed paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients. Place the bars into your refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours so that they firm up. Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the microwave for 2 minutes on 50 percent power. Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds. Don&#39;t over-cook the chips or the chocolate will burn and seize up on you. Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate. Cover the candy bar with chocolate using 2 forks, 1 in each hand. When the candy is covered with chocolate, balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off. Carefully place the candy bar onto waxed paper and remove the 2 forks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, and then chill the candy bars until firm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 19002,&quot;Neelys Twice Smashed Baked Potatoes 4 large russet potatoes, each about 3/4 pound each, well scrubbed 1/2 pound broccoli florets, blanched 4 tablespoons softened butter 1/2 cup sour cream 1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar, plus extra for topping 1/2 cup shredded smoked Gouda, plus extra for topping Salt and freshly ground black pepper Butter, for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Scrape the flesh into strands with a fork. Rub the chicken with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 teaspoons coriander and the thyme. Season generously with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip the chicken, transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until cooked through, about 13 minutes. Remove the chicken to a cutting board to rest. Return the skillet with its juices to medium-high heat and add the squash and remaining 1/2 teaspoon coriander. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash has absorbed the juices, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Divide among plates. Combine the pears, lime juice, pomegranate seeds, mint and pistachios in a bowl. Slice the chicken and serve with the squash. Spoon the pear mixture on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 19012,&quot;Apple Pie Pops 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 4 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water 1 pound mixed apples (about 3), such as Granny Smith, Gala and McIntosh 2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon or apple pie spice Pinch of fine salt 1/4 cup sugar All-purpose flour, for dusting the surface 1 large egg, beaten Instructions: For the pie crust: Pulse the flour, shortening, sugar, vinegar and salt in a food processor until it looks like fine meal. Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Sprinkle in 1/4 cup ice water and pulse until the dough begins to come together. Pinch the dough with your fingers; if it doesn&#39;t hold together, add up to 4 more tablespoons ice water 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing and checking the dough after each addition. Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pat each into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or preferably overnight. For the apple pie filling: Peel and core the apples; slice 1/4 inch thick. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the sugar and lemon juice. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apple mixture and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up with a wooden spoon, until very soft, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the flour, cinnamon and salt and cook, stirring, until the juices thicken, about 2 minutes. Let cool completely. Position 2 oven racks in the top and bottom third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Put the sugar in a shallow bowl and set aside. To assemble: Roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into about 20 rounds with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, keeping the dough and rounds cool and rerolling scraps once if neccessary. Repeat with the second disk, for a total of about 40 dough rounds. Divide half of the dough rounds (about 20) between the baking sheets, leaving 1 inch of space around each. Dip the top 1 inch of a wooden ice-pop stick in the beaten egg and lay it on one of the rounds, positioning the tip in the center of the round. Repeat with the remaining sticks and dough rounds on the baking sheets. Dollop a generous teaspoonful of the cold apple filling in the center of each round, covering the tip of each stick. Brush the edges of the rounds with the beaten egg using a pastry brush. Put the remaining dough rounds over the rounds with the filling. Press the edges together gently to seal. Use a fork to crimp the rounds closed completely, making pops. Brush the tops with the remaining beaten egg and dust each pop with a generous pinch of sugar. Using a paring knife, make 5 small slits around the centers of each pop (they&#39;ll look like apple seeds). Bake, reversing the baking sheets top to bottom halfway through, until the dough is golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes. Let the pops cool on the baking sheets until cool enough to touch, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve the pops warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19013,&quot;Slow Cooker Beef Nachos 1? pounds (approximately) beef chuck roast 3 cups CHI-CHI&#39;S?

Toss the sausage links with the oil in a large bowl. Add the sausage to the hot baking sheet, arranging them in 1 layer. Roast, turning halfway through, until lightly browned in spots and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely. Cut each sausage in half crosswise. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, cheese, baking powder, sugar, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter on the large holes of a box grater and add to the bowl along with the scallions. Add the buttermilk and mix together gently with a fork. When a shaggy dough forms, turn it out onto a floured surface. Working quickly, roll out the dough into a 14-by-8-inch rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Trim each side by about an inch, to yield a 12-by-6-inch rectangle with clean edges. Cut twelve 1-inch-wide strips, then cut those strips in half crosswise. (You should have 24 strips, each about 1 inch by 3 inches.) Wrap a biscuit strip around the center of each sausage half and place seam-side down and at least 1 inch apart on a clean baking sheet. Sprinkle a small pinch of cracked black pepper on top of each one. (Refrigerate up to overnight if not baking right away.) Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.

Rub the chicken with the oil and sprinkle with the salt and pepper, then place it breast down in a roasting pan and roast for about 1 1/2 hours, or until well browned, turning it over toward the end to brown the breast. It&#39;s done when the juices run clear, not pink, when you cut into the thigh. When the chicken&#39;s nearly ready, put abundant water on for the pasta, salting it when it boils. Take the chicken out of the oven and take the meat off the bone, leaving all that glorious burnished skin on, and cut it into small pieces. I do much of this by just pulling, without a knife, but if you haven&#39;t got asbestos hands, use a knife and fork or wait until it is cooler. For the sauce, pour all the juices from the roasting pan into a saucepan. Add the rosemary, the drained sultanas and the pine nuts. Begin to simmer the sauce when you are ready to cook the pasta. Cook and drain the pasta, and toss it with the sauce, chicken pieces, and parsley in a large warmed bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 19022,&quot;Cotelettes d&#39;Agneau a la Provencale Lamb Chops Provence-Style 6 lamb chops from the rib 1/4 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped 1 tablespoon scallions, chopped 2 tablespoons mushrooms, chopped 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup dry crumbs of French bread 1/2 cup Champagne (or other dry white wine) 1/2 cup consomme 1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons dry crumbs of French bread 1 tablespoon shallots, chopped 2 teaspoons parsley, chopped 1 teaspoon scallions, chopped 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 orange Instructions: Trim fat from the chops.

Blend for 30 seconds until the mixture is sandy but holds together when pressed between your fingers. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface. It will be crumbly, but once you start kneading, it will all come together. Gather the dough and begin to knead with the heel of your hand until it\u2019s supple and shiny, 1 to 2 minutes. If the dough feels too dry and not springy enough, add a touch of water and continue to knead until it reaches the right consistency. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow it to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Add the pink peppercorns to a small saute pan over medium heat. Toast the peppercorns until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer into a spice grinder and blend. Set aside. Heat a large, high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and the pear and saute, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sauteed pear to a small sheet tray to cool. Add the garlic and stick of butter into the same pan and gently melt over medium heat. Add the walnuts and sage. Cook the butter, swirling occasionally, until the milk solids have separated, and the butter is nutty and browned, but not burned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the apple cider vinegar, then remove the garlic and discard. Stir together the mascarpone and Gorgonzola dolce in a large bowl, beating well with a rubber spatula until fully combined. Add the cooled sauteed pears and 1/4 teaspoon of the toasted pink peppercorns and gently stir to combine. Season to taste with salt. Set up a pastry bag with a large round tip. Fill the bag with the mascarpone and Gorgonzola filling, then set aside. To roll out the pasta, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time (keeping the others covered with plastic wrap so they don\u2019t dry out), flatten the dough with your palm. Feed the dough through your pasta roller on the widest setting. Fold the dough on either end to create an envelope, then feed through the pasta roller a second time. Fold the dough into an envelope again, decrease the pasta roller setting to make it thinner and run the dough through again. Repeat this process of folding and running through the pasta roller two times before decreasing the thickness of the roller, finishing with the thinnest setting. Lay the sheets of pasta on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray and cover with a damp towel while you repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. To fill and shape the agnolotti, lay a pasta sheet on a floured board with one of the long edges closest to you. Brush the edge closest to you with water. Pipe a line of filling down the center of the dough. Fold over the top portion of the dough to meet the edge that\u2019s been brushed with water. Pinch the dough on either side of each mound of filling to seal the dough and to ensure there are no air pockets. Using a fluted pasta wheel, trim the edge of the dough where it\u2019s folded to create a clean edge. Pinch the line of filling into 1-inch mounds. Cut between each mound of filling and pinch the sides. Transfer the agnolotti to a sheet tray dusted with flour and repeat with the remaining dough sheets and filling. Set up a large pot of boiling water and season generously with kosher salt. Add the agnolotti and cook for 2 to 3 minutes; they will cook quickly. Transfer the agnolotti directly into the brown butter sage sauce and toss gently to ensure they\u2019re fully covered. To serve, plate and garnish with more ground pink peppercorns, Parmigiano-Reggiano and pecorino. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 19031,&quot;Famous Roast Garlic Crab 6 Dungeness crabs, about 1 1/4 pounds each, cooked, cleaned, and cracked 3 cups extra-virgin olive oil 20 garlic cloves, finely minced Gray salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 8 (#10) tin cans, lined with newspaper Instructions: Cleaning dungeness crab: Holding the body backside up, place your right thumb in the joint between the upper and lower shell on the side opposite the mouth.

In a large pot, bring 2 quarts chicken stock to a simmer. Add the chicken and return just to a simmer. Cover the chicken with a small heatproof plate to keep it submerged (add more stock if needed). Cover the pot and reduce the heat; gently simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the chicken and let cool slightly, then roughly cut up the meat and set aside; discard the skin and bones. Strain the stock into another large pot. Skim the fat off the surface of the stock using a spoon. Make the batter. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the matzo meal, granulated garlic, baking powder, baking soda, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. In a medium bowl, whisk the 2 whole eggs with the 3 yolks, schmaltz and minced onion. In a separate clean bowl, beat the 3 egg whites with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form. Stir the schmaltz mixture into the dry ingredients, then stir in one-third of the beaten egg whites until incorporated. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites until no streaks remain. Form the matzo balls. Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. In a small bowl, combine the vegetable oil with 1 tablespoon water. Using the oil-and-water mixture to keep your hands moist, roll scoops of batter (about 2 tablespoons each) into balls, handling them as gently as possible (makes 8 to 12). Arrange on the baking sheet and refrigerate 20 minutes so the outsides dry slightly. Make the soup. Tie the dill and parsley sprigs together with kitchen string. Return the chicken stock to a simmer. Add the carrot, celery, diced onion, rutabaga and herb bundle; season with salt and pepper. Return to a simmer and add the matzo balls. Cover and cook over moderate heat, turning the matzo balls a few times, until they are plump and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Stir the chicken into the soup and cook until just warmed through. Remove the herb bundle and season the soup with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 19037,&quot;Gluten-Free Fish Piccata 4 mild white fish fillets (1 pound), such as sole (see Cook&#39;s Note) Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more if needed<br> 5 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 shallot, finely chopped<br> 1/4 cup capers<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice (from about 1/2 lemon), plus 4 thin lemon slices<br> 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped<br> Instructions: Sprinkle both sides of the fish fillets with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. When the fat is sizzling, add 2 fillets and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side and the fish is cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Remove the fillets to a serving platter, leaving any fat behind in the skillet. If the skillet looks dry, add another tablespoon of oil. Repeat the cooking process with the remaining 2 fillets and transfer to the serving platter.<br> Add the shallots to the drippings in the skillet and cook over medium heat until softened slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the capers and continue to cook until the shallots have completely softened, about 2 minutes more. Add the wine and lemon slices, bring to a simmer and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the liquid has reduced by half. Add the lemon juice and remaining 4 tablespoons butter, swirling the pan to emulsify the sauce as the butter melts. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the sauce and lemons over the fish and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 19038,&quot;Buttermilk Roast Chicken 12 chicken drumsticks (approximately 3 pounds total weight) 2 cups buttermilk 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 cloves garlic, bruised and skins removed 1 tablespoon crushed peppercorns 1 tablespoon Maldon salt, sea salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon maple syrup Instructions: Place the chicken drumsticks in a large freezer bag, and add the buttermilk and 1/4 cup of oil. Add the bruised garlic cloves to the bag with the crushed peppercorns and salt. Sprinkle in the ground cumin and finally add the maple syrup, and then squish everything in the freezer bag around to mix the marinade and coat the chicken. Leave the buttermilk marinated chicken in the fridge ideally overnight or out of the fridge for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Take the chicken pieces out of the bag shaking off the excess marinade, and then arrange them in a roasting tin lined with foil. Drizzle over the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil, and then roast in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until brown, even scorched in parts, and juicily cooked through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19039,&quot;Mini Strawberry Princess Cakes 1/2 cup (1 stick; 113 grams) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pan 1 1/4 cups (150 grams) all-purpose flour<br> 3/4 cup (84 grams) almond flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 3/4 cup (145 grams) granulated sugar<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1/2 cup (112 grams) buttermilk<br> 1/4 cup (90 grams) store-bought strawberry jam<br> 1 cup (227 grams) heavy cream 1/2 cup (60 grams) powdered sugar<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1 pound (454 grams) marzipan Purple food coloring, for the cakes<br> Dusty rose food coloring, for the roses<br> Cypress or moss food coloring, for the leaves<br> 2 tablespoons strawberry jam<br> Powdered sugar, for dusting<br> Instructions: For the princess cakes: Place an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a quarter-sheet pan and line with parchment paper. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, salt, baking powder and baking soda. In a separate large bowl, use an electric or stand mixer to beat the butter with the granulated sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla and almond extract and beat well. Add a third of the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Add a third of the buttermilk. Repeat with another third of each, and then the final third, mixing until just combined. Spread the batter out evenly in the quarter-sheet pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Begin checking for doneness at 18 minutes. Let the cake cool fully in the pan (the cake can be made in advance and frozen). For the whipped cream: In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar and salt. Beat to stiff peaks. Spoon the whipped cream into a large pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Refrigerate until ready to use. Use a 2-inch biscuit cutter to cut the cake into 15 circles. Spread the top of each cake circle with a thin layer of jam. Top each with a small mound of whipped cream. Freeze the cakes for 1 hour while you prepare the marzipan. For the marzipan: Separate the marzipan into a 12-ounce ball and two 3-ounce balls. Knead purple food coloring into the 12-ounce ball until the desired color is reached. Wrap in plastic to keep from drying out. Knead dusty rose food coloring into a 3-ounce ball until the desired color is reached. Wrap in plastic. Knead the cypress or moss food coloring into the final 3-ounce ball until the desired color is reached. Again, wrap in plastic until ready to use. In a small mixing bowl, mix together the strawberry jam and 1 tablespoon water until thoroughly combined. Set aside. Roll the purple marzipan out to 1/8-inch thick, dusting with powdered sugar as necessary to prevent sticking. Cut out fifteen 4-inch circles, stacking them with a piece of parchment paper between each one to keep from sticking. Wrap in plastic while you make the roses and leaves. To make the pink roses: Pinch off a small piece of dusty rose marzipan and make little flat snakes. Then coil them to form a rose. Repeat to make 15 roses. To make the leaves: Pinch off a small piece of green marzipan and form into an oval leaf. Repeat to make 30 leaves. Adhere two leaves to each rose using the thinned jam as glue. To assemble the cakes: Remove the cakes from the freezer. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush each purple circle with the thinned jam. Place the circle, jam-side-down, over a cake to cover and gently press all around until the cake is completely covered. Set aside and repeat with the remaining circles until all the cakes are covered. Top each cake with a rose. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to a day or two until serving.

Then add the fish sauce to create a thin paste. You&#39;ll probably need to work in batches. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the coconut milk. Grind the dried chilies and peppercorns together in a spice grinder. Add the lime zest and kaffir leaf pieces, and grind them all together until the mixture is fine and slightly moist. Stir the spice mixture into the coconut milk mixture. Rub the pig down and up (put it in a giant garbage bag or large plastic bin), inside and out with the kosher salt. Then rub the coconut mixture all over the salted pig, inside and out. Put the pig, belly up, in a large heavy-duty trash bag and pour any remaining marinade inside the cavity. Squeeze out as much air as possible from the bag and tie it. Let sit for 2 to 3 days in a large refrigerator. Get a large smoker up to 200 degrees F. Remove the pig from the bag, saving as much of the marinade as possible. Put the pig in the smoker, belly up, and pour the marinade into the belly cavity. While it&#39;s cooking, focus on stoking your fire, maintaining the temperature, and drinking. The piggy is ready when the internal temperature of the thickest part of the shoulder is at 170 degrees F. Any pig over 140 pounds or so will take the full 24 hours. If you&#39;re working with 50-pounders, though, it&#39;ll take closer to 12 hours. Remove the pig from the smoker and transfer it to a large table covered with a plastic tablecloth or tarp. Let it rest for about 20 minutes, but pork-mad people will undoubtedly start ripping into the fatty flesh before you can get it to the table. I know because I&#39;m one of them. Use a heavy-duty, sharp knife to remove the primals, peel the skin, and chop the meat. Be sure to have a catch basin for the juice and fat that will be spilling out from the smoky carcass. Toss the reserved cilantro leaves over the chopped meat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, GSM Blend, Tempranillo]&quot; 19041,&quot;Crispy Garlic-Parmesan Chicken 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts 1/4 cup butter, melted 1 can (18 oz) Progresso?

Bring to a boil, cover, and remove from the heat. Let stand for 1 hour, then drain. Return the beans to the saucepan along with the onion, celery, carrot and bay leaf. Add water to cover by 2 inches. Slowly bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. (If you heat them too fast, the skins may break.) Adjust the heat to maintain a bare simmer and cook, uncovered, until the beans are almost tender, 20 minutes or longer, depending on the age of the beans. Add salt, to taste, and continue cooking until the beans are tender but not mushy. Remove from the heat and let cool in the liquid. (You can prepare the beans to this point 1 to 2 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Drain the beans and discard the vegetables but reserve the liquid. In a preheated casserole pan that can go from the stove top to the oven, pour in 1/4 cup olive oil, add garlic cloves and allow to caramelize, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomato puree, simmer about 10 seconds, then add beans and white bean liquid. Sprinkle top with cherry tomatoes, thyme, parsley, red pepper flakes, and 1 cup olive oil.

Set aside. In a 3 quart heavy saucepan, heat milk and water on medium high. As soon as the mixture boils, reduce heat to medium and add fried pasta. Continue to simmer for 6 minutes, or until pasta is well cooked. Add sugar and simmer 15 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. When the mixture is done, it will have a creamy consistency. While the milk simmers, in the frying pan used for the pasta, fry the raisins and cashews in 2 teaspoons of ghee until lightly browned. Add the fried raisins and nuts and the cardamom to the milk, stir, and remove from the heat. Cover and chill for a few hours or more. Serve warm, reheating if necessary. In a heavy skillet, over medium to medium low heat, heat the butter until it is completely melted. Watch as the butter boils, first with large bubbles and white milk solids floating on the surface, then with only a fine white foam filling the entire surface. Stir occasionally. Soon, small patches of golden brown will appear on the surface, and the overall color of the butter will change from yellow to golden. Push aside the foam periodically to check the color of the sediment. When the sediment turns light brown, remove from the heat. (see note) Decant into a jar with a tight lid. Warm, if desired, for serving over rice. Note: If you heat until the sediment turns dark brown, the ghee will lose it&#39;s flavor and taste like vegetable oil.

Cut off the top and bottom of an orange and place it on the counter flat side down. Cut the outer peel and pith off. Cut into chunks, removing as much pith as possible. Repeat with the remaining citrus fruits (including the zested grapefruit). Add the citrus chunks to a medium saucepot with 1/2 cup of water, the sugar and a handful of mint. Bring to low boil over medium heat and cook, occasionally stir gently making sure not to break up the fruit too much, until slightly syrupy and the sugar is dissolved, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, discard the mint and reserve, it will thicken slightly as it cools. For the Grapefruit Whipped Cream: Add the cream and zest to a stand mixer with a whisk attachment or a bowl with a hand mixer and whip on medium-high speed until peaks are medium-stiff. Refrigerate. For the Angel Food Cake: Preheat your outdoor grill to medium heat. Slice the angel food cake in half along the equator. Place each half on the grill and toast on both sides until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes per side. Place the bottom of the grilled angel food cake on a platter and spoon about half of the whipped cream over top. Use a slotted spoon to spoon some of the citrus compote over the whipped cream (don\u2019t use too much syrup or the whipped cream will be too runny). Place the top half of the cake on top (like a whipped cream sandwich). Spoon the other half of the whipped cream over top and spoon more of the citrus compote on. Garnish with mint leaves. Slice and serve like a layer cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 19047,&quot;Radish Salad 2 tablespoons apple cider 2 tablespoons orange juice 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 ounces radishes, trimmed and each cut into wedges 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion Instructions: In a large bowl whisk together the cider, orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.

Check the temperature of the mixture and microwave in 30 second increments until it reaches 180 degrees F. Cover and steep 15 minutes. Place the eggs and yolks in a blender with an 8-cup carafe. Blend on the lowest speed for 30 seconds. Raise the speed to quarter power and slowly add the sugars and blend until thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Add the remaining 2 cups half-and-half. With the machine still running, pour in the spiced half-and-half through a small hand strainer and add the rum. Use immediately, or store covered in the refrigerator for up to 72 hours. Preheat the oven on the lowest (or warm) setting. Cut a 7-inch round disk off the top of the boule using a long bread knife or serrated slicer. Tear the disk into pieces and scatter in a large roasting pan. Cut all the way around the inside of the boule just inside the outer wall. Cut downward and across the interior of the bread, first in one direction, then 90 degrees to it to create a grid, the way you would cube mango flesh to remove it from the skin. Remove the plugs of bread and tear into hunks about the size of an egg. Add to the roasting pan and bake until bread is dry, 1/2 to 2 hours. Sprinkle the fruit over the bread, pour in the custard, and press the bread to submerge all the pieces. Cover and soak for 2 hours at room temperature or for up to 8 hours in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Pour the melted butter into a spray bottle and spritz the inside of the bread shell. Be sure to cover the bottom with a thin layer to prevent the custard from soaking through. Place the bread shell in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet and place in the oven to toast the interior for 30 minutes. Remove the bread shell from the oven and transfer the soaked bread mixture into the shell. Bake until the bread pudding souffles and reaches an internal temperature of 165 to 170 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove and cool 30 minutes before slicing or scooping and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 19049,&quot;Star-Studded Berry Tarts For the crusts: 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 cup pecans 6 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 large egg, beaten For the pastry cream: 1 cup whole milk 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons buttermilk 3 large egg yolks 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1 pint raspberries 1 pint blueberries Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Make the crusts: Pulse the flour, pecans, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor until the nuts are finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Drizzle in 6 tablespoons ice water and pulse until the dough comes together. Turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap and form into a disk; wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Lightly flour a large sheet of parchment paper. Roll out the dough on the parchment into a 9-by-13-inch rectangle. Trim into an 8-by-12-inch rectangle (reserve the scraps). Cut into eight 3-by-4-inch rectangles. Separate the pieces slightly on the parchment, then use your fingers to crimp the edges. Slide the parchment onto a baking sheet. Roll out the scraps until 1/4 inch thick. Cut out 8 stars using a small floured star-shaped cookie cutter; arrange on the baking sheet around the crusts. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Poke holes in the crusts with a fork. Brush the stars and the edges of the crusts with the beaten egg. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes; remove to a rack to cool completely. Make the pastry cream: Combine the milk, 1/3 cup granulated sugar and the vanilla in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk 1/2 cup buttermilk, the egg yolks, cornstarch and the remaining 1/3 cup sugar in a bowl. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly.

Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and slightly translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the pumpkin, stock and half-and-half and stir to combine. Season generously with salt and pepper, reduce heat to medium low and cook 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, then transfer the mixture to the bowl of a food processor. **Puree for 10 seconds, until very smooth. Pour through a fine strainer into a clean pot. Add 6 tablespoons of butter and stir to combine. In a small skillet, warm 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat until gently bubbling. Add the bread cubes, stir to coat with the butter and saute until golden brown. Transfer croutons using a slotted spoon to a small bowl lined with a paper towel. Raise the heat under the soup to medium high and heat until very hot for several minutes but not boiling, stirring frequently with a whisk to blend the butter and to keep the soup from burning on the bottom. Ladle soup into bowls, sprinkle with diced Gruyere, croutons, chives and rosemary. *Cooks note: Can replace fresh pumpkin with 1 (16-ounce) can of pumpkin puree and reduce the cooking time from 30 to 15 minutes. ** When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 19051,&quot;Sherry-Shallot Vinaigrette 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 2 tablespoons chopped shallots Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Whisk together the vinegar, shallots and a generous pinch of salt in a small bowl.

Whisk in a couple turns of freshly ground black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Viognier, Vermentino, Gavi, Albari?o]&quot; 19052,&quot;Tortilla de Patata (Spanish Potato Omelet) 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil (preferably Spanish, Arbequina olive oil variety) 1 large onion, chopped 1 3/4 pounds potatoes, halved lengthwise and very thinly sliced Salt 8 eggs Baguette slices, for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil to medium-high heat in a 12-inch cast-iron or nonstick skillet. Add the onions and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the potato slices, season with salt and cook over low and slow heat until the potatoes are softened and lightly golden brown around the edges, 30 to 40 minutes, gently shaking the pan from time to time to prevent the potato slices from sticking. When the potatoes are ready, reserve 2 tablespoons of the olive oil from the skillet (now infused with the flavor of those onions and potatoes) and drain the potatoes in a colander or on a paper towel. Beat the eggs with a generous pinch of salt in a large bowl for about 1 minute. Add the drained caramelized potatoes and onions and stir with a fork to lightly break up the potatoes (this will give the finished Tortilla de Patata a wonderful light fluffy texture). Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons of the reserved olive oil in the same skillet until very hot. Pour in the egg and potato mixture and cook on one side, gently shaking the pan occasionally, until the underside is set and very lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Using a plate to cover the pan, carefully invert the omelet onto the plate and then gently slide the omelet back into the pan to cook on the other side until just set and light golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Do not overcook. This Tortilla de Patata is best when barely runny in the very center. Serve immediately with some slices of fresh baguette, or make ahead to serve later in the day at room temperature.

Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely is better here). Crack the eggs into the hole and add the olive oil, squid ink and some salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, squid ink and salt; then begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture, being careful not to break the sides of the well or else the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together into a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading, it is VERY important to put your body weight into it; get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader, or 10 to 15 minutes for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it; you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let it rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes. If using immediately, do not refrigerate. Roll and cut the pasta into the desired shape. How smooth and supple! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 19056,&quot;Crema de Tamate con Ovo 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic, smashed 3 medium onions, finely diced 3 ounces of chorizo, finely sliced 1 1/2 pounds celery heart, thinly sliced 4 cups tomato puree 4 cups hot chicken stock Salt Black pepper 1 sprig of oregano (or 1/4 teaspoon dried, tied in muslin or cheesecloth) 2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley stalks 4 tablespoons mashed potato 1 cup dry white wine 12 eggs, at room temperature Nutmeg, to season Instructions: In large pot, add olive oil, garlic, and onion.

Pat the spice rub onto the meat, making sure to heavily season the entire surface area of the brisket. Cover or wrap the brisket and let it sit at room temperature while getting the smoker or charcoal grill fired up. Do not leave at room temperature for longer than 1 hour. The grill is ready when the charcoal has burned to a white ash. If using a grill instead of a smoker, arrange the coals on 1 side of the grill, leaving an area large enough for the brisket to cook indirectly with no coals directly underneath the meat. When the grill has reached 200 to 225 degrees F, scatter 1/4 of the wood chips over the coals, close the grate, put the brisket on the grill and close the lid. Maintain a 200 to 225 degree F cooking temperature inside the grill, adding coals every 2 hours or as necessary. Add wood chips and spray the brisket with apple juice every time you add new coals. Try not to lift the lid of the grill at any other time. When the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 165 to 170 degrees F on an instant read meat thermometer (after about 4 to 5 hours), remove it from the grill and double wrap in aluminum foil to keep the juices from leaking out. Return the brisket to the grill (or smoker) The brisket is finished cooking when it is very tender and reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, about another 1 to 2 hours.

Add the evaporated milk, Dijon and hot sauce and whisk together until uniform and smooth. Toss the grated cheeses, Gorgonzola and cornstarch together in a bowl until totally coated. Whisk the cheese into the saucepan and heat, stirring constantly, until all the cheese is melted and the sauce is silky and smooth, about 5 minutes. For the cheesesteaks: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the sub rolls all over the outside and inside with the oil and set them on a sheet pan. Bake until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the oil and the meat in a nice even layer. Season with the garlic salt. Now, don&#39;t move the meat. Let it get a nice crispy crust, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs, flip the mound of meat to give the top of the pile some heat exposure. Top with a few ladles of the cheese sauce. Mix it around a bit until the succulent cheese and the crispy meaty bits all marry into one homogenous nebulous mass, then take off the heat immediately to preserve all that juiciness! Divide the meat among the rolls, stuffing each roll to the brim. Top with additional cheese sauce, some sliced roasted red peppers and crispy fried onions. Serve with some BBQ chips, a cheesesteak bib and about 6 cold light beers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 19076,&quot;Clam Chowder 3 sprigs fresh thyme, plus 1 more sprig 3 sprigs fresh parsley 2 garlic cloves 15 to 20 whole black peppercorns 2 cups white wine 1 cup water 1 1/2 pounds littleneck clams, cleaned 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed 2 ounces smoked bacon, chopped 1 small onion or 1/2 large onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 inner stalks celery, diced 1 small carrot, diced 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 russet potato, peeled and diced 1 cup milk 1 lemon, juiced Pinch cayenne 1/3 cup heavy cream Salt and freshly ground pepper Croutons, recipe follows, for garnish Fresh thyme sprigs, for garnish, optional 1 loaf sourdough bread, crusts removed, cubed Garlic and Chili Oil, recipe follows 1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 whole head garlic (about 2 1/2 ounces, cloves separated and peeled) 2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes Instructions: Make a bouquet garni by placing the 3 sprigs thyme, parsley, garlic cloves, and peppercorns in cheesecloth and tying with kitchen twine. Add wine, water, and bouquet garni to a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the clams, cover with a lid, and cook until clams open. Strain the clams into a bowl, reserving both the juice and clams. Return the pan to the heat, add olive oil, and heat over medium-high heat. Add bacon and cook until crispy. Add onion and cook for 1 minute. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add celery and carrot and cook until tender. Sprinkle flour into pan, stir to make a roux, and cook until flour is incorporated; do not let roux brown. Add more oil if mixture seems dry. Add 1 more fresh thyme sprig, and return the strained clam cooking liquid to the pan and bring to a simmer for 30 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Add potato, milk, lemon juice, and cayenne and simmer until potato is tender. Meanwhile, remove clams from their shells and roughly chop clams. When potato is tender, add clams back into the pan, add cream, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir to combine, and as soon as clams are heated through, remove from the heat. Ladle soup into serving bowls. Garnish each with croutons and a sprig of fresh thyme. Serve immediately. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place bread cubes in a large bowl.

Add the red pepper flakes and infuse for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Refrigerate in a covered container for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 19077,&quot;Pukkolla Composed cereal (recipe follows) Milk to cover 1 Granny Smith apple, washed, unpeeled, cut in half 8 large handfuls organic Scottish porridge oats 2 large handfuls ground bran 1 large handfuls chopped dried apricots 1 handful chopped dried dates 1 handful crumbled walnuts 1 handful smashed or chopped almonds, hazelnuts or Brazil nuts Instructions: I would definitely try to make this the night or day before you want to eat it, although it can be made at the time (although you won?t get the smooth silky scrumptious texture that the milk gives it overnight). I normally place double the amount of composed cereal I need (ie. 4 portions for 2 people) into a bowl. Doubling up like this gives you enough to eat for the next couple of days. Cover with milk, grate in half an apple per person and stir immediately to stop the apple discoloring. Place in the refrigerator.; Add porridge oats and bran to a large plastic container with apricots and dates. Crumble in walnuts and add chosen nuts (I usually bash them in a tea towel). At this point feel free to improvise, adding any other preferred dried fruits like raisins, sultanas, strawberries or figs, but personally I think the above combination works pretty well. This will keep for a good couple of months very happily in an airtight container, but you?ll have eaten it by then, I guarantee. The great thing about it is that you can adjust it to your own preference, but I would suggest you stick to the basic dried ingredients that I use as they work so well together. It?s very handy to have a large plastic airtight container to store your composed Pukkolla in, so try and get a hold of one.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 19078,&quot;Lemon Marble Cheesecake Grated zest of 1/2 lemon 1/3 cup strained lemon juice 5 tablespoons sugar 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup sugar 2 cups (2 percent) low fat small curd cottage cheese, drained at least 30 minutes in a strainer set over a bowl in the refrigerator 8 ounces Neufchatel Cream Cheese 3 large eggs 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 teaspoon strained lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 to 4 tablespoons graham cracker or Zwieback crumbs or crushed Chocolate Cookies or gingersnaps<br> 8-inch round pan with a solid bottom (no spring form), at least 2 inches deep.

To prepare the butternut squash, cut off the top and bottom, then use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to remove the hard skin. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds with a spoon. Slice the squash into sticks and then slice the sticks into cubes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small skillet or saucepan over low heat. Put the squash in a bowl and pour in the melted butter. Sprinkle with the red pepper flakes and some salt and pepper and toss to combine. Spread the squash out on a rimmed baking sheet and roast, shaking the baking sheet once or twice during roasting, until tender and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Set aside to cool. Put the pine nuts in a small skillet over low heat and slowly toast them, stirring, until golden brown and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Set aside off heat. Add the olive oil, red wine vinegar and balsamic glaze to a mason jar, sprinkle in a little salt and pepper and shake to mix. Put the kale in a bowl and toss with enough dressing to lightly coat. Transfer the kale to a rectangular serving platter. Sprinkle over the squash, tuck pieces of prosciutto in among the kale, sprinkle over the pine nuts and top with Parmesan shavings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 19092,&quot;Fettuccine Pasta with Prosciutto, Peas, and a Cream Sauce 1 pound fettuccine pasta 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3/4 cup diced onions 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 ounces prosciutto, cut into 1/4-inch strips 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 3/4 cup frozen sweet peas 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper 3/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: Set a large pot of water with a pasta insert over high heat and bring to a boil. Place the pasta in the water and return to a boil, being sure to stir the pasta until the water boils again. While the pasta cooks, set a large 12-inch saute pan over medium high heat, and add the olive oil and the butter. Once the butter has melted, add the onions to the pan and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic to the pan and saute for 30 seconds. Place the prosciutto in the pan and saute for 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with wine and cook until it is nearly evaporated, about 30 seconds. Add the cream, peas, salt and pepper to the pan and let the cream reduce by half, 4 to 5 minutes. If the pasta is not yet cooked, turn the fire off the sauce while the pasta continues to cook. Strain the pasta from the water once it is cooked, and place in a large heat resistant bowl. Pour the sauce over the pasta and sprinkle with the cheese and the parsley. Use tongs are two large forks to stir the sauce into the pasta and serve while hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 19093,&quot;Red Miso Kimchi 2 heads napa cabbage 1/2 cup kosher salt<br> 1 cup shredded carrots<br> 1 cup shredded daikon<br> 1/2 cup cl garlic sauce<br> 1/2 cup coarse ground gochugaru (Korean red pepper)<br> 1/2 cup red miso paste 2 tablespoons minced garlic<br> 2 tablespoons minced ginger<br> Instructions: Cut napa cabbage into 2-inch pieces, then wash the pieces in a colander and transfer to a large bowl.

If it is too close, the chicken will cook too fast, burn and dry out. Pile the charcoal in a pyramid. Ignite the charcoal with lighter fluid. Once the top portion of the charcoal has turned white, spread the charcoal out evenly using a fireproof tool such as a metal rake or shovel. Place the chicken on the cooking surface. Approximately every 5 minutes, turn the chicken with tongs (being careful not to tear the skin) and baste with the sauce each time (for best results, used a clean shaker or squeeze bottle). Grill for approximately 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Add charcoal, if necessary, to finish off (maybe 1/2 to 2/3 way through the cooking process) and be sure not to use lighter fluid, just sprinkle the new charcoal over the existing. The chicken is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 19095,&quot;Creole Crawfish Etouffee 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 stalk celery, diced 1 onion, diced 1 small green bell pepper, diced 3 cloves garlic, minced 3/4 cup chicken stock or reduced-fat low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 pound shelled crawfish tails 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper Cooked rice, for serving 2 scallions, white and pale green parts only, chopped Instructions: Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Drain in a colander in the sink and rinse under cold running water. Shake the colander to drain off excess water and pat the noodles dry with a towel. Heat 1/4 cup of the peanut oil in a large seasoned or non-stick skillet over high heat. Add the noodles, spreading them out to evenly cover the skillet, and fry, turning once, until golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. (Break the noodles up, by stirring, near the end of the cooking). Transfer noodles to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt to taste. Set aside. Discard any excess oil and wipe out the pan. Whisk together the chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, cornstarch, and sugar in a small bowl, and set aside. Season the chicken with the dark sesame oil, salt, and pepper, and set aside. Heat the skillet over high heat. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons peanut oil until very hot. Add the ginger, garlic, and scallion and stir-fry, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Reserve until needed. For the O-Towner donuts: Place the milk and eggs in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add the flours, sugar, shortening, salt and yeast and mix with dough hook on slow speed for 6 minutes. The dough should be all together and perfectly soft. Take out of the bowl and shape into a ball. Line a small tray with wax paper and lightly spray with nonstick spray, then place the dough ball on top and cover lightly with plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick spray. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour, then refrigerate for 1 hour. Place dough on a lightly floured table. Push down with your hands to form a small square, then using a rolling pin, roll out to an 11-inch square. Spread butter on dough, keeping it centered. Fold the dough over the butter like a letter. Next, roll out dough into a long rectangle, about 30 to 35 inches. Do a book fold by bringing each end towards each other meeting in the middle, then folding one side over the other. (This is one book fold.) Let the dough rest 10 minutes and repeat the process, rolling to 30 to 35 inches and doing a second book fold. (If dough is hard to roll, let rest 5 minutes; see Cook&#39;s Note.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour. Unwrap dough and place on a floured table. Start to roll out the dough again to 30 to 35 inches, and give a third book fold. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes. Take out and unwrap, then place on a lightly floured table and roll out again to 30 to 35 inches. Make its last book fold (that will be its fourth). Roll the dough on a lightly floured table to about 1 inch thick and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut out 4-inch circles of dough, then use a 2-inch round cutter to cut the centers out so they look like doughnuts. Place the round doughnuts evenly on lightly-floured dry dishcloths or baker&#39;s linen separated by 1 inch each, and cover with dry dishcloths or baker&#39;s linen. Let sit at room temperature, or even better, a warm part of your kitchen, until almost doubled, about 2 hours. Heat a few inches canola oil or shortening in a large Dutch oven to 400 degrees F using a thermometer to be very accurate, and carefully add the doughnuts. Let cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and fry 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and roll right away in cinnamon sugar and leave on a wire rack to cool. For the filling: Place raspberry jam in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the whipped cream until well combined. Flip the O-Towners upside down. Using a paring knife, poke 3 holes in a donut, twisting the knife at each incision and then pulling out: one at 2 o&#39;clock, one at 6 o&#39;clock, and one at 10 o&#39;clock. Fill a piping bag fitted with a 1/4-inch tip halfway with Pistachio Pastry Cream, then carefully insert the tip into the 3 holes you made and carefully fill the doughnuts. Use you fingers to clean any cream that spills out anywhere. Flip the doughnut right-side up again. Fill a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip halfway with raspberry filling. Pipe a perfect circle on top of the doughnut and garnish with a fresh raspberry and any other garnish you want. Remember, the simpler it looks, the better. Place the milk, pistachio paste and scraped vanilla seeds in a pot and bring to a simmer, whisking to incorporate the ingredients. Mix together the cornstarch and sugar in a bowl, then add the eggs and whisk until smooth. Pour in a quarter of the hot milk mixture, and whisk to combine. Take the pot off the heat and while whisking, quickly scrape all the egg mixture into the pot. Turn the heat back on to medium-high and cook, whisking constantly, to bring to a boil. Take off heat and add the butter, whisking in until smooth. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Take a tray and line it with plastic wrap, then scrape all the pastry cream onto the tray. Cover the hot cream with more plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Place the pastry cream in a stand mixer and whip up using a paddle until smooth. Fold in the whipped cream with a rubber spatula. The mixture should be smooth and perfectly thick, like a pudding. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19101,&quot;Chocolate Hazelnut Pull-Apart Bread 1 cup cold heavy cream 1 tablespoon hazelnut liqueur<br> 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/2 cup blanched hazelnuts (2 1/2 ounces) 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> Two 11-ounce tubes French bread dough, such as Pillsbury 2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon chocolate hazelnut spread<br> 1/2 cup semisweet mini chocolate chips<br> 2 tablespoons heavy cream<br> Instructions: For the whipped cream: Add the cream, liqueur and confectioners&#39; sugar to a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment. Whip on high speed until soft peaks form. Hold in the refrigerator until ready to serve, up to 3 hours. (Makes 2 cups.) For the pull-apart bread: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool completely. Finely chop and set aside. In a small bowl, mix together the granulated sugar, cinnamon and salt. Set aside. Lightly brush the loaf pan with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter. Line the pan with parchment paper, leaving at least 2 inches of overhang on the long sides to serve as handles later. Lightly brush the parchment with melted butter, then dust the entire pan with 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon sugar mixture; reserve the remaining cinnamon sugar. Tap out any excess sugar from the pan. Unroll one tube of bread dough on a very lightly floured work surface. The dough should form a 12-by-15-inch rectangle; stretch the dough a bit if small. With the long side parallel to you, spread the dough with 2/3 cup of the chocolate hazelnut spread, leaving a 1/4-inch boarder. Sprinkle with the chocolate chips and then with 1/4 cup of the chopped hazelnuts. Unroll the second tube of dough and lay it on top of the first. Brush the top with melted butter and sprinkle with the reserved cinnamon sugar mixture. With a ruler and a chef&#39;s knife, mark the short side of the dough at 4-inch intervals. Cutting parallel to you, slice the dough straight across at each mark, into three 4-inch-wide strips. Next, mark the long side of the dough at 3-inch intervals and cut the dough, perpendicular to you, along those marks; you will now have fifteen 3-by-4-inch rectangles. Evenly stack three of the rectangles on top of each other so that the bottom piece of dough, without any sugar on it, lays against a piece of dough that does have sugar on it. Place the stack of dough into the loaf pan on its 4-inch side so that the dough fills the width of the pan. Continue stacking pieces of dough and placing the stacks in the loaf pan until all of the rectangles are inside the pan. As you go, you may have to use one hand to hold up the dough already in the pan and gently push it back to make room for all of the dough. Using a pairing knife, cut the dough in the loaf pan lengthwise down the middle, cutting three-quarters of the way through, essentially splitting the dough in half. Place the pan on a baking sheet, cover with foil and bake for 55 to 60 minutes. The bread is done when the entire loaf has turned a deep golden brown and the sugar is caramelized and bubbling up the sides of the pan. Remove from the oven and let cool for 20 minutes. While the bread cools, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon chocolate hazelnut spread and the heavy cream in a bowl until smooth. Hold at room temperature until ready to serve. Remove the bread from the loaf pan while still warm, so the caramel does not completely set. Use a bread knife to loosen the sides of the bread that does not have parchment and then lift the bread out of the pan using the parchment handles. Remove the parchment and place the pull-apart bread on a serving tray. Drizzle with the chocolate hazelnut drizzle and sprinkle with the remaining chopped hazelnuts. Serve with the hazelnut whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 19102,&quot;Sole Meuniere 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 tablespoons Clarified Butter, recipe follows Four 2- to 2 1/2-ounce skinless, boneless sole fillets, preferably gray or lemon<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted good European-style butter, cut into small pieces<br> 1 tablespoon capers, drained, optional<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon (about 2 tablespoons juice)<br> 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley<br> 2 sticks (1/2 pound) unsalted butter (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Place an oven-safe platter in the oven to warm. Spread the flour on a plate or pie dish. Heat the Clarified Butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper on both sides. Dredge the fish in the flour and shake off any excess. Once the Clarified Butter is hot, add the fish to the skillet and sear, occasionally basting the fish with the butter in the skillet, until golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Carefully turn the fish over and cook the other side until golden but the fish is still slightly springy to the touch, about another minute. (If the fish flakes easily, it&#39;s overcooked.) Transfer the fish to the warmed platter. Return the skillet to medium-high heat and add the European butter. Cook until it melts, then turns lightly browned and smells nutty. Add the capers, if using, and season with salt and pepper. Add the lemon juice\u2014the butter will splutter\u2014and swirl the skillet to incorporate. Spoon the sauce over the fish, then garnish with the parsley and serve. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Continue to cook until a layer of white milk solids floats to the surface and the butter becomes foamy. Lower the heat to medium and continue to gently boil. The milk solids will sink to the bottom of the pan. Once the boiling has stopped, pour the butter through a cheesecloth-lined strainer into a glass measuring cup or heatproof bowl to filter out the milk solids. Cover and store in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19103,&quot;Gazpacho Andaluz 4 ounces day old bread, crusts removed, cut into 2 1/2-inch cubes 2 cloves garlic 2 pounds ripe tomatoes, about 5 to 6 medium tomatoes, seeded 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup olive oil, preferably extra-virgin 2 tablespoons wine vinegar 1 1/2 cups water Chopped green pepper Chopped onion Chopped cucumber Croutons or diced bread, toasted crisp Chopped hard boiled egg Chopped tomatoes Instructions: Put the bread in a bowl and add water to cover. Let soak for 5 minutes until softened. Squeeze out the water and place the bread in a blender container (or, if using a hand-held blender, into a mixing bowl) with the garlic. Blend until the bread and garlic are smooth. To seed the tomatoes: cut out the stem and core, then cut the tomatoes in half crosswise. Either spoon out the seeds or else squeeze the tomatoes through a sieve placed over a bowl. The seeds will squeeze out; the juice will collect in the bowl. It is then ready to be added to the gazpacho as pulp. Add the tomato pulp to the bread and garlic, and puree. Add the cumin and salt and, with the motor running, add the olive oil in a slow stream. As the oil is incorporated, the gazpacho will turn from red tomato-juice to a paler, peacher color. Blend in the vinegar. Thin the gazpacho with water to the desired consistency. Place the blended contents in a tureen, bowl or pitcher. Chill until serving time. Place each of the garnishes in separate small bowls or on a divided relish dish and pass them around the table when the gazpacho is served. Each person can add their desired spoonfuls on to their gazpacho. This gazpacho can also be served, thinned with additional water, in tall glasses for sipping, without the garnishes. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Tempranillo, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 19104,&quot;Perfect Paella 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 3 cloves garlic, crushed 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 cups enriched white rice 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads 1 bay leaf 1 quart chicken broth or stock 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1 1/2 pounds chicken tenders, cut into thirds Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 1 medium onion, chopped 3/4 pound chorizo, casing removed and sliced on an angle 1 pound peeled and deveined large shrimp, 24 shrimp 18 green lipped mussels, cleaned 1 cup frozen peas 2 lemons zested 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 4 scallions, chopped Lemon wedges Crusty, bread for passing Instructions: In a very wide pan or paella pan, preheated over medium high heat, add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, crushed garlic, red pepper flakes, add rice and saute 2 or 3 minutes.

Bake the sweet potatoes: Place the sweet potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Put the baking sheet in the center of the oven and bake until the potatoes completely yield when pierced with the tip of a knife, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. For the meat: In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until smoking lightly. Add the ground turkey in small pieces and cook until browned and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer the meat with a slotted spoon to a large bowl. Add the onions, carrot and celery to the skillet, then season with salt and pepper, and cook until the vegetables are translucent and tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour off any excess grease. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl with the meat. Stir in the peas, broth and vinegar. Taste for seasoning. Make the brown butter for the sweet potatoes: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter completely over medium heat. Wait until it starts to simmer and turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Dip a pastry brush in the butter and grease the bottom and sides of a 2-quart oval or rectangular baking dish; set aside. Remove the butter from the heat and stir in the brown sugar, molasses, ginger and cinnamon. Set aside and keep warm. Make the pure: Let the roasted potatoes cool until still hot but cool enough to handle. Place them on a flat surface and cut them in half. Use a large spoon to scoop out the flesh. Discard the skins and put the flesh in a food processor. Pulse until the flesh starts to break down, then add the brown butter mixture, milk, orange zest and salt and pepper to taste. Alternatively, run the potatoes through a food mill into a large bowl, then add the brown butter, milk, orange zest and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. Lower the oven to 375 degrees F. Spoon all of the meat mixture into an even layer in the baking dish. Dollop the mashed sweet potatoes over the meat, then spread the potatoes into a layer. Place the dish on a baking sheet in the center of the oven and bake until the center is hot when poked with the tip of a knife and the top is browned, 30 to 35 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19110,&quot;Blueberry Cobbler 8 cups fresh blueberries 2/3 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 tablespoons cold salted butter, cut into pieces 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 heaping tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 1/2 sticks cold salted butter, cut into pieces<br> 3/4 cup milk<br> 1 large egg<br> Vanilla ice cream, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Microwave, uncovered, on high (at 100 percent power) until the broth is hot but not boiling, 1 1/2 minutes in an 1,100-watt oven or 2 1/2 minutes in a 700-watt oven. Let sit for 5 minutes. Remove the porcini pieces from the liquid with a slotted spoon, squeezing out excess moisture in the process. Chop the porcini coarsely. Reserve the chopped porcini and the porcini broth separately. Place the shallots, garlic, cremini and shiitake mushrooms, 2 tablespoons of the butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a microwave-safe 8-by-8-by-2-inch baking dish. Cover tightly with 2 pieces of plastic wrap; make a small slit in the center with the tip of a paring knife to vent excess steam. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) until all the vegetables have softened, 5 minutes in an 1,100-watt oven or 9 minutes in a 700-watt oven. (When removing the plastic, be careful to avoid the hot steam.) If some of the vegetables still seem a little raw, stir and microwave again, covered, in 30-second increments. Add the rice to the baking dish, and stir to coat the grains. Add the white wine, 1 1/2 cups of the remaining chicken broth, reserved porcini broth (leaving the sediment at the bottom of the cup) and chopped porcini, thyme and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover and microwave on high (at 100 percent power) for 8 minutes in an 1,100-watt oven or 10 minutes in a 700-watt oven. Stir the risotto, and add the remaining 1 cup chicken broth. Cover and microwave on high (at 100 percent power) until the rice is cooked but with the faintest bite in the center, 9 minutes in an 1,100-watt oven or 15 minutes in a 700-watt oven. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, Parmesan and parsley, and stir vigorously until creamy. At this stage, the risotto should be thick but pourable from a spoon; if it&#39;s too stiff, splash in more broth. Let sit, covered, for 2 minutes to rest and come together. Serve with a sprinkling of grated Parmesan on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19119,&quot;Simple Taco Salad 1 pound ground round beef (85% lean) 1 can (16 oz each) beans in chili seasoned sauce 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 can (10 oz each) Ro*Tel?

Slice into 12 thin strips about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide. Trim off fat or skin and pound until very thin. Lay slices out on board or table, 4 rows of 3 slices. Trim 12 toothpicks to 2 inches. If longer, it will impede browning. Season hard boiled egg halves with salt and pepper. Place 1 half on the end of each of the slices in the first row. Roll up and secure with a toothpick. At ends of second row of veal, lay a slice of ham and spread 1 teaspoon of mustard over ham. Roll up and secure as before. At ends of last row of veal, lay 2 asparagus tips, cut to fit. Season with salt and pepper. Roll up and secure as before. Season flour well with salt and pepper. Add clarified butter to large saute pan over medium heat. Roll the veal rolls in the flour. In separate bowl, beat eggs. Add cheese to eggs. Coat veal rolls with egg mixture. Place in saute pan and cook for about 2 minutes on all sides (4 sides), careful not to burn. Remove to a serving platter and remove toothpicks. Keep warm. Pour off excess fat in pan. Add Worcestershire sauce, any remaining egg and cheese mixture, parsley, and butter. Stir and serve atop each rollito.

Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 19132,&quot;Apple-Cherry Lattice Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 3 tablespoons ice water 3 tablespoons cold vodka 3 pounds assorted apples (such as Cortland, Granny Smith and McIntosh) Juice of 1 lemon 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup jarred cherries in syrup or whole cherry jam 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon pure almond or vanilla extract Pinch of allspice 1 large egg, lightly beaten Coarse sugar, for sprinkling Instructions: Make the crust: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor to combine. Add one-quarter of the butter; process until it disappears into the flour, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture looks like cornmeal with bean-size bits of butter. Combine the water and vodka and drizzle over the flour mixture. Pulse until the dough just starts coming together but stop before it gathers into a ball. Divide evenly between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and gently pat each into a disk, using the plastic wrap to help you. (If the dough seems dry with large bits of butter, turn it out onto a work surface and use the heel of your hand to press the dough together.) Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Make the filling: Peel and thinly slice the apples; toss in a bowl with the lemon juice. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add the apples and cook, tossing occasionally, until juicy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; fold in the cherries, flour, extract and allspice. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate; refrigerate until ready to fill. Place a piece of parchment paper on an inverted baking sheet. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round, transfer to the parchment and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Transfer the dough (on the parchment) to a work surface. Using a fluted pastry wheel or a chef&#39;s knife, cut the dough into 14 to 16 half-inch-wide strips. Weave into a lattice on the parchment. Slide back onto the baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Pour the filling into the crust. Gently slide the lattice off the parchment and onto the fruit, adjusting as needed; trim the excess dough if needed, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhanging dough under itself. Brush the lattice with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Refrigerate the pie 30 minutes. Position a rack in the lowest position of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Place the pie on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer to a rack and let cool at least 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19133,&quot;Potato Latkes, with Variations 1-1/2 pounds russet potatoes peeled 1/4 cup finely chopped shallots 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 2 tablespoons flour (or more) or matzo meal (during Passover) 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil for frying Instructions: In a food processor grate the potatoes. Line a sieve with cheesecloth and transfer potatoes to the sieve. Set sieve over a bowl, twist cheesecloth into a pouch, squeezing out some moisture. Let mixture drain for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, pour off liquid from the bowl but leave the white potato starch that settles in the bottom of the bowl. To that starch add shallots, eggs, flour, 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt and freshly ground pepper. Return drained potatoes to this mixture and toss to combine. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Line a baking pan with paper towels. When you are ready to eat, in a large skillet heat 1/4 inch of oil over medium high heat until hot. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of potato mixture and cook for 3 to 4 minutes a side; latkes should be golden and crisp on both sides. Eat right away or keep warm in oven.

Spend a few minutes gently brushing along the underside of the mushrooms to get rid of any bugs and dirt that might be hiding there. This is well worth the effort. Finely chop your parsley, stalks and all, reserving a few of the leaves. Put the butter into a large hot pan and as soon as it starts to melt add a drizzle of olive oil, the mushrooms, sliced onion, and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Stir everything around and cook for about 8 minutes, or until the onions have softened and the mushrooms are starting to caramelize and take on colour. Add the chopped parsley, then pour in the cream. Continue to stir and cook for another minute, until the cream has come to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for a minute before removing from the heat. Add a good squeeze of lemon juice, have a taste, and add more salt, pepper or lemon juice if it needs it. Take your bread out of the oven and tear it into big chunks. Divide the mushrooms among the plates and scatter over the reserved parsley leaves. Serve with the chunks of bread on the side to mop up all the creamy mushroomy juices, and tuck in! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 19135,&quot;Almond Butter Brownies 1/2 cup coconut oil, melted and cooled slightly, plus additional for greasing the pan One 18.3-ounce box brownie mix, such as Duncan Hines<br> 2 large eggs<br> 3/4 cup natural crunchy almond butter 1/4 cup powdered sugar<br> 2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted and cooled slightly<br> 1/2 teaspoon flaky salt<br> Instructions: For the brownies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the cheese and pistachios, and with the processor running, drizzle in the olive oil. Scrape down sides and pulse a few more times. Adjust seasoning, if necessary. Gently work half of the pesto under the breast skin. Reserve the other half of the pesto. Put the other lemon half into the cavity along with the remaining 2 peeled garlic cloves. Rub the chicken all over with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Season the outside of the chicken with the remaining salt and pepper. Tuck the wing tips under the bird, and truss the chicken. Put the chicken, on its side, into a roasting pan and put in hot oven. Roast at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes, rotate chicken onto other side, and roast for 15 minutes more.

Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 19174,&quot;Cuban Black Bean Soup 1 pound dried black (turtle) beans 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 medium white onions, chopped (about 11/2 cups) 2 large red sweet peppers, chopped 3 stalks celery, chopped 3 tablespoons chili powder 3 tablespoons ground cumin 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 1/4 cup tomato paste 4 quarts cold water Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1/4 cup dry (not cooking) sherry Sour cream Chopped scallions or chives Instructions: Sort the beans carefully to remove any dirt and debris. Rinse the beans in cold water and then soak them overnight covered with more, clean, fresh cold water and place in the refrigerator. Drain any excess water before adding the beans to the soup pot. In a large soup pot with a heavy bottom, heat the olive oil. Add the onions, peppers, celery, chili powder, and cumin, and saute over medium heat until the vegetables wilt. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook an additional 3 minutes, stirring to make sure you don&#39;t burn the tomato or garlic. Add the water and bring to a boil. Add the black beans, return to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook for 2 to 21/2 hours, or until the beans are tender. Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper to taste, and allow to cool for half an hour before pureeing in small batches in a blender or food processor. If you are serving immediately, return the soup to a boil and add 1/4 cup dry sherry. Cook 2 minutes more. Ladle into bowls and garnish each with a tablespoon of sour cream and a sprinkling of scallions or chives. If you are preparing the soup ahead of time, cool thoroughly after blending, transfer to a container with a tightly fitting lid, and store in the refrigerator for up to a week. Add the sherry after reheating the soup to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 19175,&quot;Hushpuppies 1 cup stone-ground yellow cornmeal 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt plus to taste Pinch of cayenne 1 1/4 cup butter milk 1 large egg, beaten 2 scallions, finely chopped Vegetable oil for frying Instructions: Using a fine-meshed sieve over a large bowl, sift together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cayenne. Using a rubber spatula, stir in the buttermilk, egg, and scallions, until a batter is formed. (Take care not to over-mix the batter or the hushpuppies will be dense.) Pour the oil for frying into a large heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of 2 inches. Place over medium heat and heat to 375 degrees F. Working in small batches, using a greased teaspoon, drop spoonfuls of batter into the oil, turning once, frying until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the hushpuppies to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Serve immediately. Cook&#39;s Note: Using a greased spoon (vegetable oil spray works well) helps to release the batter from the spoon. Additionally, if you drop the batter off of the tip of the spoon it will form ball shapes; if dropped off the side it will form oblong shapes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19176,&quot;Garlic and Herb Pull Apart Bread 2 tablespoons warm water 1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon sugar 1 large egg, lightly beaten 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup cold water 1/4 cup boiling water 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus 1/2 cup or more as needed 4 cloves garlic, grated 1/4 cup chopped parsley 2 tablespoons chopped chives 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1 1/2 cups jarred marinara sauce 1/2 cup half-and-half Instructions: In a small bowl, mix the warm water, yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Set aside for about 5 minutes until the mixture starts to thicken and bubble slightly. (If the mixture does not start to thicken and bubble slightly, the yeast is not working. Check the expiration date on the yeast and start over.) In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, stir together the egg, oil, salt and remaining 1/2 cup sugar until well combined. Mix in the cold water followed by the boiling water. Add the yeast mixture to the mixing bowl and stir until well blended. Add the flour and stir until it comes together into a shaggy dough, about 1 minute. Replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook and continue to knead until mostly smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, 2 tablespoons of the parsley and 1 tablespoon of the chives to the dough. Continue to knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, another 3 minutes, adding in the extra 1/2 cup flour or more as needed so the dough isn\u2019t too sticky. Transfer the dough to a large, oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 3 hours. Line an 8-inch round cake pan or baking dish with a sheet of parchment, allowing the excess paper to hang over the edges of the pan. Place a 2-to-3-inch biscuit cutter, sharp side down, in the center of the pan or dish and set aside. Mix the melted butter with the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and 1 tablespoon chives in a large bowl. Cut the dough into strips and then cut each strip into 1-inch pieces. Roll a piece into a ball and transfer it to the bowl with the butter, turning to coat completely. Transfer it to the cake pan. Repeat with the remaining dough and butter mixture, surrounding the biscuit cutter completely with the balls. Drizzle any remaining butter from the bowl over the top. Cover and let rise for 1 1/2 hours at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the balls with the Parmesan. Place the pan of dough onto a baking sheet and bake until the top is golden brown and crisp, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. While the bread is resting, in a small saucepan, heat the marinara and half-and-half until it is warm. Transfer to a bowl for dipping. Transfer the bread to a serving platter with the side sprinkled with Parmesan facing up. Remove the biscuit cutter. Serve immediately with the creamy tomato dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 19177,&quot;Cherry-Walnut Gelatin Mold 1 pound pitted bing cherries (frozen or canned), thawed if frozen 1 1/4 cups walnut halves 1 6-ounce package cherry Jell-O 1 cup sherry 1/2 cup orange juice Cooking spray Instructions: Drain the cherries and pat dry. Break the walnuts into pieces, then stuff each cherry with a nut. Combine the Jell-O and 2 cups boiling water in a bowl and stir until dissolved. Stir in the sherry and orange juice. Lightly spray a 6-cup gelatin mold or glass bowl with cooking spray. Pour in the gelatin mixture and scatter the stuffed cherries and remaining walnuts evenly in the mold.

Butter just the sides of a 9-inch round cake pan. For the caramel topping: Stir the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring, and gently swirl the saucepan occasionally until the mixture is the color of light amber, 6 to 8 minutes. If needed, brush any sugar crystals off the side of the saucepan with a wet pastry brush. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and carefully whisk in the butter (take care: the mixture can bubble up considerably). Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan, tilting the pan to cover most of the bottom (be careful: the pan will be very hot from the caramel). Scatter the cranberries over the caramel. For the cake: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and cloves in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as needed, then beat in the vanilla and orange zest. Whisk together the milk and sour cream in a small bowl. Reduce the mixer speed to low, and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk-sour cream mixture, mixing until just incorporated. Pour the batter over the cranberries in the cake pan, and spread evenly. Bake until the cake is golden brown and bounces back when pressed and a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to separate it from the pan. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until just cool enough to handle, 20 to 30 minutes. Invert a serving platter over the cake pan and, while holding them together, quickly flip them over so the cake unmolds, cranberry-side up. Let cool completely. Cut into wedges, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19179,&quot;Pistachio, Garlic and Mint Couscous 1/3 cup shelled pistachio nuts 2 tablespoons EVOO 2 cloves garlic, grated or finely chopped 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 1 1/2 cups couscous Salt and pepper 1 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves Instructions: Toast the nuts in a saucepot suitable for rice.

Press a circle of coconut grass on top. Nestle the malted eggs on top of the grass. Gently press the peep onto the center of the grass. Cut the white Airhead into a 1/2 oval shape; trim one side so it has a cracked egg jagged edge. Place egg next to chick. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup cupcake tins with paper liners. (To avoid cupcakes sticking if they overflow slightly, lightly spray the tops of the pans.) Put tins on a baking sheet. Set aside. Process sugar and butter in a food processor until very creamy, scraping sides as needed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, pulsing after each addition. Add the milk, water, and vanilla and process to blend. Whisk both flours, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dry ingredients, in 3 batches to the wet, pulsing, and then scraping batter off the sides of the processor as needed after each addition. Process until the batter is very smooth and pourable like pancake batter, about 2 minutes. Evenly pour the batter into the prepared cups, filling them 3/4 of the way full. Bake until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and the tops are golden, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly in tin, and turn out of tin when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a rack before frosting. Whisk the milk and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Slowly beat the butter and sugar, in another medium bowl, with an electric mixer until incorporated. Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the sides of the bowl down with a rubber spatula.) Add the fluff and salt and reduce the speed to low. Add the milk and vanilla mixture, scrape the bowl down, and mix until fully incorporated. Raise the mixer to high and beat briefly until fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Frost cupcake immediately. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a mesh rack on top, if available. Put coconut in a shallow bowl. While tossing with a large spoon, add food coloring drop by drop until the desired color is reached. A little more green than yellow makes a pretty grass color. Add a few tablespoons water to moisten the mixture and help disperse the color evenly. If the color is too dark, add additional water, as needed, to dilute to the desired color. Drain the coconut in a sieve or strainer. Spread the coconut in an even layer on the rack, or directly on the lined baking sheet. Place in the oven until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. Use immediately, or store in covered container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 19203,&quot;Wild Rice Pilaf with Nuts and Lemon 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup pine nuts 2 to 3 cloves garlic, smashed 1 to 2 strips lemon zest 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 cup wild rice, preferably whole not broken 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus extra for seasoning 1 bunch scallions (white and green), thinly sliced (3/4 cup) Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the pine nuts, garlic, zest, and thyme, swirl the pan until the nuts and garlic are beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the wild rice and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute tops. Stir in the chicken broth and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a rapid simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check the texture of the rice and, if needed, continue simmering until tender. Add more liquid as needed, another 10 to 15 minutes. (Note: The rice should only just begin to crack when done. If it begins to curl it is overcooked. There are numerous varieties of varying qualities, which affect cooking times greatly.) Remove from the heat, scatter the scallions over the surface, fluff with a fork, and remove the herb sprigs and lemon zest before serving. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 19204,&quot;Smoky Grilled Chicken Wings with Pickled Red Chiles, Dates and Fresh Mint 1/4 cup kosher salt 1 tablespoon honey 4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed One 1-inch piece of ginger, peeled and smashed 5 pounds chicken wings, separated at joint, tips discarded 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 cup (about 10 pieces) Medjool dates, split lengthwise, pits removed and finely diced 4 to 5 scallions, cut thinly on the bias 1 Fresno cl, halved lengthwise and finely sliced Canola oil, for grilling Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3 tablespoons smoked paprika 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil 1/4 cup lightly packed fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 1/4 cup lightly packed fresh mint leaves, chopped Instructions: Begin by making the brine: In a large bowl, combine 6 cups water, the salt, honey, garlic and ginger. Stir until the salt is dissolved, and then add the wings. Cover and leave in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.<br> Prepare the quick pickle mixture: In a large bowl, combine the rice wine vinegar, sugar and soy. Stir well until the sugar dissolves. Add the dates, scallions and cl to the mixture. Set aside while you cook the wings. Once the wings have brined, drain and set out on kitchen towels to dry well. Preheat an outdoor grill and wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted paper towel. This not only cleans the grill but creates a nonstick surface. Sprinkle the wings with salt and pepper, and then lightly toss in a mixture of smoked paprika and sesame oil. Place the wings on the grill and cook for 17 to 20 minutes, turning halfway through, so they brown evenly all over and cook through.<br> When done, remove the wings to a large bowl. Add the chopped herbs to the pickled date mixture, toss to combine and add to the bowl with the wings. Toss to coat evenly, and then transfer to a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 19205,&quot;Buttery Triple Berry Bars Crisco?

Cook pasta until al dente, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium-sized saute pan, heat the oil until warm. Since the bread crumbs will cook quickly, you don&#39;t want to add them into a hot pan, otherwise they can burn. Add the breadcrumbs and stir constantly. Season lightly with salt and pepper since flavored bread crumbs may already have seasoning. Saute for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Drain pasta in a colander. Working quickly, add pasta to the saute pan and stir to combine. Add Parmesan and the chopped prosciutto. Mix thoroughly.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment and coat with cooking spray. Add the cauliflower and garlic to a food processor and pulse until finely ground and the consistency of couscous. Transfer the cauliflower mixture to a large bowl. Add the Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes if using, eggs, 1 cup Cheddar, 1/2 cup Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and combine until the mixture holds together when squeezed.<br> Spread the cauliflower mixture into an 8-by-12-inch rectangle about a 1/4 inch thick on the prepared baking sheet. Use the straight edge of the parchment as your guide to keep the cauliflower mixture edges straight too. Bake until the crust turns golden brown all over, 18 to 20 minutes.<br> Remove the baking sheet from the oven and lay another piece of parchment on top of the crust. Fit a second rimmed baking sheet on top so the bottom of the baking sheet is touching the parchment. Using oven mitts, hold the 2 baking sheets together and flip them over so the crust is now on the parchment on the upside-down baking sheet. Remove the first parchment from the crust, cut the crust into 1 1/2-inch-thick strips (you should have 8 to 9 strips) and spread them apart a little. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup Cheddar and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Bake on the upside-down baking sheet until the cheese is melted and turning brown in spots and the visible crust is a deep golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.<br> Let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer the sticks on the parchment to a serving plate and serve with the marinara sauce for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 19210,&quot;Deviled Eggs with Candied Bacon 1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar Cayenne pepper Pinch ground cinnamon 1/8 pound thick-cut bacon (about 3 strips) 8 large eggs, straight from the refrigerator 1/4 to 1/2 cup mayonnaise, or as much as desired 2 teaspoons whole grain mustard 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 scallions, minced 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Paprika, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, a pinch of cayenne and the cinnamon. Place the bacon on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle each slice of bacon with some of the spiced sugar and bake, about 10 minutes. Flip the bacon, sprinkle with the remaining spiced sugar and continue to cook until crispy, about 10 more minutes. Remove the bacon from the oven and allow to cool. When the bacon is cool, mince it and set aside, reserving a quarter of it for garnishing the eggs. Put the cold eggs in the bottom of a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and remove the pan from the heat. Cover the pan with a lid and let stand for 12 minutes. Drain the eggs and rinse with cold water. Let the eggs cool a bit and then peel when they are still warm (eggs are much easier to peel when they are warm). After they are peeled, you can then store them, covered, in the fridge. Mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, dill, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, the scallions and the minced bacon in a medium mixing bowl. Season with the salt. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise. Gently remove the yolks by pressing your thumb against the back of the yolk to pop it out of the white. Add the yolks to the bowl with the mayonnaise mixture. Mash together, using a fork, until smooth. Put the filling in a re-sealable bag. Cut one end off and pipe the filling into the egg whites. Sprinkle with the paprika, extra bacon bits and dill before serving. Cook&#39;s Notes: A wire rack is a great way to cook bacon because the air can circulate around the bacon making it crispy and delicious. Plastic bags are a great tool to use in place of a piping bag, easy and disposable. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 19211,&quot;Chocolate Frame 32 ounces flour for molding, as needed 32 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered Vegetable oil Instructions: You can make your chocolate frame any size you would like, however, if you were planning to use it around a chocolate \canvas, your frame should be the appropriate size. Whatever the case, your first step is to make the frame template. If you want your frame to be square, you will only need one piece of wood, if you would like it to be rectangular, you will need two. Choose a piece of wood that is the length and texture you would like for your frame. Using a mitre box, cut the one or two frame template pieces exactly to size. Both ends should be cut on an angle, and the back should have 2 nails sticking out of it. Using a whisk, lighten the flour by incorporating a little air. Spread a 2-inch thick layer of flour on top of a large sheet pan (or directly on the work surface, if the frame you are making requires more space). The amount of flour required will depend on the size of the chocolate frame. Press each piece of the frame template into the flour, immersing it completely and using even pressure, then carefully and delicately lift it out. Place the bittersweet chocolate in a piping bag with no tip. Placing the tip of the piping bag as close as possible to the flour/relief, carefully fill the space with chocolate and allow it to set for about 30 minutes. When the chocolate has set, lift it from the flour. If you would like an antique look, leave the flour on the chocolate piece, otherwise, clean it off using a strong bristled pastry brush or nailbrush. Please note: It is better to place the melted chocolate in a piping bag and pipe it into the flour. If you pour the chocolate from a spouted container, the weight of the chocolate as it falls can damage the delicate flour mold. If you are using a chocolate canvas, place it on the work surface in front of you. Position the chocolate frame pieces on top of the canvas along the edges. Trim to fit if necessary. Lift one frame piece and, using a cornet filled with chocolate, draw a line directly onto the canvas in its place. Reposition the chocolate frame piece so it is \glued\ to the canvas. Repeat with the other three frame pieces. To finish, you can use a pastry brush dipped in vegetable oil to apply a thin coat to the chocolate frame. This will give it a slight shine. Special Equipment: Wooden frame template. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 19212,&quot;Spicy Stir Fry 6 ounces grilled chicken breast, diced 2 cups raw fresh spinach 1 cup grape or cherry tomatoes 1/2 avocado, diced 2 ounces hot sauce, any brand you prefer Instructions: Heat a large wok over high heat.

Add the chilled butter and pulse until the dough looks like fine meal. Add the cheese and pulse 5 times. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and sprinkle with 5 tablespoons of ice water. Use a fork to fluff the mixture until moist clumps form. Add more ice water by the tablespoonful if the mixture is dry. Gather the dough into a ball and divide in half. Shape each half into a disk. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, mix the cornstarch and sugar, making sure there are no lumps in the cornstarch. Mix in the apples, lemon juice, zest, and salt. On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 of the dough disks into a 13-inch round. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch diameter deep-dish glass pie dish and brush the overhang with water. Pour the filling into the dough-lined dish and dot it with the 2 tablespoons butter. On the same lightly floured surface, roll out the second dough disk into a 12-inch round. Place the dough on top of the filling. Press the overhang of the bottom and top dough pieces together to seal. Cut the overhang to 1/2-inch. Fold the overhang under and crimp decoratively, forming a high-standing rim. Cut 3 (2-inch) slits in the top of the crust to allow steam to escape. Bake the pie until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cover the crust edge with foil and reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake the pie until the filling bubbles thickly in the center, about 30 minutes.

In a slow steady steam, whisk in 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add the radish, cucumber, yellow pepper and toss to coat. Let the veggies sit and marinate at room temperature while you prepare the sesame crusted snapper. Place a medium saucepan on the stove. Add the sliced almonds and toast over moderate heat then remove from pan and reserve. Return pan to stove top and add the chicken broth, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil -- just eyeball it, curry powder and cinnamon. Raise heat and bring broth up to a boil. When it boils, add couscous to the pot and stir to combine. Cover the pot and turn off the heat and let the couscous stand until ready to serve. With a sharp paring knife, score the skin side of the snapper fillets by slashing 3, 1/8- inch thick cuts across the width of the fish. Season both sides of the fish with salt and pepper. Sprinkle and then gently press the sesame seeds onto both sides of the fish. Heat a nonstick large skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan. Once the pan is hot, add the seasoned fish to the skillet skin side down. Saute the snapper for 4 minutes and if you find that the fillets bubble up in the center section, carefully press each fillet down with a fish spatula. Flip the fillets and continue to cook on the second side for 3 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and opaque. While the fish is cooking on the second side, finish off the ginger dressed snappy veggies and prepare the couscous. To the marinating vegetables, add the watercress and basil. Toss to combine. Remove the lid on the couscous. Add scallions and toasted almonds and fluff couscous with a fork. To serve, distribute the snappy veggies between 4 plates and top with the sesame crusted snapper; serve the couscous alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 19238,&quot;Scotch Eggs with Mustard Sauce 8 large eggs 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar 1 pound bulk pork sausage 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon Grapeseed or vegetable oil, for frying (about 4 cups) 1 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup milk 1 cup panko breadcrumbs 1/2 cup low-fat mayonnaise 3 tablespoons stone-ground mustard Juice of 1 lemon Instructions: Place 6 eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Add the vinegar and bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, cover and set aside 4 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a bowl with ice water. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking; let sit 2 minutes. Gently peel the eggs and set aside. Combine the sausage, herbs and one of the remaining eggs in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until combined, about 3 minutes. With moistened hands, mold the sausage mixture around the cooked eggs to completely cover. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat about 3 inches of grapeseed oil in a small high-sided saucepan over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer reads 325 degrees F (or until a pinch of panko sizzles in the oil). Season the flour with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Beat the remaining egg with the milk in another shallow dish. Put the panko in a third shallow dish. Roll the sausage-covered eggs in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess. Transfer to the egg-milk mixture and turn to completely coat. Let the excess egg drip off, then roll in the panko. Fry the eggs until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove to a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and bake until the sausage is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Mix the mayonnaise, mustard and lemon juice in a small bowl.

Bring to a boil, salt the water, reduce the heat a bit, and cook until tender, about 12 minutes. Heads up: about halfway through you will add the broccoli to the pot, so use a pot large enough to accommodate both. Season the chicken breasts with the thyme, salt, and pepper. Heat the EVOO in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the chicken for 6 minutes on each side. Add the broccoli to the potatoes and cook for 6 minutes. Heat the butter in a small saucepot over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour and cook for 1 minute, then whisk in the chicken stock and 1 cup of the milk or half-and-half. Thicken for 2 to 3 minutes, season the sauce with salt and pepper, then stir in the cheese in a figure-eight motion with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Turn off the heat. Drain the cooked broccoli and potatoes and return to the hot pot to dry them out. Mash the broccoli and potatoes together, using the remaining milk to reach the desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the chicken breasts on an angle.

Turn on the blender and while it&#39;s running, add 1 at a time through the feed tube, the parsley, chives, and garlic, and blend together until a smooth paste has formed. At this point the lime should be cool enough to squeeze. With the power still on, squeeze the lime juice through the blender feed tube, and then very slowly add the buttermilk until the mixture thickens and can coat the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside in refrigerator until needed. (When chilled, the dressing should resemble something like mayonnaise.) Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large skillet with oven safe handles, cook bacon over low heat until crisp. Remove bacon and set aside to drain. Season turkey breast and add to the bacon fat rendered in the skillet and brown on all sides. Cover and roast until it reaches an internal temperature of 160 to 165 degrees F so that during the carryover cooking (it continues to cook after removed from oven) it reaches 170 degrees F. (This is done in an effort to keep the meat from drying out.) Remove turkey to a utility platter and let rest. Leave oven on to make croutons. Slice the epee loaf in half lengthwise and place on a baking sheet. Pour olive oil over cut side of bread, and season with dried parsley, salt and pepper. Toast in oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Remove from oven and let cool. Place lettuce on serving dish. Arrange tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and mozzarella cheese wedges on top.

Stir together the remaining butter with the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of the pan, taking care to get the crust evenly into the edge. Bake until browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool. Wrap the bottom of the pan and up the side with foil, and put the pan on a baking sheet. For the filling: Beat the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sour cream, and mix until just combined. Add the heavy cream, and mix until just combined. Beat in the eggs one at time. Beat in the vanilla, lemon juice and lemon zest if using until just combined. (Do not overmix, or the cake will turn into a souffle!) Pour the filling into the crust. Bake until the cake is slightly golden and barely set in the middle, about 1 hour 20 minutes.

Warm the filtered water to 90 degrees, dissolve the yeast and set aside for 15 minutes. Add the salt to the well along with half the yeast mixture. Working from the center outward, pull the sides of the well into the center until all the flour is incorporated (the mixture will be sticky). Continue to mix the dough and add the remaining yeast in increments until all the yeast mixture is incorporated. Knead the dough until it is elastic, silky and no longer sticky. Add pinches of flour if necessary to reduce the stickiness but do not add too much or the dough will be dry. Knead the dough for 15 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and put the dough in a bowl covered with a damp cloth. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 hour. Punch the dough down, press out most of the air and shape it back into a ball. Let the dough rise for an additional 3 hours. Punch the dough down, form it into a ball and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours to \retard\ on a sheet tray covered with plastic wrap. When ready, let the dough warm to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before using. For the pulled prosciutto: Add the prosciutto end, carrots, celery, onion and garlic to a stockpot and cover with 1 galloncold water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours. Allow the prosciutto to cool in the liquid for 1 hour (it should be fork tender). Remove the prosciutto, pull the pork, discard half of the outer skin and mix the rest in with the pulled prosciutto. For the melted leeks: Cut the tops off the leek to the tender part of the leek. Cut the leek in half, top to bottom. Rinse the leek well in cool water to remove all the dirt. Cut the leek into 1/4-inch half-moons. Saute the leeks on medium heat in a large saucepot with the butter until very tender, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring as needed. When the leeks are dry, deglaze with the wine and reduce until almost dry. Add the cream and reduce until almost dry. Season with salt and pepper. Allow to cool before adding to the pizza. For the caramelized onions: Heat a large saute pan on medium-high heat. Coat the bottom of a pan with the oil, then add the onions and stir to coat. Add the sugar and some salt to taste. Saute the onions until beginning to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water and cook until evaporated, stirring occasionally. Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce until the onions lose their crunch and the pan is dry. Allow to cool before topping the pizza. For the cured black olives: In a large stockpot, bring 1 gallon water to a boil. Add the olives to a strainer and dip 5 to 6 times in the boiling water to remove the excess salt. Meanwhile, heat the extra-virgin olive oil on medium heat in a saucepan. Add the fresh rosemary and heat in the oil until just fragrant. Remove the pan from the heat and add the olives to the rosemary oil. Allow to cool at room temperature to marinate. Marinate the olives overnight to pick up the rosemary flavor. For the pizza: Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 550 degrees F. Let it heat for at least 30 minutes. Form the dough into a 12-inch disk with plenty of bench flour (make sure the dough is the same thickness throughout, especially the center). Place on a pizza peel dusted with flour and spread the melted leeks onto the dough evenly, leaving a 1-inch border around the outside. Evenly spread 2 ounces grated fontina cheese, 3 ounces pulled prosciutto and about 1 ounce caramelized onions over the pizza. Scatter 8 rosemary-marinated salt-cured olives. Sprinkle with a little Parmigiano-Reggiano. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone and bake until the cheese melts and the crust starts to char, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and slice into 6 pieces. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 19280,&quot;Raspberry Margarita Punch 2 cups frozen raspberries, thawed, pureed and seeded 1 large container frozen lemonade 1 quart water 2 cups orange juice 1 1/2 cups tequila 3 lemons, sliced Instructions: In a food processor, blend raspberries with lemonade concentrate until smooth.

In a deep pot, slowly heat to 350 degrees enough vegetable oil to completely submerge the disks when deep fried. While this is heating up, set flour, egg and bread crumbs in a 3 separate shallow plates; dip each disk of cheese in flour, then in beaten egg and finally in fresh bread crumbs, making sure breading completely adheres to all surfaces leaving no cheese exposed. With a slotted spoon or skimmer, lower the breaded cheese into the oil. Do not overcrowd or the temperature of the oil will be lowered considerably and the cheese will be greasy. Fry for 45 seconds only or until the crust is deep golden brown. Briefly drain on absorbent towels and serve immediately on garnished plates. Variations: you can marinate the goats&#39; cheese first in a mixture of olive oil, crushed black peppercorns, herbs and garlic. Pat dry before breading. Mix some ground pecans or walnuts with bread crumbs. Before breading, sandwich an anchovy fillet or chopped canned green chilis between two 1/4inch rounds of mozzarella. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 19282,&quot;Monkey Pasta 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, plus more if needed 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more if needed<br> 1 cup milk Kosher salt 8 ounces broccoli florets 2 pounds penne pasta<br> 1/4 cup grapeseed oil, plus more for coating pasta 1/4 cup minced fresh garlic<br> 1 small red onion, medium diced<br> 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped<br> 3 medium zucchini, cut into slices<br> 1 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish 3 tablespoons minced chives<br> 2 tablespoons freshly ground pepper<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh curly parsley<br> Instructions: Make a roux by melting the butter in a saucepot over medium heat.

Stir the wine and olive oil in a small bowl and pour into the well. Stir together with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out onto a clean surface and knead until smooth, 2 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest, 1 hour. Cut the dough into quarters; shape each piece into a flat rectangle. Working with one piece at a time (wrap the rest in plastic so it doesn&#39;t dry out), roll out the dough with a pasta machine, dusting the dough with flour as necessary, into a 22-inch-long sheet (about 6 inches wide and 1?16 inch thick).<br> Lay out the sheet of dough; spoon 10 mounds of pumpkin butter (about 1 teaspoon each) along the sheet, 1/4 inch from the top edge, spacing them 1 inch apart. Fold the bottom half of the sheet up to meet the top edge and press to seal around each mound of filling, starting at the folded side so there isn&#39;t any air trapped inside. Cut into 1 3/4-inch squares using a fluted cutter or knife; press the edges again to seal. Transfer the ravioli to a baking sheet lined with a kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining dough and pumpkin butter. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large heavy pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F. Fry the ravioli in batches, turning once, until golden, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Let cool 5 minutes. Mix the confectioners&#39; sugar and pie spice in a small bowl. Use a small sieve to dust the spiced sugar on the ravioli.

Add the melted butter and pulse on and off, just until the butter is incorporated into the mixture. Place 6 (4-inch) tart pans with removable bottoms on a baking sheet. (Or you can use a 10-inch pan with removable bottom.) Divide the almond mixture evenly among the tart pans, pressing the crust firmly against the sides and bottoms. Set aside. In a small saute pan, slowly heat the brandy, and pour it over the cranberries in a heatproof bowl. (Caution: Do not heat alcohol over a high heat or it will ignite. If this happens, simply let it burn away, making sure that there is nothing flammable near the stove. It will burn away in a matter of seconds.) Let the cranberries sit for 20 minutes and then drain. In a medium-size bowl, combine all the filling ingredients and stir vigorously until the mixture is very creamy. TO ASSEMBLE: Place the tart pans on a baking sheet. Sprinkle the cranberries into the crust. Carefully pour the cheese mixture just until it reaches the top of the crust. Bake the tarts in a preheated 325 degree oven for 45 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown. Let them cool completely before serving. As the tarts cool, the filling will fall and shrivel slightly. Nonetheless, they will still look irresistible. Remove tarts from pans just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19303,&quot;Salmon with Crispy Horseradish Crust 2 6 oz. salmon filet 3 tablespoon butter, softened 2 tablespoon horseradish 1 cup fresh bread crumbs Salt Pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: Check that all bones have been removed from filets.

Add half of the oil to each. Arrange the chicken on a tray in a single layer and season with salt. Turn the pieces over and season the other side. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, carefully add the chicken, skin side down, to the skillets, leaving space between each piece of chicken. Reduce the heat to medium and allow the chicken to brown on their first side, 5 to 8 minutes. Resist the temptation to move or turn the pieces. Use metal tongs to carefully turn the chicken pieces to their second side and brown 3 to 5 additional minutes. Transfer the chicken pieces to a tray and set aside. Prepare the garlic: Grate 6 of the cloves of garlic and set aside for the sauce. Cut the remaining 12 cloves in half lengthwise. Make the sauce: In one of the skillets you cooked the chicken in, add the cumin and coriander and stir rapidly over medium-low heat to give them a quick toast, 10 to 15 seconds. Immediately add the onions and grated garlic. Season with salt and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions turn light brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the cinnamon stick, pepper flakes, bay leaves and tomatoes. Allow the tomatoes to cook, breaking them apart with a spoon as they cook, 8 to 10 minutes, and then add 1 cup water. Toast the garlic cloves: In the other skillet the you cooked the chicken in, arrange the garlic halves in a single layer in the cooking grease. Toast the garlic over low heat until golden brown and crisped, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the garlic from the skillet, sprinkle with salt and drain on a kitchen towel. Finish cooking the chicken: Arrange the chicken pieces, skin side up, in the sauce. Cover the skillet, keep the heat low and continue cooking until the pieces are cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the cover and stir in the ginger, cream and vinegar. Cover and simmer 2 to 3 additional minutes. Test the center of a thigh to make sure the chicken is cooked through. It should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F and the juices should run \clear,\ not pink. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick and bay leaves. Taste and adjust the seasoning.

Then slowly increase to medium to high speed. It should have a smooth texture to it when done. If the mix is still chunky, add additional oil and continue to blend to assure all the ingredients emulsify. Set aside the sofrito for later use in the paella rice seasoning. For the paella rice seasoning: Heat a medium soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the oil and then 1/3 cup of the sofrito and let it cook for about 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, sazon con azafrin, salt and chicken bouillon. Stir together. Taste the liquid to see if it needs any additional salt. Set aside until ready to add to the boiling rice. For the rice: Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the oil to the pot and let heat up for 1 minute. Add the rice, water and reserved paella rice seasoning and let it slowly come to a boil. Stir all the ingredients together. Allow the rice to absorb all the visible liquid. Once most of the surface liquid is absorbed, stir the rice and turn the heat to low. Cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. The rice grains will be fluffy when fully cooked and all the liquid will be absorbed. For the meats: Heat a wok or pan over medium heat. Add the oil and green onions and let it warm. Add Chinese lap cheong sausage, mild pork sausage and edamame beans and stir fry. Add cooked paella rice and sambal chili garlic. Stir the rice, sausages, edamame beans and onions together.

Combine the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, oyster sauce, mushroom soy, green onions, star anise, cloves, peppercorn blend, cinnamon sticks and ginger slices in an 18-quart container. With a large whisk, mix the ingredients together. Make sure all the sugar at the bottom is properly stirred into the liquid. Gradually pour the water into the container and continue to stir. Cut the pork butt in 2-inch square pieces. Trim all the hard fat off and leave about a quarter of the soft fat on the meat. Set the pork in a deep cooking pan, and, using a ladle, pour the soy marinade mix over the meat, make sure all the meat is covered in the liquid. (Any extra soy-ginger marinade can be put away and used again on a later date.) Add the dried black mushroom and bay leaves to the liquid, spreading them evenly throughout the pan. Tightly wrap the pan with heavy-duty foil and refrigerate overnight. The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make sure the foil is tightly sealed around the pan and cook until the pork is fork tender, about 3 hours. Take the pan out of the oven and remove the foil. With a fork and tongs pull at the pork. It should easily tear off to assure it&#39;s fully cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 19312,&quot;Gajar Ka Halwa 3 cups whole milk (see Cook&#39;s Note) 4 to 6 tablespoons ghee 1/3 cup nuts, such as pistachios, almonds or cashews, coarsely chopped 1 1/2 pounds carrot (about 8 carrots), peeled and coarsely grated on the large holes of a box grater (about 5 cups; see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon cardamom seeds, crushed, optional 3/4 cup light brown sugar, plus more if needed Instructions: Bring the milk to boil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, stirring often to keep the milk from burning.

Allow the beef to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 19317,&quot;Pool Table Meatballs 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 pounds frozen beef meatballs, thawed 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 (14-ounce) can reduced-sodium beef broth 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1/4 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon Swedish meatball seasoning 2 tablespoons diced chives Seasoning salt Instructions: Heat oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs and cook until brown, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer meatballs to a bowl. Add flour to skillet and cook 1 minute over low heat, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet. Stir in broth, milk, sour cream, meatball seasoning, chives and seasoning salt, to taste, using a whisk. Return meatballs to skillet. Simmer until liquid thickens enough to coat meatballs, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Spoon sauce on top of meatballs and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 19318,&quot;Grilled Tuna with Grilled Asparagus and Oven Roasted Tomato Sauce 6 (5-ounce) portions yellowfin tuna Grilled Asparagus with Lemon-Olive Oil, recipe follows, for serving 1 teaspoon salt Oven Roasted Tomato Sauce, for serving 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 pound large asparagus, woody ends trimmed* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 3 pounds Romanita tomatoes, cored* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 12 cloves garlic, peeled Instructions: Season each piece of the tuna on both sides with the salt and pepper. Heat a grill to high and grill the tuna to the desired temperature. Serve the tuna with the asparagus and tomato sauce. Preheat the grill to medium. In a shallow baking dish, toss the asparagus with the oil to coat well. Add the salt, and pepper and toss. Place the asparagus on the grill in a single layer, and cook, turning, until marked and tender, about 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a platter, sprinkle with the lemon juice and drizzle with olive oil, to taste. Cover with aluminum foil and let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large, 14-inch, oven proof frying pan, combine all of the ingredients. Stir to blend then transfer to the oven and cook until the tomatoes begin to caramelize, about 30 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and stir well. Return to the oven and continue to cook until further caramelized and much of the liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes longer. Serve immediately. (Alternately, cool slightly, and transfer to a blender, in batches if necessary, and process sauce until coarsely pureed. If the sauce seems too thick, thin with a bit of water or chicken broth.) To store, cool completely and refrigerate for up to 4 days in a nonreactive, airtight container. The sauce is great on pasta as well as pizza and even makes a great dipping sauce for hors d&#39;oeuvres. If you prefer a less rustic sauce, puree completely as described above and strain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 19319,&quot;Mini Doughnut Muffins 4 tablespoons butter, softened, plus more for buttering the muffin tin 3 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs<br> 1 cup milk<br> 1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon cocoa powder 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter, melted Instructions: For the doughnut muffins: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease two 24-cup mini muffin tins with butter. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg. Set aside. In a different bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Add the eggs and mix again. Add the flour mixture and milk alternately to the creamed mixture, beating well after each addition. Fill the prepared mini muffin pans two-thirds full. Bake until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. For the cinnamon sugar topping: Mix the sugar, cinnamon and cocoa in a shallow bowl. Roll the muffins in the melted butter, coating them completely, then roll them in the cinnamon sugar. Transfer to a cooling rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 19320,&quot;Patatas Bravas 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads<br> 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon roughly chopped shallot (1/2 small shallot)<br> 1 teaspoon anchovy paste<br> 1 clove garlic, smashed<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup finely chopped shallot (1 large shallot)<br> 1 tablespoon minced garlic (2 to 3 cloves)<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> Kosher salt<br> On 26-ounce box chopped tomatoes<br> 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3 pounds baby red and yellow potatoes 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Sweet Spanish paprika, for garnish Instructions: For the sherry-saffron aioli: Combine the sherry vinegar and saffron threads in a small bowl and let sit for 5 minutes to rehydrate the saffron. Combine the mayonnaise, shallots, anchovy paste, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the saffron-vinegar mixture in a food processor; process until smooth. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 days. For the spicy tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and saute until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and 1 teaspoon salt and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the chopped tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens, 15 minutes. Serve immediately, or cool and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 days. For the potatoes: Place two baking sheets on oven racks. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the potatoes into halves or quarters, depending on size, to get roughly 1-inch pieces. Toss the potatoes with the olive oil and 1 tablespoon salt in a large bowl. Carefully pour half of the potatoes onto the first baking sheet; they should sizzle as they hit the pan. Repeat with the remaining potatoes on the second baking sheet. Roast, stirring halfway through, until the potatoes are tender and crispy, 40 to 45 minutes. (If some of the potatoes do not move when you stir them, do not force them; they will release from the pan when they have crisped up.) Let cool slightly. Spread one third of the tomato sauce on the bottom of a serving dish. Top with half of the potatoes. Spoon another third of the tomato sauce over the potatoes, and then top with the remaining potatoes and the rest of the tomato sauce. Dollop with the aioli, and sprinkle with the parsley and some paprika. Serve any extra aioli on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 19321,&quot;Garlic Oil Sauteed Pasta with Broccoli 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/4 head broccoli, sliced into very thin florets, stalk peeled and cut into matchsticks Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar Few tablespoons water or pasta cooking water, if needed 2 cups penne pasta, cooked al dente Parmesan cheese, for garnish Instructions: In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil, garlic, and pepper flakes over medium heat until fragrant. Once the garlic has turned golden in color, remove it from the pan. You are left with garlic-infused oil in the pan. Add the broccoli to the pan. Cook&#39;s Note: Be sure the broccoli is completely dry before tossing it into the pan. Toss the broccoli to coat with the oil. Season with salt and pepper and saute over medium heat until the broccoli barely loses some of its crunch, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat up to high and deglaze the pan with the red wine vinegar. Add a few tablespoons of water, if needed. Cook&#39;s Note: Use pasta water if the pasta was made fresh. Add in the pasta and toss to coat with the oil. Top with Parmesan cheese for serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 19322,&quot;Blood-O Margarita Ice About 2 ounces blood orange juice 1 1/2 ounces tequila, such as Patron Gold 1/2 ounce triple sec Juice of 1 lime Splash simple syrup Dash sour mix Instructions: Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add the blood orange juice, tequila, triple sec, lime juice, simple syrup and sour mix. Shake vigorously to combine. Pour over an ice-filled Collins glass. &quot;,&quot;[Tequila, Cointreau, Lime Juice]&quot; 19323,&quot;Italian Subs 1/2 large onion, thinly sliced 1 12-inch loaf soft Italian bread 5 tablespoons red wine vinegar 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 pound deli-sliced provolone cheese 1/4 pound deli-sliced Genoa salami 1/4 pound deli-sliced boiled ham 1/4 pound deli-sliced mortadella 1/4 pound deli-sliced capicola 1/2 head iceberg lettuce, finely shredded 1/4 to 1/2 cup sliced pickled pepperoncini (optional) 3 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano Instructions: Soak the onion slices in a large bowl of cold water, 15 minutes. Meanwhile, split the bread lengthwise, then pull out some of the bread from the inside. Drizzle 2 tablespoons each vinegar and olive oil on the bottom half. Season with salt and pepper. Layer the cheese and meat on the bottom half of the bread. Drain the onion and pat dry. Top the meat with the onion, lettuce, pepperoncini (if using) and tomatoes. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons each vinegar and olive oil and sprinkle with the oregano. Season generously with salt and pepper. Drizzle the cut side of the bread top with the remaining 1 tablespoon each vinegar and olive oil, then place on top of the sandwich. Cut into 4 pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Montepulciano, Tempranillo]&quot; 19324,&quot;Caramelized Green Olives 2/3 cup date jam 3 tablespoons water 1 tablespoon butter or pareve margarine Dash powdered ginger 2 cups pitted, good-quality cured green olives (about 1 pound) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the date jam, water, and butter or margarine in a small saucepan. Simmer just long enough to dissolve. Add the ginger. Spread the olives in a cake pan large enough to fit them in 1 layer. Sprinkle the olives with a few tablespoons of their own juice. Cover with the jam mixture mixture. Bake for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar in the jam has caramelized. Serve warm or at room temperature as an accompaniment to a meat meal. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19325,&quot;Chilled Carrot and Cauliflower Soup 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 yellow onion, chopped 5 medium carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped 1/2 head cauliflower, cut into florets 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 2 teaspoons lemon zest 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock 3/4 cup plain yogurt, divided Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 green onion, finely chopped Instructions: Heat the oil in large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots, cauliflower, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, cumin, stock, and 2 cups water and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer over low heat until the carrots are very tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. Let the soup cool slightly, and then blend until smooth, working in batches. Pour the soup into a large bowl and whisk in 1/2 cup of the yogurt. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Chill the soup in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours up to 24 hours. Serve the soup in individual bowls with dollops of remaining yogurt, and some chopped green onion. When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 19326,&quot;Crunch Salad 2 handfuls alfalfa and broccoli sprouts 2 handfuls mung bean sprouts 2 handfuls sunflower salad shoots Mixed edible flowers 1 bunch fresh mint, leaves picked 2 baby courgettes (zucchini), sliced thinly lengthways 2 red chicory, cut in 1/2 then finely shredded 1 bunch baby carrots, sliced thinly lengthways 1/2 fennel bulb, halved and sliced finely 1 bunch French breakfast radishes, sliced lengthways 1 head celery, outer stalks and ends removed, halved and finely sliced lengthways 2 tablespoons French mustard 4 tablespoons creme fraiche 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 to 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Mix all the vegetables together in a bowl.
