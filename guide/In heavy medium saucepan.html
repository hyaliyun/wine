Freeze the meat until very firm and starting to harden around the edges but still pliable, 15 to 25 minutes. Place half of the meat in a food processor and pulse, stopping and redistributing the meat around the bowl as necessary to ensure even grinding, until coarsely ground, 10 to 15 one-second pulses. Transfer the meat back to the baking sheet, overturning the bowl and without directly touching the meat. Repeat the grinding process with the remaining meat. Spread the ground meat over the baking sheet and inspect carefully, discarding any long strands of gristle or large chunks of hard meat or fat. Heat a cast-iron skillet or large heavy griddle pan over high heat. Divide the meat into 6 portions, then form each into a large, thin patty with your hands; focus on loosely packed meat and a larger circumference than thickness. Season with salt and pepper. In 2 batches, cook the patties. Press them down once with a spatula as soon as you put them in the skillet. Do not smoosh them again. Cook until crusty brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip once and drape 2 pieces of cheese on top of each so it melts down the side while the other side cooks. Cook to the desired temperature. Set a nonstick pan over medium heat. Butter the pretzel buns and toast until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Arrange the burgers on the pretzel buns, top with pickled jalapenos and serve with a side of DijOli. Mix the mayonnaise, Dijon, stone-ground mustard, honey and garlic together in a small bowl. Season to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 625,&quot;Ganache 8 ounces good dark chocolate, chopped (not below 60 percent cocoa, recommended: Valrhona) 8 ounces heavy cream, scalded Instructions: Completely melt the chocolate in a double boiler.

Spray one 6-inch cake pan and two 1-quart ovenproof bowls with cooking spray. Beat the cake mix, eggs, buttermilk and vegetable oil with a mixer. Divide the batter evenly among the pan and bowls; bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 25 minutes for the pan and 35 minutes for the bowls. Cool; unmold. Trim all 3 cakes to make them level. Hollow out the smaller end of one of the bowl cakes, carving about 1 inch deep. (Leave a thick rim around the edge.) Put the uncut bowl cake, wider side up, on a cake board or plate. Spread with a layer of chocolate frosting, then position the round cake on top. Spread the round cake with frosting, then put the other bowl cake on top, carved part up. Freeze the cake about 1 hour (this will make it easier to frost). Frost the outer rim and inside of the hole with vanilla frosting (an offset spatula works best). Put the remaining vanilla frosting in a resealable plastic bag. Spread the remaining chocolate frosting over the outside of the cake. Press handfuls of toasted coconut into the frosting, covering the cake completely. Microwave the bag of vanilla frosting for 5 seconds (the bag will not melt). Snip off a corner and squeeze the frosting into the top of the cake so it looks like liquid. Thread dried fruit onto a wooden skewer and insert it into the cake.

Lightly coat a baking pan with cooking spray. In a small saucepan, combine the butter and chopped chocolate and set over very low heat until melted. Stir the mixture and set aside to cool. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Measure the sugar into the large bowl of an electric mixer and beat in the cooled butter-chocolate mixture. Add the egg plus whites, vanilla, and water and beat well. Add the dry ingredients and mix on low speed just until blended. Don&#39;t overbeat. The batter will be thick. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and bake for 22 to 25 minutes; 23 minutes is usually right for me. When done, the top will look dry and a wooden pick inserted near the edge will come out with a few crumbs but the center will look slightly gooey. Cool in the pan and cut into squares. I have been trying for a couple of years to produce a brownie worthy of the name with less fat and less solid chocolate. My taste testers finally agree that this is it - a great brownie they would never suspect of being lower in anything. I have cut the classic 58 percent down to 31 percent calories from fat and eliminated 87 calories, 10 g fat, and 22 mg cholesterol from each brownie. When traditional proportions are disrupted, textures become moist and cakey at best or dry, insipid, and tough at worst. One rule emerges clearly: The fewer ingredients, the better the brownie. Avoid the usual low-fat stand-ins: applesauce, yogurt, corn syrup, canola oil. Use butter, but less, and replace most of the solid chocolate with rich-tasting Dutch-processed cocoa; retain at least 1 ounce of solid chocolate, however, for a more complex chocolate taste. A few tricks: Cake flour produced a more tender crumb than all-purpose, and melting the butter with the chocolate, as opposed to creaming the solid butter with the sugar, gave a fudgier crumb. A touch of baking powder seems to enhance the crunch of the top crust. Faced with the choice of adding high-fat chopped nuts or keeping the 1/4 cup butter, there was no contest; nuts put us over the top in fat content. However, if you feel deprived without them, sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of finely chopped walnuts on top before baking; the changes are modest: 33 percent calories from fat, plus 9 calories and 1g fat per brownie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 641,&quot;Noodle Salad 1 1/2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 1 tablespoon Greek yogurt<br> 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar<br> 3 large carrots, peeled<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 English cucumber, peeled<br> 1 red pepper, seeded and julienned<br> 6 ounces sweet potato starch noodles, cooked according to package directions and rinsed 1/2 cup dried cranberries<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk together the honey, Dijon, Greek yogurt and cider vinegar.

Saute the beef chunks with the chopped onions, salt and pepper. After beef is browned, add the beef stock and the stewed tomatoes. Bring the mixture to a boil and then simmer just below boiling point for about 1 hour, until the beef is \spoon tender. Wash the vegetables. Cut each ear of corn and each potato into quarters. Cut equivalent chunks of carrots and chayote (if Italian zucchini is used, keep pieces bigger as they will cook faster than chayote). Add the vegetables to the soup. Chop 1/4 cup of cilantro and add it to the mixture. Add water to cover the vegetables and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes. Cut the head of white cabbage into half and then into thirds, leaving the stem of the cabbage in. Wedge the cabbage chunks into the mixture and simmer for 10 more minutes.

Serve with the wasabi cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 647,&quot;Broiled Shrimp with Garlic Butter 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 1 tablespoon chopped shallots 1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley 1/2 lemon, juiced Fine sea salt, to taste 24 uncooked large shrimp, shell and tail on 1/2 cup Fish Fumet, recipe follows, or water 2 pounds heads and bones from black bass, red snapper or halibut Cold water 2 tablespoons corn oil 1 medium onion, peeled and very thinly sliced 1/4 small fennel bulb, very thinly sliced 1 leek, very thinly sliced 15 white peppercorns 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 sprig fresh Italian parsley 1 bay leaf 1 cup dry white wine 3 cups water Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Place the butter in a small bowl and stir in the garlic, shallots, parsley, lemon juice and salt. Cut the shrimp in half lengthwise, leaving them attached at the tail. Spread the shrimp open and arrange them in a shallow, oval flameproof casserole. Top the shrimp with generous dabs of the butter mixture and pour fumet or water into the dish. Broil the shrimp until they are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Arrange the shrimp in a line across 4 plates, so that the tail of each shrimp fits inside the shrimp in front of it. Whisk the liquid in the casserole dish and pour it over the shrimp. Serve immediately. Remove the gills and eyes from the fish or have your fish store do it. Cut the heads and bones across into 4-inch pieces. Put them in a shallow pan and cover with cold water. Let stand for 1 hour, changing the water twice. Drain. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, fennel, leek, peppercorns, salt, parsley and bay leaf. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the fish bones and cook, stirring from time to time, until the bones and any flesh around the bones turn from translucent to white, about 12 minutes. Add the wine and water and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes, skimming off the foam as it rises to the top. Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes. Strain the fumet through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing firmly on the solids to extract as much of the flavorful liquid as possible. If you have more than 3 cups of fumet, place the liquid in a clean saucepan and boil until reduced to 3 cups. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 648,&quot;Texas Sauce 1 1/4 pounds ground beef 1/2 onion 3/4 teaspoon garlic salt 1 1/2 teaspoon pepper 1 1/2 ounce tomato paste 8 cups water 3 1/2 teaspoon paprika 6 teaspoon chili powder Instructions: Simmer onions and garlic sauce for one hour.

Microwave the stack of tortillas for 30 seconds, flipping halfway through. Tuck 1 tortilla into each cup of 2 standard 12-cup muffin pans, gently pleating the edges of the tortillas so that they fit snugly. Roll 24 small balls of aluminum foil and place them insides the cups; they&#39;ll help the tortillas hold their shape. Bake until the tortilla cups have hardened slightly on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly. (Leave the oven on.) Meanwhile, combine the black beans, enchilada sauce, chicken and corn in a large mixing bowl. Toss until the ingredients are evenly combined. Carefully spoon the filling into each cup until it is filled nearly to the brim. Sprinkle the cheeses on top of each tortilla cup. Bake until the cheese is melted and the filling is warmed through, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle the top of each cup evenly with desired garnishes and serve warm. Mash the avocados with the lime juice. Mix in the onion and season with salt and pepper. Flavor with one of the 3 following options. For pomegranate guacamole, fold in the pomegranate seeds. Top with more seeds before serving. For roasted jalapeno guacamole, fold in the diced roasted jalapenos. For feta guacamole, fold in the feta cheese. Top with more feta before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Rioja]&quot; 651,&quot;Irish Soda Bread 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup currants Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the buttermilk and 3 tablespoons of the melted butter, using a fork, then stir in the currants. Once combined, the dough should come together. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead gently for just a few turns until the dough can be shaped into a 6-inch round (do not over-knead). Place the shaped dough into a cast-iron skillet or sheet tray. Cut an \x\ into the top of the round loaf, using a knife. Bake until the center has cooked through (testing with a skewer), about 40 minutes. Slather with the remaining tablespoon melted butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 652,&quot;Spring Vegetable Rice Salad (Insalata di Riso) 1 cup Arborio rice 1/2 pound medium asparagus 1 cup shelled English peas, from about 1 pound fresh peas 2 pounds fresh fava beans 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons lemon juice Sea salt, preferably gray salt, and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup thinly sliced basil leaves 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 1/2 cup small diced boiled ham 1/4 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add rice, stir, and adjust heat to maintain a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent any grains from sticking to the pot, until the rice is just barely done, about 15 minutes. It will continue to cook as it cools. Drain the rice well and spread it out on a tray to cool quickly. Bring another large pot of salted water to a boil. Holding an asparagus spear in both hands, bend the spear until it breaks naturally at the point where it becomes tough. Repeat with the remaining spears. Discard the tough ends and cut the tender part into 1/3-inch lengths. Blanch asparagus and peas together in the boiling water for 1 minute and 30 seconds, then lift out with a strainer and transfer to a paper towel lined baking sheet to cool. Shell the fava beans, then blanch the unpeeled beans in the same boiling water for about 3 minutes. Drain, transfer them to a paper towel lined baking sheet to cool. Peel the fava beans by pinching open the loose skin; the peeled bean should slip out easily. Put the lemon juice in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Gradually whisk in the olive oil. In a large bowl, combine the cooled rice, asparagus, peas, fava beans, basil, parsley, lemon zest, ham and cheese. Toss with your hands to blend. Pour the dressing over the salad (you may not need it all) and toss gently. Taste and adjust seasoning. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 653,&quot;Poppy Seed Cakes 1 cup butter 3/4 cup sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/3 cup poppy seeds 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 1/4 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon Instructions: In the bowl of a standing mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar. In a separate bowl beat the egg and vanilla until light and fluffy (I&#39;m not convinced we need to do this step but my grandma did. Will she strike me down if I take a shortcut? Only one way to find out). Add egg mixture to the butter mixture and combine. In a separate bowl stir together the dry ingredients then add to the butter mixture and combine well. Roll dough into a log 9-inches long and 1 1/2-inches wide, then wrap waxed paper, and chill 2 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut dough into 1/4-inch slices and place on a greased cookie sheet. Bake until golden brown on the edges about 10 to 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 654,&quot;Roasted Apple Pies with Whipped Cream 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 1 (9-inch) refrigerated rolled pie crust (recommended: Pillsbury) 2 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, plus extra for dusting Instructions: Special equipment: a 3-inch round cookie cutter Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper sprayed with vegetable cooking spray. Unroll the pie crust out on a work surface. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 8 disks of pastry. Arrange the pastry disks on the prepared baking sheet. Using the tines of a fork, prick the pastry all over. Bake until brown and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes. Slice the bottom of the apples to create an even surface for cutting. Slice each apple into 6 (1/2-inch) slices. Cut each apple slice in half and remove any seeds or pieces of core. In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Add the apple slices and toss until coated. Shake off any excess mixture. Arrange the apple slices on the same baking sheet in a single layer. Bake until dark brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat the cream until thick, about 1 minute. Add the powdered sugar and continue to beat until the cream is very thick. To assemble the pies: Place the pastry disks on a work surface. Divide the cooked apple slices among 4 of the disks. Dollop about 2 tablespoons of the cream on top of the apples and cover with the remaining disks. Transfer the apple pies to dessert plates, dust with cinnamon and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 655,&quot;Pat&#39;s Potato Pierogis \Elegante<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature 1 egg 1/2 teaspoon butter, softened 1/2 cup lukewarm milk 4 to 5 medium potatoes, peeled, boiled in water until fork tender 2 teaspoons butter 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 medium onion, finely diced 1 large onion, roughly chopped 1 stick butter, plus extra for frying Instructions: In a large mixing bowl, add flour, salt, cream cheese, egg, butter, and milk. With your hands mix together until dough forms a ball. Turn out on a floured board and knead until smooth. You may add a little more flour to make the dough pliable. Divide dough into fourths. Put the pieces under a damp cloth, so it won&#39;t dry out. Roll the first piece to 1/4 inch of thickness and cut with a 3-inch cookie cutter or a glass. Put pierogi rounds under damp cloth while cutting the rest. Filling: This may be made ahead of time! Mash hot potatoes. Saute onion in the butter and add this to the hot mashed potatoes along with the cheddar cheese, salt and pepper. You may add a little milk if too dense. The consistency should be a little thicker than mashed potatoes. Assembly of pierogis: For each pierogi, place 1 tablespoon of potato mixture in the center of the dough circle. Fold over to form a half circle. Seal edges by pinching together with your fingers. I then take a fork and press all along the edges. Repeat with remaining dough filling. Cooking pierogis: Fill a large pot half full with water and bring to a boil. Drop 5 or 6 pierogis in at a time. When they float to the top, cook for 1 minute. Place in a colander to drain. They will stick to paper towels. Repeat with remaining pierogis. Frying pierogis: In a large frying pan saute onion in butter and remove onion to a separate bowl. Place pierogis in pan and cook for 2 mintues on each side. You may have to add more butter for frying. Remove and place in a covered casserole dish. When all pierogis are prepared, pour sauteed onion over the top. Serve with sour cream or applesauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 656,&quot;Classic Potato Latkes 2 medium to large yellow or Vidalia onions, quartered 3 jumbo eggs<br> 4 1/2 teaspoons powdered golden consomme<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper<br> 5 pounds Yukon gold potatoes<br> 3/4 to 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, depending on wetness of the batter<br> Neutral oil, for frying (I use canola)<br> Sour cream and chives or homemade applesauce, for serving<br> Instructions: Add the onions to a food processor and process with the standard blade until smooth. Add the eggs and process until light in color. Add the golden consomme and white pepper and blend on high until you have an even mush with no pieces of onion visible. Transfer the onion mush to a mixing bowl. Peel the potatoes and cut a third of them into quarters. Put the quartered potatoes in the food processor and blend until an even mush is achieved. Add the potato mush to the mixing bowl.<br> This is a good time to start heating your frying pan(s) on very low heat with NO OIL!<br> Switch to the food processor shredding disc and shred the remaining potatoes in batches if necessary. Before you add the shredded potatoes to the mixing bowl, take the potatoes by the handful and squeeze out as much water as possible over the sink. Add the squeezed potatoes to the mixing bowl--breaking them apart as you add them--and mix them in after every 2 to 3 handfuls. This will help evenly incorporate the mush and shreds for a consistent batter that is seasoned evenly as well. Use your strong spoon! Add 3/4 cup flour and mix; the batter is the right consistency when you don&#39;t see a lot of water collecting across the top. Add more flour a bit at a time, just enough to not have a watery mix.<br> Turn the pan(s) up to medium-high or high heat (for a heavier pan). When a drop of water in the pan sizzles and pops, the pan is hot enough to add about 3/4 inch of oil. Heat the oil to between 375 and 400 degrees F.<br> Before you start a big batch, make a few \tester latkes\ to taste so you can adjust the seasoning. How many you make will depend on how many \experts\ you have hanging around waiting for a \tester.\ Know the size of latke you want to make. I make larger ones if they are part of a meal and smaller ones if they are being served as an appetizer or being sent to school for a holiday party. Smaller ones should be about 1 tablespoon and larger ones should be about a serving spoon of batter.<br> Think to yourself \thin and crispy\ while you spoon the batter into the pan and flatten. Don&#39;t crowd the pan. The shredded edges may touch, but that&#39;s ok.<br> Cook the latkes until the bottoms are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes on the first side. You can&#39;t rush perfection--the middle has to cook. Don&#39;t make the heat so high that the outside burns but the middle is uncooked. Put on your favorite music or have someone you love keep you company!<br> Flip when the bottoms are golden brown. Flipping tip: Putting a spatula under the latke using your dominant hand and a fork on top of the latke with your other hand will give you a controlled flip that won&#39;t splash you with oil. Cook on the second side until the bottoms are golden brown, another 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Line a baking dish with paper towels. Place the cooked latkes on the lined baking dish on their sides (like a tray of Oreos); this will let the oil drain and keep them from getting soggy. If you have a lot of counter space, feel free to use a wire rack and then stack sideways. Foods cooked in oil are a part of the Chanukah story.<br> Mix the batter before each batch to keep everything well incorporated. Repeat and repeat and repeat and beware \experts\ looking for more \testers.\ If you need to add more oil to the pans, do it between batches and give it a minute to heat up. The latkes can be kept in a low oven to keep warm or the baking dish can be put in the oven at 350 degrees F to heat from room temperature.

Season both sides of flank steaks with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Place steaks on hot pan and cook 5 minutes per side for medium meat. Let steaks rest 10 minutes before slicing crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. While the steaks are cooking, season both sides of polenta with salt and black pepper. Arrange slices alongside steak for the last few minutes of cooking; cooking slices 1 to 2 minutes per side, until golden brown. While the steak and polenta are cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pearl onions and cook 3 minutes, until golden brown stirring with a spoon. Add mushrooms and cook 3 minutes, until mushrooms soften. Add thyme and cook 1 minute, until fragrant. Add wine and bring to a simmer, for 5 minutes, until sauce reduces to 1/4 cup.

Butter and flour an 8-inch springform pan. Place a large heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, making sure the water doesn\u2019t touch the bowl. Put the butter and chocolate in the bowl, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate melts. Take the bowl off the heat and set aside. First, whisk the sugar into the chocolate mixture, then whisk in the eggs, coffee, and salt, whisking until the mixture is combined and smooth. Sprinkle on the flour and fold it in with a rubber spatula until it\u2019s incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and place it on a sheet pan. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note), until the top puffs up and cracks and the cake doesn\u2019t wobble when you jiggle the pan. (A toothpick will not come out clean.) Remove from the oven and cool completely on a baking rack. The cake will deflate as it cools. Run a small knife around the cake and remove the sides of the pan.

Dry the lamb chops well and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the oil to the pan and heat until shimmering. Lay chops in the pan and cook, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the sides of the lamb registers 125 degrees F, about 4 minutes per side. After cooking the lamb on each side, stand it up on it&#39;s edges to brown the sides as well, about 2 minutes more. Reduce the heat if needed so the browned bits remaining in the pan don&#39;t burn. Remove chops from the skillet and set aside in a warm place. Pour off all but 1 1/2 tablespoons fat from the skillet. Add the garlic and cook, tilting the skillet to keep the garlic submerged in the fat, and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Add the wine and rosemary, stirring up browned bits from the bottom of the pan, and simmer over high heat until syrupy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth and cook until reduced by about half, another 5 to 6 minutes. Remove pan from the heat and briskly whisk in the butter. When the butter has incorporated, whisk in the mustard and heavy cream. Season with additional salt and pepper. Serve 2 chops per person with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 660,&quot;Mustard Pork Chops 2 pork chops, about 1-pound total weight 2 teaspoons infused oil 1/2 cup hard cider 1 tablespoon grain mustard 1/3 cup heavy cream Instructions: I love the old French favourites, the sorts that evoke not the supercilious waiter and theatrically removed silvered dome of the big name restaurants, but rather the small town bistro, all warm wood and rough red. This is possibly the easiest route to a proper, filling and yet strangely delicate dinner. The pork is cooked for just enough time to take away pinkness but ensure tenderness within, and gloriously scorched without. The mustard, cider and cream add comfort and piquancy. To soak up the gorgeous juices, and to serve as a fantastically quicktime potato substitute, I serve up gnocchi alongside. You could always add a little lemony fennel, sliced thinly, or a green salad if you&#39;re in the mood. Cut the fat or rind off the chops, and then bash them briefly but brutally with a rolling pin between 2 pieces of cling film/plastic wrap to make them thinner. Heat the oil in a pan, and then cook the chops over a moderately-high heat for about 5 minutes a side. Remove them to a warmed plate. Pour the cider into the pan, still over the heat, to deglaze the pan. Let it bubble away for a minute or so then add the mustard and stir in the cream. Let the sauce continue cooking for a few minutes before pouring over each plated pork chop. If you&#39;re having gnocchi with, make sure you turn them in the pan to absorb any spare juices before adding them to your plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 661,&quot;Blackened Chutney Halibut: \Chutbut<br> 6 halibut fillets, cut to 1/2 to 3/4-inch thickness (1/2 pound to 1 pound per person) Cajun Spice, recipe follows 1 stick butter, clarified Mango Chutney, recipe follows 2 to 3 teaspoons cayenne pepper, to taste 1 teaspoon dry mustard 2 teaspoons garlic powder or granulated garlic 2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon celery salt 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme 1 teaspoon ground pink or white pepper peppercorns 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced 2 to 4 fresh mangoes, chopped (can substitute kiwi, peach or cantaloupe) 1 cup dried cranberries (recommended: Craisins) 1 small lemon, zested 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup cider vinegar Dash ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: Heat a cast iron skillet directly over hot coals in a barbecue until smoky hot. Alternatively, heat the skillet on the stove over high heat until very hot. Sprinkle Cajun Spice on the fish, or, for a more robust flavor, dredge the fillets in the Cajun Spice, coating both sides of fish. When the pan is hot, pour approximately 2 tablespoons of clarified butter into pan, and reduce heat to medium-high. Carefully add as many fillets as will fit in the skillet, leaving at least 1/2-inch in between each. Cook the fish for approximately 2 minutes on the first side, and then flip the fillets with a fish spatula. While flipping the fish, add another 1 to 2 tablespoons clarified butter to the pan, and sear the fish on the second side for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Repeat with remaining fish fillets, adding more butter as needed. Serve the halibut on a bed of white or wild rice. Pour the Mango Chutney over the fish, and serve with a green salad on the side. Combine all ingredients together in a bowl, stirring until well mixed. Set aside for dredging fish fillets. Add all ingredients to a medium non-reactive saucepan. Simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Set aside, and keep chutney warm until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 662,&quot;Fried Turkey Breast One boneless, skin-on turkey breast (3 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Canola oil, for frying Instructions: One hour before frying, place the turkey breast on a baking sheet, sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper, and let sit at room temperature. To figure out how much oil you will need for frying, put the breast in a large pot and cover with water by 3 inches; the pot should be large enough that the water comes no more than halfway up the sides. Remove the breast and check the water level -- that is how much oil you will need. Dry the pot and add the oil. Heat to 350 degrees F on a deep-frying thermometer. Pat the breast dry with paper towels. Using heat-resistant gloves (to protect yourself from burns), SLOWLY and CAREFULLY lower it into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and season with a bit more salt.

Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans. Cream the granulated sugar and butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla, eggs and bananas. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix the flour mixture into the butter mixture, alternating with the sour cream--do not overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans and bake until a tester comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool before removing from the pans. For the buttercream: In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, mix the salt, confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla and egg whites for 5 minutes on medium-high speed. Add the butter, little by little, and mix for 10 minutes. Fold in the chopped strawberries. To assemble the cake: Using a serrated knife, cut the top dome off of the cakes to make them level.

(If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling.) Cook the poblano and bell peppers on the grill, turning occasionally, until completely charred on the outside, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with a plate to steam for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, grill the onions until golden and soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Peel the poblano and bell peppers and remove and discard the stems and skins. Cut the flesh into 1/2-inch strips and set aside. (Keep the poblano strips separate from bell pepper strips.) Set the steak on a cutting board. Using a long thin knife and starting at the thin, narrow end of the steak, slice it in half horizontally leaving 2 inches of the meat uncut at the wide end of the steak so the pieces stay attached. Open it up like a book so you have one long piece. Pound the steak with a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch. Arrange the steak flat on a work surface with a long side facing you. Combine the cilantro, tomato paste, oil, cumin, oregano, scallions and 2 teaspoons salt in a bowl. Spread the paste all over the top of the steak. Working in three batches, arrange vertical stripes of the poblanos, bell peppers, onions, and olives on the steak until the steak is covered, leaving 2 inches empty at each end. Roll up the steak like a jelly roll, starting at one of the short ends. Tie the steak closed around the circumference with butcher&#39;s twine at 2-inch intervals. Tie one more piece of twine lengthwise around the steak. Put the steak on the direct heat side of the grill and cook, turning, to brown all 4 sides, about 2 minutes per side. Move the steak to the indirect heat side of the grill, cover and cook, turning occasionally, until the center of the steak registers 115 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 30 minutes for a steak that is well-done on the outside and medium-rare in the center. (Test frequently; the time will vary based on the temperature of your grill.) Let the steak rest about 10 minutes. Untie the steak and cut it into 6 thick slices.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 713,&quot;New England Lobster Roll 1 live lobster or one pound cooked lobster meat, 2 cups 1/4 cup celery 1/4 cup mayonnaise Salt and freshly ground black pepper Hot dog buns Butter Paprika Instructions: Put lobster in boiling water and cover.

Add the egg yolk and 1 to 2 tablespoons of the ice water. Pulse, pulse, pulse until the mixture comes together. If it seems a bit dry, add a little more water and pulse, pulse, pulse until the mixture comes together into a ball. Dump the whole thing out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the mixture only enough to make it a smooth ball, 1 or 2 times. Using a rolling pin or your fingers, roll or press the dough out into an even circle 11 to 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a cookie sheet lined with plastic wrap and enclose the dough in plastic wrap, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the sugar, apple cider, lemon juice and vanilla bean seeds in a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof pan and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, brushing down the sides of the pan occasionally with a pastry brush dipped in water, if necessary. Cook, swishing the pan around gently to promote even cooking, until the mixture turns light brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Continue to cook the mixture until it becomes a much deeper amber color, another minute or so. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, 2 pats at a time. The mixture will bubble up. That is okay, just be VERY CAREFUL not to get any of this on you. When all of the butter has been incorporated, begin to arrange the pears rounded-side down in circles. Try to do this neatly and in a pretty way. Remember, the bottom will be the top! Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium heat for 20 minutes, then remove from the heat. Retrieve the chilled pastry and place it on top of the pears. Tuck the pastry in around the edges of the pan. Bake until the dough is golden brown and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the tart cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Place a serving platter upside down on top of the pastry and CAREFULLY flip the platter and the pan over. Let the tart fall gently out of the pan.

Scatter the butter over the top and pulse with the dry mixture to coat, and then continue pulsing until cool and almost sandy, about eight 3-second pulses. Drizzle the yolk over the top, and pulse again until the ingredients are moist and barely starting to clump, about another 8 pulses. The dough should just hold together when you squeeze it in your palm. If not, add 1 teaspoon of cold water and pulse briefly.<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured work surface. Smear out the dough across the work surface using the heel of your hand until it begins to come together. Gather the dough back together and shape it into a disc. Wrap in plastic and chill for 1 hour.<br> Let the dough warm up slightly before rolling it out (if you roll it while it is cold, it will crack). Roll the dough on a lightly-floured work surface with a rolling pin into a 1/8 to 3/16-inch-thick circles, 10 to 11 inches in diameter. Fit the dough into an 8-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Don&#39;t worry if it cracks a bit; you can patch it with some of the trimmings. Press the dough firmly into the bottom of the pan where it meets the sides, and then roll the rolling pin across the pan to cut off the overhang. Press the dough firmly against the sides of the pan and back up to the top using your fingers (sometimes the rolling pin pushes the dough down the sides of the pan a bit). Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Position the rack on the lowest rung of the oven and put a baking sheet on top. Line the chilled crust with a 10-inch coffee filter and weight it down with dried beans or rice. Place on the hot baking sheet and bake until the sides begin to turn golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the shell from the oven, carefully remove the beans and filter and then return to the oven until completely golden brown and baked through, another 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F. Let cool before adding the filling, about 10 minutes.<br> For the filling: Pulse the maple sugar, flour and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the melted butter and pulse to combine, and then add the buttermilk and vanilla and pulse to combine again. Add the eggs and pulse until just combined-don&#39;t over-mix. Strain into the tart shell. Bake the tart until the sides are set (they may puff slightly) and the middle still jiggles slightly when you tap the pan, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a rack for at least 45 minutes.

Whisk in the egg yolks until combined, then whisk in the milk. Heat over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken, 4 to 5 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat. Whisk in the butter and vanilla bean paste. Transfer to a bowl, then press a sheet of plastic wrap on the surface of the pastry cream. Let cool, then refrigerate until chilled through, at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Start the cream puff dough: In a medium saucepan, bring the milk, butter and salt to a simmer over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture comes together. Cook until the mixture starts to pull away from the sides of the pan into a ball and looks dry, 3 to 5 minutes more. Finish the cream puff dough: Using a wooden spoon, beat in the eggs, one at a time, waiting until they are fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix until the batter is shiny and stiff. Alternatively, you can use a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-low speed to incorporate the eggs. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round pastry tip. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Form and bake: On the prepared baking sheet, pipe rounds of dough that are 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide and about 1 inch high, allowing 1 inch between each. Alternatively, measure out a scant 1/4-cup dough for each puff. Wet your finger and press down any pointed tops on the cream puffs. Bake for 15 minutes. Lower the oven to 350 degrees F and bake until firm to the touch, another 15 to 20 minutes. Finish baking: Shut the oven off. Let the puffs dry inside the oven for 10 minutes. Remove and let cool. Assemble: Using a paring knife, hollow out a hole in the bottom of each of the puffs. Pipe the pastry cream into the hole. Alternatively, you can cut the top off each puff and remove any undercooked dough in the center, then fill with the pastry cream and top with the top again. Hold in the refrigerator until ready to garnish and serve. Make the chocolate sauce: In a small pot, heat the cream. In a small bowl that fits over the pot of cream (without the bottom of the bowl touching the cream), combine the chocolate with the cinnamon. Use the pot of cream as the bottom of the double boiler and melt the chocolate over the cream. When the chocolate is melted, add the heated cream to the bowl with the chocolate and whisk to combine. Keep warm. Top the cream puffs with a sprinkle of confectioners\u2019 sugar and some of the chocolate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 729,&quot;Chicken Mishmash 1 1/2 cups leftover chicken, skinless, finely chopped 1 red pepper, finely diced 2 cloves roasted garlic 2 eggs 1 handful grated cooked potatoes Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons of canola oil Instructions: Combine the chicken, red pepper, garlic, eggs and potatoes in a large bowl.

Whisk the egg yolks with 1/4 cup water in a medium bowl. Line up the tots, egg wash, ground cereal and prepared baking sheet with the rack on your work surface. Dip the tots in the egg wash (let the excess drip off), roll them in the cereal to fully coat and place on the rack. (To avoid a mess, designate one hand for dipping and retrieving in the egg and the other for rolling in the cereal.) Spray each tot all over with the cooking spray, turning as needed. (Unsprayed breaded tots can be placed on a parchment-lined baking sheet, frozen until solid, about 2 hours, then transferred to a large freezer bag for up to 1 month. Coat with cooking spray before baking.) Bake the tots on the prepared baking sheet until golden brown outside and hot inside, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a serving platter.

Generously coat the interiors of 8 6-ounce straight-sided ramekins with the softened butter using a pastry brush or your fingers. Pour 2 tablespoons sugar into 1 dish and turn it until all surfaces are coated, then tip the sugar out into the next and repeat the process until all the ramekins have a thorough coating of butter and sugar. Set the prepared molds in a large shallow baking pan or on a half-sheet pan.</li><li>Applesauce. Tie the rosemary sprigs together with kitchen twine, wrapping the twine in a spiral up the length of the stems to keep the needles from falling off in the sauce. Put 3/4 cup sugar in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place it over medium-high heat. When the sugar begins to melt, stir it with a wooden spoon. it will form big lumps at first, but keep cooking and stirring until all the sugar is dissolved and you have a smooth amber syrup. As soon as it reaches this stage, add 2 tablespoons butter and stir until it is melted and incorporated. Add the apples and stir. The caramel will harden and form lumps again, but once the sauce cooks it will dissolve. Add the rosemary bundle, cinnamon stick, and vanilla bean. Stir in the vanilla extract if using. Puree the mixture with a handheld immersion blender, in a food processor, or by passing it through a food mill. You should have a deep brown sauce that is thick enough to hold its shape in a mound. (This applesauce can be stored covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.)</li><li>Egg whites. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and liquor if suing into the applesauce. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks, add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and continue to beat until they form stiff peaks. Using a large rubber spatula, fold one-third of the whites into the apple mixture until it is thoroughly incorporated, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Tilt the bowl over the prepared souffle cups and, using the rubber spatula to carefully guide the mixture, fill the dishes to 1/2 inch of the top. Wipe up any spills ont he sides of the dishes and, using your thumb, wipe off any mixture that is touching the rims. If the souffle bakes onto any buttered surface at the top of dish, it will stick and prevent it from rising straight up. At this point the souffles can be held up to 1 hour at room temperature.</li><li>Baking. Put the baking pan holding the souffles in the oven and pour about 1/2 inch hot tap water into the pan. Bake until the souffles are nicely browned and risen about 1 1/2 inches, 20 to 25 minutes. Using tongs or oven mitts, immediately transfer the hot dishes to individual serving plates and rush them to the tables with pitchers of the custard sauce. Each guest should break open their souffle in the middle and pour in some of the custard.</li><li>Heating the milk and warming the yolks. Pour the milk and sugar into a small (1 to 2-quart) saucepan and set it over medium heat. Put the egg yolks in a medium stainless-steel mixing bowl and float that bowl in a larger bowl half full of hot tap water. Whisk the yolks until they are lukewarm, about 90 degrees to 100 degrees F. (it will take less than 1 minute), then lift the bowl out of the water.</li><li>Cooking the custard. The instant the milk mixture comes to a rolling boil and rises in the pan, lift it off the heat. With the whisk in one hand and the saucepan in the other, pour the boiling milk into the egg yolks as you whisk constantly but gently. Continue to gently stir the sauce with the whisk for 30 seconds. At this point it should be fully cooked. An instant-read thermometer set in the sauce should register 170 degrees to 180 degrees F. It should coat a teaspoon, but it will become much thicker when it cools. (If for some reason the sauce did not get hot enough to thicken, you can place the bowl on top of a saucepan of boiling water and stir it with a rubber spatula until it reaches 170 degrees F. Do not heat the sauce above 180 degrees F. or it will curdle.) Now whisk the sauce rapidly for 30 seconds to cool it and then pour it through a fine sieve. Store it in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.<br> Pour the milk into a small (1 to 2-quart) saucpean and place it over medium-high heat. Watch the pan carefully. As soon as the milk comes to a full boil, add the herbs and any additional flavoring, push them under the surface of the pan and let the herbs steep for 30 minutes. If they steep longer, it will have little effect on the flavor, but you should uncover the pan so that the milk can cool faster. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve into a large liquid measuring cup, pressing down firmly on the herbs with the back of a spoon to extract all the liquid from the leaves. Add fresh milk if needed to measure 2 cups. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 761,&quot;Mangoes Foster with Creme Fraiche 1 stick unsalted butter 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 6 large slightly under-ripe mangoes, halved and pitted 1/3 cup bourbon 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans 1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream, optional Instructions: Heat the grill to high. Place a medium saucepan on the grates of the grill, add the butter, and brown sugar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has melted and the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. While the sauce is cooking, remove the mangoes from the peel and cut into diamond shapes. Place the diamonds onto serving plates. Remove the pan with the sauce from the heat and add the bourbon. Using a long lit match, ignite the bourbon and allow the flames to subside. Stir in the cinnamon, salt and pecans.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Drop 1/4 cup of the potato mixture into the skillet, pressing down lightly with a spatula. Repeat until there are 4 hash browns in the skillet. Cook until golden brown on the bottom, 5 to 7 minutes, reducing the heat to medium low if they start to brown too quickly. Flip and cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat the process with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and remaining potato mixture. For the cheesy eggs: In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs and season with salt and pepper. Melt the butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lower the heat and add the egg mixture. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, push the eggs toward the center of the skillet and let the liquid run out. Cook, continually moving, until just set, about 2 minutes. Drop 2 tablespoons of the garlic-herb cheese into the middle. Gently fold the cheese into the warm eggs. Divide the hash browns among 4 plates. Top each with some cheesy eggs and sliced avocado.

Spoon about 1/2 cup of barbeque sauce over the meat slices and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 768,&quot;Apricot Orange-Glazed Duck 6 ducks, 5 to 6 pounds each 4 3/4 cups apricot-orange glaze, recipe follows 1/4 cup reserved duck fat (from duck drippings) 6 cups duck or chicken stock 4 cups apricot-orange glaze, recipe follows 2/3 cup, plus 3 tablespoons flour Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups apricot preserves 2 cups orange preserves 4 cups maple syrup 1/2 cup brandy 6 tablespoons Grand Marnier or Triple Sec Instructions: Rinse the ducks with cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Place them in a large shallow dish or plastic container and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Place the duck, breast side up, on racks in several shallow roasting pans. Prick the skin all over, especially along the side of the breast, so that the fat can run off while roasting. Roast for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Continue roasting for 15 to 20 minutes per pound. Begin to baste with the glaze once the ducks have been roasting for 50 minutes. Baste every 5 to 10 minutes. The ducks are done when a meat thermometer registers 170 degrees. If you prefer your meat well done, continue to roast about another 15 minutes, but be aware the meat may become a bit dry. Discard all but 1/4 cup of the residual fat in the roasting pan, reserving for Apricot-Orange Duck Sauce recipe. Cooks Note: Unless you have 2 ovens, roast 3 ducks at a time. Reheat the first set of ducks for about 10 minutes, or until heated through. Place one of the roasting pans, which have been drained of fat, on stovetop. Set heat of burners to medium, add the 1/4-cup fat and stir to loosen pieces from bottom of pan. Whisk in stock. Simmer for 15 minutes, uncovered. Add apricot-orange glaze; simmer 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place flour in a medium bowl and whisk in 1 1/2 cups liquid scooped up from the pan; blend well. Add flour mixture to pan, whisking until well blended. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes or until slightly thickened. Add salt and pepper, to taste. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix well.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 769,&quot;Honey Soy Grilled Salmon with Edamame 1/4 cup packed cilantro leaves 2 scallions 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon grated ginger Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 center cut skin-on wild salmon fillets, about 6 ounces each 2 teaspoons fresh lime juice 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce 2 teaspoons honey 1/4 teaspoon black sesame seeds 1 1/3 cups cooked edamame Lime wedges, optional garnish Instructions: Preheat the grill over medium-high direct heat. Oil the grill grates. Finely chop the cilantro and scallion and mix in the oil and ginger. Season with salt and pepper. Cut two 3-inch long slits through the skin lengthwise on the bottom of the salmon fillets, going about halfway into the salmon. Evenly stuff the slits with the herb mixture. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Stir together the lime juice, soy and honey until smooth. Place the salmon, skin side up, on the grill and cook until well marked, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the salmon and continue to cook, brushing the tops with the sauce, until the fish is cooked through, about another 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle the tops with the sesame seeds. Serve with edamame and lime wedges. Broiler directions: Position an oven rack so that a baking sheet set on the rack is about 4-inches below the heat source. Preheat the broiler. Prepare the salmon as above and place the fillets, skin down, on a foil lined baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Broil, basting 3 to 4 times with the sauce, until just cooked through, about 6 to 7 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 770,&quot;Roasted Elk 2 pounds elk roast Pinch salt and pepper 1/2 cup duck fat, rendered Instructions: Rub the elk roast with salt and pepper. Roast in a preheated 400-degree F oven for about 25 minutes per pound, or until the thermometer registers 140 degrees. While the elk is roasting, periodically, baste the roast with the rendered duck fat to maintain the moisture. Let roast cook until an inserted meat thermometer reads 155 degrees. Let the roast rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah/Shiraz]&quot; 771,&quot;Apple Fries with Apple Pie Spice Whipped Cream 1 quart neutral frying oil 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon powdered sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> 1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar<br> 2 Granny Smith apples, cored, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick strips<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: Pour the oil into a small Dutch oven fitted with a deep-fry thermometer. Heat over medium heat to 365 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar, apple pie spice and vanilla in a large bowl. Whip with a whisk or hand mixer until it holds medium peaks. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Whisk 1/4 cup water into the cornstarch in a bowl until smooth. Add the cinnamon sugar and whisk to combine. Dip the apple strips into the mixture and toss until evenly coated. Allow any excess mixture to drip off before carefully lowering half of the apples into the hot oil. Fry, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Let drain on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Fry the remaining apple strips in the same manner. Serve immediately alongside the whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 772,&quot;Hot Mussels 1 pound mussels 1/2 cup licorice-flavored liqueur (recommended: Pernod) 3 tablespoons salted butter, softened 1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives 1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon leaves 3 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs Freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon, cut into wedges Instructions: Preheat the oven to broil with the rack near the top. Clean the mussels, discarding any that are open. Bring the liqueur to a boil in a large pot, and add the mussels, cover, and cook 3 minutes, or until opened. Drain and discard any mussels that have remained closed. Mash the butter with the chives and tarragon in a bowl. Put a pinch of the herbed butter on each mussel. Sprinkle over the breadcrumbs. Grind over some pepper. Broil until the crumbs are golden, about 2 minutes. Serve the mussels with lemon wedges for squeezing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Albari?o]&quot; 773,&quot;Kakawa&#39;s Mayan cl Chocolate Elixir 3 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped into chunks, such as Valrhona 4 tablespoons agave or honey 2 tablespoons cl powder (we use ancho) 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: In a medium saucepan, heat 1 1/2 cups water until almost boiling. Turn off the heat and add in the chocolate. Whisk until melted and combined. Turn the heat back on again if you wish to further melt, heat and thicken. However, do not walk away, chocolate burns very easily. Continue stirring until you remove it from the heat. Do not let the chocolate and water come to a full boil. After the water and chocolate are combined, add in the agave, cl powder and vanilla.<br> Enjoy immediately while it&#39;s hot, or pour over ice for a unique experience! &quot;,&quot;[Tempranillo, Malbec, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah]&quot; 774,&quot;White Bean and Chorizo Soup 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 link or 5 1/2 ounces Chorizo sausage, diced 1 large onion, thinly sliced 2 celery stalks, diced 2 cloves garlic, crushed 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 1 teaspoon paprika 2 tomatoes, diced 4 cups chicken stock 2 (14-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: In a large pan, heat the olive oil over high heat, and saute the sausage, until it crisps, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain the pieces on a paper towel, and set aside.<br> Reduce the heat to medium-low, and add the onion and celery to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 6 to 7 minutes. Add in the garlic, thyme, and paprika and continue cooking and stirring, until the herbs are fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for another minute. Return the chorizo to the pan along with the stock. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add in the beans and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Season the soup with the sea salt and black pepper before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 775,&quot;Garlic Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes 2 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, washed and quartered 2 cloves garlic Kosher salt 1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream 1/2 stick cold butter, cut into 3 pats Instructions: Place the potatoes and garlic in a saucepan. Cover with 1 to 2 inches cold water and season generously with salt. The water should taste like the sea. TASTE IT! If the water is under seasoned at this point it will be hard to have a well-seasoned end product. Bring the pan of water to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and garlic well and pass through a food mill or ricer. DO NOT use a food processor or blender. It will result in a very sticky and rubbery end product. While passing the potatoes, bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Once the cream has come to a boil, remove from the heat. While the potatoes are still hot, add one-third of the cream and 2 pats of the butter and stir vigorously into the potatoes. Repeat this process two more times until all of the cream and butter has been incorporated. Taste the potatoes for seasoning, and add salt if needed. Serve immediately or cover with foil and keep warm in an oven on low heat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 776,&quot;Pastel de Choclo 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts 5 cups chicken broth 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 1 tablespoon paprika 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/4 cup butter 6 large ears fresh corn, husked or highquality frozen 1/2 to 1 cup milk 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 8 fresh basil leaves, chopped 4 hardboiled eggs, peeled, sliced 1 cup pitted black brinecured olives (such as Alfonso or Kalamata) 1 cup raisins 2 tablespoons powdered sugar Instructions: Poach chicken in broth until cooked through. Cool in broth. Shred chicken. Save broth for another use. Set aside. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and stir until golden brown. Add paprika, cumin and oregano and stir until fragrant. Add shredded chicken and stir well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Using grater, grate corn from cob (WilliamsSonoma sells a special gadget for grating corn right into a bowl). If using canned or frozen corn, pulse in food processor until coarsely pureed. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add corn, sugar and salt. Gradually stir in enough milk and cook until mixture is slightly thick. Stir in basil. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spoon chicken mixture into 2quart baking dish. Arrange hardboiled eggs, olives and raisins over. Pour corn mixture over, smoothing top to cover filling completely. Sprinkle powdered sugar over top.

Rinse salmon fillet under cold running water and pat dry. Cut a piece of foil long and wide enough to encase the salmon when folded over the center and folded up on the ends. Position the foil on a large baking sheet and place the salmon in the center of the foil, skin side down. Sprinkle the salmon with the salt, pepper, and rosemary. Place the lemon slices over the fish fillet along with the sliced onion and garlic slivers. Drizzle the fillet evenly with the olive oil and fold the edges of the foil up over the salmon and crimp to seal. Fold the edges together on both ends to create an airtight package. Bake the salmon for 15 minutes, or until just cooked through but still moist. Serve immediately, using a large metal spatula to portion fish. Serve some of the accumulated juices spooned over the fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 778,&quot;True Brew Brewing a simply perfect cup of Joe can be perfectly simple, if you stick to some basic guidelines: Instructions: Buy quality whole beans from a reliable purveyor (preferably a roaster). If you don&#39;t have a grinder at home, ask a salesperson to grind whole beans for you rather than settling for pre-ground. Purchasing bulk (unpackaged) beans from a specialty shop is okay as long as the bins or jars are relatively small and refilled regularly. Large vats hold a lot of beans and therefore don&#39;t need frequent filling. That means that beans can hang around for a long time being exposed to light and air. That can mean stale beans, and staleness is not a desirable attribute. Purchase pre-packaged whole beans only when sealed in a foil-style bag featuring a one-way valve. The dime-shaped plastic valve is usually integrated into the packaging so that it will be as unobtrusive as possible, so check carefully. The absence of a valve means that the coffee probably sat and \gassed out\ before it was packaged. That means it could be stale. Stale, again, is not a good thing. And remember: paper bags with twist tops are temporary transportation vessels, not storage devices. Try to purchase only a week&#39;s worth of beans at a time. If you live where this is impractical, purchase several small sealed packages rather than one large one. Unopened one-way valve bags will keep coffee fresh for approximately three months. If you buy bulk coffee (not sealed with one-way valves) in large amounts, divide into weekly batches, seal in Mason-style jars and freeze. Transfer these small batches to counter top storage as needed (see below) . Store opened or bulk coffee in an airtight, opaque container and store at room temperature for up to a week. Grind coffee as close to brewing time as possible. For drip method, grind in blade style grinder for 15 to 20 seconds. For French presses, grind for only 10 to 12 seconds. Regardless of method, brew using 2 heaping tablespoons of coffee for each 6 ounces of clean (filtered or bottled), cool water. If you prefer a milder cup, brew to full strength (between 190 and 205 degrees F), and then dilute with hot water. Brewing with too little coffee will result in over-extraction, and that means bitterness. If you really want to taste the subtle nuances of regional coffees, consider a gold mesh filter. When purchasing a coffee maker (either manual or electric), look for a model that brews into a thermal carafe rather than a glass pot designed to sit on a heating element. Continuous heating of coffee leads to bitterness. Quality decaffeinated coffees usually cost more than regular beans. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 779,&quot;Salabat 4-5 cups water 3 inches fresh ginger, sliced thinly 1 cup brown sugar Instructions: Boil the water, ginger, and brown sugar together. Reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Add more water if tea is too strong. Strain and serve hot or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 780,&quot;Double-Fried French Fries 4 large russet potatoes (about 2 pounds) Canola oil, for deep-frying (about 2 quarts) Fine sea salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Fill a large bowl with cold water. Peel the potatoes. Cut into 1/3-inch-thick slices, then stack the slices and cut into 1/3-inch-thick sticks, adding the potato sticks to the bowl of water as you go. Soak at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. (This will help remove the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing.) Fill a heavy stockpot with 1 1/2 inches canola oil; fit with a deep-fry thermometer and heat the oil over medium heat until the thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Drain the potatoes and pat dry to remove any excess water. Add 2 handfuls of potatoes to the hot oil. (There should be at least 1 inch of oil above the potatoes.) Par-cook the potatoes until they are light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon, gently shaking off the excess oil; let drain on a rack. Repeat until all the potatoes are par-cooked. Bring the temperature of the oil to 350 degrees F. Cook the potatoes again, 2 handfuls at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon, shake off the excess and season lightly with salt and pepper. Repeat until all the potatoes are cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 781,&quot;Karythopitta: Walnut Cake 1 cup superfine sugar 1/4 cup honey 3/4 cup water 1 tablespoon brandy 4 cloves 1 cinnamon stick 3 pieces orange rind, pith removed 2 1/2 cups walnuts, finely ground 1 cup flour, sifted 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch ground clove 4 ounces unsalted butter 1/4 cup of superfine sugar 4 eggs, separated Instructions: For the syrup: Heat the sugar, honey, water, and brandy over medium-high heat until the sugar has dissolved. Turn heat to low and add in cloves, cinnamon stick, and orange rind. Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes and remove from the heat. Remove the orange, cloves and cinnamon stick and cool.

This creates 6 chops that are thicker than a normal lamb chop -- YUM!! Cut each rack into 6 equal chops, place on a baking sheet, and transfer to the fridge. For the harissa: Preheat a grill. Place the bell peppers on the grill and cook them on all sides until the skin is black and charred. Transfer the peppers to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let them hang out until cool. HINT, HINT: This can totally be done ahead! YAY! Scrape the black charred skin off the peppers and remove the stem and seeds. Coarsely chop the peppers and transfer them to the bowl of a food processor. Add the cumin, coriander, fennel, caraway, chiles, garlic, vinegar, and tomato paste to the food processor and season with salt. Puree until smooth. Add 1/4 cup of the olive oil to the mixture and pulse, pulse, pulse. Add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and pulse again until thoroughly combined. Taste and season with salt. Taste again and re-season if needed. Store in an airtight container until ready to use. To make the lamb: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Remove the lamb from the fridge, season generously with salt, and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes before cooking. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring the pan to medium-high heat. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, add the lamb chops and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare (if you like your meat a little more well done, lower the heat and cook them a minute or 2 longer). If the pan begins to smoke, lower the heat. The chops will be beautifully browned on each side. Stand up the chops to brown the fat edge along each chop. YUM!!! Brown food tastes good! Place the cooked chops on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven to keep them hot while the others cook. Top each lamb chop with a spoonful of harissa and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 785,&quot;Sugar Witch&#39;s Hat 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar Scant 2/3 cup light corn syrup Scant 1/2 cup water Orange and black food color paste Orange and black food color paste<br> Vegetable baking spray<br> Instructions: Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 320 degrees F. Remove from the heat and carefully divide the cooked sugar between 2 medium-size microwaveable glass bowls. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown. A glass bowl will hold the temperature of the sugar. I put a towel under the bowl to keep the bowl from tipping over and to protect my hands from the heat of the glass. (The sugar will stay liquid enough to work with easily for about 10 minutes; after that it will start to thicken. If this happens before you are finished, just pop the bowl in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sugar is liquid enough to work with once again.) Add a few drops of orange food coloring to 1 bowl and mix with a wooden skewer. Add a few drops of black food coloring to the other bowl and mix with a wooden skewer.<br> To make the brim: Trace a large circle onto a piece of parchment paper. Turn over the paper and give it a light coating of vegetable cooking spray. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot orange sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the circle, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly around the side of the circle, making sure to come all the way to the edges of the brim. Then dip the tines of the fork into the hot black sugar. Repeat the process. You will be able to see the paper through the sugar but you want to make this layer thick. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes.<br> To make the cone of the hat: Wash, dry, and lightly but thoroughly spray the clean, dry mold with the baking spray, wiping out excess with a paper towel. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot orange sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the outside of the mold, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly around the side of the mold, making sure to come all the way to the top and the brim. Then dip the tines of the fork into the hot black sugar. Repeat the process. You should still be able to see the mold through the sugar. Make a nice thick layer of sugar so the hat will be sturdy. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes.<br> To unmold, place your hands on the inside of the mold and let your fingers gently pull or slide the sugar loose from the side of the mold. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside. Keep moving the sugar as it cools. This will keep it from resticking but you need to wait until the sugar has cooled. Once the sugar has released from the mold, carefully lift it out and place it over the brim. If the sugar is still too warm, the hat may begin to collapse. That is why it is a good idea to release the sugar from the mold but leave it in the mold until it has cooled completely. (At this stage, the cage can be stored, right side up, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for 1 to 2 days.)<br> Carefully remove the parchment paper from the brim. You should be able to pull it out from under the brim. Do not worry if the brim cracks or breaks. You can use a blow torch to melt the sugar back into place. Carefully lift the cone of the hat and center it on top of the brim. I used a special Croquembouche mold to make my Witch&#39;s Hat because it is exactly the right shape. You do not need to buy this expensive mold to make your decoration. Use any metal or ceramic shape, preferably one that does not have outside handles or seams.<br> Remember you are working with hot sugar so be sure to have a bowl of cold water ready in case you get any of it on your skin. It is best to work with sugar on a dry day, as the humidity will melt the sugar. To be on the safe side, make your sugar decoration no more than one to two hours before you are ready to serve them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 786,&quot;Remoulade Deviled Eggs with Pickled Shrimp 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 cup white wine vinegar<br> 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1/2 Spanish onion, chopped<br> 1 tablespoon pickling spice<br> 2 dried chiles de arbol or 1/4 teaspoon red cl flakes<br> 12 large (21/24 count) shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails off<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s Red Hot 6 hard-cooked eggs, halved 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard<br> 2 cornichons, finely diced<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill<br> 1 tablespoon finely sliced chives Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Parsley leaves, for garnish<br> Smoked paprika, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the pickled shrimp: Combine the lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, onions, pickling spice, chiles and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan.

Arrange an oven rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon five-spice powder. Set aside to cool. Stuff the cavity of the turkey with the thyme, bay leaves, mandarins, onion and ginger. Brush the turkey all over with the cooled butter mixture. Pour 2 cups of the chicken broth into the pan. Roast the turkey until it reaches 145 to 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer inserted in the deepest part between the leg and breast, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. While the turkey is roasting, make the glaze: In a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the ketchup, jam, pineapple juice, cider vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, five spice and salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer, cooking until thick and syrupy, 3 to 5 minutes. You should have about 1 cup glaze. Remove half of the glaze and set aside for serving. Once the turkey reaches 145 to 150 degrees F, add the remaining 1 cup chicken broth into the roasting pan. Then brush the turkey all over with the remaining half of the glaze. Return to the oven and continue to roast (tenting with foil towards the end if it is getting too brown), brushing the turkey with the remaining glaze halfway through, until the turkey is deeply glazed and reads 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 30 to 45 minutes more. Remove the turkey to a cutting board to rest for 30 minutes. Season with flaky salt. Pour the pan juices into a large measuring cup and skim the fat from the top. Stir the defatted juices into the reserved half of the glaze to make a sauce; keep warm. To carve, cut down through the breasts, along the breastbone, to remove. Slice both breasts crosswise into thick slices. Cut through the skin attaching each leg and pull slightly to open up the space, then follow the natural curve of the leg to remove the leg/thigh in one piece. Cut at the joint to separate the leg from the thigh. Remove the thigh bones and cut the thighs into 2 or 3 pieces each. Cut off the wings. Serve the drumsticks and wings whole on a platter with the sliced meat, decorating the platter with the mandarins, cilantro and scallions. Serve the sauce on the side for drizzling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 789,&quot;Giant Cinnamon Roll Snowman Nonstick cooking spray Two 17.5-ounce tubes refrigerated large cinnamon rolls, such as Pillsbury Grands! Two 16-ounce containers cream cheese or vanilla frosting Black icing gel, such as Wilton Sparkle Gel Green or red icing gel, such as Wilton Sparkle Gel 1 orange candy, such as a gum drop or an M&amp;M Instructions: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Lightly spray 2 rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray. Remove the cinnamon rolls from the tubes and place on a large cutting board or a clean work surface; reserve the icing from the tubes for serving. Unravel 3 rolls and coil them around 1 intact roll to create a very large cinnamon roll. This will be the base of the snowman. Place on the bottom half of one of the prepared baking sheets, with a short side of the sheet facing you. Unravel 2 more cinnamon rolls and coil them around 1 intact roll. This will be the body. Place it on the baking sheet, adjoining the base of the snowman. Gently squeeze so they just adhere. Unravel 1 more cinnamon roll and coil it around 1 intact roll. This will be the head of the snowman. Place it on the baking sheet, adjoining the top of the body. Bake until golden brown, puffed up and cooked through, 24 to 28 minutes. Meanwhile, unravel the remaining cinnamon roll into a strip of dough. Cut crosswise into 5 equal pieces. Coil 3 of the pieces each to create 3 mini cinnamon rolls. These will be the buttons. Roll out each of the remaining 2 pieces to about 3 inches long. These will be the snowman arms. Transfer the buttons and snowman arms to the second prepared baking sheet. When the snowman finishes baking, let it cool slightly on the baking sheet on a wire rack. Bake the second baking sheet until the buttons are cooked through and puffed up, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool completely. Once the snowman is cool enough to touch, transfer to a large cutting board or platter. Using a butter knife of small offset spatula, evenly spread 1 container of frosting all over the snowman, frosting the crevices and even the sides of the rolls, if you like. This will act as the crumb coat. Reserve 1/4 cup of the second container of frosting and spread the remaining all over the snowman, creating large swirls. Decorate the base and body of the snowman with the cooled cinnamon roll buttons. Spread 2 tablespoons of the reserved frosting all over each snowman arm and adhere the arms to the snowman body. Use the black gel icing to pipe eyes and a smiling mouth. Use the green gel icing to pipe a scarf. Add the orange candy for the nose. Transfer the reserved icing to a small bowl and serve it on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 790,&quot;Pomegranate Iced Tea Juice of 2 lemons Juice of 2 limes 2 tablespoons brown sugar Sprigs of fresh mint, for muddle and garnish 8 cups sweet tea 4 cups pomegranate juice 1 cup cranberry juice Ice, for glasses Instructions: In a mixing bowl, crush or muddle the lemon and lime juices with the brown sugar, blending the juices and sugar together.

On a lightly floured surface roll the dough to a 12-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. Line the pie plate, being sure to press the dough into the bottom and up the sides without stretching. Chill 30 minutes. Roughly chop the apples into small pieces, about the size of lima beans. (The apples should measure about 9 cups chopped.) Combine with the sugar, tapioca, cinnamon, salt and lemon juice in a large bowl. Set aside until the juices begin to run, about 10 - 15 minutes. Beat together the cream and egg to make a glaze and brush over the edges and bottom of the crust. Mound the apple filling in the pie shell. It will be quite full. Roll out the remaining dough to a large round about 1/8&#39;&#39; thick. Place over the filling a seal the edges together by gently pressing together. Trim any excess dough with scissors and flute the edges. Brush the top with the remaining egg glaze. Using a paring knife, cut out and remove a circle the size of a quarter from the center of the top crust. Cut 5 or 6 slits in a spoke pattern beginning 1/2-inch from the center hole and ending 1/2-inch from the outside edge. Chill for 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place the pie plate on a cookie sheet and bake 10 - 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees and continue baking until the juice visible in the center becomes thick and bubbly, about 1 hour (if the edges are browning too quickly, cover with aluminum foil). Meanwhile prepare the caramel topping. Spoon the hot caramel over the top of the pie to coat and return to the oven. Bake 5 minutes longer, or until the caramel sets. Cool on a rack before serving. In a small saucepan combine brown sugar, butter and cream. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the pecan halves. In a large bowl combine the flour with the lard, butter and salt. Mix lightly with your fingertips until the dough forms grape-sized pieces. You should be able to see chunks of fat. Stir in the iced water. Lightly knead, handling the dough as little as possible, until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more iced water if necessary. Transfer to a plastic bag and shape into a log. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, and chill for as little as 1 hour or as long as 3 days. The pie dough can be frozen for as long as a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 797,&quot;Wolf Hash-Home Fries with Pastrami, Corned Beef, and Salami Tidbits 1 1/2 pounds baking potatoes, like russets, skinned, cubed and par-boiled 1 large Spanish onion, cut into chunks 1/4 cup canola oil 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 pound mixed scraps of pastrami, corned beef, salami, franks, etc., cut into 1/2-inch pieces Instructions: In a large saute pan, heat the oil.

On a large piece of parchment paper, trace a circle 10 inches in diameter. Use this parchment paper to line a baking sheet, pencil side down (you should still be able to see the circle). In a large saucepan, bring the water, butter, salt, and granulated sugar to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, 30 seconds to evaporate some of the moisture. Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer). Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running and, working 1 egg at a time, add 3 of the eggs, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add 1 more egg and mix until incorporated. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip and using the pencil line as a guide, pipe the dough onto baking sheet in a ring. Pipe a second ring around the first one, hugging it so the 2 rings touch closely all the way around. Pipe a third circle, using up all the remaining dough, on the crack between the first 2 rings so that all 3 rings touch closely, forming 1 big ring with 3 parts. Whisk the remaining egg with the water. Brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash (do not use all of it). Sprinkle the almonds over the surface. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 25 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. The recipe can be made up to this point up to 24 hours in advance. Hold at room temperature, lightly covered with aluminum foil. Custard: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Let cool slightly. Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. The custard can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Refrigerate until 1 hour before using. Whipped Cream: When ready to serve, whip the cream and brown sugar until stiff. Using a long serrated knife, cut the pastry ring in half horizontally. Set the top half aside. Using a clean pastry bag, pipe the custard filling onto the bottom half. Pipe the whipped cream on top of the custard. Place the top half of the pastry lightly on the whipped cream, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar, and serve, cut into sections. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 801,&quot;Grilled Lamb Chops with Pink Peppercorn Sauce 1/4 cup canola oil 2 tablespoons yellow mustard 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for serving 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, plus more for serving 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 pounds double-cut lamb rib chops, frenched if desired Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped sweet onion 1/4 cup brandy 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon pink peppercorns, coarsely crushed Kosher salt Instructions: Make the marinade for the lamb chops: Combine the oil, mustard, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, rosemary and garlic in a medium bowl. Place the lamb chops in a baking dish or large resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the meat, turning to coat. Cover or seal. Marinate the lamb chops for at least 1 hour at room temperature or up to 8 hours in the refrigerator. Place a grill pan over medium heat until hot. Remove the lamb chops from the marinade. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part (avoiding bone) registers 135 degrees F for medium-rare, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Remove the lamb chops from the grill and let rest 15 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, make the pink peppercorn sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until it begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Slowly pour in the brandy. (If using a gas cooktop, to avoid flare-ups from the alcohol, remove the pan from the heat before adding the brandy.) Cook until the alcohol cooks off, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits. Slowly whisk in the heavy cream and peppercorns. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the sauce reduces by half, about 5 minutes. Season with salt. To serve, arrange the lamb chops on a platter. Garnish with parsley and rosemary and serve with the pink peppercorn sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 802,&quot;Quick Apple and Sweet Potato Soup 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 stalks celery, chopped 1/2 cup chopped Vidalia onion 8 sprigs fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cloves garlic, smashed 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon allspice 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks 4 Granny Smith apples, cored, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks 4 cups vegetable stock 1 1/2 cups apple cider Instructions: In a large pot over medium heat add the butter and olive oil.

Transfer the mixture to a large resealable plastic bag and add the pork chops, massaging the paste into the chops to coat. Marinate at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the apples and leeks and season with salt and pepper. Add 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks are tender, about 15 minutes. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Remove 3 pork chops from the marinade and cook until lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove the pork chops to a plate and cook the remaining 3 chops. Place each pork chop on a plate and spoon the apple-leek mixture (including any juices) on top. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 807,&quot;Sausage and Cheese-Stuffed Kabocha 1/4 pound dried porcini mushrooms 1 kabocha squash<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 medium-size cheese pumpkin, around 10 pounds<br> 1 baguette<br> 1 1/2 pounds sweet Italian sausage, out of the casing<br> 1 large white onion, diced<br> 3 cloves of garlic, sliced<br> 1 pound button mushrooms, sliced<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 2 cups milk<br> 2 cups heavy cream<br> 1 pound Gruyere, shredded<br> Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Pour 2 cups of boiling water over the dried porcini and let sit while you prep your other steps, 10 to 15 minutes. Peel, de-seed and medium dice the kabocha squash. Pour onto a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Roast in the oven for about 30 minutes to cook through. In the meantime, use a small serrated paring knife to remove the top of the pumpkin wide enough to later fill the pumpkin stuffing and scoop out the seeds. Dice the baguette and place in the oven on a sheet pan to make croutons, about 5 minutes. In a large skillet over medium heat cook the Italian sausage breaking it up into little pieces and cook it all the way through. Remove it from the pan leaving the grease. Now add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. While the onions are cooking, take the porcinis that are re-hydrating in the hot water, wring them out and give them a rough chop. Remove the cooked onions and put in a large bowl with the Italian sausage. In the same skillet, add the sliced white mushrooms, chopped porcinis along with 1/2 cup of the mushroom liquid and cook for about 5 minutes. Remove and add to the large bowl with the sausage mixture. Add the cooked kabocha and croutons to the sausage bowl. Mix well and add the ginger, paprika, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Add the milk and heavy cream to a saucepan and bring it to a simmer. To assemble: Sprinkle the inside of the pumpkin with salt and pepper. Add a layer of the sausage mixture, some of the heated milk-cream mixture, add a layer of Gruyere and continue by pressing down repeating the layering process until the pumpkin is completely full. Place the top of the pumpkin back on, put it in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish and fill with 1- to 2-inches of warmed water. Bake until it&#39;s cooked through, about 1 1/2 hours Serve by scraping the inside of the pumpkin and getting some of the pumpkin flesh along with the filling to serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 808,&quot;Hoppin&#39; John 3 tablespoons finely chopped green onion 3 cups steamed white rice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 large ham hock 1 cup onion, chopped 1/2 cup celery, chopped 1/2 cup green pepper, chopped 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 pound black-eyed peas, soaked overnight and rinsed 1 quart chicken stock Bay leaf 1 teaspoon dry thyme leaves Salt, black pepper, and cayenne Instructions: Heat oil in a large soup pot, add the ham hock and sear on all sides for 4 minutes.

Transfer to a small plastic storage container with a lid and freeze until ready to use. (Pack the frozen butter in your cooler, it will help cool your food.) Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, about 1 minute. Add the breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until golden and toasted, about 4 minutes. Can be made a day ahead, pack in a small plastic re-sealable bag.<br> (Make sure to pack all of the other ingredients and equipment.) Build a medium-high campfire that has a grate for cooking.<br> When ready to cook, combine the tomatoes, clams and 1 1/2 cups water in a large saucepan, on the grate, directly over the fire and bring to a boil. Add the pasta to the boiling sauce and stir to coat. Bring back to a boil for 30 seconds then remove from the heat and cover with a lid, let sit for 3 minutes.

Line a sheet pan with parchment or buttered waxed paper. Unroll the puff pastry on a work surface. Brush the pastry generously with melted butter. In a small bowl, toss together the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over the pastry. Working lengthwise, cut the pastry in half and then cut each half into 6 even strips, each 3/4-inch wide. Twist the strips to make long twisted \straws. Transfer to the prepared pan, pushing the ends down with your thumb to help them stay in place on the pan and remain twisted. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes. To make the sauce, heat the milk in a saucepan. Pour the hot milk over the chocolate and whisk to melt it. Whisk in the peanut butter until smooth. Keep sauce warm until ready to serve. To serve, place the twists on a tray and serve with the sauce along side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 811,&quot;My Grandma&#39;s Ravioli 1 pound baking potatoes (about 2 large), scrubbed thoroughly 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, plus 8 tablespoons (1 stick) 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1 teaspoon minced garlic 8 ounces farmer&#39;s cheese 5 ounces goat cheese 2 ounces mascarpone 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, plus 1/4 cup freshly grated 2 tablespoons minced fresh mint leaves 2 tablespoons minced fresh chervil leaves 1 egg, lightly beaten Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper Basic Pasta Dough, recipe follows Semolina or all-purpose flour, for dusting 1 egg lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash 1 tablespoon olive oil Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 1/4 cup toasted and chopped hazelnuts 3 cups flour 8 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 3 to 5 tablespoons water Semolina or all-purpose flour, for dusting Instructions: Make the filling: Bake the potatoes in a preheated 350 degree F. oven until fork tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. Peel, and while still warm, pass through a food mill. In a small saute pan, heat the 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook until soft. In a medium bowl, combine the farmer&#39;s cheese, goat cheese, mascarpone, 3 tablespoons Parmesan, the herbs, and the beaten egg. Add the cooked shallots and garlic and the warm potato. Stir until blended (being careful not to overmix, or the mixture will get pasty). Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Then, with lightly moistened hands, roll into 1/2-ounce balls, about the size of golf balls. Cut the pasta dough into 4 portions and work with 1 portion at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with plastic wrap. Lightly dust the work surface with flour. With a pasta machine or a rolling pin, roll out the dough about 20 inches long and 4 inches wide. Brush the dough with egg wash and arrange 9 to 10 balls of filling on the lower third of the length of the dough, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart. Fold the top half over to cover the balls. Press the dough around each ball to seal, making sure that you do not have any air pockets. With a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut the ravioli. Dust a tray with flour and arrange the ravioli on the tray, dusting with more flour. Repeat with the remaining dough, egg wash, and filling. Refrigerate, covered, until needed. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, over high heat, add the oil and the remaining butter. Cook the butter until it begins to brown. Drain the ravioli and toss into the browned butter, turning to coat both sides. Add the remaining Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and hazelnuts and serve immediately. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of the water. Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine and pinch the dough to test it. If it&#39;s too dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball. Turn out on a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, until a smooth ball is formed. Loosely wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the other pieces covered in plastic while you roll out 1 piece at a time, by hand with a rolling pin or through the rollers of a pasta machine, stretching the dough to the desired thickness. If using a pasta machine, set the rollers at the widest opening. Flatten the first piece of dough into a thick strip no wider than the machine, to enable it to pass through the rollers. If necessary, dust the pasta very lightly with flour. Run the pasta through the machine. Fold in thirds, crosswise, and run through the machine again. Repeat this procedure 2 or more times, until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic. Set the machine to the next smaller opening and run the dough through the rollers. Continue rolling and stretching the dough, using the smaller opening each time, until the next to the last or the last opening is reached, dusting lightly with flour only as necessary. (The strip of dough will be long. If you don&#39;t have enough space on your worktable, halfway through the rolling process cut the strip of dough in half and continue to work with each piece separately, keeping the unused dough covered). Adjust the cutting mechanism to the desired width, cut the noodles, and allow them to dry before cooking. A convenient way to dry pasta is to arrange the cut pasta on a pastry tray sprinkled with flour, preferably semolina flour. As 1 layer is completed, sprinkle flour over the noodles, place a piece of parchment paper over them, and continue layering with noodles and flour. Dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 812,&quot;Bonfire Eggs with Green Peppers and Cheese 4 medium russet potatoes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 large eggs<br> About 2 tablespoons heavy cream<br> Hot sauce, optional<br> 1/4 red onion, diced<br> 1/2 green bell pepper, diced<br> 2 ounces shredded cheese<br> Instructions: Start a fire! Poke the potatoes all over with a fork and microwave them for 12 minutes or bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Let the potatoes cool until they&#39;re cool enough to handle or wrap the bottoms in aluminum foil or use heat-safe gloves for the next step. Working with one potato at a time, chop off the end (keep this part, it is the potato&#39;s hat) and then use a small spoon to hollow out the potato, leaving about 1/3 inch of potato flesh all around. (Reserve the potato innards for another use, like potato soup or mashed potatoes, or feed them to your chickies.) Salt the insides of the potatoes, then crack an egg into the center of each potato. Add 1/2 tablespoon cream, a good pinch of salt, a turn of pepper, hot sauce, if using, and a quarter of the onion and pepper to the center of each potato. Give it a quick scramble (I like using a chopstick for this). Top each with a little pile of cheese. Place the potatoes&#39; hats back on them, then wrap each tightly in aluminum foil. Carefully put the potatoes in the fire. Cook, turning occasionally with long tongs or a stick, for 20 minutes, then unwrap and check for doneness; the egg should be cooked and fluffy. If the egg is still runny, rewrap the potato and put it back in the fire for a few more minutes. Let cool slightly and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 813,&quot;Quick Italian Salad 1/2 cup olive oil 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan (pre-grated in a pack from the store)<br> 1/4 cup minced fresh parsley<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 tablespoon vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 1 clove garlic, pressed<br> Juice of 1 lemon<br> 1 head romaine lettuce, roughly chopped 1/2 head iceberg lettuce, chunked<br> 6 whole pepperoncini 1/2 cup whole black olives 1/2 cup whole red cherry tomatoes 1/2 small red onion, very thinly sliced into circles<br> 1/3 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: For the dressing: In a blender, add the olive oil, mayonnaise, Parmesan, parsley, sugar, vinegar, black pepper, salt, red pepper flakes, garlic and lemon juice and blend until pureed.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the sugar, corn syrup and milk, and whisk continuously until a candy thermometer registers 100 degrees F, which will happen rather quickly. Remove the saucepan from the heat.<br> With an electric mixer on low speed, combine the bread flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, salt and cloves. Slowly pour the butter-sugar mixture in, and beat until thoroughly combined, 2 minutes. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan, cover with plastic wrap and press with your hands to spread the batter to the sides of the pan. Refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat several baking sheets with cooking spray, or line them with parchment paper. Cut the chilled dough into 4 equal pieces. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out 1 piece of dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch; dust with more flour as needed. (Keep the other dough pieces refrigerated until you&#39;re ready to use them.) Using 2 different-sized biscuit or cookie cutters, cut out concentric circles of dough, leaving a 1/2-inch-wide ring. The cookies shown are about 2 inches across, but you can make them larger or smaller based on the size of your cookie cutters. Place the rings about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the other pieces of dough.<br> Bake the cookies until slightly browner on the edges and firm to the touch, 10 to 12 minutes for smaller cookies, 15 minutes for larger.

Some fish grill better than others, if you&#39;re unsure, ask your butcher. Excellent selections are salmon, bass, halibut, mahimahi, yellowtail, and lingcod. Heat the grill on high. Combine the butter and olive oil in a bowl and set aside. Combine the pineapple, jalapeno, and honey. Brush a mix of melted butter and olive oil onto the fillet or fish steak before placing it in the grill. This will cause the flames to rise up, searing in the juices. Brush more of this mixture on the top as it&#39;s cooking. Do not overcook, most fish grill quickly. You must adjust the cooking time based on the thickness of the fish being cooked. Flip the fillets or steaks and reapply another brushing of the butter/oil mixture. Once seared, reduce the flame to low and close the lid on the barbecue. Wait a few minutes (until fish is nearly done) and pour the pineapple mixture or Jazz Honey-Jalapeno Pineapple Sauce over the top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is cooked. Garnish platter with green leaf lettuce, carefully place fish on the bed of lettuce, and serve. This is a simple and amazingly eye attractive dish.

In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites until frothy. Add the cream of tarter and continue to whisk until soft peaks form. Once the whites are at soft peaks, slowly add in the granulated sugar and continue whisking until stiff peaks form and the egg whites are smooth and glossy. Place a nonstick baking pad on an upside-down baking sheet and then spray with nonstick cooking spray. Scoop the meringue into a square shape using a 3-inch square stencil. Smooth out the edges and make the squares even with a long, flat icing spatula. Make as many squares that can fit onto the baking sheet. You&#39;ll need 6 sides to make a full box, so make sides based on how many boxes you want to make. Remove the stencil. Bake the meringue until set and not tacky to the touch, 3 hours. The meringue should have no color on it after baking. For the diplomat cream: In a saucepan, bring the milk to a light simmer. In a bowl, lightly whisk the squash puree, 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar, the cornstarch, flour, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and yolks until smooth. Add half of the steaming milk into squash mixture very slowly, whisking as you pour. Whisk in the remaining milk. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the cubed butter and vanilla, mixing until the butter melts. Cover the mixture with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Cool the pastry cream completely. Once the pastry cream is completely cool, place the heavy cream and the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk, and whip until stiff. Fold the whipped cream into the cooled pastry cream to create the diplomat cream. Keep refrigerated. Use royal icing as the glue between the sides of the box, leaving one side open. When the box is set, spoon the diplomat cream into the box and top with the final side as the lid.

Reduce the heat to keep it at a medium boil and cook, stirring frequently, until the milk is reduced by half, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the saffron strands with 1 tablespoon of the hot milk in a small bowl. Mash with the back of the spoon to get the saffron to release its color and turn the milk a deep orange.<br> Once the milk has reduced, add the sugar, crushed cardamom and saffron-milk mixture and mix well. Cook, stirring as needed so the milk does not stick to the bottom of the pan, until the milk is well flavored, about 5 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons of the nuts, saving the balance for garnish, and let the milk mixture cool.<br> For the paneer balls (rasgullas): Heat the milk over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed pot, stirring every minute or so in the beginning and more often as it comes closer to a boil to ensure that the milk doesn&#39;t burn at the bottom, until it comes to a boil, about 10 minutes.<br> As soon as it reaches a boil, turn off the heat and add 1/2 cup of ice to reduce the temperature of the milk. Add the lemon or lime juice 1 tablespoon at a time until the milk is curdled and the solids separate from the whey. The whey will turn greenish-yellow. Add another 1/2 cup of ice. This stops the cooking and keeps the paneer soft.<br> Line a strainer with folded-over cheesecloth or muslin and set over a large bowl. Pour the mixture into the strainer and let the water drain out. Pour a cup of cold water over the paneer and drain. Take the ends of the cloth and squeeze out the excess water very well. Hang the cloth to further drain out water from the paneer for about 30 minutes. The paneer should be crumbly yet a little moist.<br> Add the paneer to a food processer and process until the crumbles become a ball, about 30 seconds. Alternatively, you can knead it with the heel of your palm, but this will take 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Roll the dough into 12 equal balls, making sure there are no cracks. (A kitchen scale isn\u2019t necessary but is helpful.) You can keep them round or gently flatten them out to disks about 1 inch high. If you see any cracks, smooth them over with wet fingers. Cover with a damp cloth.<br> For the sugar syrup: Combine the sugar and 7 cups water in a wide Dutch oven and bring to a rolling boil. Add the prepared paneer balls one by one so the temperature doesn\u2019t drop suddenly. Gently shake the pot, lower the heat slightly to keep the mixture at a low boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Do not open the lid in between. Gently stir the balls, cover and cook for another 5 minutes. The balls should almost double in size. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool naturally, 20 to 30 minutes. The balls will sink in the water.<br> Once cooled, drain the balls. Very gently squeeze out the syrup from the balls and transfer them to the prepared ras (saffron milk). Refrigerate for a minimum of 3 hours, to let the balls absorb the milk and become divine!

Add the coconut oil in small spoonfuls, and pulse until the largest pieces are pea-sized. Add 4 tablespoons ice water, and pulse until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together; it should just hold its shape. If the mixture is too powdery, pulse in an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water. Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, pat into a 1/2-inch-thick disc and chill for at least 1 hour up to overnight. To make rolling easier, let the dough soften up a bit-it should be slightly soft when pressed-at room temperature (this may take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen). Roll the disc into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface or between two pieces of floured parchment paper. If the dough gets too warm, refrigerate it to firm it up. Ease the crust into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself, and crimp the edge as desired. Chill for 30 minutes. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line the chilled pie crust with a large coffee filter or foil, and fill with pie weights. Bake until the edges are lightly golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the coffee filter or foil and weights, and continue baking until the crust is lightly golden all over, 15 to 20 minutes more. Transfer to a rack, and let cool completely.

Allow the pot pie to cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 866,&quot;Smoked Salmon Pizza (a la Wolfgang) 1 cup kosher salt 1/4 cup light brown sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns 1 whole side salmon, pin bones removed 2 cups warm water (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F) 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one 1/4-ounce envelope) 5 to 5 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, preferably organic 2 teaspoons fine sea salt Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing Canola oil, for brushing 3/4 cup creme fraiche 2 tablespoons finely chopped mixed fresh herbs (dill, chervil, chives, parsley), plus more whole herbs for garnish 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup capers in brine, rinsed 1 red onion, thinly sliced Instructions: For the smoked salmon: Mix the kosher salt, brown sugar, granulated sugar and peppercorns in a medium bowl. Cut a piece of extra-wide aluminum foil a little longer than the length of the salmon. Place an equally long piece of plastic wrap on top of the foil. Sprinkle one-third of the salt rub onto the plastic. Lay one side of the salmon skin-side down onto the rub. Sprinkle another third of the rub onto the flesh of the salmon. Place the second side of the salmon flesh-side down onto the first side. Use the remaining rub to cover the skin on the top piece. Fold the plastic over the salmon to cover, and then close the edges of the foil together and crimp tightly around the salmon. The salmon should be folded in half and wrapped.<br> Place the wrapped salmon on a baking sheet and top with another baking sheet. Weigh the top pan down with a brick or two. Refrigerate the salmon for 12 hours. Flip the salmon over and refrigerate for another 12 hours. Some juice will leak out during the refrigeration process, so make sure there&#39;s a place for the runoff to gather. Unwrap the salmon and rinse off the salt rub with cold water. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels and place in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator) until the surface of the salmon is dry and matte-like, 1 to 3 hours depending on humidity. A fan may be used to speed the process.<br> Preheat the smoker. Smoke the salmon over the smoldering alder wood chips until the thickest part of the salmon registers 150 degrees, about 30 minutes. Keep the temperature inside the smoker between 190 and 200 degrees F. Serve the salmon immediately, or cool to room temperature, wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to 3 days.<br> Meanwhile, for the pizza dough: Place the warm water and yeast in a large bowl. When the yeast dissolves, let the water stand about 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups of the flour and the fine salt until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups of the flour and continue adding flour (up to 1/2 cup) 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes away from the bowl but is still sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead with lightly floured hands. Slap the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself using a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape dough from surface. Repeat the process until the dough is easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes.<br> Lightly oil a bowl with olive oil. Shape the dough into 2 balls and transfer to the bowl. Turn to coat the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. The dough is done when you press it with your finger and an indent remains.<br> Gently remove the dough from the bowl. Roll each dough half into a ball and place on a lightly-floured baking sheet. Brush the dough balls lightly with olive oil. Cover the baking sheet lightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes.<br> Prepare charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash). Add to the grill, creating a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, and leaving the other half with no coals.<br> Stretch and shape each piece of dough into a 10-inch-round on a flat surface. Brush the tops of each round with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the rounds on the grilling stones and cook until the bottoms are lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush the tops of the rounds with oil, flip and cook until the bottoms are lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> For the assembly: Whisk the creme fraiche, chopped herbs, zest together and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the creme fraiche mixture on top of each cooked dough round. Flake some of the smoked salmon and place on top of the creme fraiche mixture. Top with the capers and onions. Garnish with whole herbs. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 867,&quot;Rosemary Grilled Chicken Thighs and Wild Mushroom Sauce 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Coarse salt and black pepper 3 stems fresh rosemary, leaves stripped and chopped 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock 1-ounce dried porcini mushrooms 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/8 pound, 4 slices, pancetta, chopped, available at your deli counter or 3 slices bacon, chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 large shallot, chopped 2 portobello mushroom caps, halved and thinly sliced Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1 cup dry red wine Instructions: Heat a grill pan over high heat.

Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain out the solids. If a chunky gravy is desired, chop the gizzards and return them to the simmered stock in the saucepan. Keep warm. In a straight-sided saute pan, add the hot oil and flour and cook over medium-high to high heat until the mixture is light brown in color (for a dark gravy, cook the flour to a deeper brown color). Add 2 cups of the warm stock, whisking constantly, and cook until the gravy thickens and bubbles. Add more warm stock if a thinner consistency is desired. Reduce the heat to low and add salt and pepper to taste (this will depend on how salty the stock is). Add a squeeze of lemon juice and taste again for seasoning. Keep warm until ready to serve, adding more warm stock as needed. Just before serving, remove from the heat and swirl in the butter until melted. Pour into a gravy boat and serve. Let the turkey come to room temperature, then pat it dry thoroughly and season it generously with salt and pepper inside and out. Fill a countertop indoor turkey fryer with the indicated amount of oil according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions (see Cook&#39;s Note) and heat to 400 degrees F. Carefully lower the turkey into the fryer and cook for 35 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh should register approximately 165 degrees F.

Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch pie pan. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly and trim the excess around the rim. Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the filling: melt the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, remove from heat and let cool. Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl until frothy and then blend in the sugar. Stir in the syrup, vanilla, bourbon, salt, and the melted butter mixture until well blended. Arrange the pecans on the bottom of the pie crust and carefully pour the egg mixture over them. Bake until the filling is set and slightly puffed, about 45 minutes. Test for doneness by sticking a thin knife in the center of the pie, if it comes out pretty clean, you&#39;re good to go. Transfer the pie to rack and cool completely before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Merlot]</p><p>&quot; 876,&quot;20-Minute Shrimp and Grits with Peas and Butter Sauce 3/4 cup instant grits Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1 1/4 pounds large peeled, deveined shrimp 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 cup dry white wine 6 ounces frozen peas (about 1 1/2 cups) 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved 4 scallions, sliced Instructions: Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a medium covered saucepan over high heat. Uncover and slowly whisk in the grits, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes.

In a bowl, mix flour and salt. Pour in water and mix with a spoon until the dough comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 5 minutes. Remove dough from bowl and knead for about 5 minutes moistening your hands and the board with water as you work. (Kneading in the additional moisture is an important step in making a tender arepa.) The dough should be smooth and not crack around the edges; it should be moist but not sticky. Form into disks about 3-inches around and 1/2-inch thick. (The disks can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap at this point and cooked later.) Add the oil to a non-stick pan over medium heat and cook arepas on each side just until a crust forms. Do not let brown. Place on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the arepas make a hollow sound when tapped. Open a slit in 1 side of the arepa to make a pocket (or slice in half).

Drain and allow to stand until cool enough to handle. Scrape skin from potato with paring knife. Press them through a potato ricer. Spread the riced potatoes into a thin, even layer on the work surface and allow to cool completely. In a small bowl, beat together the egg, salt, pepper and nutmeg. gather cold potatoes into a mound and form a well in the center. Pour egg mixture into the potato well. Knead the potato and egg mixture together with both hands, gradually adding the grated cheese and enough of the flour, about 1 1/2 cups, to form a smooth but slightly sticky dough. It should take no longer than 3 minutes to work the flour into the potato mixture; remember, the longer the dough is kneaded, the more flour it will require, and the heavier it will become. As you knead, repeatedly rub dough from hands and scrape it from the work surface back into the dough. On a flour-dusted surface, dust dough and cut it into 6 equal pieces. Form dough into a rope. Slice rope into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle rounds with flour and roll them into balls. Hold the tines of a fork at a 45-degree angle to the table with the concave part facing up. Dip the tip of your thumb in flour. Take one ball of dough and with the tip of your thumb, press the dough lightly against the tines of the fork as you roll it downward toward the tip of the tines. As the dough wraps around the tip of your thumb, it will form into a dumpling. Set on a baking sheet lined with a floured kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining dough. At this point, gnocchi must be cooked immediately or frozen. To cook gnocchi, drop into salted boiling water.

On a lightly floured flat surface, roll out the dough and separate it into 4 rectangular parts, leaving 2 triangles attached for each of the 4 sections. Each section should appear to be a rectangle with a perforated dividing line through its center diagonally. Carefully pinch together the 2 triangles along this line to close the gaps and seal it to make it 1 piece. Cut each piece in half to make 2 squares. Repeat for each and place on a nonstick baking sheet with sides. There should be 8 squares to fill. Combine the candy bars and bacon in a medium bowl. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of the candy mixture in a row along the length of the prepared dough in the center, leaving enough room to pull the uncovered dough on the edges up and over the pile of filling. For the topping: In a small bowl, mix the sour cream and just enough water to make it loose like glue, yes glue. Brush this over the top of each roll and sprinkle with sugar and a pinch of flake salt. Bake until golden on top, 16 to 20 minutes.

F) 2 cups bread flour 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading 2 teaspoons sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl One 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1 grated small garlic clove 1 teaspoon olive oil 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano Pinch of sugar, salt and pepper Instructions: Make the dough. Transfer one 1-pound ball of dough to a 9-inch round cake pan coated with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cover and let the dough rise again until almost spread to the edges of the pan, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 500? F (use the convection setting, if available) with a pizza stone, baking steel or inverted large baking sheet in the lower third of the oven.<br> Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a paper towel\u2013lined plate with a slotted spoon and let drain and cool. Press the dough to reach the edge of the pan, then press the dough up the sides to create a lip 1/2 to 3/4 inch higher than the center of the dough. Top with the Parmesan and sliced mozzarella, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Spread the pizza sauce over the cheese, almost to the edge, and top with the sausage, olives and the shredded mozzarella. Place the pan on the hot stone and bake the pizza until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then loosen the edges with a small offset spatula and remove the pizza to a cutting board. Sprinkle with Parmesan and parsley.<br> Sprinkle the yeast over the hot water in a small bowl. Let stand until dissolved and slightly foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the bread flour, all-purpose flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the yeast mixture into the well and add the olive oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, dust the dough with flour and knead, dusting with more flour as needed, until very smooth and elastic but still slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough into two 1-pound balls. (If making sheet-pan pizza, let the dough rise, covered, on an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet coated with 3 tablespoons olive oil instead of in a bowl; do not divide into two balls.) If not using the dough right away, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature before using. Combine crushed tomatoes, garlic clove, olive oil, dried oregano and a pinch each of sugar, salt and pepper in a medium bowl; season with more salt and sugar if needed.

To save on time, bring a large amount (enough to cover the squash) of water to a boil. Gently lower in the spaghetti squash and cook for about 30 minutes or until a fork goes easily into the flesh. Remove from the water and let it cool. Or you can bake the squash. To do so, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Set the squash on a baking sheet and prick it with a pot fork or slender long knife so the skin doesn&#39;t burst. Bake anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, depending upon its size. Let cool a bit. Either way you cook the squash, split it down the middle and remove the seeds. With a fork rub the squash flesh until it separates into spaghettilike strands. To serve it simply, reheat it in olive oil or butter, season with salt and pepper and fold in grated cheese or serve it more as a main course with more ample toppings.

Spread the meringue on the prepared baking sheet, making sure to stay within the drawn 9-inch circle. Create some shallow dips and swoops (this will hold the whipped cream and berries). Bake until the meringue is dry and crisp on the outside, about 2 hours. Turn off the heat and let the pavlova sit in the warm oven to dry out more, about 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. (The meringue can be made up to several hours in advance.) Meanwhile, make the whipped cream by whisking together the heavy cream and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Toss the berries and raspberry jam in a medium bowl until evenly coated and glossy. Cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. To serve, dollop the whipped cream on top of the meringue and spread into an even layer. Pile the macerated berries on top (drizzle any berry juice on top as well). Slice into wedges and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 929,&quot;Mushroom and Cheese Omelet 2 to 3 large eggs Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 tablespoons warm Sauteed Mushrooms, recipe follows 2 tablespoons diced triple or double creme cheese, such as St. Andre, Brillat-Savarin or Fromager d&#39;Affinois Pinch of chopped fresh thyme or other herb, optional 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 pound mushrooms (any assortment), sliced 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste Instructions: Crack the eggs into a small bowl, and use a fork to beat them with the salt and pepper.<br> Heat an 8-inch omelet pan or shallow skillet (preferably nonstick) over medium-high heat. Add the butter, let it melt and swirl the pan so it coats the bottom evenly. Pour the eggs into the pan and quickly shake and swirl so the eggs completely cover the bottom. Let the eggs firm up on the bottom, about 30 seconds, then use a rubber spatula to lift the edges of the omelet up so any uncooked egg on the top runs underneath.<br> Sprinkle half of the eggs with the sauteed mushrooms and cheese and let it cook for another 30 seconds; the top should be moist but not quite runny (unless you like it runny). Flip the uncooked side of the eggs over the filling, and slide it onto a plate. Garnish with fresh herbs, if desired. Heat a very large skillet over medium high heat. Add the oil, then the mushrooms and garlic, season with salt and pepper and saute until the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms have turned nicely browned, about 10 minutes.

In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate, then add the butter and sugar until just melted. Add eggs and whisk until well combined; add flour and mix only until combined. Do not overmix or the cake will be rubbery. Lightly grease four 4-ounce disposable aluminum cups, muffin molds, or ramekins with vegetable baking spray. Distribute batter among the four molds. Place molds on a sheet pan and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake. For the Chocolate Sauce: Pour the milk into a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. When it boils, remove the milk from the heat and make a ganache by adding the chopped chocolate. Whisk well, stirring into the edge of the saucepan to combine. The ganache should be homogenous and smooth. Set the ganache aside. In a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the heavy cream, butter, and sugar. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. The butter should be completely melted and the sugar completely dissolved. Once the mixture has come to a boil, pour it into the warm ganache. Place the sauce over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a whisk. As the chocolate sauce cooks, it will begin to thicken slightly. When it reaches a boil, remove it from the heat, and pour it into a clean, dry bowl. Cover by placing plastic wrap directly on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Let the chocolate sauce cool to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator. When cold, the sauce will become thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. Invert molds onto individual serving plates. If you would like to decorate the plate, do so with fresh raspberries or fruit or chocolate sauce, and serve immediately. The sauce can be reheated whenever needed. If using a microwave, simply place the chocolate sauce in a microwaveable bowl and heat it at medium-high power in 30-second intervals until it becomes liquid. On the stovetop, place in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and stir occasionally until it becomes liquid. If you store it in a squeeze bottle, you can easily drizzle it over a dessert or decorate a plate. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to three weeks.

Combine the paprika, black peppercorns, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, garlic powder, onion powder, nutmeg and cayenne in a spice grinder. Process until a fine powder is formed, approximately 30 seconds. Pat the ribs dry and turn bone-side up. Trim excess fat and, if one end of the ribs is especially narrow, trim meat and bone to ensure even cooking. Remove the membrane on the underside of the ribs by inserting a rounded utensil, an upside-down spoon works well, between the membrane and the meat at one end of the slab. Carefully work the spoon under the membrane to loosen but not tear. Once enough has been loosened, use a paper towel to hold onto the membrane as you slowly pull it down the slab to remove. Sprinkle the ribs on both sides with the salt and brush both sides with the mustard. Sprinkle two-thirds of the spice mixture on the meat side of the ribs and the remaining third on the bone side. Once the smoker has reached 225 degrees F, add the wood chips or chunks and the ribs to the smoker. Smoke for 4 to 5 hours then test for doneness. There are four criteria that should be met in order for ribs to be done. First, the internal temperature of the meat should be 185 to 190 degrees F. Second, pick up each slab from the center with tongs and it should droop into a u-shape and crack slightly. Third, while holding with the tongs, and bouncing gently, the surface of the ribs should crack slightly. Lastly, the meat should pull easily off the bone but not fall off. If ribs pass all tests, remove them from the smoker and wrap in heavy-duty foil and rest for 15 minutes. If not, continue smoking for 45 minutes to 1 hour and test again until done. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 955,&quot;Skillet Cornbread 1 cup yellow cornmeal 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup milk 1 whole egg 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Now, with a sharp knife, make a horizontal cut through 1 half (you&#39;ll be cutting parallel with the board) from one long side to within 1/4- inch of the other. This will allow you to fold open the meat like a book, utilizing that 1/4-inch uncut side as a hinge. Using a meat pounder or heavy mallet, pound the pork to between 1/4 to 1/8-inch thickness. In a food processor or blender, thoroughly puree the chipotles and all the canning sauce. With a pastry or basting brush, liberally paint the meat on both sides with the pureed chipotles. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 24 hours). Repeat with the other tenderloin pieces. (There will be considerably more chipotle puree than you need; cover and refrigerate the leftover for up to 2 weeks and use it to marinate other meat, fish, poultry or vegetables.) Soaking the sun-dried tomatoes: In a small saucepan bring the orange juice just to a boil. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, stir well, cover and remove from the heat. Let stand, stirring once or twice, until softened, about 20 minutes. Salsa: Scrape the soaked tomatoes and the juice into a food processor or blender, and measure in 1 tablespoon of chipotle puree. Pulse the processor until the tomatoes are rather finely chopped (not pureed). Scrape into a small serving bowl. Rinse the chopped onion under cold water, shake off the excess liquid and add it to the salsa along with the olives, cilantro and the lime juice. Stir everything together, then taste and season with salt, usually about 1/4 teaspoon. Adjust the consistency to that of an easily spoonable salsa with additional juice or water if needed. Set aside at room temperature while you cook the meat. Searing the meat: Set a large (12-inch) heavy well-seasoned or non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Add the lard, oil or bacon drippings, brushing or spreading it around to evenly coat the surface. (If using a non-stick surface, oil the meat instead of the pan.) When the oil is very hot (it&#39;ll just begin to smoke), lay on one of the marinated meat pieces in a single layer. Sear on one side until beginning to brown (2 to 3 minutes), flip it over, and sear the other side about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet in a single layer and keep warm in the oven. Sear the remaining meat and add to the baking sheet. Chop or slice the meat into smallish pieces and scoop into a warm serving bowl. Set on the table along with the salsa and warm tortillas, and your meal is ready. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 973,&quot;Rainbow Deviled Eggs 12 large eggs 1/3 cup mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon dill pickle brine<br> 2 teaspoons yellow mustard<br> 1/2 teaspoon sugar<br> Dash of hot sauce, such as Tabasco<br> Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon paprika Finely diced red bell pepper, for garnish<br> 3 baby carrots, plus shredded carrots, for garnish Pinch of saffron<br> 1/4 small avocado 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley and/or cilantro, plus more for garnish<br> Squeeze of lime juice<br> Coarsely crushed blue potato or tortilla chips, for garnish 1 very small cooked beet Instructions: For yellow/classic deviled eggs: Put the eggs in a large saucepan in one layer with cold water to cover by 1 inch.

For the Quail and Stuffing: Spread the brioche cubes on a baking sheet and bake until dry but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until crispy, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, garlic, onion, sage and apricots and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and cool slightly. Add the brioche cubes to the vegetables and toss. Add the egg, salt, pepper, and enough of the chicken broth to moisten the bread, and toss. Season the quail inside and out with salt and pepper. Stuff each quail loosely with the brioche mixture and tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Put the remaining stuffing into a lightly buttered casserole dish. (The recipe may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.) Bake the stuffing until browned on top, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the remaining olive oil in an ovenproof medium skillet over high heat. Add half the quail and cook, turning as each side gets a rich mahogany brown, about 8 minutes in all. Transfer to a low roasting pan or casserole dish just large enough to hold the quail. Repeat with the remaining quail, adding more olive oil if necessary. Reserve the skillet and drippings. Transfer the quail to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the cavity reads 160 degrees, about 20 minutes. For the Sauce: Add the shallots to the reserved drippings in the skillet over medium heat and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the red wine and simmer until reduced by about half, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits. Add the demi-glace or chicken stock, the apricots and currants. Simmer until fruit is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Transfer the quail to a plate and tent loosely with foil. Whisk the butter into the sauce a bit at a time until the sauce is glossy and coats the back of a spoon. (If necessary, gently reheat the sauce before whisking in the butter off the heat.) To serve, spoon some of the stuffing into the centers of 4 dinner plates. Set 2 quail on top, spoon some sauce over, and ring with some of the Wilted Greens. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and chard stems and cook, stirring occasionally, until brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the chard leaves and cook, tossing, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 979,&quot;Coleslaw with Cumin-Lime Vinaigrette 1/3 cup fresh lime juice 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 2 cloves garlic, chopped Few dashes Bobby Flay&#39;s Hot Sauce, or your favorite 1/2 cup olive oil 3 carrots, peeled and shredded 1 medium head green cabbage, shredded 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 red onion, thinly sliced 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro Salt and pepper Instructions: Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, toss with the dressing and season with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 980,&quot;Ganache Filling (for cake) 4 1/4 cups (35 ounces, 1000 grams) heavy cream 7 cups (42 ounces, 1200 grams) bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1/2 cup (4 ounces, 120 grams) Grand Marnier or Stoli Instructions: Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Make sure you chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous. If the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools, it will thicken and set. When the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste, use an offset spatula to cover the cake layer with the ganache. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 981,&quot;Autumn Layered Salad with Sweet Potato and Wheat Berries 1/2 cup pecan halves 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon honey Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 1/2 cup wheat berries, rinsed well 1/2 small head red cabbage, thinly sliced (about 4 cups) 8 ounces aged Cheddar, cut into small chunks 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, roughly chopped 6 pickled sweet piquante peppers, such as Peppadews, finely chopped 5 ounces deli-sliced honey-baked ham, cut into bite-size pieces 2 1/2 ounces baby kale (about 4 cups) 2 cups apple chips, slightly crushed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Rub the turkey breast with 2 teaspoons of the oil; sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet and roast until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 160 degrees F, about 55 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest 15 minutes; the turkey will continue to cook and the internal temperature should reach 165 degrees F. Place the bacon lardons on a baking sheet and bake until crisp, about 20 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate; drain and reserve the fat for another use. Lower the oven temperature to 250 degrees F. Coat the tomatoes with the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes cut-sides up on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake until they start to dehydrate and wrinkle, about 45 minutes. While the tomatoes are cooking, start the Mornay sauce. Add the butter to a medium saucepan and melt over medium heat. Add the milk to a small saucepan and heat over medim heat. When the butter is melted, add the flour and stir continuously so the roux doesn&#39;t scorch, about 2 minutes. When the milk starts to simmer, slowly add it to the roux, stirring continuously so lumps don&#39;t form. Increase the heat and bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the Cheddar and red peppers and stir until smooth. Remove the sauce from the heat and season with salt and pepper. You are now ready to assemble the dish. Heat the broiler. Distribute the bread cubes evenly among four 6-inch round cast-iron gratin pans. Cut the turkey into bite-size pieces, about 1/2 inch each, and divide evenly among the gratin pans. Spoon the Mornay sauce over the pans, and top each with 10 tomato halves. Sprinkle each pan with the Parmesan and bacon and place under the broiler on the bottom rack of the oven until golden and bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 1012,&quot;Apple Cinnamon Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Whipped Cream Butter or cooking spray, for ramekins 3 cups bite-sized cubes challah bread<br> 1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1/4-inch dice 1/2 cup raisins<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1/2 cup half-and-half<br> 1/4 cup brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled 2 teaspoons Calvados<br> 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> Pinch allspice<br> Pinch freshly grated nutmeg<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 cup heavy cream, cold 1 vanilla bean, split, seeds scraped and reserved<br> Instructions: For the bread pudding: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. and place a rack in the center of the oven. Lightly grease four 6-ounce heatproof ramekins with butter. Place the ramekins into a baking dish that is large enough to hold them without touching. Place the bread cubes, apples and raisins in the ramekins, dividing the ingredients evenly. Using a whisk, beat the eggs, half-and-half, brown sugar, butter, Calvados, vanilla, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of kosher salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Carefully pour the custard over the bread cubes, pressing the bread cubes down so they are covered with the custard. Set aside to allow the bread to absorb the custard, about 15 minutes. Prepare a water bath: Carefully pour enough hot water into the baking dish so that the water is halfway up the sides of the ramekins. (A water bath is used to provide temperature protection for the egg custard.) Bake until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Another way to judge whether the puddings are fully baked is to gently press down on the center of each. If any uncooked custard comes up to the top, the pudding needs to be baked a little longer. Remove the bread puddings from the water bath and cool slightly. The puddings can be served warm or slightly chilled. Meanwhile, make the vanilla bean whipped cream: Put the heavy cream and vanilla bean seeds in a large bowl. Whisk until soft peaks form. Serve immediately with the puddings or refrigerate until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 1013,&quot;Country Ham and Redeye Gravy 2 1/4 inch thick slices cured country ham 1/2 cup brewed coffee Instructions: Slowly fry ham slices on both sides, in a cast iron skillet until lightly browned on each side.

Take the pan immediately off the heat and whisk in the salt and half of the cream; the mixture will bubble up very quickly. Add the other half of the cream once it has stopped bubbling so vigorously. Once all the cream is added and it has stopped bubbling, whisk in the butter. Place the pan over medium-low heat and cook, whisking, until the mixture has thickened slightly, another 2 minutes. Pour the hot caramel into an ice cube tray and place in the freezer for 3 hours or overnight. You should be able to make between 8 and 10 caramels roughly 1/2 inch in size, depending on your ice cube tray. The salted caramel cubes can also be kept in the freezer for 2 weeks for later use. For the chocolate cake: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C/390 degrees F. In a medium bowl, beat the egg and sugar with a hand whisk until the mixture appears light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl and place over a double boiler, stirring occasionally, until completely melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the bowl of chocolate from the heat and slowly pour over the egg mixture. Whisk until combined. Sift in the flour and stir the mixture together gently with a spatula until all of the flour is incorporated. Using some spare soft butter, grease the inside of 2 chocolate fondant molds (roughly 3 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep). Place the cocoa powder into the bottom of one mold. Rotate the mold, tipping the excess cocoa powder around the edges until the mold is completely coated. Tip the excess cocoa powder into the second mold and repeat the process. Tip out any remaining cocoa powder from the mold once finished. Using a tablespoon, fill the molds up two-thirds of the way with the chocolate mixture. Remove 2 caramel cubes from the freezer and push a cube into the center of each cake, making sure the caramel is covered by the chocolate batter. Bake until the tops have formed a slight crust and the cakes start to pull away from the sides of the molds, about 11 minutes. Immediately remove the cakes from the oven. Place a serving plate on top of each mold and flip it over, releasing the cakes.

Arrange the baguette slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Mix the oil, garlic, oregano and fennel seeds in a small bowl. Brush the oil mixture over the top of the baguette slices. Sprinkle lightly with pepper. Bake the baguette slices until lightly toasted but still slightly soft, 12 to 15 minutes.<br> For the fondue: Mix together the beer and mustard in a small bowl. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the sausage, onions, fennel seeds, salt and pepper. Break the sausage into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon and cook until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour. Add the beer mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Gradually add the Cheddar, fontina and Parmesan, stirring constantly, until the cheese is melted and smooth. Keep warm over low heat. If the fondue becomes too thick, gradually stir in extra beer, 1 tablespoon at a time.<br> Serve the fondue with the crostini. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 1042,&quot;Instant Pot Sausage Lasagna 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed<br> 2 cups ricotta<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> Kosher salt 8 oven-ready lasagna noodles<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan<br> 3 cups marinara sauce<br> 6 ounces shredded mozzarella<br> 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan<br> Instructions: Set a 6-quart Instant Pot? to Saute. Add the olive oil and wait until it gets hot. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up clumps with a wooden spoon, until brown, about 5 minutes. Remove sausage with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl. Add a splash of water and scrape up the brown bits, then discard. Wipe down the inside of the pot. Stir together the ricotta, egg, oregano, nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Break the noodles into approximate thirds (it&#39;s okay if little shards break off too). Spray a 7-inch round cake pan with nonstick spray. Spread a little bit of sauce in the bottom of the pan, then top it with a layer of broken lasagna noodles so that they slightly overlap and cover most of the pan. Top with a third of the ricotta mixture and about a third of the mozzarella, then a sprinkle of Parmesan. Sprinkle a third of the sausage over the cheeses, then drizzle with 1 cup marinara sauce. Repeat 2 more times: noodles, ricotta, mozz, Parm, sausage, marinara. Top with one last layer of noodles, a thin layer of the remaining marinara, making sure not to cover completely with sauce, and then the remaining mozzarella. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. Create a sling for your pan by folding a 24-inch sheet of foil lengthwise twice place under the pan. Place the trivet in the bottom of the Instant Pot? and add 1 cup water. Set the lasagna on the trivet, then cover the pot. Set the pot to Pressure Cook on high and set for 30 minutes. Manually release the valve when it is done. Preheat the broiler. Carefully remove the lasagna from the pot, and place on a sheet pan. Broil the lasagna in until bubbling and browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Let stand for 20 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 1043,&quot;Icebox Cake with Slice and Bake Peanut Butter Sandies 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon fine salt 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup smooth peanut butter 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 12 peanuts, halved 3 cups heavy cream 1/3 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 5 tablespoons milk 1/4 cup confectioners&#39;&#39; sugar 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter Instructions: For the Icebox Cake: Whisk together all-purpose flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Reserve. Combine the butter, peanut butter and light brown sugar in another medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the flour mixture and blend until just combined. Shape the dough into a log: Place it onto a piece of plastic wrap about 18 inches long. Use your hands to pat the dough into a log about 7 inches long and 2 inches around. Roll the plastic wrap around the dough. Twist both ends of the wrap, like a candy, and tighten both sides until the dough log is compact and tightly wrapped (this might cause the dough to shrink down to a 6-inch log instead of a 7-inch log, but that is okay). Tuck the twisted ends under the dough and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. When ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and arrange 2 racks in the middle of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the plastic wrap from the dough and use a serrated knife to slice the dough into 1/8-inch thick rounds. Place the rounds about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets, about 12 cookies per baking sheet. Press a halved peanut in to the center of each cookie. If the dough is still very cold, it might crack slightly around the peanut. Simply use your finger to lightly push the dough back together. Bake the cookies until the edges are very lightly browned, 10-12 minutes. Halfway through cooking, rotate the baking sheets front to back and top to bottom. Cool the cookies slightly on the baking sheets for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely. Place the heavy cream and confectioner&#39;s sugar in to a large mixing bowl and use a hand mixer to whip until stiff peaks. Line a 1.5 quart loaf pan with plastic wrap. The plastic wrap should come up the sides of the loaf pan and have at least a 2-inch over-hang. On the bottom of the loaf pan, lay 5 cookies face-side-down in a single layer. The cookies should touch but not over-lap. Spread 1 cup of whipped cream evenly over the cookies. Continue this layering process 3 more times. Place the last 4 cookies on the whipped cream and top the cookies with any of the remaining whipped cream. Fold the plastic wrap over the top of the loaf pan so that the entire top layer is covered. Refrigerate overnight. For the Peanut Butter Glaze: Right before serving, whisk together the milk, confectioner&#39;s sugar, and peanut butter until smooth in a mixing bowl. To serve, flip the icebox cake out on to a platter and remove the plastic wrap. Drizzle the glaze all over the top of the icebox cake. Reserve extra peanut butter glaze to drizzle over individual slices. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 1044,&quot;Fava Bean Pesto 1 cup fava beans, cleaned 1 teaspoon lemon juice 2 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon mint 6 leaves basil 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 cup Parmesan 8 slices round Greek bread 4 ounces manouri, shaved Instructions: In a blender, puree all ingredients, except the Parmesan, bread, and manouri, until all ingredients are smooth.

Spread the pesto on the toast and top with manouri. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 1045,&quot;Spinach and Goat Cheese Tartlets 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese Vegetable oil, for brushing 1 large shallot, minced 1 clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/4 cup milk Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 1/2 ounces mild goat cheese, softened 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 2 large eggs, separated 1 10-ounce box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry Chopped chives, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Melt 1 tablespoon butter. Place 1 phyllo sheet on a clean surface (cover the other sheets with a damp towel), brush with melted butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon parmesan. Cover with another phyllo sheet, brush with more butter and sprinkle with another teaspoon parmesan. Top with the remaining phyllo sheet and brush with butter. Cut the phyllo stack into 24 squares, about 3 inches each. Brush a 24-cup mini muffin tin with oil, then firmly press a phyllo square, buttered-side down, into each cup. Bake until golden, 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic and cook until translucent. Stir in the flour, then add the milk and stir until the mixture is smooth, 1 minute. Add the nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Stir in the goat cheese, lemon zest and vinegar until the cheese melts. Remove from the heat and mix in the egg yolks, then the spinach. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold into the spinach filling. Spoon about 1 tablespoon filling into each phyllo cup and top with the remaining parmesan. Bake until the filling is set, 15 minutes. Cool slightly in the pan; remove and top with the chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 1046,&quot;Bittersweet Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Sauce and Toasted Almond Cream 1/2 cup sugar plus 1 1/2 tablespoons 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped 3 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped 9 tablespoons (1 stick plus 1 tablespoon) butter, cubed 3 large eggs, at room temperature 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate 1/2 cup heavy cream Cocoa powder, for garnish Chocolate curls, for garnish 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup toasted almonds 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: To make the cake, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, combine the 1/2 cup of sugar with 1/3 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring, over high heat. Meanwhile, combine the chocolates and the butter in a medium bowl. When the sugar mixture boils, pour it over the chocolates and stir until blended. Set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine the 11/2 tablespoons sugar and the eggs. Using a mixer set at high speed, whip the eggs and sugar until the mixture falls back onto itself in a slowly dissolving ribbon-like pattern when the beater is lifted. Add 1/3 of the egg mixture to the chocolate mixture and fold in with a spatula to lighten. Fold in the remaining egg mixture. Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Spray 6 (6-ounce) ramekins or 6 (2 by 3-inch) loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray and place them in a roasting pan just large enough to hold them. Divide the batter among the ramekins, place the roasting pan in the oven, and add enough water to the pan to come three-quarters of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the middle of the cakes comes out with just a few crumbs sticking to it, about 30 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. In a small saucepan, combine the chocolate and cream and heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is melted. Cool for at least 30 minutes. Bring cream and almonds to a boil and store refrigerated for 24 hours. Strain, add vanilla and whip. PLATING: Dust plates with cocoa. Invert the ramekins onto the plates and add a scoop of the almond cream to each. Drizzle the chocolate over the cake and cream, sprinkle with chocolate curls, if using, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 1047,&quot;Black and White Italian Cocktail 1 large coffee ice cube (See Cook&#39;s Note) 1 ounce coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua<br> 1 ounce vodka<br> 1/2 ounce amaretto<br> 1 ounce half-and-half, chilled<br> Dash of cinnamon, optional<br> Instructions: Place the coffee ice cube in a rocks glass.

Serve sprinkled with green coriander. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 1050,&quot;Berry Shortcake Pudding Pie 3 large egg yolks 3 cups whole milk 5 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 prepared 9-inch graham cracker crust 1 cup frozen blueberries, thawed (about 7 ounces) 16 small shortbread cookies, crumbled (about 1 cup crumbled) 3/4 cup strawberry jam 2/3 cup sugar Instructions: Make the pudding: Put the eggs yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk together the milk, sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan, and bring to a low simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly to prevent sticking on the bottom. Once it begins to simmer, whisk until the mixture is just thicker than heavy cream, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, pour about 1 cup of the milk mixture into the egg yolks and whisk to combine. Pour this milk-egg mixture back into the milk mixture in the saucepan. Return the saucepan to medium heat, and whisk until the mixture is very thick, 3 to 4 minutes. (When you drag the whisk through the thickened pudding, the streaks should hold firm for a few seconds.) Whisk the butter and vanilla into the pudding, and transfer it to a large bowl to cool. Set the bowl in some ice water, and whisk frequently to help the pudding cool faster. Build the pie: Spread 1/2 the cooled pudding into an even layer over the pie crust. Scatter the blueberries over the pudding, then the cookies. Finish with an even layer of the remaining pudding. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Stir the jam with a splash of water in a small bowl to loosen and smooth out. Spread the mixture over the pudding and refrigerate again until the pudding is completely set, about 2 hours.

Cover pot and bring to a boil, then uncover and let simmer until fully cooked, 55 to 60 minutes. Peel potatoes while they are still hot, then mash them. Mound the flour on a cutting board, then hollow out its center so that the flour mound is shaped like a doughnut. Add the mashed potatoes, salt and egg in the middle of the flour. Mix all of the ingredients together. Once the ingredients are mixed together, remove a lemon-sized portion and make a ball of dough. Using both hands, roll the ball of dough back and forth on the cutting board, drawing the dough out into a snake 10 to 11 inches long, approximately the circumference of your finger. Cut into small pieces, about 1/2-inch in length. Using your thumb, gently press each piece across the top of the tines of a fork, creating a beautiful and authentic gnocchi from the old world. Place on a sheet tray dusted with flour to prevent them from sticking together. Continue in the same manner until all the dough is made into gnocchi. Meanwhile, boil a pot of water. Once the water boils, add a pinch of salt to it and add the gnocchi. When the gnocchi is fully cooked, it will rise to the surface and float. Remove the cooked gnocchi and strain using a colander. For the sauce: Place the Italian peeled tomatoes in a blender and puree. Transfer the pureed tomatoes to a saute pan and add the cream and salt. Cook over medium heat for approximately 10 minutes. Stir in the pesto quickly, then remove the pan from the heat, as pesto does not like to be cooked. Add the cooked gnocchi to the completed sauce.

Place cooked asparagus around the platter and then place pimentos in the center. Serve with tostones (recipe follows). Peel plantains and cut at an angle. Place in cold water with salt. In a large frying pan put in 1/2 cup oil (preferably peanut oil ). Place plantains in pan and cook until somewhat soft (they will turn a lovely pale yellow color). Take them out of the pan and smash each one between 2 pieces of foil (folded 2 or 3 times to make a thick pad - place 2 paper towels on top of foil so that you don&#39;t burn yourself). Return to frying pan (you may have to add more oil). Fry until crisp and then season with salt. Serve with rice and chicken - or just about anything! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 1059,&quot;Clear Soup with Shrimp 12 medium-sized raw shrimp Salt Cornstarch, kuza starch or arrowroot 1 small piece dried wakame seaweed 4 sprigs mitsuba (tresfoil) or scallion 12 small dried shiitake mushrooms, presoaked in water 2 1/2 cups dashi (recipe follows) 2 teaspoons dark miso 1/2 teapoon light soy sauce, or slightly larger amount of dark soy sauce Instructions: For garnishes, shell the shrimp, leaving the tail attached, and devein. Wash, pat dry, salt lightly, and lightly dredge in cornstarch (or kuzu starch or arrowroot). Parboil in unsalted water for 2 minutes. Soften the dried wakame seaweed in cold water for 20 minutes. Cut out hard parts and discard, then cut into 1-inch (2 1/2-cm.) lengths. (Professional chefs might treat wakame in a slightly different way to bring out its bright green color and to insure tenderness: swish it in boiling water for 30 seconds then plunge it into a cold bath before leaving it to soak.) Wash and pat dry the mitsuba sprigs. In a medium-sized soup pot, bring the dashi to a simmer over medium heat. Never boil. Add the miso gradually, dissolve it little by little. Gradually add the soy sauce. Stir and taste. The higher the quality of the dashi, the less soy sauce required. Warm individual covered lacquer soup bowls by filling with hot water and letting them stand for 1 or 2 minutes. (In lieu of lacquer bowls, use small or medium-sized deep soup bowls or cups on saucers.) Dispose of hot water and wipe bowls dry. Attractively arrange 3 shrimp, 3 shiitake mushrooms, and a small amount of seaweed in each bowl. Ladle in the seasoned stock carefully so that it does not splash and mark the side of the bowl or disturb the arrangement. Fill bowls 3/4 full no more. Add a sprig of mitsuba to each bowl. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 1060,&quot;Cheese Soup 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 5 ounces small diced onion (approximately 1 cup) 5 ounces small diced carrot (approximately 1 cup) 5 ounces small diced celery (approximately 1 cup) 1/2 teaspoon salt for sweating vegetables, plus more if needed at end of cooking 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 quart chicken broth, heated to a simmer 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 bay leaf 1 cup heavy cream 10 ounces Fontina, shredded 1 teaspoon Marsala wine 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce 1/2 teaspoon white pepper Instructions: Melt butter in large heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and salt. Sweat for 5 to 10 minutes or until the vegetables begin to soften, stirring occasionally. Sift the flour over the vegetables and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually add the chicken stock and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and add the garlic and bay leaf. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until vegetables are soft. Remove bay leaf. Turn off the heat, add the heavy cream, and then puree with an immersion blender or in a conventional blender*. Gradually add the cheese, 1 small handful at a time, and stir until melted before adding next handful. Stir in the Marsala, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and white pepper. Taste and add additional salt if desired. If soup is not hot enough, return to a low heat until warmed through. <em>When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1061,&quot;Slow-Cooker Beef Curry 2 1/2 pounds cubed beef stew meat 1 pound small red-skinned potatoes, quartered 2 tablespoons Madras curry powder 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cumin 2 tablespoons finely chopped peeled ginger 2 large cloves garlic, grated Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 5 slices naan bread 2 15-ounce cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes 1 1/4 cups fresh cilantro 1/4 cup sliced pickled jalapeno peppers, plus 1 tablespoon brine from the jar Instructions: Toss the beef and potatoes with the curry powder, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 tablespoon ginger, the garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a 6-quart slow cooker.

Shuck the oysters. Discard the top shell. Strain oysters and oyster liquor (see Cook&#39;s Note*) through fine sieve into a ceramic or glass bowl. Cover in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator. Scrub the bottoms shells of the oysters under running water and arrange them on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool. Turn oven to broil. Drain 2/3 of the liquid from the oysters for the sauce and set aside. Make a 1-inch bed of salt in a large pan. Evenly space the cleaned oyster shells on the salt bed with the outside edge of the shell facing down. Place 1 oyster on each shell. Place 1 drop of truffle oil on each oyster (truffle oil is potent so use sparingly). Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the froth over each oyster. Place the pan under the broiler until the froth turns golden brown, about 1 minute. Serve immediately. In a small bowl lightly froth the egg yolks with the hand held blender. In a heavy bottomed saucepan bring the oyster liquor and cream just to the boil. Reduce the heat to low. Pour 1/3 of the mixture into the 2 egg yolks and froth with the hand held blender. Slowly add the frothed egg mixture to the saucepan. Immediately begin frothing the mixture in the saucepan over low heat. Pour froth over truffle laced oysters on the half shell. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1064,&quot;Fried Turkey Breasts with Cranberry Mayo 1/2 cup (76 grams), plus 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 cup (100 grams) loosely packed light brown sugar<br> 1 cup of water (240 grams)<br> 4 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 4 sprigs fresh sage<br> 2 dried bay leaves<br> 2 teaspoons black peppercorns<br> 1 lemon, peel removed with a vegetable peeler, and juiced<br> 6 cups cold buttermilk<br> 3 (453 to 566 grams) skin-on, boneless turkey breasts (about 1 to 1 1/4 pound each)<br> 3 cups (360 grams) all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup (64 grams) cornstarch<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1 tablespoon sweet paprika<br> 2 teaspoons poultry seasoning<br> Cranberry Mayo, recipe follows Ground sumac, for garnish<br> Flaky salt, for garnish<br> Lemon zest, for garnish<br> 3/4 cup (168 grams) mayonnaise 1/4 cup (70 grams) whole berry canned cranberry sauce<br> 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: In a large Dutch oven, add 1/2 cup salt, brown sugar, water, thyme, sage, bay leaves, peppercorns and lemon peel. Bring to a simmer just to dissolve the sugar and salt. Turn off the heat. Stir in the cold buttermilk and lemon juice. Add the turkey breasts. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 1 hour before you\u2019re ready to cook and allow to come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour enough neutral oil into a large Dutch oven to fill 1/3 of the way up the sides of the pot. Heat over medium heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, paprika, 1 tablespoon salt and poultry seasoning in a large bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup of the buttermilk brine a little at a time to make small clumps. When the oil is at 350 degrees F, remove the turkey breasts from the brine and dredge well in the flour mixture. Carefully add to the oil. (The oil temperature will drop initially, you want it to settle at about 330 degrees, so adjust the heat accordingly.) Cook, turning occasionally, until the coating is crisp and deeply browned and the internal temperature of the turkey is about 160 degrees F, 15 to 18 minutes depending on the size. (If you have larger size turkey breasts and they are brown before they are cooked through, you can finish for a few minutes in the oven at 350 degrees F .) Remove the fried turkey to a cooling rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Let the turkey cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. While still hot, sprinkle with the sumac, flaky salt and lemon zest. Keep warm in the oven until ready to serve. To serve, slice the turkey into thick slices against the grain. Serve with the cranberry mayo on the side. In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, cranberry sauce, lemon juice and a healthy grinding of black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1065,&quot;Chili Omelet 1/2 pound breakfast sausage links 1 (15-ounce) can vegetarian chili with beans 1 (8-ounce) package 3-cheese Mexican shredded cheese 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 large eggs 1/4 cup chopped chives Sour cream, for garnish Instructions: Cut the sausage into 1/4-inch chunks. In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, brown the sausages. When brown, add the chili and heat through, about 5 minutes. For an extra-cheesy omelet, stir in a handful or 2 of the cheese. While this is cooking, heat an 8-inch skillet over medium-low heat and melt the butter. Beat the eggs with half the chives and pour into the pan. Cook until the egg forms a solid yellow circle. Cover half of the omelet with the sausage and chili mixture, reserving 1/4 cup. Add a layer of cheese, reserving 1/4 cup. Fold the omelet and top with the remaining chili and cheese. Slide the omelet onto a plate and garnish with a large dollop of sour cream and the remaining chives. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Malbec, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]&quot; 1066,&quot;Cheese-Stuffed Lamb Burgers 1 cup white vinegar 1/4 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon pickling spice<br> 1 red onion, thinly sliced into rings<br> 1 cup plain yogurt, strained 1/2 cup grated cucumber<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh mint<br> 2 teaspoons lemon juice<br> Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb 1/4 cup grated onion<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh mint<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley<br> 2 tablespoons olive tapenade<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 garlic clove, grated 1/4 cup crumbled feta 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella 4 onion rolls, toasted<br> Butter lettuce, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the pickled onions: Combine the vinegar, sugar, salt, pickling spice and 1 cup cool water in a medium saucepot. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add onions to the pot and stir to combine. Bring back to a simmer, then turn off the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer to a resealable container and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 weeks. For the tzatziki: Combine the yogurt, cucumber, dill, mint, lemon juice and salt in a bowl and refrigerate until serving time. For the burgers: Combine the lamb, onion, mint, parsley, tapenade, salt, pepper and garlic in a large bowl, being careful not to overmix. Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions. Using a burger-sized ring mold (about 4 inches across), lay the ring mold on a baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Press 1 portion of the lamb mixture down lightly to fill the bottom of the ring mold. Add about 1 tablespoon of each cheese, then another portion of the lamb mixture. Cover with the plastic wrap, then press down firmly to fill the ring mold. Remove the plastic-wrapped burger from the ring mold, then repeat with the remaining lamb mixture and cheese to create 3 more burgers. Cover the patties in plastic wrap and refrigerate for about an hour. Heat a grill or grill pan to high heat and cook the burgers, flipping only once, until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Spread some tzatziki sauce on the bottoms of the toasted rolls and stack with patties. Top each with pickled red onions, some lettuce, more tzatziki sauce and the tops of the rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 1067,&quot;Cajun T-Bone Steak 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons paprika<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> One 1- to 1 1/2-inch-thick T-bone steak (1 to 1 1/2 pounds) Vegetable oil, for the grill<br> Instructions: Combine the garlic powder, paprika, salt, black pepper and cayenne in a small bowl. Place the steak on a rack set over a baking sheet. Sprinkle the spice mixture evenly on both sides of the steak (use all of the spice mixture). Let the steak sit on the rack at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat a grill to medium-high. Lightly brush with the oil. Place the steak on the grill, then cook until dark marks form on the underside and the steak releases easily from the grill, about 6 minutes. Flip the steak and continue cooking until a thermometer inserted in the center (avoiding bone) registers 125 degrees F for medium-rare, 5 to 7 more minutes. Remove to a cutting board and let the steak rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 1068,&quot;Wasabi Edamame-Avocado Dip 1 tablespoon wasabi powder 2 tablespoons water 1/2 pound frozen shelled edamame (green soy beans), (about 1 1/2 cups) 1 ripe Hass avocado 1 tablespoon finely grated peeled fresh ginger Juice of 1 lime, (about 3 tablespoons) 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 4 scallions (white and green parts), finely chopped 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Whisk the wasabi and the water in a small bowl to make a thick liquid; cover and set aside.

Rub the chicken with the mixture. Lift the skin on top of the chicken, place the butter between the flesh and skin so it self-bastes as it cooks. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Stuff the chicken cavity chopped oranges. Place the chicken, breast side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F and continue roasting until chicken is cooked (general rule of thumb for cooking chicken is 15 minutes per pound to cook and 10 minutes to rest). Continue to baste with pan drippings through the cooking process. When cooked the juices should run clear and the internal temperature should be 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove chicken from the oven and place on a serving platter.

Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Slice the potatoes on the thinnest setting of a mandoline (they should be almost see-through). Lay the slices on a clean kitchen towel in a single layer and pat dry with paper towels. One at a time, transfer the slices to the cold oil (starting with cold oil keeps the potatoes from sticking to one another). If the potatoes are not completely submerged, add more oil to cover. Add the garlic and rosemary to the pot. Turn the heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed, 5 minutes. Stir the potatoes once to make sure they are not sticking to the bottom, then let fry, undisturbed, until golden, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove the chips with a strainer and drain on paper towels.

Fill a large mixing bowl with cold water and squeeze the juice of half a lemon into it. With a large knife, cut off the stem flush with the base of each artichoke. Pull off and discard any small or discolored leaves around the base. Remove one or two rows of leaves by bending outward and down so that the top part snaps off of the leafs fleshy base. Place the artichoke on its side on the cutting board and, with a heavy sharp knife, cut off about 1 1/2 inches from the top. With kitchen scissors, trim off the pointy ends of all the remaining leaves. Halve the artichokes lengthwise and, using a paring knife or a teaspoon, dig out and discard the fuzzy chokes. When each artichoke has been trimmed and halved, drop them into the cold water and continue trimming. In a very large nonreactive sauce pan, bring the water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon of the salt and the juice of the remaining lemon half. Drop the artichokes into the water and cook them for about 10 to 20 minutes, or until just barely tender (cooking time will depend on the size of the artichoke). Remove the artichokes and drain cut side down in a colander. In a heavy casserole, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the whole garlic cloves and saute for a few seconds, without letting it brown. Add the onion rings, carrots, serrano, bay leaves, peppercorns, oregano, nutmeg, and remaining 1/2 tablespoon salt. Saute the mixture for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the artichokes, cook for 1 minute more, and add the vinegar and the white wine. Stir together and increase the heat so that the mixture comes to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside in the pan to cool to room temperature. Discard the bay leaves. If desired, the escabeche could be refrigerated for up to 1 week, very tightly covered.

Gradually mix in the currants, sultanas, raisins, candied peel, and almonds, followed by the apple and citrus zests. In a small bowl, whisk together the rum, barley wine, and stout, and then beat in the eggs. Pour this mixture over the dried fruit and nut mixture. Mix thoroughly. It should be somewhat loose; if it needs a little more liquid, add some stout. Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight. The following day: Butter a 1-pint pudding mold and pack the pudding mixture into it. Cover with a double piece of parchment and a sheet of foil and tie securely with a string across the top to make a handle. Place the pudding mold in a covered steamer set over a saucepan of simmering water, and steam for 8 hours. Check the water level, adding boiling water as needed. When the pudding is finished, let it cool and then remove the papers and foil. Replace with fresh paper and make a new string for easier maneuvering. Set in a cool place away from light (under the bed works well). To reheat, set a saucepan with boiling water over medium heat and put a steamer on top. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, set the pudding in the steamer, cover, and let steam for 2 1/4 hours. Top up the water a bit if necessary. To serve, remove the pudding from the steamer and take off the wrapping. Slide a palette knife around the pudding, and then turn it out onto a warm plate. Garnish with a sprig of holly. To flambe the pudding, warm a ladleful of brandy over direct heat, and when it is hot, carefully light the brandy. Place the flaming ladle over the pudding, but do not pour until at the table. When you do slowly pour it over the pudding, sides and all, watch it flame! Serve with rum sauce if desired.

Season the chicken, shrimp and calamari with the mixture. Brush both sides of the meat and seafood with 3 tablespoons of the canola oil. Let marinate 1 hour refrigerated. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Season both sides of the meat and seafood generously with salt and pepper. Grill the chicken a few minutes per side to crisp the skin, then move to a cooler part of the grill to finish cooking, about 10 minutes. Remove and place on a baking sheet. Grill the shrimp 1 to 2 minutes per side, then remove to the baking sheet. Grill the calamari a few minutes per side. Slice the calamari into rings on a cutting board and transfer to the baking sheet. Grill the lemon halves cut-side down until grill-marked, 3 to 4 minutes; transfer to the baking sheet. Set aside. In a saucepan, combine the chicken stock and saffron threads. Bring to a simmer, whisking until the saffron dissolves. (This can be done on the grill as well, or on the stove inside and brought out to the grill area. The stock should be hot while you are making the paella.) Place an 18-inch paella pan (or large cast-iron skillet) over the hottest part of the grill. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil, add the onions and saute until translucent. Add the garlic and cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the chorizo and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the fat starts to render and it begins to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the rice, coating it in the chorizo fat and toasting it, about 2 minutes. Using a ladle, begin to add the stock, stirring constantly. Cook, continuing to add the stock as it absorbs, until the rice is al dente, 15 to 20 minutes. Once the stock is absorbed, stir in the peas. Now, stop stirring to allow the \soccarrat\ to form (this is the crispy bottom on the rice; it&#39;s not burnt!). Allow the bottom to crisp up for about 5 minutes. Arrange the chicken, seafood, lemon halves and peppers on top of the rice. Sprinkle the parsley and scallions over the top. Use a spoon or spatula to scrape up the crispy bottom of the rice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Tempranillo, Pinot Noir]&quot; 1089,&quot;Peanut Brittle 1 1/2 cups lightly salted, roasted peanuts 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 3 cups sugar 1 1/2 cups water Vegetable oil, for coating the saucepan Softened butter for spatula Instructions: In a small bowl combine peanuts, cinnamon, and cayenne. Set aside. Brush the inside of a medium sized heavy saucepan with vegetable oil. Add the sugar and water to the saucepan, cook over high heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until it comes to a boil. Stop stirring, cover and cook for 3 minutes. Uncover, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the sugar is a light amber color. Stir in peanuts. This will greatly reduce the temperature of the sugar so work quickly. Once evenly mixed, pour mixture onto a sheet pan lined with a silicone baking mat or buttered parchment paper. Using a buttered spatula, spread thin. You will have to work quickly when pouring out and spreading the mixture in the pan. If necessary, in order to achieve single layer of peanuts, top with second sheet pan whose underside has been buttered. Cool completely and then break into pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 1090,&quot;Candy Cane Croquembouche 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 large eggs 10 ounces white chocolate, finely chopped 2/3 cup heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract 1 16-ounce container mascarpone cheese 2 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup whole milk, plus more if needed Crushed candy canes, for topping Instructions: Make the pastry puffs: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Bring 1 cup water, the butter, granulated sugar and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and sift the flour directly into the pan; stir with a wooden spoon until a paste forms. Return to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste is shiny and pulls away from the side of the pan, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed to cool slightly, about 2 minutes. Beat in 1 egg until incorporated, then beat in 1 more egg. Whisk the third egg in a small bowl, then beat into the dough, 1 tablespoon at a time, until just smooth and tight. (You may not need all of the third egg.) Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. Pipe 1 1/4-inch rounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart; you should have about 50 puffs. (Alternatively, drop the dough in small mounds onto the baking sheets with a spoon.) Smooth the dough peaks with a dampened finger, then transfer to the oven and bake until puffed, 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking until golden, 5 more minutes. Turn off the oven but leave the puffs inside to dry out, 5 to 7 more minutes. Remove from the oven and pierce a small hole in each puff with a paring knife to let steam escape; transfer to a rack to cool completely. Make the filling: Put the white chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan, then pour it over the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth and cool, about 7 minutes; whisk in the peppermint extract. Stir in the mascarpone until combined. Cover and refrigerate until thick enough to pipe, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a large pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. Insert the tip of the pastry bag into the hole in each puff and pipe in the filling. Transfer the filled puffs to a baking sheet; refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours. Make the icing: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk in a large bowl until smooth. Assemble the croquembouche: Dip the bottom of a puff into the icing, letting the excess drip off. Transfer the puff to a platter, icing-side down. Repeat with more puffs, arranging them side-by-side in a 7-inch circle. Fill in the circle with more puffs to stabilize the base of the tower. Continue building a conical tower of puffs, using the icing to hold them in place. (If the icing becomes too thick, whisk in more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time.) Dust the croquembouche with confectioners&#39; sugar and sprinkle with crushed candy canes; chill until set, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1091,&quot;Le Wagyu Burger 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 yellow onion, cut in half, then thinly sliced (julienne style)<br> 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 32 ounces ground wagyu beef<br> 1/4 cup Dijon mustard<br> Kosher salt and ground black pepper 4 slices Gruyere 4 tablespoons butter, optional<br> 4 brioche hamburger buns<br> 4 leaves green leaf lettuce, trimmed 1 tomato, sliced<br> Desired condiments, for serving Instructions: Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until golden brown and caramelized, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the thyme and mix well. Set aside on low heat until ready to serve. Divide wagyu into 4 equal patties (see Cook&#39;s Note). Spread 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard on one side of each patty. Place the patties, mustard-side down, in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the mustard sides of the patties have cooked through and become a caramel brown color, then flip the patties over and cook until the centers of the patties have reached the ideal temperature for diners&#39; tastes, using an instant-read thermometer. (Without a thermometer, a patty that is firm to the touch in the center but not tough and has a thin line of pink through the middle is around medium-well.) Remember, you still have to melt the cheese on top, so you may want to cook a little under your normal preference at this stage, because it will continue to cook while the cheese melts. Add 1 ounce (1/8 cup) sauteed onions to the top of each wagyu patty. Add 1 slice of Gruyere on top of each serving of onions. Cover the skillet for about 30 seconds to allow the steam to melt the cheese. Butter brioche buns and lightly toast using a separate skillet, if desired. Place a patty on each brioche bun. Serve with lettuce and tomato on the side for garnish, along with desired condiments. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1092,&quot;Deviled Crab Stuffing 1 stick unsalted butter, plus more for the baking dish 1 bunch scallions, sliced (white and green parts separated) 1 small red bell pepper, chopped 4 stalks celery, chopped 2 tablespoons fresh thyme 1/4 cup dry sherry or white wine 3 cups low-sodium turkey or chicken broth Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 large eggs 16 cups 1/2-inch stale potato bread cubes (1 1/2 pounds) 1 pound lump crabmeat, picked over 1 teaspoon paprika Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and butter a shallow 3-quart baking dish. Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the scallion whites, bell pepper and celery; cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 6 minutes.

In a heavy bottomed pan, preferably a cast-iron skillet, melt the bacon fat and stir in the flour. It&#39;s important to keep stirring this until it turns a deep dark brown. Usually about 30 minutes. Also remember once it is brown to remove it from the burner and it will continue to cook as the pan is still really hot. For the gumbo: Melt the butter in a large pot. Add the celery, onions and green and red bell peppers. Let simmer for 5 minutes. Cut the hot links in 1/4-inch half-moons and add to the pot. Add the water, clam base, chili powder, thyme, oregano, garlic, paprika, cayenne, chicken base, hot sauce and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and turn down to a simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes.

Marinate the steak: Spread the jalapenos in a baking dish and press the steak on top. Cover and set aside at room temperature, about 1 hour. Preheat a grill or grill pan to high. Brush the jalapenos off the steak, pat dry and season with salt and pepper. Grill the steak for 4 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest 10 minutes, then slice. Assemble the tacos: For each taco, stack 2 tortillas and lay a few pieces of steak in the middle. Top with onion, salsa and cilantro. Top with lime wedges. Toast the chiles in a dry skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat, shaking the pan, about 2 minutes. Pour 1/2 cup boiling water on top, cover and let soak 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat a grill or grill pan to high. Grill the tomatoes, turning, until charred. Transfer to a food processor. Add the chiles and their soaking water, onion, garlic, oregano, lime juice, sugar and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt; pulse until chunky. Set aside, about 1 hour. Garnish with cilantro. Put the masa harina in a bowl and gradually stir in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water with a fork. Add 3 or 4 more tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix with your hands until the dough comes together. Knead until soft and pliable, then gather into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and set aside, 30 minutes. Roll the dough into Ping-Pong-size balls, moistening your hands with water to keep the dough from sticking. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap; keep covered with more plastic as you roll the rest of the dough. First, set a large griddle over two burners; heat one side to medium-low and the other to medium-high (or use two cast-iron skillets).<br> Cut a circle slightly larger than your tortilla press from a large resealable plastic bag; include the seam of the bag in your circle so that the two circles remain attached on one side. Place a dough ball between the plastic rounds and flatten in a tortilla press into a 5-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. (If you don&#39;t have a tortilla press, use a coffee can to flatten the dough.)<br> Peel off the top piece of plastic; flip the tortilla onto your hand and peel off the bottom piece of plastic. Ease the tortilla onto the cooler side of the griddle and cook until it is slightly dry around the edges and starts to peel away from the griddle, about 45 seconds. Transfer to the hotter side of the griddle, uncooked-side down. Cook until speckled on the bottom, about 1 minute, then flip and cook until puffed in spots, about 1 more minute. Press and cook the remaining tortillas; stack them in a cloth-lined basket and cover with the cloth, or wrap in foil and keep warm in a 250 degrees F oven. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 1121,&quot;Blood Orange Sorbetto 1 cup water 1/2 cup sugar 2 cups blood orange juice Instructions: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring water and sugar to a simmer and simmer for 2 minutes to dissolve the sugar.

Tuck the wings back and underneath the backbone until they stay in place. Season liberally with kosher salt or sea salt and lots of black pepper. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium to medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to the hot pot and brown the chicken breast-side down first, turn using a wooden spoon or closed tongs placed in cavity. Once the bird has browned on both sides, remove the chicken to a plate and add the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, rosemary, bay leaf, salt, and pepper, and cover the pan. Sweat the vegetables to make a little pan juice, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place the bird atop the vegetables and cover the pot. Transfer to the oven with the rack at the oven bottom, and roast about 1 1/2 hours, until a thermometer reads a minimum of 165 degrees F at the thickest part of the bird. About 15 to 20 minutes before the chicken comes out of the oven, place the potatoes and turnips in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, and cook to tender. Drain, and mash with milk, and ripe camembert cheese. Season the potatoes with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, to taste. Cover and turn off the heat to keep potatoes warm. Place the chicken on a carving board and cover with foil. In a large pot, bring a few inches of water to a boil for the green beans. Salt the water, and boil the beans 5 to 6 minutes for tender-crisp. Drain and dress with butter.

Submerse the pork chops in the brine and refrigerate for 3 days. After 3 days remove the chops from the brine, discarding the brine. Preheat a grill or grill pan. Roll the fat edge of each pork chop with the fennel pollen. Place porks chop gently on the preheated grill or grill pan. After 3 to 4 minutes rotate the chops 90 degrees to create lovely grill marks. Grill the chops for another 3 to 4 minutes and then turn over and repeat the process. If the chops seem to be burning move the chops to a cooler part of the grill to allow for longer cooking time without burning. Stand the chops up so the fat edge is in contact with the grill to crisp up the fat edge, this will also make the fennel pollen very aromatic. Remove the chops from the grill and let rest in a warm place before serving. The doneness of the meat should be about medium to medium well and very juicy. Serve with polenta. In a medium size saucepan, bring the milk, water and bay leaf to a boil. Season generously with salt, almost to the point of over seasoning. How do you know that you are there? TASTE IT! When it has reached a boil, slowly whisk in the polenta in small sprinkles. Once all of the polenta has been incorporated, reduce heat to medium and immediately switch over to stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook the polenta for 30 to 40 minutes, adding water if the polenta becomes too thick to loosen it up. When the polenta is thoroughly cooked, it should look creamy and not feel gritty on your tongue. Remove it from the heat and stir in the Parmigiano and mascarpone. Serve it immediately, or place a sheet of plastic wrap right on the surface of the polenta to prevent a skin from forming on the top. To reheat: Add a little water to the polenta and heat over low to medium heat stirring constantly to prevent burning. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 1128,&quot;Classic Lasagne 4 Tbsp butter 4 Tbsp flour 2 1/2 cup heated milk salt &amp; pepper to taste nutmeg to taste 3 Tbsp butter 1 cup minced onion 1/2 cup minced celery 1/4 cup minced carrots 1 cup minced smoked ham 1/2 lb each, ground beef &amp; ground pork lightly browned in olive oil 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 cups chopped canned plum tomatoes 1 cup chicken stock 2 Tbsp tomato paste 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano salt &amp; pepper to taste Instructions: First make the bechamel sauce.

The next day, drain the beans, rinse under cold running water, and drain again. Place the beans in a large pot with 8 cups of cold water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 1 hour. Stir occasionally and skim off any foam that rises to the top. The beans should be very tender and the skin will peel away when you blow on a bean. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium (10-inch) stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the pancetta and onion and saute over medium to medium-high heat for 12 to 18 minutes, until browned. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and saute for one minute. Add the tomatoes, wine, 4 cups of the chicken stock, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper and turn off the heat. Drain the beans and add two-thirds of them to the soup. Pass the remaining beans through a food mill, discarding the skins. Stir the bean puree and the pasta into the soup, bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender. Add up to 2 more cups chicken stock if the soup is too thick. Stir in the Parmesan and the vinegar. Ladle the soup into large shallow bowls and add a swirl of olive oil, a sprinkle of Parmesan, and some basil. Serve hot with extra Parmesan on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Barbera]&quot; 1140,&quot;Pulled Pork Enchilada Casserole Cooking spray 1 19-ounce can red enchilada sauce 10 corn tortillas 2 cups pulled pork 1 15-ounce can black beans or pinto beans, drained and rinsed 1 cup frozen fire-roasted corn 2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend (about 8 ounces) Sour cream, sliced scallions and chopped fresh cilantro, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400?.

In a food processor, add garlic, onion, bell pepper, and cilantro. Set a large pot over medium heat and add a 3-count of olive oil. Add the oregano and cumin. Add vegetable puree and saute until just fragrant, 7 to 10 minutes. Add beans, ham hock, jalapeno, and stock. Slightly cover and simmer for 2 hours until beans are tender. When cooked, remove bay leaves and take out ham hock. Cut ham meat off the bone, cut into pieces and set aside. Using a blender or immersion blender, puree just enough of the beans and stock (about a third of the total pot) to thicken up the soup and bring everything together. Season with salt and pepper and fold ham meat back into the soup. Make the crema by combining sour cream and zest. Serve each soup with a spoonful of lime crema, a squeeze of lime and some fresh cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1143,&quot;Hearts of Passion 2 pounds milk chocolate, tempered 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon corn syrup 1 cup fresh passion fruit juice 18 ounces milk chocolate, chopped 5 tablespoons passion fruit liqueur (reccomended: Alize) 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Using a ladle, fill the mold with milk chocolate. When it is full, empty the excess chocolate back into the bowl. The inside of the molds should be evenly coated. Wipe the lip of the mold clean and place it upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, use a wide pastry scraper to clean the edges of each cavity clean. (When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks). You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Place the cream, corn syrup and passion fruit juice in a pan and scald the mixture. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chopped chocolate and blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender. Add the passion fruit liqueur and the butter and blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender. Allow the mixture to come to 85 degrees F. Place the mixture in a piping bag and pipe it into the chocolate filled molds. Let set overnight. Apply milk chocolate the bottoms of each cavity with an offset spatula in order to seal them. Scrape clean and allow to set. When the chocolate has set, invert the mold over a clean dry surface. It may be necessary to rap the mold against the counter to encourage the chocolates to release. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 1144,&quot;Tom Yum Soup 3 1/2 cups chicken stock 4 thin slices fresh galangal 2 kaffir lime leaves 1 lemongrass stalk, smashed and sliced 2 shallots, sliced 1 tablespoon roasted chili paste 2 tablespoons fish sauce 3 tablespoons lime juice 6 cherry tomatoes, chopped 8 Thai chilies 10 fresh straw or button mushrooms 6 large whole shrimp 2 sprigs cilantro 2 spring onions, thinly sliced Instructions: Heat the stock in a saucepan and add your flavors 1 by 1: begin with the galangal, kaffir lime leaves, and lemongrass.

Work the butter pieces in with your fingers. Then add the egg yolk. Work in the white wine until a smooth dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and let rest for a few minutes while you make the filling. For the filling: Sift the powdered sugar, allspice and ginger into a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, whisk the ricotta until smooth and then add it to the dry ingredients; mix to blend. Beat the cream until fairly stiff and gently fold it into the ricotta mixture with a rubber spatula. Stir in the chocolate chips. Lightly zest the lemon and stir it into the ricotta. Refrigerate. To roll and fry the shells: Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a heavy-bottomed medium pot. Meanwhile, spread an even layer of flour on a flat surface and flour a rolling pin. Roll the dough until very thin (about 1/8-inch thick). Cut out 3- to 4-inch rounds, using a glass or a small bowl; you should have about 12 rounds. Wrap each one around a cannoli mold, pressing to enclose. Flare the edges out slightly from the mold. Use a pair of tongs to submerge the shell in the hot oil. Fry until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oil and immediately slide the shell off the mold. Set aside to cool. Repeat for all the rounds. To fill the cannoli: Just before serving, use a pastry bag to pipe the ricotta filling into the cannoli shells. Fill the shells from both sides so that the cream fills the length of the shell. Sprinkle the sesame seeds generously onto the ricotta on each end. Dust with powdered sugar.

Set a wire rack over a roasting pan and spray with the nonstick spray. Using a sharp knife, make a lengthwise, horizontal cut into the side of each chicken breast so you can open it up like a book. Place between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound out so it has an even thickness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay slices of pepperoni down the middle of each breast, slightly overlapping each piece so there are no gaps. Top with slices of mozzarella. Sprinkle each piece of chicken with 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Starting with one of the edges of the chicken (that isn&#39;t covered) roll each chicken breast over the top of the pepperoni and cheese (like a sushi roll) onto itself. Secure by inserting one skewer on each end and one in the middle so it retains its shape. Set up a breading station with 3 pans. Pour the flour into one and season with salt and pepper. Crack the eggs into a second pan and season with salt and pepper. Mix well. In the third pan, add the panko and remaining 3/4 cup Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper and mix well. Working with one chicken portion at a time, dip into the seasoned flour, then egg mixture and then panko, gently pressing the panko into the chicken all over, especially taking care to cover the seams and sides. Place the breaded chicken portions on the prepared rack seam-side down, ensuring they have space between them so they cook evenly. Spray with nonstick spray, then bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes before slicing. Prepare the sauce: Add the celery, carrots and onion to a food processer and process until finely diced. Set aside. In a large pot, add the canola oil and thinly sliced pepperoni. Cook over medium heat, gently stirring, until the pepperoni is crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on a paper towel. To the pepperoni fat in the pot, add the tomato paste, garlic and the onion-celery-carrot mixture and saute until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Slice the chicken into 1-inch-thick slices and serve with the sauce.

Put a handful of hot coals in the bottom of a smoker. Scatter the hickory chips over the top. Put a try of ice on the bottom grate. Put the cooking grate above the ice tray. Once the temperature of the smoker reaches 100 degrees F, brush the tomatoes with canola oil, season with salt and pepper and put them on the top grate. Close the smoker and smoke the tomatoes for 10 to 20 minutes, depending how smoky you want them. Coarsely chop the tomatoes, place in a bowl and add the olive oil, olives, dill, lemon juice, parsley, vinegar, honey, onions and season with salt and pepper. Let the relish sit at room temperature until ready to use. For the seafood: Prepare a charcoal grill at least 30 minutes before cooking by lighting a chimney starter filled with hard wood and let burn until covered with gray ash. Toss the shrimp and calamari with the lemon juice, olive oil and garlic and let marinate for 15 minutes. Brush the cut side of each lemon half with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Skewer the shrimp and kalamari tentacles onto different skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the shrimp for about 2 minutes per side and the calamari tentacles for about 30 seconds per side. Put the calamari bodies directly on the grill and cook for about 15 seconds per side. Grill the lemons, cut-side down, until slightly charred. Remove to a platter. Arrange the skewers and bodies on a large platter. Top with the relish. Drizzle a little more olive oil over the top and squeeze a grilled lemon half over all. Garnish the platter with the remaining grilled lemons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 1160,&quot;The Ultimate Crab Cakes with Remoulade 2 pounds russet potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 cup whole milk 2 garlic cloves, smashed 1/4 bunch fresh thyme sprigs 2 bay leaves 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns 1 pound fresh jumbo lump crabmeat 2 teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 bunch fresh chives, finely chopped 3 cups bread crumbs 5 tablespoons vegetable oil, for frying Lemon slices, for garnish Green salad, as accompaniment Remoulade, recipe follows 2 cups mayonnaise 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons cornichons or sour gherkins, minced 3 tablespoons capers, minced 1 garlic clove, minced 2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves 1 tablespoon chopped tarragon leaves 1 1/2 anchovies, minced Several dashes hot pepper sauce Instructions: Put potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add salt and bring to the boil, uncovered. Simmer for about 20 minutes until there is no resistance when a fork is inserted. Drain the potatoes and make sure they are dry. Mash them in a large bowl until all there are no lumps. While the potatoes are cooking, heat the milk, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Do not let it boil. Using a sieve, strain the milk and herbs into the potatoes and mix thoroughly. Add the chopped chives and season with salt and pepper. Check crabmeat for pieces of shell. Cover with cling-film and leave in the refrigerator until ready to use. Remove and fold carefully into the potatoes. Using your hands shape the mixture into medium sized patties, taking care to flatten out the centers and smooth out the top. Roll them in bread crumbs and shake off excess. Coat a large non-stick skillet with a 1/4-inch of oil and heat over a medium heat until it begins to smoke slightly. Pan-fry the crab cakes until brown, about 5 minutes on each side, turning carefully with a spatula. Remove from pan and serve on a large flat dish with Remoulade. Garnish with slices of lemon and serve with a green salad. Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.

To make the crostini, cut the baguettes into 1/4-inch thick slices. Using a pastry brush, brush the baguette slices with olive oil. Place on 2 foil-lined baking sheets and bake until crisp and golden, about 12 to 15 minutes. Reserve 25 of the crostini slices for the cheesecake. Cool the remaining crostini, then store in an airtight container until ready to serve. To make the cheesecake crust, put the 25 crostini slices in a food processor and run the machine until crostini are like bread crumbs, about 1 minute. Add the melted butter and pulse a few times to combine. Press the bread crumbs into the bottom of the cheesecake pan. Bake until golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. To make the cheesecake, wrap the outside of the cheesecake pan with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil. Place the ricotta, cream cheese, and goat cheese in a food processor. Pulse to mix. Add the eggs, sugar, and salt and pulse a few times until well mixed. Using a rubber spatula, stir in the red pepper, basil, and thyme. Pour the cheese mixture into the cheesecake pan. Place the cheesecake pan in a roasting pan. Pour enough hot water in the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake until the cheesecake is golden at the edges and the center of the cake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour (the cake will become firm when it is cold.) Transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate until the cheesecake is cold, at least 3 hours and up to 2 days. To serve, combine the jam and the hot water in a small bowl and stir until the jam is liquefied. Remove the cheesecake from the springform pan by running a knife around the inside of the rim and unlatching the pan&#39;s ring. Then, run a long metal spatula under the cheesecake and gently slide onto a serving plate. Drizzle the jam mixture over the top of the cheesecake, encouraging some of the jam to run down the sides. Serve with the reserved crostini alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1162,&quot;Chocolate White Chocolate Chunk Cookies 1/2 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup light brown sugar, packed 1 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup good unsweetened cocoa 2 cups flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds good white chocolate, coarsely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cream the butter and 2 sugars until light and fluffy in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the vanilla, then the eggs, 1 at a time, and mix well. Add the cocoa and mix again. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt and add to the chocolate with the mixer on low speed until just combined. Fold in the chopped white chocolate. Drop the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, using a 1 3/4-inch ice cream scoop or a rounded tablespoon. Dampen your hands and flatten the dough slightly.

In a mixing bowl combine the water, brown sugar, sea salt, apple juice concentrate, peppercorns, and thyme. Give it a good stir to dissolve the sugar and salt. Transfer the mixture to an extra-large re-sealable plastic bag. Submerge the pork chops in the brine, seal up the bag, and put it in the refrigerator for 2 hours to tenderize the meat. Do not brine longer than that or the meat will break down too much and get mushy. Remove the pork chops from the brine and pat them dry with paper towels. Sprinkle both sides of the meat with salt and pepper. Put a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add a 3-count drizzle of olive oil and get it hot. Lay 2 pork chops in the pan (most likely only 2 of these massive pork chops will fit comfortably) and brown 4 minutes per side. Remove the pork chops to a large baking pan; brown the remaining 2 chops and add them to the others in the pan. Put the baking pan in the oven and roast the chops for 30 minutes. The pork is done when the center is still rosy and the internal temperature reads 140 to 145 degrees F when tested with an instant-read thermometer. While the chops cook, melt the butter in a clean skillet over medium-low heat. Add the apples and thyme and coat in the butter; cook and stir for 8 minutes to give them some color. Toss in the raisins and add the apple juice, stirring to scrape up the brown bits. Stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and dry mustard; season with salt and pepper. Squeeze in the juice from the lemon to wake up the flavor and simmer for 10 minutes or until the apples break down and soften. Spoon the spiced apples over the pork chops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 1165,&quot;Baked Ham 1 ready-to-eat ham, bone in, no water added (about 7 or 8 pounds for a half a ham) 2 to 3 cups water or chicken stock 1/4 cup white wine 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup orange marmalade 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons dark rum 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1/4 cup cornmeal (helps glaze stick to ham) Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Cut away fat from ham, leaving about 1/4-inch fat all around. Remove any tough skin. Score fat in a diamond pattern with a sharp knife, being careful not o cut into the meat of the ham. Place ham, fattier side up, in a roasting pan and roast on a middle rack of the oven. A good roasting guideline is about 15 minutes per pound with the final internal temperature at about 140 degrees. While the ham is roasting, mix together all the ingredients for the glaze. About halfway through the roasting time, increase the temperature to 350 degrees and begin brushing the ham with the glaze, repeating about every 15 minutes. If the sugar starts to burn the bottom of the pan, keep adding stock or water. When the ham is finished, remove to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes before carving. If you&#39;d like, deglaze the pan with a little white wine and add the remaining stock of water. Reduce to make a sauce. Alternatively, just serve the ham with a nice selection of mustards and chutneys. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1166,&quot;Marinated Grilled Steak 1? pound flank steak 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped Ground black pepper 1 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Trim the steak of excess fat and rub with garlic and pepper.

Get in the habit of always tasting your flour; once it coats the veal it is harder to adjust the seasoning. Dredge the veal shanks in the seasoned flour and then tap off the excess (extra flour will burn and make the dish off-tasting). Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat and hit it with a 3-count drizzle of oil. Add the butter and swirl it around the pan to melt. Sear the veal shanks, turning carefully with tongs, until all sides are a rich brown caramel color. Drizzle with a little more oil, if needed. (Do this in batches if the shanks are big and look crowded in the pot.) Remove the browned veal shanks to a side plate. There will be a lot of flavor left over in the bottom of the pot. You&#39;&#39;re going to use that to create your sauce. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Using the same pot, sautee the onion, celery, carrots, lemon zest, garlic, bay leaves, and parsley over medium heat. Cook the vegetables down until they start to get some color and develop a deep, rich aroma. Season with salt and pepper; add a little oil if needed. Nestle the veal shanks back in the pot. Pour in the amarone wine and let it simmer down for 20 minutes, until the wine has reduced by half. Reducing is key for intense flavor. Add the beef broth and tomatoes and stir everything together. Cover the pot and put it in the oven. Braise for 1 and a 1/2 hours. Then remove the cover and continue to cook for another 30 minutes. The sauce should be thick and the veal tender and nearly falling off the bone. Remove bay leaves.

Grease a pudding dish or a shallow baking dish with the capacity of about 1 1/2-quarts with some of the butter. Put the raisins in a small bowl, pour the rum over and microwave them for 1 minute, then leave them to stand. This is a good way to soak them quickly but juicily. Make the sandwiches with the brown bread, butter and ginger jam (2 tablespoonfuls in each sandwich); you should have some butter left over to smear the top later. Now cut the sandwiches in 1/2 into triangles and arrange them evenly along the middle of the dish. I put 1 in the dish with the point-side uppermost and so on, then squeeze a sandwich-triangle down each side - but you do as you please. Sprinkle with the raisins and unabsorbed rum that remains in the bowl. Whisk the egg yolks and egg together with the sugar, and mix in the cream and milk. Pour this over the triangles of bread and leave them to soak up the liquid for about 10 minutes, by which time the pudding is ready to go into the oven. Smear the bread crusts that are poking out of the custard with the soft butter, mix the ground ginger and Demerara sugar together and sprinkle this mixture on your buttered crusts and the lightly over the rest of the pudding. Sit the pudding dish on a baking sheet and put in the oven to cook for about 45 minutes or until the custard has set and puffed up slightly. Remove, let sit for 10 minutes - by which time the puffiness will have deflated somewhat - and spoon out into bowls, putting a pitcher of custard, should you wish, on the table to be served alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 1176,&quot;Braised Octopus with Chickpea Salad and Salsa Verde Tentacles from one 4-to 6-pound fresh octopus 1 cup sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar<br> 1 cup red wine<br> 1 cinnamon stick<br> 2 star anise pods<br> 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 1 teaspoon fennel seeds<br> 1 bay leaf<br> A few sprigs fresh parsley (can also use basil or oregano) A few sprigs fresh thyme (can also use basil or oregano) 4 cups fresh or canned cooked chickpeas 1/2 small red onion or 1/2 large red onion, sliced 1/2 poblano pepper, minced<br> Zest of one lemon, plus 1/4 cup lemon juice<br> 1/4 cup lime juice<br> Zest of one orange, plus 1/4 cup orange juice<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 cup chopped romaine hearts<br> 1 cup arugula<br> 2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped 1/2 bunch fresh basil 1/2 bunch fresh parsley<br> 2 cloves garlic<br> 3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Salt and pepper<br> Instructions: For the octopus: Fill a large pot about 2/3 full with water and bring to a boil.

When hot, add shallot, garlic, and mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms soften and begin to brown on edges, about 10 minutes. Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is glossy and coated with oil, 2 to 3 minutes. Add a little salt and pepper, then wine. Stir and let liquid bubble away. Ladle stock into skillet 1/2 cup or so at a time, stirring after each addition, and every minute or so. When liquid is just about evaporated, add more. Mixture should be neither soupy nor dry. Keep heat at medium and stir frequently. Begin tasting pasta 10 minutes after you add it; you want it to be tender but with a tiny bit of crunch. When pasta is about 3 to 4 minutes away from being done, add chicken and stir to combine. Continue to cook until chicken is done, it will be white on inside when cut and pasta is how you like it. Taste, adjust seasoning, garnish with parsley and parmesan if using, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 1181,&quot;Filipino Grilled Chicken Wings 1 1/2 cups rice vinegar 1 1/4 cups soy sauce<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons black peppercorns<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 7 bay leaves, broken in half<br> 1 head garlic, minced (about 3 tablespoons)<br> 24 chicken wings, drumettes and flats separated and rinsed<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Leaves from 7 sprigs fresh cilantro (about 2 tablespoons)<br> Instructions: Combine the vinegar, soy sauce, peppercorns, paprika, onion powder, bay leaves and garlic in a resealable plastic bag. Place the wings in the bag, then press out any air and seal. Move the bag around to completely coat the chicken, then refrigerate, flipping the bag at least once, at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Preheat a grill to 350 degrees F. Remove the wings from the marinade (discard the marinade). Grill the wings, covered, for about 10 minutes. Flip the wings, close the lid and continue to grill until cooked through or the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, another 10 to 20 minutes. Allow the wings to rest for a few minutes.

Pulse until combined, and then add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter, about 10 pulses. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to 1 tablespoon cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand. Form the dough into a disk, wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. Roll the dough out with a rolling pin on a lightly-floured surface into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan and trim the edges, leaving about 1 inch extra hanging over the edge. Tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to form a thick edge that is even with the rim. Flute the edge as desired. Freeze the pie shell for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile for the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix together the pecans, syrup, dark brown sugar, light brown sugar, melted butter, vanilla and salt in a large bowl. Whisk the beaten eggs into the filling until smooth. Put the pie shell onto a baking sheet and pour in the filling. Bake on the lower oven rack until the edges are set but the center is still slightly loose, 40 to 45 minutes. (If the edges get very dark, cover them with aluminum foil halfway through baking.) Cool the pie on a rack, and then serve slightly warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 1184,&quot;Homemade Cheese Sauce One 1-pound block processed cheese, such as Velveeta, cut into cubes One 5-ounce can evaporated milk<br> 1 teaspoon dry mustard<br> 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1 clove garlic Instructions: Place a double boiler over medium heat.

Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Sliders: Preheat grill over medium-high heat. Form the meat into 2 to 3-ounce portions, packed tightly. Season with salt and pepper. Place the sliders on the grill. Wait until they are nice and crusty on the first side, about 4 to 5 minutes and then flip and cook another 4 minutes. When the sliders are about done, top with desired cheese and close the grill, allowing the cheese to melt. Place the slider on mini burger buns and top with chipotle mayonnaise and any other desired toppings. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 1187,&quot;The Hurricane 1 1/2 ounces light rum 1 1/2 ounces dark rum 1/4 cup passion fruit juice 1-ounce orange juice 1-ounce fresh lime juice 2 teaspoons simple syrup (equal amounts sugar and water heated until the sugar dissolves; cool) 1 teaspoon grenadine Ice cubes Cherries with stems, and orange slice to garnish Instructions: In a cocktail shaker, mix the rum, all of the fruit juices, and the simple syrup. Add the grenadine, and stir to combine, then add ice and shake. Half-fill a hurricane glass with ice, then strain the drink into a glass and add more ice to fill the glass. Garnish with cherries and an orange slice. &quot;,&quot;[Rum, Dark Rum, Grenadine]&quot; 1188,&quot;Red Cabbage and Apple Sauerkraut 1 head red cabbage (about 3 pounds) 3 tablespoons pickling salt, plus more as needed<br> 2 Granny Smith apples One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled<br> 1 teaspoon allspice berries Instructions: Remove any loose leaves from the cabbage head and reserve. Quarter the cabbage and thinly slice, on a mandoline if you have one. (The shreds should be about the thickness of a quarter.) Toss the cabbage in a large bowl with the pickling salt. Work the cabbage through your hands and massage for a minute or two, until the cabbage begins to \u201csweat\u201d and release some water. Thinly slice, then julienne the green apple, leaving the peel on. (Again, use a mandoline if you have one.) Slice the ginger into coins and press with the side of your knife to bruise them slightly and release their oils. Add the apples, ginger and allspice berries to the cabbage and toss well. Let sit for an hour or two, until the cabbage has released quite a bit of water. Pack the cabbage mixture into a large, wide-mouthed crock and press down very firmly until the liquid the cabbage has released covers it. (Depending on the age of your cabbage, it may release less water; a fresher cabbage will release a lot of water, while a cabbage that has been stored all winter will release less.) If the cabbage is not covered, mix together 1 quart cold water and 4 1/2 teaspoons pickling salt until dissolved and pour over enough to cover the cabbage. Use a couple of the reserved whole cabbage leaves to cover the surface of the cabbage. Cover with a plate (or the weight provided, if you have a fermenting crock) and set something heavy on top to weight it. (You can use cans. Many people like to use a resealable plastic bag filled with the same salted water solution used above because it weights evenly and if it leaks, it doesn\u2019t ruin the fermentation process.) Store the crock in a cool, dry place. Check the kraut after 2 days. There should be a few bubbles around the sides. Skim any scum that has risen to the surface. Check the kraut every few days and repeat skimming, if needed. Depending on the temperature of your room, the kraut should be ready after about a week. (Some people ferment for a couple of weeks or more, depending on how funky they want their kraut to be.) Divide the kraut and pack into jars. Store in the refrigerator. Drain and rinse the kraut well (discarding any ginger pieces) before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 1189,&quot;Glazed Apples and Pears 2 firm cooking apples, such as Golden Delicious, Macoun, Cortland, or Gravenstien 2 ripe pears, such as Anjou, Bartlett, or Comice 1 lemon 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons sugar 1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick or vanilla bean, split lengthwise 1 to 2 tablespoons Calvados or Apple Jack, optional Instructions: Peel, halve and core, both the apples and pears. Cut each 1/2 into 4 wedges and transfer to a medium bowl. Halve the lemon and squeeze the juice over the fruit, toss lightly. Melt the butter in a skillet over high heat. Add the sugar, and cook until the sugar begins to caramelize. Add the fruit-- the caramel may seize (harden) don&#39;t be alarmed. Add the cinnamon stick or vanilla, and cook, stirring, until the caramel melts, and the fruit is juicy, about 7 minutes. If adding the Calvados, remove the pan from the heat before adding the alcohol. Return the pan to the heat. To flambe the alcohol on a gas burner, carefully tip the pan toward the flame; and on an electric element hold a long match at the inside edge of the pan until it ignites. Swirl the pan over the heat until the flame subsides. Serve fruit, warm, over ice cream with cookies.

Using the dough hook attachment, gently mix together. Add the honey, butter, 2 eggs, flour, spice mix, salt, and raisins. Start the mixer and gently pour in the remaining 1 cup of milk while mixing. The dough should come together as a soft ball after a few minutes of mixing. If it is too sticky add a few sprinkles of additional flour; if it is too hard add a few more drops of cold milk. Turn this soft dough out directly onto a sheet pan and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise until about doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When it has double in size, turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Cut the dough in half and each half in half, etc. until you have a dozen pieces. Shape these pieces into rounds with your hands. Place these rounds equally spaced apart on a floured piece of parchment on a sheet pan. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until almost doubled in size. (If you press gently with your finger on a bun it should bounce back but your fingerprint should remain a bit.) Beat the remaining egg with a fork in a small bowl. Very gently brush this mixture on each of the buns. Using a sharp knife cut a cross shape in the top of each bun. Besides being decorative this allows the bread to rise nicely as it bakes. Bake in for about 15 minutes or until browned. Let cool. When cool, ice each bun with the glaze in a cross shape, following your cuts and using your spatula to drizzle icing on. Mix together all the ingredients. Put the sugar in a large bowl with the milk. Work the sugar and milk together until combined, adding additional milk 1 teaspoon at a time, until you have a nice smooth thick glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1195,&quot;Pumpkin Caramel Bread Pudding Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup granulated sugar 3 cups heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cups whole milk 4 large eggs plus 6 large yolks 1 cup pumpkin puree 1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 8 cups stale cubed challah (about one 1-pound loaf, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes; see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 cup raw pecan pieces Whipped cream or ice cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

If you don&#39;t have a grinder at home, ask a salesperson to grind whole beans for you rather than settling for pre-ground. Purchasing bulk (unpackaged) beans from a specialty shop is okay as long as the bins or jars are relatively small and refilled regularly. Large vats hold a lot of beans and therefore don&#39;t need frequent filling. That means that beans can hang around for a long time being exposed to light and air. That can mean stale beans, and staleness is not a desirable attribute. Purchase pre-packaged whole beans only when sealed in a foil-style bag featuring a one-way valve. The dime-shaped plastic valve is usually integrated into the packaging so that it will be as unobtrusive as possible, so check carefully. The absence of a valve means that the coffee probably sat and \gassed out\ before it was packaged. That means it could be stale. Stale, again, is not a good thing. And remember: paper bags with twist tops are temporary transportation vessels, not storage devices. Try to purchase only a week&#39;s worth of beans at a time. If you live where this is impractical, purchase several small sealed packages rather than one large one. Unopened one-way valve bags will keep coffee fresh for approximately three months. If you buy bulk coffee (not sealed with one-way valves) in large amounts, divide into weekly batches, seal in Mason-style jars and freeze. Transfer these small batches to counter top storage as needed (see below) . Store opened or bulk coffee in an airtight, opaque container and store at room temperature for up to a week. Grind coffee as close to brewing time as possible. For drip method, grind in blade style grinder for 15 to 20 seconds. For French presses, grind for only 10 to 12 seconds. Regardless of method, brew using 2 heaping tablespoons of coffee for each 6 ounces of clean (filtered or bottled), cool water. If you prefer a milder cup, brew to full strength, and then dilute with hot water. Brewing with too little coffee will result in over-extraction, and that means bitterness. If you really want to taste the subtle nuances of regional coffees, consider a gold mesh filter. When purchasing a coffee maker (either manual or electric), look for a model that brews into a thermal carafe rather than a glass pot designed to sit on a heating element. Continuous heating of coffee leads to bitterness. Quality decaffeinated coffees usually cost more than regular beans. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1213,&quot;Hot Mustard 1 tablespoon powdered hot mustard 1 teaspoon white vinegar 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 2 tablespoons water Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a small bowl, adding more or less water depending on desired thinness of sauce.

Slide out of the skillet onto a plate and serve immediately, sprinkled with chives. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1224,&quot;Merry Berry Sundae Two 1/2-cup scoops strawberry ice cream Two 1/2-cup scoops huckleberry ice cream<br> Two 1/2-cup scoops dark cherry ice cream<br> 1/3 cup marshmallow cream 1/3 cup mixed fresh berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries<br> 4 to 5 Candied Cranberries, recipe follows 2 gingerbread people, store-bought or homemade 1 tablespoon Green Ganache, recipe follows 1 tablespoon Red Ganache, recipe follows 2 sprigs fresh mint<br> 1 maraschino cherry<br> 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar 3 cups fresh cranberries<br> 6 ounces green candy melting wafers 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 6 ounces red candy melting wafers 1/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: Place the strawberry, huckleberry and dark cherry ice cream in a serving dish. Put the marshmallow cream in a piping bag (or spoon it straight from the jar) and top the ice cream with a mound of it. Decorate with the mixed berries and Candied Cranberries. Press the gingerbread people into the ice cream and marshmallow cream, then drizzle over the Green Ganache and Red Ganache. Finish decorating the sundae with the mint sprigs and a cherry on top. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a sheet pan. Pour 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup of the sugar into a saucepan, bring to a boil and simmer on low heat for 3 minutes. Stir to ensure the sugar has dissolved into the water and the result is a syrup consistency. Add the cranberries to the pan and stir so they are covered in the syrup. Remove the pan from the heat and stir for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cranberries from the pan and add them to the prepared sheet pan. Allow the cranberries to cool and dry, about 1 hour. Pour the remaining sugar into a bowl. Add the cranberries and toss until they are thoroughly coated in the sugar. Store in an airtight container until ready to use. Add the candy melting wafers to a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream in a pan until hot but not boiling. Pour over the candy wafers and let sit for 1 minute, then stir until completely melted. Add the candy melting wafers to a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream in a pan until hot but not boiling. Pour over the candy wafers and let sit for 1 minute, then stir until completely melted. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 1225,&quot;Risotto 1 medium-size yellow onion 4 tablespoons butter (1/2 stick) 5 cups or more chicken broth, canned or homemade 2 cups Arborio rice (available in many supermarkets or specialty food stores) Salt and pepper to taste 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Preparing the Rice Peel and finely chop the onion. Melt the butter in a 4-to-5-quart saucepan over medium heat, stirring regularly. Add the onion and cook, continuing to stir, until it turns soft and translucent. Turn the heat down if the onion starts to brown. Meanwhile, pour the chicken broth into a separate saucepan, set over medium heat, and bring to a gentle simmer. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain this simmer the whole time you are preparing the risotto. Once the onion is soft, add the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary -- if the rice is cooked at too high a heat, it will turn brown and take on an undesirable flavor. Adding the Liquid to the Rice Using a ladle, scoop up about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of broth. Pour it in the pan with the rice, stirring constantly with a spoon. After the first addition of broth, the rice mixture will look a bit soupy. As the rice begins to cook, stir it constantly, making sure that you scrape along the bottom of the pan so that it does not stick. You should see little bubbles popping up on the liquid from time to time. If it bubbles more vigorously than this, turn the heat down to medium-low. When most of the liquid is absorbed into the rice and the rice begins to look a bit dry, add another ladle of broth to the pan and stir constantly, as before. Determining When the Risotto Is Cooked Continue to add the broth in 1/2-to-3/4-cup batches and stir the rice until you have used most of the broth (this will probably take about 20 minutes). It is now time to test whether the risotto is cooked. Spoon up a grain of rice and bite into it -- it should be tender without being too mushy. If it is still crunchy and tastes a bit starchy, you will need to continue adding liquid and cooking further. If it looks as if you will run out of chicken broth and your rice is still not cooked, don&#39;t be alarmed. Because of variations in individual stoves and cooking temperatures, you may need more liquid than called for in the recipe. Simply heat up another cup or 2 of chicken broth. If you run out of broth, use hot water. When the rice is tender and the risotto has a creamy consistency, almost like thick oatmeal, it is done. Serving the Risotto Add salt and pepper to the risotto, about 1/4 teaspoon at a time, until it seems well seasoned to you. Stir. Add the grated Parmesan cheese and stir well. Serve the risotto immediately in warm bowls and have extra grated Parmesan on hand. Risotto with Tomatoes and Basil: Take 4 Roma tomatoes, cut off and discard the stem tops, and cut the tomatoes into small pieces. Chop enough fresh basil leaves into small pieces to make about 1 cup. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet, and turn the heat to medium-high. When the bottom of the skillet feels hot when you put your open hand 1 inch from the bottom, add the tomatoes and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Stir for 3 or 4 minutes, until they seem soft. Put the cooked tomatoes aside, and when the risotto is done, stir the tomatoes and basil into the hot risotto. Stir to mix well; taste for salt and add some if needed. Serve immediately and pass some grated Parmesan cheese. Risotto with Spinach and Garlic: Peel and chop 3 large cloves of garlic into small pieces, and put them on a piece of waxed paper. Rinse 1/2 bunch of spinach leaves, and shake off the excess water. Cut off the stems, bunch the leaves up, and cut them into thin strips, then cut crosswise into small pieces. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. When the bottom of the skillet feels hot when you put your open hand, palm side down, 1 inch from the bottom of the skillet, it is ready. Add the garlic to the oil and stir for a minute. Turn the heat to low, and add the spinach. Press the spinach down with a spatula, lightly salt and pepper it, and turn it over with a spatula. The spinach will wilt down almost immediately. Take the skillet off the stove, put a lid on the skillet, and when the risotto is done, stir the garlic and spinach into the risotto. Serve immediately, and pass some grated Parmesan cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 1226,&quot;Wild Mushroom and Mizuna Salad with White Truffle Vinaigrette and Sage 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 portobello mushrooms, stems removed, cleaned with a brush and cut into 1/4-inch slices 12 chanterelle mushrooms, cleaned with a soft brush 2 tablespoons minced garlic Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste 4 cups mizuna greens, rinsed well and dried White Truffle Vinaigrette, recipe follows 1/4 cup sage leaves, cut into chiffonade 2 tablespoons chopped shallots 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon white truffle oil Salt, to taste Pepper, to taste Instructions: Heat oil in large pan over high heat until almost smoking. Add mushrooms and cook until golden brown. Add garlic and cook 1 minute. Divide mizuna and mushrooms among 4 plates. Drizzle with the White Truffle Vinaigrette and sprinkle with sage. Place shallots, vinegar and mustard in a blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running add olive oil and blend until emulsified.

Whisk the first 7 ingredients in a large bowl to blend. Stir in the Parmesan and bread crumbs. Mix in the beef, pork, and veal. Pack half of the meat mixture into a 9 by 5 by 3-inch loaf pan. Spoon the stuffing over the meat in the pan, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Top with the remaining meat mixture, enclosing the stuffing completely and pressing firmly. Spoon the marinara sauce over the meatloaf, then sprinkle with the provolone cheese. Bake, uncovered, until the meat loaf is firm to the touch in the center and has pulled away from the sides of the pan, about 45 minutes. Cut crosswise into slices and serve. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 15 by 10 by 2-inch glass baking dish. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and saute until crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a large bowl. Melt the remaining butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, rosemary, and garlic. Saute until the onions are very tender, about 12 minutes. Gently stir in the chestnuts and parsley. Transfer the onion mixture to the large bowl with the pancetta. Add the bread and Parmesan and toss to coat. Add enough broth to the stuffing mixture to moisten. Season the stuffing, to taste, with salt and pepper. Mix in the eggs. Transfer the stuffing to the prepared dish. Cover with buttered foil, buttered side down, and bake until the stuffing is heated through, about 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until the top is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 1228,&quot;Spaghetti with Parsley Olive Oil Sauce 1 pound of spaghetti or any other thin pasta 1/2 cup (packed) fresh parsley leaves 2 cloves garlic 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Parmesan cheese-optional garnish Instructions: In a large pot bring water to a full rolling boil.
