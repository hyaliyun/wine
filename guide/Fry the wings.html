This swirling will assure the wings fry more evenly on all sides. When they are light to medium brown, 5 to 7 minutes, remove them with the slotted spoon and lay them out on the wire rack. Season with salt. Cook the rest of the wings in batches, keeping the fried wings warm on the second baking sheet in the oven until all are cooked. Leave the wings in the oven for at least 10 minutes to assure all are cooked through. Toss the wings in a large bowl with all of the Buffalo sauce. Serve on a large platter with the blue cheese dressing and vegetables on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 41832,&quot;Fennel Remoulade 5 1/2 ounces fennel bulb 2 tablespoons olive oil 1-ounce garlic cloves 1 lemon juice 2 cups mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves 1 tablespoon chopped chives 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon white pepper 1-ounce Pernod Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Chop the fennel bulb into a small dice and mix with the olive oil and garlic cloves. Roast in the oven until golden brown and tender. Let cool and mix with all the other ingredients in a food processor. Blend in food processor until smooth. Place in covered container until needed for service. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 41833,&quot;Lentil and Chorizo Soup 3 to 4 dried ancho chiles, wiped clean, stemmed and seeded 1 cup water 4 thick slices bacon, cut into strips 1-inch long x 1/8-inch wide 9 ounces chorizo sausage, removed from casings and crumbled 2 medium onions, diced 10 garlic cloves, minced 1 1/2 cups brown lentils, washed and picked over 3 quarts chicken stock, vegetable stock, or water 2 carrots, peeled and diced 2 celery ribs, washed and diced 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 bunch parsley, leaves only, chopped 1 bunch cilantro, leaves only, chopped Lime wedges Instructions: Toast the chiles in a dry, cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until brown all over; they will soften, bubble and release their aroma .Place the chiles in a saucepan with the water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook 5 minutes, or until soft. Transfer the chiles with their water to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Reserve. Fry the bacon in large heavy stockpot over medium-high heat, about 4 minutes. Stir in the chorizo and saute 3 minutes longer, or until browned. Spoon out excess fat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden. Then stir in the garlic and cook for a few minutes to release its aroma. Add the lentils and reserved cl puree and saute an additional minute. Pour in the stock or water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook 10 minutes, occasionally skimming and removing the fat from the top. Stir in the carrots, celery, salt and pepper. Cook over medium-low heat, covered, for about 40 minutes, skimming and discarding the fat from the top. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and cilantro and serve hot, with the lime wedges if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 41834,&quot;Crispy Kale Chips with Lemon 2 bunches fresh kale, stemmed, torn into bite-size pieces Extra-virgin olive oil Flaky sea salt 1 lemon Crushed red pepper flakes Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the kale in a large bowl and dress very lightly with olive oil so the leaves are barely coated. Season with salt. Spread the leaves out across 2 roasting sheet trays so they aren&#39;t stacked up on each other too much. Roast in the oven until crispy but still green, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and dress with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a touch of crushed red pepper flakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 41835,&quot;Roasted Red Pepper Pizza 1 28-ounce can whole San Marzano plum tomatoes 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper For the pepper spread: 1 Fresno or red jalapeno cl pepper 1 large red bell pepper 1 clove garlic 2 anchovy fillets 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt For the pizza: 1 Prebaked Pizza Crust, recipe follows 6 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (preferably buffalo mozzarella),drained and sliced 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese Torn fresh oregano or basil, for topping 4 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon rapid-rise instant yeast 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl Instructions: Place a pizza stone or inverted rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Make the tomato sauce: Crush the tomatoes in a large bowl with your hands. Stir in the olive oil, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Make the pepper spread: Roast the cl pepper and bell pepper over the flame of a gas burner (or under the broiler), turning, until charred, 4 minutes for the cl and 6 to 8 minutes for the bell pepper. Transfer the peppers to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Peel off the charred skins with your fingers (you may want to use gloves for the cl pepper to avoid irritation). Halve the peppers and remove the seeds. Combine the garlic, anchovies, red pepper flakes and oregano in a food processor. Add the roasted peppers and pulse until almost smooth. Pour in the olive oil and pulse a few times. Season with salt. Assemble the pizza: Keep the prebaked crust on the baking sheet. Spread with 3/4 cup to 1 cup tomato sauce (you will have extra sauce). Top with the mozzarella, then spoon 1/2 cup pepper spread on top. Sprinkle with half of the parmesan. Transfer the baking sheet to the hot pizza stone and bake until the cheese melts and the crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the remaining parmesan and the herbs. Season with salt. Combine the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Stir in 2 cups warm water (about 105 degrees F) and 2 tablespoons olive oil with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until the dough rises slightly, about 1 hour. Using lightly floured hands, transfer the dough to a generously floured surface and knead several times until it just starts becoming smooth and elastic, about 1 minute (do not over-knead). Transfer to a lightly oiled large bowl. Tightly cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, place a pizza stone or inverted rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Brush two rimmed 13-by-18-inch baking sheets (not nonstick) with 3 tablespoons olive oil each. Place one piece of dough on each baking sheet. Prepare the pizzas one at a time: Cover the dough with plastic wrap, then press firmly with your hands to fill the baking Remove the plastic wrap and transfer the baking sheet to the hot pizza stone. Bake until the crust starts browning, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully loosen the crust from the pan using a spatula. Top and bake (see recipe indexfor ideas), or let cool, lightly wrap in plastic and set aside up to 8 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barbera, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 41836,&quot;Peach and Blueberry Pastry Pocket with Vanilla Glaze and Candied Almonds 8 ounces cold cream cheese, cut into cubes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, grated on a box grater Kosher salt 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 large egg plus 1 yolk 1 pint blueberries (about 10 ounces) 3 peaches, peeled and small diced 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 6 sprigs thyme, tied together with kitchen twine Zest and juice of 1 lemon 1 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Juice of 1/2 lemon Candied Almonds, recipe follows, for garnish Flaky sea salt, for garnish 1/2 large egg white 1/3 cup granulated sugar Pinch kosher salt 1 cup sliced almonds Instructions: For the pastry pocket: To the bowl of a food processor, add the cream cheese, flour, butter, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar. Pulse to combine until it\u2019s the consistency of grated Parmesan cheese. Add the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of water. Pulse until the dough just comes together. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and gently knead into a large disc. Roll the dough into a circle about 1/4 inch thick. Transfer the dough to a sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap, then place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Set up an ice bath and generously season with kosher salt (it keeps the water cold!). Add the blueberries, peaches and cornstarch to a medium saucepan. Stir to combine, making sure all of the fruit is coated with the cornstarch. Add the cinnamon, thyme bundle, lemon zest and juice, remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove the thyme bundle and discard. Transfer the peach and blueberry mixture to a bowl, place over the ice bath and stir to cool down. Whisk the whole egg with 1 teaspoon of water to create an egg wash. Place the dough on a floured work surface. Roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thick. Using a 5-inch ring cutter, punch out 8 circles and place on a parchment-lined sheet tray. Brush the edges of one half of each circle with the egg wash. Add 2 tablespoons of filling into the center of each circle, then fold the dough over to create a half moon. Press the edges with your fingers to secure the seam tightly. Crimp the edges using a fork. Make 3 small slits in the top of each pastry pocket with a paring knife. Bake, turning the tray halfway through cooking, until golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes. Set the pastry pockets on a sheet tray lined with a rack to cool. For the glaze: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar using a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Add the milk, vanilla extract and lemon juice and whisk to combine.

Whisk until uniform while bringing to a simmer to bloom all the spices and flavors, then simmer, about 5 minutes. Take off heat to cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. Coat all slices of pork with marinade. Spray a plastic quart container with cooking spray. Stuff the container with the slices of marinated pork, arranging them in a stack. Cover and place in the fridge 8 hours or overnight to marinate. Slide marinated meat gently out of quart container. Cut the pineapple into 4 equal rounds. Reserve 2 whole slices of pineapple and core the remaining 2 slices, then cut them into chunks. Place the stack of marinated meat in between the reserved slices of pineapple. Evenly skewer the stack with 8 to 10 metal skewers to make the \pastor. Heat a grill for cooking at about 275 degrees F. Using a chimney starter, ignite 3 to 4 charcoal briquettes. Place the briquettes in a smoker box with apple or cherry wood chips that have soaked in water 30 minutes, and place the box directly on the grate. Place onion and pineapple chunks in a small drip tray or roasting pan. Position the pan right on the grill, and the pastor on the elevated grill shelf directly above it. Place smoker box directly in front of the drip pan, so that some of the heat and smoke from the wood can reach the pastor. Cook for 4 hours, rotating a quarter every 45 minutes to 1 hour. Take it off the heat and let rest for at least 1 hour. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Dice onions and pineapple from drip tray and sear in the skillet until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Holding the pastor vertical, shave off shards of pork. Sear off in the skillet until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Serve with corn tortillas, salsa verde and fresh cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 41860,&quot;Roast Chicken Cobb Salad 2 large chicken breasts, bone-in, skin-on Good olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 pound thick-cut applewood smoked bacon 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 lemons) 5 tablespoons good olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 ripe Hass avocados Juice of 1 lemon 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved through the stem 1 cup diced English Stilton, or other crumbly blue cheese 3 ounces baby arugula Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment. Place the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is fully melted. Set aside.<br> Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.<br> Beat the granulated sugar, butter and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy and pale, about 4 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the vanilla and then the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and mixing well after each addition. Add one-third of the flour mixture and beat on low speed until just combined. Add half of the milk and beat until combined. Repeat alternating additions of the flour mixture and milk, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each and beating until the last addition of flour is fully incorporated.<br> Transfer one-quarter of the batter to the bowl with the melted chocolate and stir until the chocolate is evenly incorporated.<br> Pour half of the remaining vanilla batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth out to the edges with an offset spatula. Scoop large spoonfuls of the chocolate batter on top of the vanilla batter and then pour the remaining vanilla batter on top. Using a skewer or butter knife, carefully swirl the chocolate batter into the vanilla batter to create a marbled effect.<br> Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes. The top of the cake should be springy to the touch and the vanilla spots should be lightly golden. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then use a paring knife to loosen the sides of the cake from the pan and invert onto a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.<br> For the frosting: Beat the butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the cocoa powder, cream, vanilla, salt and 1 1/2 cups of the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix on low speed until fully incorporated. With the mixer still on low, gradually add the remaining confectioners&#39; sugar and mix well. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes; the frosting will lighten in color as air is incorporated.

Spray a 24-count mini muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place an approximately 20-inch-long piece of plastic wrap over the muffin pan, leaving about 4 inches of excess plastic hanging over the ends of the pan. Press the plastic into each cup of the pan, making sure the cups are completely lined with the plastic wrap. Using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon measure, scoop ice cream into each muffin cup. Press a cherry into each cup and use a small offset spatula or butter knife to spread the ice cream over the cherry to cover. Place a chocolate cookie on top of each ice cream-filled muffin cup. Freeze until the ice cream hardens, about 3 hours. Place a rectangular cooling rack over a baking sheet. Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Carefully remove the plastic wrap from the muffin pan to release the bonbons from the muffin cups. Place the bonbons cookie-side down on the baking sheet lined with the cooling rack. Slowly pour some of the chocolate shell ice cream sauce over about 4 of the bonbons to cover completely. Before the sauce hardens, sprinkle the tops of the bonbons with rainbow sprinkles or chopped peanuts. The sauce will harden in about 30 seconds, so continue to coat 4 bonbons at a time before topping them with the sprinkles or peanuts, until all 24 are coated and topped. Transfer the bonbons from the cooling rack to the parchment-lined baking sheet with an offset spatula or butter knife and let stand until set, 3 to 5 minutes. Dip the offset spatula in hot water, then use it to remove the bonbons from the parchment. The hot spatula will help prevent the chocolate shell of the bonbons from cracking when you remove them. Store in a resealable container in the freezer until ready to serve. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Stir in the coconut oil and corn syrup. Let cool for 1 hour. It should be the consistency of pancake batter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 41871,&quot;Bistro Breakfast Burger 1/4 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce 1 1/2 pounds ground beef, 80/20 1 teaspoon sweet paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 slices thick-cut bacon, halved crosswise 4 large eggs 4 sesame seed hamburger buns 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, for brushing 4 slices Havarti cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

With a melon half flesh side up, cut vertical lines into the flesh (leaving rind intact) 1 inch apart and about 2 inches deep along the length of each half, leaving a 1-inch border of flesh on both ends. Repeat this process with the lines going in the opposite direction. Use a spoon to scoop out the watermelon pieces into a large bowl (it&#39;s okay if some of the spears break in half as you are doing this.) Repeat with the remaining melon halves. Use the spoon to remove as much of the flesh left in the watermelon halves as possible and save for another use. Cut 1 1/2 inches off both ends of 2 of the watermelon halves (these halves will become the middle parts of the bowl). Cut 1 1/2 inches off one end of the 2 remaining halves (these will become the bookends of your bowl). Use the flesh left in the watermelon ends to stamp out sharks with a 3-inch shark cookie cutter and set aside.<br> Use a metal skewer to outline waves along the top edge of each watermelon half. Then carefully cut out the wave pattern using a sharp paring knife. Take one middle piece and one bookend piece and place the flat sides together to create half of the large bowl. Thread the metal skewer through the bottom of the watermelons to secure them together. Repeat this process with the remaining watermelon halves and another metal skewer to create the other half of the large bowl. Place both halves on a large platter with the two middle pieces pushed together (these parts do not need to be secured with a skewer as they will stay together on the platter).<br> Fill the assembled watermelon bowl with the reserved watermelon chunks. Mix the berries and grapes together and scatter on top of the watermelon, covering it as much as possible, then add the melon sharks.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41875,&quot;Texas Caviar 1 ear corn, shucked 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 5 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 1/2 teaspoons honey 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 15-ounce can assorted beans, drained and rinsed 1 small red onion, diced 1 small plum tomato, diced 1/2 yellow bell pepper, diced 1 stalk celery, finely diced 1 jalape?o pepper, finely chopped (remove seeds for less heat) 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Tortilla chips, for serving (optional) Instructions: Preheat a grill to high.

Whip the egg whites until foamy in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the granulated sugar and whip until stiff and glossy, about 3 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and whip very briefly (I count to 10), just to incorporate. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag with a medium plain tip and pipe small hearts with 2 teardrop shaped strokes onto a parchment lined cookie sheet. Place the pan in the turned-off oven, close the door, and leave overnight to dry until crisp. (The recipe can be made up to this point and stored at room temperature in an airtight container up to 5 days in advance.) When ready to serve, whip the cream and place in a pastry bag with a star tip. Place 1 meringue heart on a plate then pipe on cream. Top with raspberries and a final meringue.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In a separate small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the egg, buttermilk and 2 tablespoons oil. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Transfer the batter to a tall skinny glass or measuring cup (this step isn&#39;t completely necessary, but it will make coating the sausages easier). Working in batches of 3 or 4 sausages at a time, insert popsicle sticks or lollipop sticks into the sausages, pat off any excess moisture with a paper towel, and dip them into the pancake batter to fully coat, scraping off excess. It doesn&#39;t need to be a very thick coating as the batter will puff up when frying. Carefully lower the entire thing (stick included) into the hot oil and fry until golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Use tongs to transfer to a paper towel or wire rack. Repeat with the remaining sausages.

Add the egg whites and mix again until incorporated. Stir in the flour and red food color; mix until just combined. Scrape down the bowl and mix again briefly. With an offset spatula, spread a thin layer of stencil paste over a 17-by-11-inch silicone baking mat. Using a cake comb with 1/4-inch spaced teeth, and starting at one corner of the mat, drag the comb diagonally across the mat and through the paste so that 1/4-inch even stripes of red paste remain on the mat. Repeat the combing process until the entire mat is striped. Place the mat inside a 17-by-11-inch jelly roll pan and freeze for at least 10 minutes. (You may have leftover stencil paste.)<br> For the sponge cake: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the almond flour, confectioners\u2019 sugar, all-purpose flour, whole eggs and egg yolk until combined. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites and granulated sugar with an electric hand mixer until a thick, glossy meringue forms. Gently fold the meringue into the almond mixture. Add the melted butter and gently fold again, being careful not to deflate the batter. Remove the jelly roll pan from the freezer and pour the batter on top of the red stencil paste. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the cake springs back when pressed in the center. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

Trim the edges of the cake away using a small sharp knife.<br> Place four 3-inch diameter pastry rings on a baking sheet. Cut the striped sponge into 3-inch-wide strips and trim the length to fit inside the pastry rings. Line each ring with the sponge so that the red stripe design rests against the pastry ring. Refrigerate the cakes while you prepare the peppermint mousse.<br> For the peppermint mousse: Place the 2 tablespoons cold water in a condiment cup and sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Let stand for 1 minute. Place the bloomed gelatin in a medium saucepan. Whisk in the egg yolks and granulated sugar; mix well. Stir in the hot milk. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. When done, it should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the chopped white chocolate and let stand in the hot mixture for 2 minutes. Add the peppermint and blend with a whisk until the chocolate has melted and is even in color. Let cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks with an electric mixer.<br> When the chocolate mixture has cooled, pour it into the whipped cream and add a few drops of red food color. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cooled chocolate mixture until well blended. Transfer the mousse to a piping bag.<br> Remove the cakes from the refrigerator and place each cake on a length of plastic wrap double the size of the pastry rings. Pipe peppermint mousse into the centers, filling them to the top. Cover the cakes with the overhanging plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.<br> For the Christmas tree toppers: Combine the butter and confectioners\u2019 sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment. Beat until combined; add the milk or cream a little at a time until the mixture comes to piping consistency. Mix in the vanilla extract. Set aside 2/3 cup of the frosting in a small bowl and cover with a damp paper towel.<br> Add the green food color to the remaining frosting and beat well to combine. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip (4B).<br> When the cakes are well chilled, remove them from the refrigerator and cover the tops with a thin layer of frosting from the bowl of reserved white (untinted) buttercream. Place a sugar cone in the center of each cake. Pipe green buttercream stars on the cones beginning at the bottom edge of each cone, and travelling upward to the pointed end. Immediately sprinkle the cakes with the white nonpareils. Place gold and white sugar pearls on the trees using a pair of kitchen-dedicated tweezers. Arrange the small candy cane sprinkles on the tree using the tweezers.<br> Melt the yellow candy wafers in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave at 100% power in 30-second increments. Stir between heating until the candy is smooth. Transfer the melted candy to a small disposable piping bag. Pipe the candy into a small star candy mold with cavities approximately 1.1-inch in diameter, filling just 8 of the cavities. Place in the freezer for 5 minutes, or until hardened. Turn out the stars onto a baking sheet. Use leftover melted candy to attach the flat sides of two stars together, lining them up to match evenly. Let stand until firm, about 2 minutes. Place an assembled star on the top of each tree, pressing them into the icing to adhere firmly.

Set a bowl of well-salted ice water on the counter. Add the broccoli rabe and cook for 1 minute. Remove the broccoli rabe from the boiling water and plunge it immediately into the salted ice water. Reserve the boiling water to cook the pasta. Once the broccoli rabe has cooled, remove it from the ice water and squeeze out any excess water. Finely chop the broccoli rabe (the food processor works really well here) and put it in a large mixing bowl. Add the ricotta, Parmigiano and eggs and sprinkle with salt. Adjust seasoning if needed. Put the filling in a pastry bag and reserve. For the pasta: Set the pasta roller on the widest setting (#1). Start with half the pasta dough; keep the other half covered until ready to use. Using your hands, flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller, twice dusting it in between rolls if it feels sticky. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees (a quarter turn) and run it through the pasta machine 2 to 3 times. Move the roller to the next setting (#2) and run the pasta through. Dust lightly with flour if the dough feels sticky. Continue to run the dough through the machine reducing the opening (or moving the setting to the next larger number) in between every roll. Stop when you get to the correct thinness, this will usually be around number 5 or 6 on the dial, but every machine is different, you will have to be the judge of your own pasta thickness. To assemble the ravioli: Lay out the dough on a flat surface. Brush the lower half of the dough (the part that is closest to you) lightly with water. This is the glue that will hold the ravioli together. Use the glue sparingly, if you use too much the pasta will slide and not stick. Pipe 1-inch balls of filling onto the pasta that has been brushed with water, leaving about 2 inches between each ball. Fold the top half of the pasta down over the filling to meet the bottom edge. Using your index fingers, poke around each filling ball to seal the ravioli shut, AND to make sure that there are no air bubbles. Using a fluted round cutter or a fluted pastry wheel or even a drinking glass, cut out each ravioli. Transfer to a sheet tray dusted with semolina or polenta and reserve until ready to use. To cook the ravioli and make the sauce: Add the butter to a large saute pan and bring to a medium heat. Add 1 cup of chicken stock and season with salt. Shake the pan to incorporate the butter and stock, and simmer until the stock has reduced a bit and the sauce looks velvety and is the consistency of heavy cream. If the sauce thickens too much, adjust the consistency with chicken stock. Add the ravioli to the pot of boiling water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully remove the ravioli from the cooking water and put them immediately into the sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, shaking frequently to be sure that the ravioli don&#39;(TM)t stick to the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the Parmigiano and swirl to combine the cheese with the sauce. Transfer the ravioli to a serving platter and sprinkle with a little more grated Parmesan. Garnish with chopped pistachios and serve. Mangia Bene! Put the flour on a clean, dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, salt and water. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, salt and water. Using the fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture; be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately do not refrigerate. Roll and cut the pasta into desired shape. How smooth and supple! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo]&quot; 41921,&quot;Kan Kan 3 tablespoons salt Four 2-pound pork chops that include loin, rib and attached skin 1 cup sofrito<br> 1 cup olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon dried oregano<br> 1 tablespoon ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon annatto powder Oil, for deep-frying chops Instructions: Fill up a deep pot with 2 gallons of water and 1 tablespoon salt.

Cook the clams: Heat a large skillet over high heat. Rinse the clams one final time to make sure they are free of any grit. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet, add the clams and vermouth and cook, shaking the skillet slightly, until the clams open. Remove and cool. Reserve any cooking liquid.<br> Make the breadcrumb mix: Place the remaining 10 tablespoons butter in the bowl of a food processor, add the garlic, scallions and lemon zest and juice and pulse to blend. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Mix in the breadcrumbs.<br> Prepare and bake the clams: Detach each clam from its shell and put the meat back in the shell. Mix the reserved cooking liquid from the clams (if any) with the cream. Pour a touch of the cream mixture on top of each clam and immediately mold some of the breadcrumb mixture into each of the shells so the clam body is covered. Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until hot, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and preheat the broiler.<br> Broil the clams for 1 minute, watching them constantly so they don&#39;t burn. Remove them from the oven. Squirt with lemon juice. Top each clam with some parsley. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 41940,&quot;Hot Smoked Salmon 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, lightly packed Kosher salt 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black peppercorns 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (2 lemons) 2 pounds King salmon fillets, skin on (whole or cut in serving pieces) 1 large, flat disposable foil pan<br> Fresh Dill Sauce, recipe follows, for serving 1/2 cup good mayonnaise, such as Hellmann&#39;s 1/2 cup sour cream 1/2 cup plain yogurt, such as Stonyfield 2 tablespoons cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup chopped scallions, white and green parts (4 scallions) 1/2 cup minced fresh dill 1/4 cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup seeded, grated hothouse cucumber Instructions: The night before serving, combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, 2 tablespoons salt, the peppercorns, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Place the salmon fillets skin-side down on a large flat ceramic or glass dish. Spread the mixture evenly on top of the salmon. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate. At least 1 1/2 hours before you plan to cook the salmon, soak the wood chips in water. Thirty minutes before you?re ready to cook, heat the charcoal. Place a double layer of coals on one side of the grill, light them, and allow them to burn until the coals are gray on the outside. (I use a charcoal chimney to light the coals.) Sprinkle half the soaked wood chips on the hot coals (you will see lots of smoke). On the other side of the grill, place the foil pan and pour in 1 cup water. Place the cooking grate over the coals and the pan. Scrape most of the sugar mixture off the salmon and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt. Place the salmon skin-side down on the side of the grill directly over the foil pan. Put the lid on the grill, making sure the top and bottom vents are open. Smoke the salmon for 10 minutes. Add the remaining wood chips directly on the coals and cook for 5 to 10 more minutes, depending on the thickness of the salmon, until it&#39;s firm to the touch and barely cooked. Don&#39;t overcook the salmon or it will be dry! Transfer the salmon to a clean platter and immediately cover tightly with aluminum foil. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the skin, if desired, and serve hot, at room temperature, or cold with the Fresh Dill Sauce. Place the mayonnaise, sour cream, yogurt, cream cheese, scallions, dill, parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Puree for a few seconds, until well mixed. Add the cucumber and puree for another few seconds, until combined. Pour into a container and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to develop.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41941,&quot;Fische Fondue (Speciality of the Hotel St. Gotthard) 2 eggs, separated 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard Freshly ground salt Freshly ground pepper 1 cup oil 1 teaspoon boiling water 1 clove garlic, crushed 2 sweet gherkins, chopped 2 teaspoons capers 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped Pinch tarragon Pinch chervil 1/2 teaspoon curry powder 1/2 teaspoon tomato paste 1/2 teaspoon brandy 3 anchovy fillets, small dice 1 teaspoon flaked almonds 12 shrimps, peeled 4 ounces turbot 4 ounces sole 4 ounces salmon 4 ounces scallops Instructions: Sauce: Beat the egg whites until stiff and set aside. Put the egg yolks into a bowl and place over a pot of warm water. Beat with an electric mixer until they are light and creamy. Remove from the heat. Add the mustard and a pinch of fresh ground salt and pepper and continue beating gradually adding 1/4 cup oil, drop by drop. If the mayonnaise should curdle and lose its bulk add some of the beaten egg white. Continue to add the remainder of the oil so that the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the boiling water. Set aside. Have several little bowls ready for mixing use. To 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise in a bowl, add the garlic and mix together. Place on a fondue sauce tray. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise into each of 6 small bowls and add to one, gherkins and capers. In the second bowl, parsley. In a third, tarrragon and chervil. In a fourth bowl the curry powder. In the fifth tomato paste and brandy. Sixth bowl the anchovies. The seventh bowl should be the flaked almonds, without mayonnaise. Pour these sauces into the fondue sauce trays. Remove all bones from the fish. Cut the fish into bite-size pieces. Heat the oil in the fondue pot and set the fish cubes attractively on a serving platter. Place a piece of fish on a skewer and dip it into the oil for 1 to 2 minutes and then dunk into the various sauces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41942,&quot;Fingerling Potato Chips 1 pound medium fingerling potatoes 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon salt 2 tablespoons coarse black pepper 2 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves 2 cloves garlic, minced Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Preheat oil to 350 degrees F.

Season with salt and pepper. If necessary, thin with a few teaspoons of water to achieve the desired consistency. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41946,&quot;Sfogliatella 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup semolina flour 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup shortening 1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash Confectioners&#39; sugar (about 1/2 cup) 1 cup whole milk 1/4 cup semolina flour 1 cup ricotta cheese 1 egg 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons finely chopped mixed candied orange and lemon bits 2 tablespoons finely chopped mixed candied orange and lemon bits<br> Ground cinnamon, for dusting<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, the semolina flour and salt. Use your fingers to work the butter into the dough until it forms pea-like balls. Alternatively, sift the dry ingredients into the food processor and pulse the butter into the mixture until it is blended and relatively smooth. Work the water in with your fingers (or in the mixer). Turn the dough out onto a flat surface and roll it into a ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap and press it down. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. In a medium saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer. Whisk in the semolina flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. If it forms lumps as it cooks, whisk until smooth. Transfer the milk and flour mixture to a bowl to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the ricotta, the egg, sugar. Add the candied orange and lemon bits and sift a dusting of cinnamon over the surface. Stir to blend. Taste for seasoning and refrigerate until ready to use. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide in half. Flour a flat surface and roll 1 of the halves into a rectangle about 14 inches by 24 inches. The shorter end of the rectangle should be close to you. The dough should feel very thin. The thinner the better! Brush the entire rectangle with a layer of the shortening. Sprinkle it with an even dusting of confectioners sugar. Gently and evenly roll it up into itself like a jelly sponge roll. Roll carefully, taking care that it rolls up very tightly. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Use a sharp knife to cut the roll into 1 to 1 1/2-inch thick pieces. Repeat the same process with the other half of the dough. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put 1 of the dough rounds in your hand and, with the other hand, press your thumb into the middle of your other hand (and, therefore, into the dough) and start to stretch the dough. You don t want to push so much that you make a cavity just yet. First, concentrate on making the dough round bigger and flatter. When it is about the size of a large clam shell, start to smooth and push down in the middle so it forms a cavity a lot like a large clam shell. You want to finish with a cone with an opening of about 3 inches and the smaller, tapered end about 1-inch. Brush a little shortening on the dough and turn it inside out, cupping the dough cone between the length of your index finger and thumb. Carefully spoon 2 large spoonfuls of the filling into the cone. The cone should be fairly filled and go to the edges of the opening with a thin layer of the filling. Close the mouth by carefully folding the cone opening over itself. The same as if you had 2 halves of a clam shell and were closing it up. Gently press the edges of the opening, together. Arrange on a nonstick baking sheet. Repeat with all of the dough, until both of the baking sheets are filled. Brush each with the egg wash. Put the trays in the center of the oven and bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow them to rest a few minutes on the baking sheet. After the Sfogliatella have rested for a few minutes, sprinkle them with another dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar and put each baking sheet squarely under the broiler. Do not walk away! Stay there and watch as the sugar slowly browns the top. If the layer of sugar was light and you want to make it a little browner, repeat with another dusting of sugar and another minute under the broiler. Allow them to rest a few minutes, then transfer them to a serving platter, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 41947,&quot;Mahi Mahi With Cauliflower 4 6-ounce skinless mahi mahi fillets (about 3/4 inch thick) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 head cauliflower, florets cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1/4 cup sliced almonds 1/4 cup golden raisins 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the fish until golden brown on one side, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, cooked-side up, and roast in the oven until just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower and cook, stirring, until golden brown and crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Add the almonds, raisins, coriander, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste; cook until the almonds are golden, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and parsley.

Coat the chicken pieces with the spices, place in some large resealable plastic bags and refrigerate overnight. In a small bowl, combine the honey and Sriracha. Stir well and refrigerate until ready to fry the chicken. In a large Dutch oven, put in enough lard to come 4 inches up the side of the pot. Heat the lard to 325 degrees F. In a large, shallow baking dish, whisk together the flour and a generous pinch or two of salt. Remove the chicken pieces from the bags and dredge in the flour mixture. Beginning with the thighs, add the chicken to the pot, making sure not to crowd. (This may take several batches.) Place the lid on and cook until golden and cooked 80 percent through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the chicken to a wire cooling rack and repeat with the remaining chicken, if necessary. (If you&#39;re entertaining, you can get ahead by doing all work up to this point, then continuing just before you plan to serve.) Once all the chicken is done, heat up the lard to 365 degrees F. Add the chicken in the same batches and cook until dark golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove onto paper towels and serve immediately with the Sriracha honey. Cook&#39;s Notes: Lard is available at better supermarkets at the meat counter, or at specialty butcher shops. If you can&#39;t find it, use vegetable or peanut oil.

Liberally coat the rib-eyes with the seasoning and set aside. Set up a smoker on the stove top by adding the wood chips and tea to the bottom of a foil-lined 4-inch hotel pan. Set another piece of foil over top. Set a 2-inch perforated pan over the top and cover with foil. Turn the heat to medium-high and allow the wood chips to smoke for 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, soak the broccoli rabe in water for 25 to 30 minutes. Uncover the pan, then add the rib-eyes. Turn off the heat, cover again with foil and smoke for 5 to 7 minutes. Flip the rib-eyes, cover with foil and let sit for 10 minutes. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the smoked rib-eyes on both sides with olive oil. Place on the grill pan and cook for 5 to 6 minutes for medium-rare, flipping halfway through. Remove from the grill and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Reserve the grill pan. Toss the mushrooms with 2 tablespoons olive oil, a pinch of red pepper flakes and salt. Lay the mushrooms cap-side down on the grill pan and cook until charred and soft, 5 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove from the grill, slice into strips and set aside. Reserve the grill pan. Drain the broccoli rabe and place on the grill pan. Cook until the water has steamed off and the broccoli rabe is charred. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and red pepper flakes and set aside. Place the onions and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan. Season with salt and sweat over medium-high heat until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the ginger and stir to combine. Add the balsamic vinegar, blackberry preserves, soy sauce and half of the blackberries. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.

Remove the neck and gizzard from the turkey and discard. Rinse the bird thoroughly with cold water and pat dry. Using your fingers, gently loosen the skin from the breasts and drumsticks and slip the sage leaves underneath. Rub the entire surface with 1/4 cup of the melted butter. Lightly sprinkle the skin and cavity with salt and pepper. Truss the turkey and place on a rack in a large roasting pan. Roast for about 45 minutes, until brown, basting with the remaining butter every 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 F and continue roasting for another 1 1/4 hours or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 180 degrees F. If the legs or breast brown too quickly, cover them with foil. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and allow it to rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving. To serve, cut down along each breast and remove it whole. Cut the breast into slices, the way you would a loaf of bread. Place on a large serving platter and arrange the thigh meat in chunks and the legs on top. Spoon some pomegranate sauce over the top and sprinkle everything with the pomegranate seeds and chives. Serve the remaining Pomegranate Sauce and the Wild Rice and Goat Cheese Stuffing alongside. You can reheat sliced turkey over medium heat in stock just to cover. Top with sauce, pomegranate seeds, and chives just before serving. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and sweat the onion and garlic until the onion is tender, about 3 minutes. Add the peppercorns and cook another 3 minutes. Add the port and cook, stirring, until most of it has evaporated. Add the stock, pomegranate juice, molasses and brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and reduce slowly to a sauce consistency. As the sugars caramelize, the sauce will turn brownish red. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and add chives and pomegranate seeds. Place the rice, water, and salt to taste in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer until the grains open all the way. Drain the rice. Meanwhile, cook the chorizo in a small saucepan over medium heat until the fat is rendered and the chorizo gets a little crisp. Drain. Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery and sweat until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, chorizo, bread, cheese, parsley, thyme, and stock and stir to combine. The mixture should be quite wet: add a little more stock or water, if needed. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Transfer to a 6-cup buttered baking dish and bake, uncovered, until golden brown and heated through, 25 to 30 minutes.

Mix all ingredients together by hand, then cover and allow to ferment overnight. Combine all other ingredients in the mixing bowl together except the yeast and the salt. Mix until completely hydrated. Then stop the mixing process for 20 to 30 minutes for \autolese. This is the period where the enzymes naturally found in the flour are brought to life by hydration and begin doing their work on the development of dough structure, without inoculating substantial fermentation (that&#39;s why we leave the yeast out). Then add the yeast and the salt to the mixture. Then mix the dough to the right consistency. When its done, place in a bowl or tub for 40 minutes. Fold. In 40 more minutes, remove from the tub and cut to 400 grams. Pre shape, then allow the dough 20 minutes to rest. Then shape the final shape (note -- extended to a long shape, classifying the bread as a baguette), place in a linen, and either allow to proof for another 2 hours or so in a warm environment and bake, or place in a retarder overnight. Then bake in the morning.

Season with salt and pepper. Add leftover spaghetti and combine well. In a large 10-inch non-stick skillet, heat extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add spaghetti and egg mixture, spreading evenly and pressing down in pan. Cook until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Carefully invert onto plate, add a little more oil to the pan, and slide mixure back into skillet and cook the other side for 6 minutes. Turn out onto serving platter and cut into wedges and serve warm. In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil. When water comes to a boil, add pasta, stirring constantly for the first minute to help prevent spaghetti from sticking together. Cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. In a large saute pan, heat oil. When almost smoking, add olives and red pepper flakes. Saute for 3 minutes over medium high heat. Reduce heat to low and carefully pour in tomato sauce and simmer for 10 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander, reserving 1/4 cup pasta water. Add pasta to the sauce and toss to coat completely. Add pasta water if you need to thin out the sauce a bit. Plate pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and basil. In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and bay leaves and simmer uncovered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors. Add 1/2 the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce. If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags. This will freeze up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 41995,&quot;Caribbean Stew Over Pierogies 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 large sweet green bell pepper, chopped (1-1/4 cups) 1 medium onion, chopped (3/4 cup) 1 medium sweet potato, peeled, cut in small cubes (1-1/2 cups) 1 (14.5-ounce) can ready-to-serve chicken broth (see Note) 1 teaspoon Caribbean jerk seasoning (see note) 1 (16.9-ounce) box frozen potato &amp; onion pierogies 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed, drained Instructions: Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.

Beat the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Gradually add the flour mixture and beat until combined, about 2 minutes. Divide the dough in half; pat each piece into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 1 hour. Roll out each dough disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper until 1/4 inch thick. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut the dough into shapes using a 4 1/2-inch gingerbread man cookie cutter and arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Reroll the scraps and cut out more cookies. (If the dough is too soft, freeze 10 minutes before cutting.) Refrigerate until firm, 15 minutes. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are set but still soft, 15 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes on the pans, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Make the icing: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and water in a bowl with a mixer on high speed until smooth and thick. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner. Pipe skulls and bones onto the cookies. Let set 30 minutes. To decorate the cookies, first make the outline of the skull, eyes, nose, mouth and bones. Then thin some icing with a little water and pipe into the outline of the skull; use a toothpick to help. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 42006,&quot;Boerewors and Tomato Bredie 3 pounds lean boneless beef sirloin or chuck, cubed 3 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cubed 4 teaspoons ground coriander seeds, 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1 pound pork fatback, finely chopped 1/2 cup red wine vinegar Sausage casing, optional Tomato Bredie, recipe follows 2 tablespoons canola or rice bran oil 2 large onions, thinly sliced 2 pounds ground pork 2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes 2 Idaho potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced 1 fresh green cl, such as jalapeno, chopped, or red cl flakes Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: One day ahead: In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, coriander, salt, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice.

Whisk the eggs, heavy cream, chives, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a bowl until fluffy. Generously coat the bottom and sides of an 8-inch-square or round cake pan with olive oil; add the egg mixture. Set in a roasting pan; add enough water to come 1/4 inch up the sides of the cake pan. Carefully transfer to the oven; bake until the eggs are set, 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches if needed, add the Canadian bacon and cook until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side; set aside. Cut the baked eggs into 4 equal pieces. Spread the rolls with the dijonnaise, then sandwich with the Peppadews, bacon, cheese and eggs. Place the sandwiches on a baking sheet and bake until the cheese melts, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the greens with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, the Peppadew brine and fried shallots; season with salt and pepper. Serve with the sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 42012,&quot;Deep Fried Cajun Turkey 1/2 cup kosher salt 3 tablespoons onion powder 3 tablespoons black pepper 3 tablespoons white pepper 2 tablespoons sweet basil 2 teaspoons ground bay leaves 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons file powder 3 tablespoons garlic powder 1 1/2 tablespoons paprika 1 (10 to 12 pound) whole turkey 4 to 5 gallons peanut oil (see note) Instructions: Preheat oil to 375 degrees F. Stir salt and seasonings together. Mix until well blended. Use 1/2 to 2/3 cup for a 10 to 12 pound turkey. May be stored for several months in an airtight covered jar. Remove the giblets and neck from the turkey. Rinse the turkey well with cold water and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Take care to dry both inside cavities. Place in a large pan and rub the interior and exterior of the bird with the seasoning mix. To allow for good oil circulation through the cavity, do not truss or tie legs together. Cut off the wing tips and plump little tail as they may get caught in the fryer basket. Cover pan and place in refrigerator overnight. Place the outdoor gas burner on a level dirt or grassy area. Never fry a turkey indoors, in a garage, or in any structure attached to a building. Do not fry on wood decks, which could catch fire, or concrete, which could be stained by the oil. (Safety tip: have a fire extinguisher nearby for added safety). Add oil to a 7 to 10 gallon pot with a basket or a rack. At medium-high setting, heat the oil to 375 degrees F.(depending on the amount of oil, outside temperature and wind conditions, this should take about 20 to 40 minutes). Meanwhile, place the turkey in a basket or on a rack, neck down. When the deep-fry thermometer reaches 375 degrees F. slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. The level of the oil will rise due to the frothing caused by the moisture from the turkey but will stabilize in about 1 minute. (Safety tip: to prevent burns from the splattering oil wear oven mitts/gloves, long sleeves, heavy shoes, and even glasses. It is wise to have 2 people lowering and raising the turkey). Immediately check the oil temperature and increase the flame so the oil temperature is maintained at 350 degrees F. If the temperature drops to 340 degrees F. or below, oil will begin to seep into turkey. Fry about 3 to 4 minutes per pound, or about 35 to 42 minutes for a 10 to 12 pound turkey. Stay with the cooker at all times, as the heat must be regulated. When cooked to 170 degrees F. in the breast or 180 degrees F. in the thigh, carefully remove the turkey for the hot oil. Allow the turkey to drain for a few minutes. (Safety tip: allow the oil to cool completely before storing or disposing). Remove turkey from the rack and place on a serving platter. Allow to rest for 20 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 42013,&quot;Red Pepper Spaetzle in Mustard Cream Sauce with Sausage 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil Coriander Spiced Sausage, recipe follows 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers 2 tablespoons goat cheese 4 tablespoons chicken stock 3 cups all-purpose flour 4 eggs 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley 1/2 cup cold water 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small shallot, minced 3 tablespoons white wine, or chicken stock 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons grated Gruyere 2 pounds pork shoulder (with a good amount of fat), cut into large chunks Pinch caraway seed Pinch ground coriander 2 tablespoons fresh oregano 2 tablespoons salt Ice cold water Oil Hog casing Instructions: For the sausage: In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned on each side, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water to the skillet. (You can add a little more if sausage is large.) Cover and cook until the water is nearly evaporated and the sausage is firm, 15 to 20 minutes. For the spaetzle: In a food processor, combine the roasted peppers, cheese, and chicken stock and puree until smooth. In a large saucepot over high heat, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. While the water is heating, in a bowl blend 1/2 cup red pepper puree, flour, eggs, parsley, 1/2 cup water, and salt. Stir until just well mixed. Do not over mix! Over mixing will result in a tough dough. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium. Squeeze or press the dough through a spaetzle maker or a large holed colander. This pressing needs to be completed in a quick manner, thus allowing the dough to cook evenly. Once the spaetzle has been dropped into the water, cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring throughout the cooking time. Once cooked, remove from the heat and drain through a colander to retrieve the spaetzle. Drain well. For the sauce: In a saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and shallots, cooking until shallots are a light brown, and then deglaze with the wine. Once deglazed, add the cream, thyme, Dijon, and salt and pepper, to taste. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook until the cream has thickened, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese. Toss the spaetzle in the sauce. Slice the sausage and serve alongside the spaetzle in cream sauce. Place the pork shoulder in a bowl and keep cold until ready to use. Fill a large bowl with ice and place the bowl of pork shoulder on top. Grind the pork shoulder once through a grinding disk with large holes and again through a disk with medium holes. Grind the meat into the bowl sitting on ice. Season the pork with caraway, ground coriander, fresh oregano, and salt. Mix to combine well. Cook a small amount of the meat mixture to test for seasoning. Add more spices and salt, if needed. Thoroughly mix in a splash of cold water. Allow the seasoned pork to chill on ice or in the fridge before stuffing into the casing. Replace the grinder attachment with the horn. (Be sure to thoroughly clean the attachment area before proceeding.) Rub oil onto the horn, and then put the casing on, leaving a few inches of slack at the end. Stuff the casing, tie off the ends, and prick the sausage with a pin or the tip of a knife. Refrigerate the sausage until ready to cook. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 42014,&quot;Garden Pasta with Lemon Ricotta Kosher salt 12 ounces gemelli pasta 2 cups sugar snap peas, trimmed and sliced into 1-inch pieces (about 8 ounces) 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, chopped Freshly ground pepper 6 radishes, sliced (about 1 cup) 1 small yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 1 ounce) 2/3 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs (such as parsley, chives and/or basil) 1 cup ricotta cheese 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs, adding the snap peas during the last 2 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain the pasta and peas. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper; cook until the garlic is softened, about 1 minute. Add the radishes and bell pepper; cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add half of the reserved pasta cooking water and cook until the vegetables are tender, 2 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the pasta and snap peas to the skillet along with the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, the parmesan and all but a few tablespoons of the herbs; toss to coat, adding enough of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen. Season with salt and pepper. Combine the ricotta, 1 tablespoon water, the lemon zest and a pinch of salt in a bowl.

Place the turkey on a flat surface and sprinkle inside and out with salt and pepper. Transfer the turkey to a large roasting pan and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh meat (without touching bone) registers 155 to 160 degrees F, 2 hours 55 minutes to 3 hours 15 minutes. Transfer the turkey to a flat surface and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before carving the meat. Meanwhile, place the neck and the chicken stock in a pot and simmer gently until the stock reduces by about half. Season with salt and pepper. For the stuffing: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with butter. Cut the reserved turkey heart and gizzard into small pieces and set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the celery and onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the contents to a bowl. Set aside. Arrange the bread slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until light brown. While the bread is hot, lightly butter both sides of each piece, then cut into 1-inch squares and transfer them to a large bowl. Toss with the thyme, rosemary, sage and some salt and pepper. Mix and set aside. (Turn the oven down to 350 degrees F.) Heat a tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet and quickly saute the heart and gizzard pieces, about 30 seconds.

Transfer to the greased baking dish and bake for 40 to 45 minutes. For the gravy: After removing the roasted turkey to rest, place the roasting pan over the burners of the stove over low heat and add the Marsala and mustard. Cook, scraping the bottom of the pan to get the drippings and tasty bits off, until there is almost no liquid. Strain the neck out from the stock and pour about 1/2 cup into a small bowl. Whisk the flour into the bowl, taking care there are no lumps. Add the remaining chicken stock and the flour mixture to the roasting pan and whisk to blend. Taste for seasoning. Reduce until the mixture thickens to the desired consistency. Carve the turkey and arrange on platters. Serve with the gravy on the side. (If the turkey is dry, ladle a little hot gravy directly on the meat.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 42037,&quot;Roasted Squash with Brown Butter and Cinnamon 3 pounds butternut squash (or other variety), washed, and peeled with a vegetable peeler 6 ounces unsalted butter 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 3 tablespoons molasses Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1 (1 to 2-inch) knob fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 fresh orange Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Cut the rabbits as follows: With a sharp cleaver, cut off the front portions (from right behind the front legs) of the rabbits and cut them in half through the backbones. Then cut the saddles from the hind legs; remove the bones but keep the saddles intact. Chop each hind leg into 2 pieces?the thighs and the drumsticks or lollipops. Remove the bones from the thighs; discard the bones. Reserve the livers and hearts. Place the front portions on a baking sheet and roast until golden brown, about 25 minutes. While they roast, bring the brown or white chicken stock to a simmer in a small stockpot over medium heat. Add the roasted rabbit pieces and continue to simmer. Reduce the oven heat to 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, puree the onion, fennel, celery, garlic and 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves in the food processor. Scrape the puree into a bowl. Coat a large Dutch oven with some of the olive oil and heat over medium heat. Season the rabbit lollipops with salt and brown on all sides. Transfer the lollipops to a plate. Add the pureed vegetables and cook, stirring frequently, until almost dry. Add the white wine and let it bubble away until reduced by half. Stir in the mustard. Return the rabbit lollipops to the pan and add enough simmering stock to cover by 2/3. Simmer about 10 minutes, add 2 full ladles of rabbit stock, simmer another 10 minutes, and add 2 more ladles of stock. Continue to cook the rabbit until tender, about 30 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Stir in the remaining heaping teaspoon of whole grain mustard. While the lollipops cook, cube the thigh meat. Put it in the bowl of a food processor with the hearts and livers, the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons rosemary, the Parmesan cheese and some salt. Pulse to combine. With the processor running, stream in the cream until the mixture is smooth. This is the forcemeat. Cut the caul fat so that you have 2 pieces a little bit larger than the saddles with the loins attached. Spread the pieces of caul fat on a cutting board and lay the prosciutto on top to cover. Put a saddle on each one. Scoop the forcemeat onto the saddles between the loins and roll everything up so that the caul fat encloses the whole bundle. Season with salt. Tie with butcher&#39;s twine in a few spots. Coat a medium skillet with some of the remaining olive oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add the loins seam-side down and brown them well on all sides. Leave the skillet over the heat. Transfer the loins to a small baking sheet and roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the center registers 160 degrees F, about 15 minutes. While the rabbit loins roast, ladle some rabbit stock into the pan you browned them in and scrape any brown bits with a wooden spoon; add the mixture to the pot of rabbit stock. For the ragu: Coat a medium skillet with olive oil and heat over medium heat. Add the spring onion, season with salt, and sweat them, stirring occasionally, until softened; you don?t want them to take on any color. Add the mushrooms and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the fava beans and rabbit stock and cook just to heat the beans through. To serve: Slice the loins into thick rounds. Spoon some Polenta and ragu into the centers of 4 dinner plates. Divide the rabbit legs and sliced loin over and around the vegetables, and serve immediately. Bring the milk, 2 cups water and bay leaf to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Season generously with salt, almost to the point of over-seasoning. How do you know that you are there? TASTE IT! When the liquid reaches a boil, slowly whisk in the polenta in small sprinkles. Once all of the polenta has been incorporated, reduce the heat to medium and immediately switch over to stirring with a wooden spoon.

(For a more free-form shape, divide the dough into six pieces and roll out.) Place the circles on a baking sheet lined with parchment or wax paper. Fill the lower half of each circle with about 1/4 cup of the cooked peaches. Fold the top half of the dough over the filling and crimp the edges securely with a fork. Refrigerate for 20 minutes before frying. Heat 2 1/2 inches of vegetable oil to 350 degrees in a heavy 4-quart saucepan. Fry pies 2 or 3 at a time until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a 200 degree oven until all the pies are fried. Serve immediately with ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42102,&quot;Cinnamon Bread 1/2 cup warm water (100 degrees F to 110 degrees F) 3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast 1 tablespoon plus a pinch of granulated sugar 1 1/2 cups bread flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled Cooking spray 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar Pinch of salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 3 to 5 tablespoons milk Instructions: Make the dough: Combine the warm water, yeast and a pinch of granulated sugar in a small bowl and let sit until foamy, 5 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the bread flour, remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and salt in a stand mixer. Add the yeast mixture and melted butter to the flour mixture. Knead with the dough hook on medium speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl coated with cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Lightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Punch down the dough and transfer to a work surface; knead a few times. Cut in half and gently shape into two 3-by-6-inch loaves (do not overwork the dough). Place the loaves 3 inches apart on the prepared pan. Lightly spray the loaves with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until puffy, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Make the topping: Whisk the granulated sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small baking dish. Whisk the melted butter and corn syrup in another small baking dish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Cut 4 deep slashes across the top of each loaf (the loaves will look deflated). Dip each loaf in the butter-corn syrup mixture, turning to coat, then coat with the cinnamon sugar, making sure to get the sugar in the crevices. Place the loaves in the prepared pans. Drizzle with any remaining butter mixture and sprinkle with any remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake until light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Lift the bread out of the loaf pans using the parchment overhang and transfer to a rack. Let cool in the paper, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, salt, melted butter and 3 tablespoons milk in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in up to 2 more tablespoons milk as needed to loosen. Drizzle on the warm loaves or serve on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 42103,&quot;Green Risotto 2 cups water 1 quart vegetable stock 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 1 tablespoon butter 1 medium onion, finely chopped 2 cups arborio rice 1/2 cup dry white wine or dry sherry 1 pound triple washed spinach, chopped 1 cup loosely packed basil leaves, chopped or torn 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, a couple of handfuls, chopped Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, grated or ground 1/2 to 2/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, 2 or 3 handfuls Instructions: Bring water and stock to a boil, then reduce heat to low to keep warm.

Use a paring knife to scrape the meat from to bottom toward the top of the bone to form a lollipop shape; make sure the bone is scraped completely clean. Make the brine: To a saucepan, add 1 1/2 cups water and the vinegar, honey, salt, soy sauce, peppercorns, pepper flakes, garlic, star anise, bay leaf and ginger. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Pour the brine into a large bowl and add 1 1/2 cups ice to cool it down quickly. Add the chicken lollipops to the brine, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Remove the chicken and pat dry. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare the dry rub: In a large bowl, combine the five-spice powder, garlic, ginger, mustard, paprika, salt and cayenne. Mix well to blend. Set aside 1 tablespoon of the rub for later use in sauce, then add the chicken and coat thoroughly with the rub. Arrange the chicken on a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the skin begins to turn golden. (This helps render some of the fat, so the drummettes fry up nice and crispy.) Remove from oven and set aside. While the drummettes are cooking, prepare the sauce: To a medium saute pan, add the sweet soy sauce, vinegar, fish sauce, honey, pepper flakes and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook until the sauce has reduced by a third or so, about 10 minutes. Stir in the reserved tablespoon of the dry rub and keep warm while you fry the wings. Fill a large, heavy pot with 2 to 3 inches of oil, and heat to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Working in batches, fry the chicken wings in the oil until brown and crispy, 6 to 7 minutes. With a spider or slotted spoon, remove the fried chicken to a large mixing bowl. Add the sauce to the chicken and toss to coat. Transfer the chicken lollipops to a serving platter and garnish with the red pepper, scallions, cilantro and sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42114,&quot;Big Island Tomato and Maui Onion Salad Freshly ground black pepper 6 cups mesclun greens 1 pint yellow tear-drop tomatoes, halved 1 pint red tear-drop tomatoes, halved 3 large tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 Maui onion, cut into 3/4-inch pieces Maui Onion Dressing, recipe follows Salt 1 large Maui onion 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 1/4 to 1/2 cup Salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a bowl, combine the tomatoes and Maui onion.

Add the egg whites and beat again until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Sift the flour into the mixing bowl and beat on low speed until just combined. Divide the mixture between four bowls. Tint the first bowl of paste with the juniper green food color; begin with 1/8 teaspoon, mixing and adding a little color at a time, until a dark green color is achieved. Tint the second bowl of paste with a dab (the amount picked up on the end of a toothpick) of juniper green food color and dabs of neon yellow food color. Mix until a light avocado color is achieved. Tint the third bowl with two dabs of neon yellow gel food color and mix until bright yellow is achieved. Tint the fourth bowl using the brown food color; begin with 1/8 teaspoon and add more until a dark brown color is achieved. Transfer each color to a piping bag with a small hole snipped in the end. You may also fit each bag with a small round decorator tip, if desired. Cut a sheet of parchment paper to fit inside a 15-by-10-inch jelly roll pan. Print the Avocado Emoji Template (link below) and trace the pattern onto the piece of parchment paper using a pencil. Flip the paper over so that the side with the drawn emojis is touching the pan. You should be able to see the images through the paper. Pipe a line of yellow paste around the face (oval part) of the avocado, then use the brown paste to fill in the round shape in the center (the avocado pit). Fill in the yellow outline using the light green paste. Finally, use the dark green to pipe the avocado shell-shape. Transfer the pan with the piped images to the freezer while you prepare the cake batter.<br> For the cake roll: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the eggs on high speed using the whip attachment until they lighten in color considerably and have the appearance of yellow cake batter, about 5 minutes. With the mixer still running, slowly add the granulated sugar and oil to the whipped eggs. Next, add the buttermilk and vanilla extract. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the liquid ingredients. Mix until well combined. Pour the batter into the prepared jelly roll pan and over the inlay paste emojis. Smooth the batter using a rubber spatula to distribute it evenly.<br> Lay a large cotton tea towel on a work surface. Sprinkle the towel with confectioners&#39; sugar and rub the sugar into the towel with your hands. Set aside. Bake until the cake springs back when pressed with fingers, 10 to 12 minutes (check at 10 minutes). Immediately turn the cake out onto the tea towel--do this without delay! Peel off the parchment to reveal the avocado design. Gently flip the cake over so that the avocados are against the tea towel. Immediately roll the cake into the tea towel, beginning at the narrow end. Roll as evenly as possible. Place the cake in the towel on a refrigerator shelf and chill for 1 hour. For the avocado frosting: Halve and pit the avocados. Using a spoon, scoop the avocado from the skins and place in the bowl of an electric mixer. Squeeze the juice from the lemon half into the bowl over the avocados. Mix on high speed until the avocados are creamed with just a few pea-sized solid pieces of avocado in the mixture. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar a little at a time until thick, spreadable frosting forms. For the cake assembly: Remove the cake from the refrigerator and gently unroll; allow the most tightly rolled end to remain slightly curled. Apply the avocado frosting to the cake in a smooth even layer using an offset spatula. Re-roll the cake and then roll it up in the tea towel. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Combine the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Heat, stirring, until the sugar is melted. Transfer to a small bowl and allow to cool to just warm. Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Brush the outside of the cake with the simple syrup using a pastry brush.

Gradually add the polenta, whisking as you pour. Keep whisking until the polenta starts to thicken and looks like it&#39;s one with the water, about 2 minutes. Turn the heat to low (the polenta should steam and tremble, but only rarely erupt with bubbles) and cook, stirring every now and again, until the polenta is tender but still coarse in texture, about 45 minutes.<br> Stir in the olive oil, kale puree, and most of the Parmesan and keep cooking, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes more. Take the pot off the heat and fold in 2 tablespoons of the mascarpone (it&#39;s nice to run into a little pocket of mascarpone, so don&#39;t stir too much). Top with the remaining mascarpone and Parmesan, and as much black pepper as you&#39;d like. Put 4 of the garlic cloves in a medium pot, fill it with water, cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add enough kosher salt so that the water tastes slightly salty and add the kale, prodding to submerge it. Cook uncovered until the kale is tender and tears easily, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> Fish out the boiled garlic cloves from the pot and reserve them. Drain the kale in a colander and when it&#39;s cool enough to handle, squeeze out as much water as you can. Roughly chop the kale, the boiled garlic, and the raw garlic.<br> Combine the kale, garlic, and Maldon salt in a food processor. Process, stopping occasionally to prod and stir, for about 45 seconds, then add the oil and process, stirring once or twice, to a fairly smooth puree.

Slice off the ridged part of the thick rib at the bottom each leaf, creating a level surface over the leaves. Place about 1/2 cup of the beef mixture in the bottom center of each roll. Roll the bottom of a leaf over the beef mixture, fold in the sides, and continue rolling forward until completely closed. Repeat with the remaining leafs. Arrange the rolls seam side-down in a 9-x 13- x 2- inch oval gratin dish. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Make the tomato sauce: In a medium saucepan, combine the tomatoes, broth, salt, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and season with pepper to taste. Pour over the cabbage rolls and cover the baking dish tightly with foil. Bake for 1 hour. Remove the foil from the baking dish and continue cooking, basting occasionally, until lightly browned and cooked through, about 30 minutes more. Serve in the gratin dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 42120,&quot;Homemade Donuts with Mexican Chocolate Sauce 1 cup whole milk 1/2 orange, zested 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 cup Mexican cocoa 1/2 cup light corn syrup 2 tablespoons bittersweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup sugar 1 teaspoon Chinese cassia cinnamon Donuts:<br> 1/2 cup water 1 tablespoon Mexican vanilla extract<br> 4 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup all-purpose flour Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 4 eggs Brown paper bag Instructions: In a medium saucepan, over low heat, bring the milk, orange zest and sugar to a low simmer.

Whisk together until the mixture is smooth and everything is well incorporated. Taste and adjust seasoning. For the whipped sorghum butter: Add the butter, molasses and salt to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or to a medium bowl if you&#39;re using a hand mixer or whisk. Mix on medium speed until well-combined and the butter is lightened and fluffy. For the catfish: Combine the catfish with salt and sugar in a bowl. Refrigerate. For the hush puppies: Combine cornmeal with sugar, salt, baking powder, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, black pepper and cayenne in a medium bowl. Whisk thoroughly to combine these dry ingredients. Whisk together the buttermilk and egg in a separate bowl until there are no specks of egg and it becomes a smooth and homogenous mixture. Retrieve the quick-cured catfish from the fridge, and add the catfish and diced onion to the dry ingredient mixture. Quickly stir together to coat the onion and catfish bits with cornmeal and spices. Add the buttermilk and egg and mix quickly with a spatula or wooden spoon until everything is well combined and the batter stiffens up pretty quickly as the cornmeal soaks up the buttermilk. Cover your batter and refrigerate for a few minutes while you prepare your pot for frying. Add vegetable oil to a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven no larger than 8 inches across\u2014it&#39;s necessary for deep frying to have at least 2 inches of oil. Heat the oil over medium heat, bringing it up to 350 degrees F, using a thermometer to check the temperature. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, you can tell that the oil is ready when you add a small pinch of flour and it immediately sizzles and fries. You can fry without a thermometer if you&#39;re feeling bold, but just be careful that your oil doesn&#39;t get too hot or cold\u2014you could either burn your hush puppies or end up with greasy ones\u2014and no one wants that!) Once the oil is up to 350 degrees F, pull your batter from the fridge and begin to scoop it into the hot oil. We like to use a 3/4-ounce cookie scoop, but you could also use two spoons to scoop and drop roughly tablespoon-sized dollops into the hot oil. Fry as many hush puppies as comfortably fit into the pot at once\u2014they should definitely have some room to expand and get crispy. It&#39;s okay to fry in several batches. Fry the hush puppies for 2 minutes, then turn them over and fry until golden brown and fluffy on the inside, another 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon or spider, moving them to a plate or tray lined with paper towels to help drain any excess oil. Sprinkle the hush puppies with a little salt while they&#39;re still hot. Repeat this process until all your hush puppies are cooked and seasoned. Pile the hushpuppies into a dish for serving and garnish with a nice sprinkle of the chives. Serve them nice and hot with 1 cup comeback sauce and 1/4 cup whipped sorghum butter, or your favorite sauces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42123,&quot;Asian Salad Chicken Soup 2 cups chicken, veal, fish or vegetable stock 2 cups water 2 tablespoons soy sauce 4 cups mushrooms, wiped clean, trimmed and thinly sliced 2 nickelsize slices of fresh ginger 1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons Oriental sesame oil 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 3 cups bean sprouts 4 scallions (green onions), thinly sliced 1 bunch of watercress, rinsed and stemmed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced into 2 inch cubes 2 tablespoons black or toasted white sesame seeds, optional Instructions: In a large saucepan, over high heat, bring the stock, water, soy sauce, mushrooms, ginger and red pepper flakes to a boil.

Cook the macaroni according to package instructions. If you are using fresh broccoli, blanch in hot salted water for 5 minutes, then drain. If you are using frozen broccoli, thaw and drain it. Add the broccoli to the macaroni. Set aside. Meanwhile, place the sun-dried tomatoes in a small bowl and add enough warm water to cover. Let stand until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain well, then chop into 1/4-inch pieces and set aside. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Add the green onions and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in the flour, cayenne, basil and salt. Add the milk and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened and bubbly. Add 3/4 cup of the Cheddar, then all of the Gruyere, and Gouda, a little at a time, stirring well after each addition, until the cheeses are melted. Stir in the macaroni-broccoli mixture and the softened sun-dried tomatoes. Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish and sprinkle the top of the casserole with the remaining 3/4 cup Cheddar.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar. When the sugar syrup reaches a boil, stop stirring and swirl the pan around over the heat so it doesn&#39;t burn. As the syrup reaches the caramel stage, the bubbles on top will become smaller, thicker, and closer together. Simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, until the caramel coats the back of the spoon. (If so inclined, stick a candy thermometer in the pot and cook until the syrup reaches the soft-crack stage, about 270 degrees F. When you drop a bit of this syrup into cold water, it will solidify into threads that, when removed, are hard yet bendable.) Remove the caramel from the heat and stir in the marshmallows. Fold the marshmallows into the hot caramel so they all melt into a gooey caramel sauce. The caramel will coat better if the popcorn is hot, so make it while boiling the sugar or pop it first then keep it warm. Put the popcorn in a big bowl and pour the caramel marshmallow mixture over the popcorn. Gently fold with a wooden spoon to coat each kernel. Grab handfuls of the popcorn and squeeze it together to form popcorn balls; make them about the size of a tennis ball. Put the popcorn balls on a sheet pan lined with waxed paper to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 42152,&quot;Beef Stroganoff 1 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin fillet Salt and pepper 3 tablespoons butter, divided 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups beef consomme, available on soup aisle 2 teaspoons prepared Dijon style mustard 1/4 cup sour cream, eyeball it 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan in a slow stream 1/2 small onion, sliced 1/3 cup coarsely chopped cornichons 1 pound extra wide egg noodles, cooked to package directions Chopped parsley leaves, garnish Thickly sliced pumpernickel bread, optional Instructions: Slice meat into 1/2-thick by 2 -nch long very thin strips and season with salt and pepper.

Carefully pour the sake into the pan away from you (it may ignite). Burn off some of the alcohol for about 30 seconds. Stir in the soy sauce, sugar, chicken powder, scallions and ginger and bring to the boil for about 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Turn off the heat and evenly divide between 2 tall, heatproof containers like liquid measuring cups. (One will be for quickly marinating and another will be for basting.) Set aside. For the yakitori: Skewer the heart halves on each of 20 skewers, alternating every 2 pieces of heart with a scallion piece. Put the skewers in one of tare basting sauces while you heat the grill. Load a konro grill with hot coals and heat until the coals burn white. Position the grate on top. Alternately, preheat a charcoal grill. Remove the skewers from the basting sauce and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook the skewers on one side until light brown and slightly crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn over and repeat until the scallions are soft and the hearts are medium, 3 to 5 minutes. Dunk the skewers into the unused tare basting sauce just until the hearts are fully dipped. Drain and place back on the grill for 1 minute on each side. The sauce will caramelize, and the hearts will crisp on the edges.

If it is too thick, add some water a couple tablespoons at a time until it is the consistency of heavy cream. Scrape into a bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. For the falafel: Using the same processor bowl, add the chickpeas and process until coarsely ground. Add the flour, parsley, cilantro, baking powder, cumin, cayenne, scallion, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and process until well mixed but not totally smooth. Check the consistency to make sure it will hold together. If it is too dry, add some water a little at a time. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Add about 2 inches of vegetable oil to a deep skillet and heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Using a small scoop or a tablespoon, scoop out small balls of the falafel mixture and gently drop them into the hot oil. Cook in batches, turning them over from time to time, until golden brown and cooked through, for between 30 and 60 seconds. Drain on paper towels while you cook the rest. To serve: Cut the top off each pita and form a pocket. Drizzle some sauce into each pita and add 4 or 5 falafel pieces. Top with the greens, carrots, scallions and plenty more sauce. Alternatively, build a salad with the vegetables, then top with falafel and sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache Blanc, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 42189,&quot;Poblano and Pepper Jack-Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Ancho cl Cream Sauce 2 small to medium fresh poblano peppers Two 8-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil Two 2 ounce slices pepper jack cheese 2 cups heavy cream 1 tablespoon Cajun spice, such as Paul Prudhomme&#39;s Blackened Redfish Magic Spice 1/2 tablespoon ancho cl powder Instructions: For the poblano and pepper jack-stuffed chicken breasts: Roast the poblano peppers over an open flame until completely charred, transfer to a plastic bag and seal for 10 minutes. Peel the charred skin, remove all the seeds and cut each pepper in half.<br> Meanwhile, put chicken breasts on a cutting board and pound with a meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the oil, heat, then add the chicken and cook until the first side is golden-brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until the second side is golden-brown, another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until just cooked through, about 8 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, make the ancho cl cream sauce: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan and cook until reduced by 1/3. Add the Cajun spice and ancho cl powder and simmer for another minute or so. Keep warm.<br> When the chicken is done, cut each piece into 2 equal halves.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the butter, granulated sugar, salt and 3/4 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as it boils, take off the heat and add the flour. Mix vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixtures comes together and pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed until slightly cooled. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. After adding the last egg, beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Use a 1 1/2-inch cookie scoop to place rounds about 1/2 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake the cream puffs for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and continue to bake until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely, then use a serrated knife to cut the puffs in half. For the filling: Beat the cream, mascarpone and confectioners&#39; sugar with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until it just holds stiff peaks, then gently fold in the jam. When ready to serve, use a large spoon to dollop the cream on the bottom half of the puffs and add 1 raspberry to each. Then top with the other half of the puff. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 42191,&quot;Mocha Chocolate Icebox Cake 2 cups cold heavy cream 12 ounces Italian mascarpone cheese 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, such as Pernigotti 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 (8-ounce) packages chocolate chip cookies, such as Tate&#39;s Bake Shop Shaved semisweet chocolate, for garnish Instructions: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the heavy cream, mascarpone, sugar, coffee liqueur, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and vanilla. Mix on low speed to combine and then slowly raise the speed, until it forms firm peaks. To assemble the cake, arrange chocolate chip cookies flat in an 8-inch springform pan, covering the bottom as much as possible. (I break some cookies to fill in the spaces.) Spread a fifth of the mocha whipped cream evenly over the cookies. Place another layer of cookies on top, lying flat and touching, followed by another fifth of the cream. Continue layering cookies and cream until there are 5 layers of each, ending with a layer of cream. Smooth the top, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. Run a small sharp knife around the outside of the cake and remove the sides of the pan. Sprinkle the top with the chocolate, cut in wedges, and serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 42192,&quot;Swedish Pancakes with Cherry Cream Cheese and Chocolate-Banana Fillings 2 cups milk 2 large eggs 4 tablespoons unsalted melted butter, divided 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar 1 pinch kosher salt 1 (15-ounce) can cherry pie filling, divided 1 (8-ounce) container whipped cream cheese 2 bananas, sliced 1/2 cup chocolate and hazelnut spread (recommended: Nutella) Powdered sugar, for garnish Instructions: For the batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, 2 tablespoons melted butter and vanilla. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. Combine the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, whisking out any lumps. Let the batter rest for a few minutes while you prepare the fillings. (Batter can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours, but it may need to be thinned a bit.) For the fillings: Mix together 1 cup cherry pie filling and the cream cheese; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Put the remaining cherry pie filling into a serving bowl. When ready to serve, slice the bananas and put them into a bowl; put the chocolate spread into another bowl. For the pancakes: Grease the pan with a bit of the melted butter. Pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter into the pan, swirling the pan to coat it evenly. When the top looks dry and bubbles and the edges are lightly browned, 45 seconds to 1 minute, flip the pancake over and cook for an additional 15 to 20 seconds. (The first pancake may not turn out perfect so don&#39;t worry if it does not work, eat it as a snack.) Place the pancake onto a plate and continue cooking the remaining batter in the 1/4 cup increments, brushing the pan with melted butter as needed. Stack the pancakes on top of each other and set aside covered with foil until ready to serve. (Pancakes can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Pancakes can be placed between layers of wax paper, wrapped in plastic and frozen for up to a month. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.) To serve: Put the pancakes out along with the bowls of fillings. Fill a pancake with a dollop of 1 of the fillings fold it in half and roll it up like a cigar. Garnish with a dollop of the remaining cherry pie filling or sprinkle with a bit of the powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 42193,&quot;Chocolate-Pretzel Cereal Treats 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for buttering the pan One 10-ounce bag mini marshmallows 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Kosher salt 8 cups puffed chocolate cereal, such as Cocoa Puffs 2 cups crushed pretzels 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 teaspoon coconut oil Instructions: Line a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil leaving a 2-inch overhang on the two short ends. Lightly coat the foil with butter. Melt the butter in a large pot set over medium heat. Add the marshmallows and cook, stirring occasionally, until the marshmallows melt, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla and a pinch of salt and then the cereal and pretzels until well mixed. Transfer to the prepared baking dish and press into an even layer. Set aside at room temperature until cooled and firm, about 30 minutes. Melt the chocolate and coconut oil together in a small microwave safe bowl for 30-second increments in the microwave, stirring, until smooth.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Fit a large pastry bag with a 1/2 -inch round tip. Combine the butter, granulated sugar, salt and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat; sift the flour into the saucepan and stir with a wooden spoon to make a paste. Return to medium heat and stir until the dough pulls away from the side of the pan and is slightly shiny, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until slightly cooled, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the whole eggs, one at a time, beating until smooth before adding the next. Transfer the dough to the pastry bag. Pipe 1-inch mounds of dough 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Smooth the tops with a damp fingertip. Beat the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water; brush on the dough mounds. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking until the puffs are golden brown and crisp, about 25 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, beat the heavy cream and the confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with a mixer until soft peaks form; refrigerate until ready to assemble. Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until melted. Cut the puffs in half crosswise with a serrated knife; sandwich with the sliced bananas, dulce de leche and whipped cream.

Add the parsley, lemon juice, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and season with salt and pepper; mix well to coat all the ingredients. Slice the rolls horizontally. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil on each of the cut sides. On the 4 bottoms place about 1/2 cup of the chopped salad and spread it out evenly. Put the tops on and gently press each sandwich to flatten it slightly; drizzle lightly with olive oil. Place each sandwich on a preheated panini press and grill until the bread is toasted and the cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes. Alternately, preheat a dry cast iron or non-stick pan. Place the sandwich in the pan and weight it down with another pan or a clean brick wrapped in foil. Grill 5 minutes, turn the sandwich over, re-weight it, and grill for another 5 minutes.

Refrigerate until needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 42197,&quot;Pizza Dough 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey 1 cup warm water, 105 to 115 degrees 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing Toppings of your choice Instructions: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball.) Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough. Lightly brush the inner circle of the dough with oil and arrange the topping of your choice over the inner circle. Using a lightly floured baker&#39;s peel or a rimless flat baking tray, slide the pizza onto the baking stone and bake until the pizza crust is nicely browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven. Transfer the pizza to a firm surface and cut into slices with a pizza cutter or very sharp knife. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 42198,&quot;Roasted Salmon Tacos 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons honey<br> 1 teaspoon lime zest plus 2 tablespoons lime juice<br> Kosher salt<br> Dash hot sauce<br> 1/2 small red onion, very thinly sliced<br> 4 radishes, very thinly sliced<br> 1/2 medium head red cabbage, finely shredded (about 7 cups)<br> 1/2 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped<br> 2 ripe avocados, halved and pitted 1 cup sour cream<br> 2 tablespoons chopped pickled jalapenos<br> Zest of 1 lime and juice of 1/2<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 pounds skinless center-cut salmon fillet 1 tablespoon chili powder<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Flour Tortillas, recipe follows, kept warm 2 cups (254 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 1/4 cup shortening or neutral oil<br> Instructions: For the red cabbage slaw: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Whisk together the olive oil, honey, lime zest and juice in a large serving bowl. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and the hot sauce. Add the red onion, radishes, cabbage and cilantro and toss well. For the avocado sour cream: Scoop the avocado flesh into the carafe of a blender. Add the sour cream, pickled jalapenos, lime zest, juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add 1 tablespoon water and blend until smooth. (If the mixture is too thick to blend, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water and blend again). Transfer to a serving bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve. For the salmon: Sprinkle the salmon all over with the chili powder and 1 teaspoon salt and rub it in. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the salmon top-side down and sear until browned, about 1 minute. Flip the salmon and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast until the salmon is just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness. To serve, break the salmon into chunks. Serve in Tortillas with the slaw and sour cream. Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a medium bowl. Add the shortening or oil and mix until mealy. Stir in 3/4 cup water to form a dough. Turn it out onto a surface and knead, adding more flour if needed, until a smooth, slightly sticky dough is formed, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a towel and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. (Full disclosure: When we&#39;re hungry, we skip this step. But letting the dough rest does make it easier to roll these out.) Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts and roll them out on a lightly-floured surface until they&#39;re really thin, keeping the remaining dough balls covered. I like a 1/16- or 1/8-inch thickness but wouldn&#39;t turn down a 3/16-inch-thick one. Cook them in the skillet on both sides until they&#39;re just starting to show some brown spots, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Keep warm in a towel until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42199,&quot;Pork Ragu Over Penne 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 (4-pound) bone-in pork butt shoulder roast Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 stalks celery, chopped 2 carrots, chopped 1 medium onion, chopped 2 (15-ounce) cans diced tomatoes 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1/2 (6-ounce) can tomato paste 1 (16-ounce) package penne 3 fresh basil leaves, for garnish 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, for garnish Instructions: Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the pork with salt and pepper and brown it on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. While the pork is browning, add the celery, carrots, and onion to the bowl of a slow cooker. Put the pork on top of the vegetables and add the tomatoes and garlic. Place into the slow cooker and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours. Remove the pork to a cutting board or sheet pan. Pour the vegetables and liquid from the slow cooker bowl into a saute pan over medium heat, and mash with a fork. Add the tomato paste to the pan sauce and stir to incorporate. Shred the pork, add it to the vegetables, and let this simmer, uncovered, while you cook the pasta (save 2 cups of the ragu for the Round 2 Recipe Lasagna Roll Ups). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the penne, stir, and cover the pot. When it returns to a boil, remove the cover and stir it again. Cook until the pasta is al dente, about 8 minutes.

Fill a medium saucepan with a couple inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. (Alternatively, use a double boiler.) Turn off the heat, set the bowl of chocolate over the water to melt and stir until smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the cookie crumbs, peanut butter and butter. Reserve 1/2 cup of the mixture and set aside. Form twenty 1/2-inch balls with the remaining crunch. Press your thumg into the center of each ball to make a hollow center. With the reserved 1/2 cup crunch, sculpt thin spider legs and twenty 1/2-inch round discs to use as the bottoms. Set aside at room temperature until you are ready to assemble the spiders. For the chocolate ganache: Place the dark chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a boil and pour over the dark chocolate. Let stand without stirring for a couple of minutes in order to let some of the chocolate melt. Stir in the butter, corn syrup and rum. Mix until smooth. Let sit at room temperature until you are ready to assemble the spiders. For the strawberry jelly: Mix 1 tablespoon of sugar with the pectin in a small bowl and set aside. Bring the strawberry puree to a boil in a small saucepan and slowly stir in the pectin sugar. Bring this mixture back to a low boil and add the corn syrup, lemon juice and remaining 2/3 cup sugar. Boil for approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the jelly to a small stainless mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap to let cool. To assemble: Place the milk chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Fill a large saucepan with a couple inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off the heat, set the bowl over the water to melt and stir the chocolate until smooth. Transfer the strawberry jelly and chocolate ganache to two separate pastry bags and snip the ends off. Fill each hollow crunch ball with equal parts jelly and ganache and cover with the bottom pieces of crunch to form the spider bodies. Refrigerate for about 20 minutes. Lay a sheet of parchment paper over a flat surface. Arrange the spider legs on the parchment, dip the bodies in the melted chocolate with the rounded side facing up. Attach the spider body to the arranged legs. Dust with cocoa powder, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42206,&quot;Rotisserie Lamb Tacos with Apricot-Chipotle Baste 1/4 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 boneless leg of lamb, about 7 pounds Apricot-Chipotle Baste, recipe follows 1 pound goat cheese, crumbled 1/2 pound shredded romaine lettuce Salsa Cruda, recipe follows 16 (6-inch) flour tortillas Charred corn guacamole, recipe follows 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 large red onion, coarsely chopped<br> 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped<br> 4 cups red wine vinegar<br> 3 cups sugar<br> 1/2 pound dried apricots, soaked for 1/2 hour in warm water and chopped<br> 6 large tomatoes, diced 1/2 large red onion, diced<br> 3 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1 jalapeno, diced<br> 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, chopped (recommended: Mexican oregano)<br> 1/4 cup cilantro leaves, chopped<br> 1 lime, juiced<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup olive oil 2 ears corn 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> Salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced<br> 1 serrano cl, finely chopped<br> 1 red onion finely diced<br> 1 lime, juiced<br> 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves<br> Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat grill to medium-high.

Place all 8 pieces of chicken in a large heavy pot with 8 cups boiling water. Add the garlic, onion and salt. Bring to a boil again. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for about 1 hour. Remove the chicken and set aside. Maintain a medium heat under the broth as you&#39;ll use it again for this recipe. For the roasted vegetables: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the tomatoes, onion and garlic onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and roast until the skins are blistered and the vegetables softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool. Once cooled, remove the foil and peel the garlic and the skins off the tomatoes.<br> For the mole: In a large heavy saute pan heat 1 cup lard. Quick fry the chiles in the hot lard, being careful not to burn them or they&#39;ll become bitter. Add the chiles into the pot of chicken broth and simmer for 10 minutes. In the meantime, add 2 tablespoons lard to the saute pan and fry the roasted onions and garlic. Add the tortilla and bolillo and cook for 5 minutes. Add the peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, blanched almonds, raisins, oregano, cumin, thyme, coriander seeds, whole black peppercorns and cinnamon stick. Saute for 4 minutes and remove from the heat. Cool slightly. Remove the cinnamon stick and discard.<br> Working in two batches, transfer half of the cooled nut and seed mixture into a large-capacity blender. Then transfer half of the simmered chiles, without the broth, into the blender. Add half of the roasted tomatoes and fresh tomatillos. Allow to cool before blending. Process until smooth. A paste will form. If the mixture is too dry, add 1 cup of reserved chicken broth at a time. Strain the mixture into a large mixing bowl. Then repeat with the remaining ingredients, processing until smooth and then strain.<br> Clean the saute pan and place over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons lard. Pour in the strained mole sauce and cook for 2 minutes. Season with the salt, some pepper and the sugar. Add 1 1/2 cups of the reserved chicken broth and stir to combine. Add the Mexican chocolate and stir to melt. Simmer for 15 minutes, uncovered. Return the chicken to the saucepan with the mole and cook until the chicken is warmed through, an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large serving bowl or platter. Sprinkle with some sesame seeds and a couple pinches of sugar if desired. Drizzle the Mexican crema over the chicken mole and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 42227,&quot;Best Cinnamon Toast 1/2 cup (100 g) sugar 3 cinnamon sticks Four 3/4-inch (2 cm) thick slices Pullman loaf or whole wheat bread 8 tablespoons (115 g) unsalted butter, softened 3 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Confectioners&#39; (icing) sugar (optional) Instructions:</p><ol><li>Make the cinnamon syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, cinnamon sticks, and 1/2 cup (120 ml) water and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring often to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the cinnamon is very fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool (the syrup can be refrigerated for up to 3 weeks).</li><li>Make the toast: Using 3-4 tablespoons of the butter, coat both sides of each piece of bread. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet (frying pan) over medium heat. Place the bread in the skillet and set a large heat-safe plate or cake pan on top of the bread--it should fit inside the skillet. If the plate isn&#39;t very heavy, weigh it down with a few cans of beans or tomatoes. Cook until the bread is golden brown, 2-3 minutes (weighting the bread helps the entire surface area of the crumb come into contact with the hot fat and the hot pan, ensuring a nice even golden-brown toast). Remove the weights and the plate and flip the bread over, then continue to brown the second side, about 1 1/2-2 minutes longer. Brush a generous amount of cinnamon syrup over one side of each slice (add enough syrup to saturate the bread without making it soggy).</li><li>In a small bowl, mix the sugar with the cinnamon until combined, then transfer all but 2 teaspoons of it to a plate. Dip each piece of toast, syrup side down, in the cinnamon sugar.</li><li>In a large skillet (frying pan), melt the remaining 2-3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and place the toast, sugared side down, in the skillet. Set a large heat-safe plate on top of the toast to press it down (place one or two cans of beans on top to weight it down). Cook until the edges of the bread are caramelized and the sugar is completely melted and glistening across the surface of the bread, 3-4 minutes.</li><li>Serve each slice of toast caramelized side up and sprinkled with some of the reserved cinnamon sugar and, if desired, confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42228,&quot;NutriBullet?

Take it out of the bowl and place on a floured surface. Knead by hand for 2 to 3 minutes and place back in bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes before using. Divide into 2 balls of dough. Mix together ground chicken and onion in a bowl and add some salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour on a pelmeni mold and roll out first ball of dough to fit the mold. Drape on top of the mold and press lightly. Fill the holes with the chicken mixture. Roll out the second ball and drape on top. Trim the edges. With a large rolling pin, start rolling gently at first and then more firmly until the shape cuts through. Turn the mold around and tap out the pelmenis. For the soup: Add the stock, tomatoes, mushrooms and half the dill to a small pot and bring to a boil. Add the pelmenis and let boil until they float on top, 5 to 7 minutes. Divide soup among 4 bowls and add dollops of sour cream and the rest of the dill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 42230,&quot;Egg and Bacon Salad 4 eggs 1 head escarole or frisee or other bitter leaves of choice 1 teaspoon garlic oil 7 ounces (3/4 cup) smoked lardoons, or about 14 slices smoked bacon, cut into chunks 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 4 teaspoons cider vinegar Dash Worcestershire sauce Small bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves chopped Instructions: Put the eggs into a saucepan of water, over medium heat. Bring to boil, and cook for 1 minute, then turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water and let cool. Peel the eggs once they feel cool to the touch. Cook&#39;s Note: I cook my eggs this way, as I love the yolks to be only just or rather almost hard-boiled, with the memory of oozy goldenness still evident at the centre; it also keeps the white amazingly silky. If, however you prefer a proper, good and bouncy reassuringly hard-boiled egg, cooked until the yolks are powdery and compact, keep the heat on under the pan for 10 minutes. The same applies, if you&#39;re making this for anyone with a compromised immune system, such as the old and frail, very young or pregnant women. Meanwhile, tear the salad leaves into bite-sized pieces and drop them into a serving bowl. Heat the garlic oil in a small frying pan, over medium heat and fry the lardons or bacon until crisp, about 5 minutes or so. Transfer the lardons or bacon with a slotted spatula to some paper towels to drain, while you make the dressing. Add the Dijon mustard to the bacon juices in the pan and whisk to combine, then add the vinegar and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Whisk again, then pour it over the salad leaves, tossing to mix. Add the lardons and toss again, then quarter the eggs and add them along with the chopped parsley. Gently mix to combine, trying not to break up the eggs. Make Ahead Note: The hard-boiled eggs can be made up 4 days ahead. Cool, leave the shells and store in an air tight container in the refrigerator. Remove the shells just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 42231,&quot;Shirred Eggs 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 8 large whole eggs 1-ounce black truffle, thinly sliced 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.

Rub the pork chops with the cumin, 3/4 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper; add to the slow cooker. Drizzle with the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil, squeeze in the juice of 1 orange and add the squeezed orange halves. Cover and cook on low until the pork is very tender, 7 to 8 hours. Cook the rice as the label directs, sprinkling the peas on top of the rice during the last 3 minutes of cooking. Remove the pork chops to a bowl; discard the bones and orange halves and shred the meat with 2 forks. Stir the vinegar and the juice of 1/2 orange into the slow cooker. Season with salt and pepper; add the juice from the remaining 1/2 orange to taste. Return the pork to the slow cooker. Fluff the rice with a fork, stirring in the peas.

Remove from the heat and let stand for a few hours until pliable. Place the toasted anchos in a bowl and cover them with the vinegar and warm water. Soak for about 20 minutes, then pour the mixture into a blender. Add the cumin seeds, oregano, thyme, salt, garlic, and vinegar. Blend to a smooth paste. Cut the fish into 3 by 1 inch batons and place in a ceramic or glass bowl. Add 6 tablespoons of the cl paste and mix together gently but thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.<br> Separate out 18 of the largest and most pliable husks, at least 6 inches across on the wider end and 6 to 7 inches long. If you cant find enough good ones, overlap some of the larger ones to give a wide and strong unbroken surface to spread the dough on. Pat the leaves dry with a towel. Make ties for the tamales by cutting a few of the husks into strips. Divide the marinated fish into 6 equal portions. Spread 1 teaspoon of the reserved cl paste over a 2 by 3 inch area on the wide end of a husk. Lay half of one portion of fish over the paste. Sprinkle with a little salt and top with the remaining half portion of fish. Fold over the sides and then the ends to enclose the filling. Lay the finished package flap side down, repeat the operation to double wrap the fish and tie it twice around its width with the cornhusk strips. Continue to form the other 5 packages in the same way.<br> About 20 minutes before serving, heat a large griddle or a grill to medium high heat. Grill the packages for about 6 minutes on each side, until the husks have blackened. Open one of the packages to test for doneness, taking care not to let out any of the precious juices. Remove the strings from each package and carefully pull away the outer layers of husk. Set each package on a heated dinner plate and carefully remove the last husk, pushing the fish out onto the plate. Drizzle a little olive oil over the fish and scatter with a little onion and chopped cilantro. Serve the lime wedges on the side. Pass the warm corn tortillas, mashed avocado, diced cucumber, and chiles at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Noir, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 42237,&quot;Parmesan and Thyme Crackers 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 3 ounces grated Parmesan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix until creamy.

Add the pheasant breasts, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. To make sauces: In a large, non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium to medium-high heat. Add the shallots cooking until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla bean and seeds, white wine, cider, and cream. Bring to a simmer cooking until the liquids are reduced and thickened to sauce consistency, about 10 minutes. Add the ginger. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. In another saucepan, combine the red wine and the honey. Bring to a simmer over high heat cooking until reduced to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Reserve. To cook the pheasants: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large non-stick ovenproof skillet, add 2 tablespoons butter and melt over high heat. Season the pheasant with salt, pepper, and coriander. Add the pheasant skin side down, cooking until browned and well-seared, about 5 minutes. Turn over and transfer the pan to the lower rack of the oven. Cook until just about medium, about 6 to 8 minutes depending on the size of the pheasant breast. Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven. Allow to rest a couple of minutes before cutting. In another large, non-stick, skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the butter over high heat. Add the Anjou pears cooking until they just begin to soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Add two tablespoons of the sugar cooking while occasionally stirring until browned on the edges, about 4 minutes. Remove the pears and keep warm. To Serve: Position the rice pilaf mixture in a cylinder form in the center of each hot serving plate. Position the pear slices around the rice cylinder. Slice the pheasant on a bias to yield 4 or 6 thin broad slices. Stack the slices on top of the rice cylinder. Spoon the vanilla-ginger and red wine sauce artistically over and around the pheasant and on the plate. Sprinkle the dish with freshly ground black pepper and chives. Garnish with the vanilla bean and sprigs of chive over the pheasant. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42249,&quot;Cream Cheese Wontons 3 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon Sriracha or other hot sauce<br> 1 teaspoon vinegar or rice wine vinegar<br> 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil<br> 8 ounces cream cheese 1 tablespoon Sriracha or other hot sauce (more to taste)<br> 2 green onions, light green and dark green parts, chopped<br> 1 egg<br> 24 wonton wrappers<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> Instructions: For the dipping sauce: Mix together the honey, soy sauce, Sriracha, vinegar and sesame oil in a small bowl and set aside. For the wontons: In the bowl of a mixer (or you can do it by hand), mix together the cream cheese, Sriracha and green onions until totally combined (scrape the mixer bowl if necessary). In a separate bowl, mix together the egg and 1/2 cup water. One at a time, assemble the wontons: Place approximately 1/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture on one corner of a wonton wrapper. Use your finger to \paint\ the egg wash all around the edges of the wrapper. Roll the wrapper on a diagonal, starting with the cream cheese corner and stopping when half the wrapper is rolled and the cream cheese mixture is inside. Bring up the 2 ends and use the egg wash to stick them together. Allow the remaining pointed end to naturally tuck backward. (The wontons should resemble tortellini.) As you work, place the assembled wontons under plastic wrap or a light towel to keep them from drying out. Heat 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil in a large saucepan or medium skillet until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers just under 350 degrees F. (You don&#39;t want the oil too hot or it will burn the wontons! Experiment with a spare sheet of wonton wrappers to check.) In batches of 4 or 5 at a time, fry the wontons for 45 seconds to 1 minute, flipping carefully midway through to make sure they brown evenly. Remove them when you think they still could stand to slightly brown a teeny bit more (because they will slightly brown in the seconds after you remove them from the pan!). Drain the wontons on a paper towel. Repeat with the remaining batches. It&#39;s best to wait 5 to 10 minutes before serving the wontons, as the cream cheese filling can be quite hot. Serve with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42250,&quot;White Soda Bread or Scones with Herbs 1 recipe White Soda Bread dough, recipe follows 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs, e.g. rosemary or sage, thyme, chives, parsley 1 pound white unbleached flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 12 to 14 ounces buttermilk Instructions: Add fresh herbs to dry ingredients of white soda bread dough and proceed making dough as above. Shape into loaf or scones and bake as for soda bread. If making scones bake for 20 minutes in a 450 degree oven. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a mixing bowl sift together 1 pound flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. Make a well in the center. Pour most of the milk into the well. Using one hand, mix in the flour from sides of the bowl, adding more milk if necessary. The dough should be softish, not too wet and sticky. When it all comes together, turn the dough onto a well-floured counter. Wash and dry hands. Knead lightly for 1 second, just to tidy it up, flip over. Pat dough into a round about 11/2 inches deep and cut a cross into dough over the sides of the bread to let the fairies out. Bake in preheated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn down the oven to 400 degrees for another 30 minutes or until cooked. If in doubt, tap the bottom of the bread, it should sound hollow. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42251,&quot;Grilled Turkey, Brie, and Apple Butter Sandwich with Arugula 8 slices stone-milled rye artisan bread, about 1/2-inch thick 5 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup store-bought apple butter 1 pound sliced fresh roasted deli turkey 1/2 pound brie cheese, thickly sliced 1 bunch arugula, stems trimmed Instructions: Spread each of 4 slices of bread with 1/2 tablespoon of butter. Now spread each with 1 tablespoon of the apple butter. Top each slice of bread with a couple of slices of turkey, cover that with 2 to 3 slices of brie (enough to cover the turkey), and finally, arrange 2 to 3 arugula leaves on top. Spread the remaining 4 bread slices with 1/2 tablespoon of butter and lay them, buttered sides down, over the cheese; press gently. Heat a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and let it melt to evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Add as many sandwiches as will comfortably fit (either 2 or 4) and cook 2 to 3 minutes until the bread is golden brown and the cheese begins to melt. Flip and cook 2 to 3 more minutes to brown the bread. (Add another tablespoon of butter and cook the remaining sandwiches, if you need to.) Cut the sandwiches in half and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 42252,&quot;Turmeric Roasted Chickpea and Lentil Salad One 15.5-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 teaspoon canola oil<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon turmeric<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 2 cups low-sodium chicken stock<br> 1/2 pound dried brown lentils<br> 1 small yellow onion, halved<br> 1 clove garlic, smashed<br> 1 small bay leaf<br> 1 lemon, halved 1/4 cup chopped roasted red bell peppers<br> 2 tablespoons chopped flat leaf parsley<br> Instructions: Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F.

The first way, on the stovetop, is my favorite because it yields a much smokier-flavored babaganoush. For the stovetop method: Turn 2 burners up full-throttle. Place 1 eggplant on each burner and, using a pair of tongs, turn every 5 minutes or so, until the entire surface of eggplant is charred and crispy, about 15 minutes. Don&#39;t worry if the eggplant deflates a little. Remove from the burner and place on a plate to cool. For the oven method: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Prick the eggplants all over with a fork (this keeps the eggplant from exploding in the oven, so don&#39;t skip this step). Place on a baking sheet and roast until softened, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Regardless of the cooking method you choose, once the eggplant is cool enough to touch with your hands, carefully peel the charred skin off the eggplant. Discard the skin. Move the flesh onto your chopping board, slice off the stem and discard. Using your knife, mince the flesh until almost smooth. Scoop into a bowl. Add the lemon juice, tahini, parsley, and a little salt and pepper. Whisk together and taste for seasoning. Feel free to add more lemon juice, more salt and pepper... it will vary depending on the size of your eggplant, and how you like your &#39;ganoush! Serve with pita chips. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Petite Syrah, Grenache Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 42256,&quot;Chocolate Cinnamon Caramel Ice Cream with White and Dark Chocolate Chips 10 cups chocolate ice cream base* 1 teaspoon cinnamon, or more if stronger flavor is desired 4.25 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 4.25 ounces white chocolate chips 10 1/2 ounces caramel sauce Instructions: Put the ice cream base in a 1-gallon container.

Whisk together the melted butter, buttermilk, oil, vanilla extract, vanilla seeds and egg yolks in a medium bowl. In a clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites at medium-high speed until foamy, about 30 seconds. With the machine running, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Continue to beat until stiff peaks just form, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer to a separate bowl and set aside. Wash the bowl and dry. Add the flour mixture to the now-empty mixing bowl. With the mixer running at low speed with the whisk attachment, gradually pour in the butter mixture and mix until almost incorporated (a few streaks of dry flour will remain), about 15 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape the whisk and sides of the bowl. Return the mixer to medium-low speed and beat until smooth and fully incorporated, 10 to 15 seconds. Using a rubber spatula, stir one-third of the whites into the batter to lighten. Then add the remaining whites and gently fold into the batter until no white streaks remain.

Cook the chorizo slices in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat until some of the fat has rendered and the chorizo is crisped, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Mix the refried beans and chili powder in a small bowl until combined and set aside. Stretch and roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a thin round about 1/4-inch thick and 12 inches in diameter; it&#39;s ok if it&#39;s not perfectly round. Place on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil about 18 inches long. Lift the whole piece of foil and place on the grill. Check the bottom of the dough after 2 minutes as it begins to char, puff and bubble. Rotate one-quarter turn or halfway to evenly cook the bottom. Grill until the bottom of the dough is charred and the pizza is almost cooked through and there is no more raw-looking dough in the center, 4 to 7 minutes. Using the foil, remove the pizza from the grill, brush the top with the oil and flip. Spread the refried bean mixture on what is now the top of the crust, stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge. Sprinkle with the chorizo, cheese, jalapenos and red onions. Using the foil, lift the pizza back onto the grill. Grill until the bottom of the crust is charred and the cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pizza from the grill and top with the cilantro and avocados.

Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown, pull the pan off the heat and immediately add the sage, sugar, vinegar (stand back so as not to get splattered), molasses and Toasted Spice Rub. Mix well and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors. Pour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well, then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny. Increase the oven temperature to broil. Working in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a buttered 1 1/2 pint gratin dish, or 6 to 7 (1/2 cup) ramekins, top with the crumbled biscotti and put under the broiler for 5 to 8 minutes or until biscotti is slightly toasted. You can also refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. Variation for Smoky Butternut Squash: Cook the prepared squash on a baking sheet in a covered grill with soaked chips to give a slightly smoky taste. Substitute in any of the recipes that call for roasted squash. If cooking kabocha, acorn, or other difficult-to-peel squash, cut in half, scoop out the seeds, and rub the insides and cut edges with the vinegar/molasses mixture.

Grease the bottom and sides of 2 (8-inch) round cake pans; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, water, oil, eggs and extract. Use an electric mixer to beat on low speed for 1 minute. Scrape down bowl and then beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, or until batter is smooth. Divide batter evenly between cake pans. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until center of tester comes out clean. Let cool in pans for 5 minutes. Remove from pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. ; For Royal Icing: With a hand mixer, beat the egg whites with the lemon juice or extract until frothy. Add the sifted powdered sugar and beat on low speed until combined, smooth, and shiny. Turn to high and beat approximately 5 minutes until stiff and glossy. Add food coloring, if desired, and transfer to a pastry bag to pipe onto cookies. ; To Decorate: Line the backside of a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Place 4 inch wide strips of parchment paper around the border of the sheet pan to keep the foil clean while you decorate the cake. Place cake rounds side by side on the lined sheet tray. Slice one side off each cupcake. Place cupcakes side by side at one end of a cake round with the cut/flat side facing up (this will be the top of the top hat). Frost both cakes and cupcakes with frosting so that it looks like a hat is resting on a snowman&#39;s head resting on a body. Remove the parchment paper. Spread or drizzle the bottom third of the sheet pan with some royal icing (the royal icing will act as glue for the coconut). Sprinkle the coconut over the royal icing to mimic snow. Randomly place 20 dollops of royal icing around the rest of the sheet pan. Place the snowflake cookies on each dollop of royal icing. Decorate the snowman&#39;s hat with rows of blue mints, starting at the very top of the Snowman&#39;s head and working up onto the cupcakes. To decorate the face use the peppermint patties for eyes, place a small dot of the royal icing in the center of each patty and place a blue jellybean on top of the royal icing. Use the orange gum drop for the nose and the blue candy coated chocolates for the smile. To make the buttons dip the flat side of a hard candy into the royal icing and then into the colored decorating sugar and place on the snowman&#39;s chest; repeat with remaining 2 hard candies. Take 2 (8-inch) piece fruit strips and tie them into a knot. Drape fruit strips across where the 2 cake rounds meet to make a scarf. To make the \broom, take a 3-inch long piece of fruit strip and slice the bottom 2 inches into thin strips. Place a small amount of royal icing at the end of the over sized candy cane and place the unsliced end of the fruit strip on to the royal icing. Use the large white gumdrops to make the hands. Place the candy cane next too one of his hands. ; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42269,&quot;Peach Apricot Melba Crepes em Curd: /em 1/3 cup unsalted butter 1 (12 oz.) jar Smucker&#39;s?

Once the butter is melted, remove from the heat and add the almonds, flour, cream, espresso powder, vanilla and salt. Mix well, and allow to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Because Florentines spread so much, you will only be able to bake a few cookies at a time, so the pans will be used multiple times.)<br> Using a small cookie scoop or 2 tablespoons, spoon 6 mounds of dough on each sheet, spaced evenly. Bake until golden amber, 10 to 12 minutes.<br> Allow the Florentines to cool on the cookie sheets for 3 minutes, then remove them using a thin spatula. To make bowls, place them on top of inverted glasses, and press down gently to mold. For taco shells, drape over a rolling pin. For cigars, gently wrap around the handle of a wooden spoon. For sandwiches, lay them flat on a cutting board or countertop. Cookies will hold their shapes after they&#39;ve cooled completely. Continue baking cookies in batches. (It is not necessary to cool the baking sheets completely in between.) Cookies can be stored in an airtight container for 2 weeks, or stored in the freezer for 3 months.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 42288,&quot;Air Fryer Fried Shrimp Nonstick cooking spray 1 pound large shrimp (16/20 count), peeled and deveined, tails on<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chopped pickled jalapenos<br> 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard<br> 1 tablespoon ketchup<br> 1 tablespoon hot sauce<br> 1 scallion, thinly sliced<br> Instructions: For the fried shrimp: Spray the basket of a 3.5-quart air fryer with cooking spray and set aside. Pat the shrimp dry between a couple paper towels, then season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Whisk the flour with 3/4 teaspoon salt and few grinds of pepper in a shallow bowl or baking dish. Whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt in another shallow bowl. Add the panko to a third shallow bowl. Dip a shrimp in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess, then dip in the beaten eggs. Dredge in the panko, turning until evenly coated. Transfer to a large plate or a rimmed baking sheet and repeat with the remaining shrimp.<br> Preheat the air fryer to 385 degrees F. Working in batches, place some of the shrimp in a single layer in the fryer basket, then spray lightly with more cooking spray. Cook until the shrimp are golden brown and cooked through, flipping halfway through, about 10 minutes.<br> For the spicy remoulade sauce: Meanwhile, stir together the mayonnaise, pickled jalapenos, mustard, ketchup, hot sauce and scallion in a small bowl until smooth.

Gently whisk in the yeast, 1 tablespoon of the flour and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Set aside until bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbles start to form around the edges, about 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the butter, the remaining sugar and the salt. Set aside to cool, about 10 minutes. Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment, set on medium-low speed and pour the milk mixture into the yeast mixture. Add the 2 beaten eggs. Gradually mix in the remaining flour, and beat until a soft dough forms. Increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until the dough pulls away from the sides and forms a ball, about 5 minutes (the dough will be sticky). Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface, and knead, adding more flour as needed, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Put the dough in a lightly buttered large bowl, cover and place in a warm spot to rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Punch down the dough, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and cut it into 3 equal parts. Gently roll out each piece into a 16-inch-long rope. Transfer the ropes to the prepared baking sheet. Press the ropes together at one end, braid them, then gently tuck both ends under to form a long loaf. Cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the entire loaf with the remaining beaten egg. Scatter the almonds and nonpareils on top, concentrating them down the middle of the loaf (they will spread as the loaf bakes). Bake until the loaf is dark golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool about 30 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42292,&quot;Edamole Dip 1/2 cup peeled edamame, fresh or frozen 1/2 cup broccoli stalks, peeled 1 avocado, peeled 1 scallion, sliced 1/2 red onion, diced 1 clove fresh garlic, minced 1/2 jalapeno, minced 1 lime, juiced 1 tomato, diced 2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped Sea salt Instructions: In a saucepan, heat 2 cups of water and bring to a boil.

Allow to sit, uncovered, in your fridge overnight. One hour prior to cooking, remove the steak from the fridge and allow to come to room temperature. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Sprinkle the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. It is important to use more seasoning than needed, as the steak is very thick and much of the seasoning will fall off during the cooking process. Grill the steak on one flat side, 5 to 8 minutes. Stand the steak up on one short side and grill for 1 to 2 minutes. Turn over and grill on the other flat side, 5 to 8 minutes. Stand it up on the opposite short side and grill for 1 to 2 minutes. Move the steak to the cooler part of the grill and cook until the internal temperature reaches 125 degrees F for medium rare. Transfer to a plate and allow to rest until the internal temperature registers 130 degrees F, about 20 minutes. Measure out 1 tablespoon of the steak juices that have settled onto the plate and put in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk in the mustard, shallots and vinegar. Toss the watercress in the dressing, along with the tarragon leaves and radish slices. Place the salad on a plate with the steak. Drizzle the steak with the olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar. Finish with the sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 42295,&quot;Spice-rubbed Chipotle-Molasses Ribs 1 cup ancho chili powder 1/4 cup Spanish paprika 2 tablespoons ground cumin 2 tablespoons ground coriander 2 tablespoons dry mustard 2 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons dried oregano 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 2 racks pork ribs (12 ribs each) 1 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup coarsely chopped ginger Chipotle-Molasses BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 large Spanish onion, coarsely chopped 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons ancho chili powder 1 tablespoon pasilla chili powder 1 tablespoon New Mexican chili powder 3 cups canned plum tomatoes with juices, pureed 1 cup water 1/4 cup ketchup 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup molasses 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 chipotle chiles in adobo, pureed 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the onions and cook until starting to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the squash and zucchini, sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Grill the tomato slices on a grill pan or simply sear them in a hot skillet. Remove and set aside. For the hollandaise sauce: In a small saucepan, melt the butter until sizzling. Put the egg yolks in a blender. Turn the blender on low to allow the yolks to combine, and then begin pouring the very hot butter in a thin stream into the blender. The blender should remain on the whole time, and you should be careful to pour in the butter very slowly. Keep pouring the butter until it&#39;s all gone, then immediately begin pouring the lemon juice into the blender. Check the blender to make sure the sauce is still liquid and moving easily through the blades; if it&#39;s not, add a little more juice and give it a stir, then blend again. Add a generous shake of cayenne pepper. If the sauce is too thick, continue to blend while adding more lemon juice. For the poached eggs: Bring a medium saucepan of water to a gentle boil. Add the vinegar. Use a wooden spoon to carefully stir the water into a circular \whirlpool.\ Crack the eggs into the water and allow them to swirl around in the water until they begin to set. Let them stay in the water for 1 minute, then remove them with a slotted spoon and set on a plate. If the eggs need to be cooked longer, just add them back to the water for 30 seconds at a time. Spoon the vegetables on plates or in bowls and set the eggs on top. Lay the tomato slices on the side. Place the cheese slices on the side. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper and serve with the hollandaise sauce poured over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 42305,&quot;Tiramisu al Vin Santo 1 pounds/500 g cantuccini cookies, chopped 1 cup/250 ml Vin Santo 1 pound/500 g mascarpone cheese 3.5 ounces/100 g chopped bittersweet chocolate 2 tablespoons/30 ml sugar Instructions: Place the cookies on the bottom of a cake pan, creating a base for the tiramisu.

Lightly oil the baking sheet and set aside. Partially cook the pasta shells in a large pot of boiling salted water until slightly tender but still quite firm to the bite, about 4 to 6 minutes. You will continue cooking the shells in the oven after they have been stuffed. Using a slotted spoon, drain pasta shells and place on oiled baking sheet, spreading them out so that they don&#39;t stick together and allow to cool. Heat the oil in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the pancetta and saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes. Add the garlic and saute until tender, about 1 minute. Add the marinara sauce. Bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring often. In a medium bowl, stir the ricotta, Parmesan, egg yolks, basil, parsley, mint, salt, and pepper. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spoon 1 1/4 cups of the sauce over the prepared baking dish. Fill the cooked shells with the cheese mixture, about 2 tablespoons per shell. Arrange the shells in the prepared dish. Spoon the remaining sauce over the shells, then sprinkle with the mozzarella. Bake in the lower third of your oven until the filling is heated through and the top is golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 42308,&quot;Coconut Shrimp Lollypops with Apricot-Ginger Dipping Sauce 1/2 cup apricot jam 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 jalepeno pepper, seeds discarded, minced 2 tablespoons seasoned rice wine vinegar or freshly squeezed lime juice 1 coconut, or 2 cups sweetened shredded coconut 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup beer 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 egg 12 shrimp (16 to 20 count) shelled and deveined 12 bamboo skewers, approximately 5 inches 3 to 5 cups peanut oil, or vegetable oil Instructions: Place all apricot dipping sauce ingredients in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. Reserve. Pierce the soft eye of the coconut and drain the coconut water. Reserve. Crack coconut in 1/2 using the back of a cleaver. Separate the coconut meat from the shell. Use a pairing knife to remove the brown skin from the meat. Using the finest part of your grater, grate 2 cups of coconut . Pour coconut water in a measuring cup and if necessary top off with beer until you have 3/4 cup of liquid. Reserve. If you are using store-bought shredded coconut (and consequently do not have any coconut water) replace mixture with 3/4 cup of beer. In a large bowl, combine flour, coconut water/beer mixture, baking soda, salt, cayenne, and egg. Beat until it is smooth. Add a bit more flour or beer, if necessary, so that the batter has the consistency of thick pancake batter. Tightly wrap each shrimp like a pinwheel (with the tail end of the shrimp on the outside) and skewer 1 shrimp on the end of each skewer. Use a paper towel to pat the shrimp dry. Pour oil into a small, tall pot until it is 3 inches deep. Heat oil until it reaches 350 degrees F (see oil dissertation below). While oil is heating, dip each shrimp into the batter, then dredge into the coconut shreds so that the entire \lollypop\ is covered in coconut shreds. When oil is ready, submerge 4 shrimp at a time into oil (with the skewers sticking out of the pot). Fry for approximately 1 minute, or until coconut is a golden brown, rotating the top of the skewer once or twice. Remove and place lollypops on paper towel to absorb excess oil. Skim any wayward coconut shreds from the oil. Adjust heat so that it is 350 degrees F again and continue with next batch. Serve with apricot dipping sauce. For a creative presentation, stick skewers into an upturned pineapple or melon 1/2 and/or serve the dip in a coconut 1/2 (the side without the hole!) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 42309,&quot;Fresh Apple Cake with Homemade Caramel Sauce 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened 2 cups sugar<br> 2 large eggs<br> 2 cups (about 2 apples) grated unpeeled Granny Smith apple (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cloves<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)<br> Homemade Caramel Sauce, recipe follows Whipped cream or ice cream (optional)<br> 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup half-and-half<br> 4 tablespoons butter<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the butter with a mixer at medium speed until fluffy; gradually add the sugar, beating well. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition. Add the apple, beating just until blended. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt; add to the butter mixture, and mix just until blended. Stir in the walnuts, if desired. Pour into a lightly greased 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or just until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack 10 minutes. Serve with Homemade Caramel Sauce and, if desired, whipped cream or ice cream. Cook the sugar, half-and-half, butter, and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low for 5 to 7 minutes, whisking slowly, until thickened. Remove from the heat, and let cool slightly before serving. Keep refrigerated up to one week after you make it. Just be sure to warm it up before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 42310,&quot;Overnight Pot Roast 1 large onion, sliced 1 large flank steak (about 3 pounds) 2 teaspoons Montreal steak seasoning, McCormick Grill Mates 1 packet (1.0-ounce) onion soup mix, Lipton 1 can (14.5-ounce) stewed Italian tomatoes, S&amp;W 3 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 can (10.75-ounce) condensed cream of celery soup, Campbells Instructions: Place onion in the bottom of a 5-quart slow cooker.

Gently, drop in the cubes of paneer and gently toss, taking care not to break the cubes if you&#39;re using the homemade kind. Let the cubes marinate while you get the rest of your ingredients together and prepped. Thaw the spinach in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish, 5 minutes on high, then puree in a food processor until smooth. Alternatively, you can chop it up very finely with your knife. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, and add the paneer as the pan warms. In a couple of minutes give the pan a toss; each piece of paneer should be browned on one side. Fry another minute or so, and then remove the paneer from the pan onto a plate. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and cl. Now here&#39;s the important part: saute the mixture until it&#39;s evenly toffee-coloured, which should take about 15 minutes. Don&#39;t skip this step - this is the foundation of the dish! If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning, add a couple of tablespoons of water. Add the garam masala, coriander and cumin. If you haven&#39;t already, sprinkle a little water to keep the spices from burning. Cook, stirring often, until the raw scent of the spices cook out, and it all smells a bit more melodious, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the spinach and stir well, incorporating the spiced onion mixture into the spinach. Add a little salt and 1/2 cup of water, stir, and cook about 5 minutes with the lid off. Turn the heat off. Add the yogurt, a little at a time to keep it from curdling. Once the yogurt is well mixed into the spinach, add the paneer. Turn the heat back on, cover and cook until everything is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve. Line a large colander with a large double layer of cheesecloth, and set it in your sink. In a large wide pot, bring the milk to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid burning the bottom (a nonstick pot works really well for this purpose). This will take a little while so be patient! Add the lemon juice and turn the heat down to low. Stirring gently, you should almost immediately see the curds (white milk solids) and whey (the greenish liquid) separate. Don&#39;t fret, this is perfect! Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour the contents into the cheesecloth-lined colander. Gently rinse with cool water to get rid of the lemon flavor. At this point, you could squeeze out some of the liquid, and serve with some honey and some nuts, almost like a fresh ricotta! Grab the ends of the cheesecloth and twist the ball of cheese to squeeze out the excess whey. Tie the cheesecloth to your kitchen faucet and allow the cheese to drain for about 5 minutes. Twisting the ball to compact the cheese into a block, place it on a plate with the twisted part of the cheesecloth on the side (this will ensure your block of cheese is nice and smooth!) and set another plate on top. Weigh the second plate down with cans of beans or a heavy pot. Move to the refrigerator and let it sit about 20 minutes. Combine the cinnamon sticks, cloves, green cardamom seeds, black cardamom seeds, if using into a spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind until fine. Store the spice mix in an airtight container away from direct sunlight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42312,&quot;Breakfast Bruschetta 2 tablespoons light whipped butter or light buttery spread 1 (2-inch-wide) French baguette (about 4 ounces) 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1 cup fat-free liquid egg substitute 1 plum tomato, diced 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil Salt and black pepper, optional Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.<br> Put butter in a small microwave-safe bowl.

Line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. Using a half-sheet pan as a guide, roll the Flaky Pastry Dough out to a bit larger than the sheet pan (13 by 18 inches). Trim the dough with a sharp knife and transfer to the prepared sheet pan (it should fit snugly). Refrigerate for 20 minutes to chill. Dock the dough with a fork and bake until risen and golden brown on top, about 35 minutes. Set aside. In a skillet, combine the olive oil, onions and garlic; saute over medium heat until the onions have softened, about 15 minutes. Add the maple syrup and paprika and stir to combine. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the cream cheese, artichoke hearts, Parmigiano-Reggiano, mayonnaise, the onion mixture and salt and pepper to taste. Pulse until mostly smooth, with a few small artichoke pieces remaining. Gently spread the artichoke mixture over the pastry, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with the sliced tomatoes. Bake until the edges of the filling are beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Top with the fresh herbs. Serve warm and immediately. Add the flour and salt to a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the butter and toss to combine. With your fingers, begin to \smush\ the butter into flat pieces. Continue smushing until all the butter is flattened but none of the pieces are larger than a quarter. The flour will look like coarse cornmeal. Add the water, quickly folding it in with a wooden spoon to distribute the moisture. (Do not stir vigorously--the dough should appear shaggy.) Use your hands to break up any large clumps of moisture. Then use your knuckles or a palm to smear the dough up the sides of the bowl (a technique known as fraisage). This distributes the butter over a larger surface to achieve larger flakes and compact the dough. Once you&#39;ve gone around the bowl one time, fold the dough over itself a few times to pick up any dry bits from the bottom. Gently press the dough into a disk. (Note: The dough should remain very cool to the touch throughout the process. If it approaches room temperature, refrigerate it for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.) Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a 10-by-12-inch rectangle. Perform a letter fold by folding one of the short ends towards the middle and the other short end over the first, like folding a business letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees, so the long side faces you, and perform a second letter fold. Turn the dough 90 degrees again; perform a third letter fold. If the dough still feels cool, it can be used immediately. Otherwise, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42314,&quot;Pumpkin Pie 1 cup cooked and pureed pumpkin, drained in a fine strainer 3/4 cup creme fraiche Generous 1/3 cup brown sugar, firmly packed 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger Pinch ground cloves 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 tablespoons brandy or dark rum 1 (10-inch) prebaked pie shell, recipe follows Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

(If you do not have a deep-fryer, you can use a Dutch oven filled with about 4 inches of oil heated to 350 degrees F.) Allow the turkey to simmer in the gravy in a medium saucepan for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Wrap the tortillas in a clean, damp kitchen towel and microwave just long enough to make them pliable, about 20 seconds. Unwrap and lay one on the counter, and layer in your leftover ingredients, starting in the lower center of the tortilla, adding 1/4 cup each of mashed sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, stuffing and the warmed turkey in gravy. Take care to keep the ingredients away from the edges so they don&#39;t spill out. Fold the bottom half over the filling to the center of the tortilla. Then, fold each remaining side in. The filling should be mostly covered at this point. Roll everything away from you towards the top of the tortilla and secure the seam with toothpicks. Repeat the process until all the burritos have been rolled. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Fit a rack inside a sheet tray and set aside. Carefully place one burrito at a time into the hot oil.

Bring to a boil and then simmer, about 1 1/2 hours. Dice the turkey meat. Make sure the meat pieces are no larger than the size of a soupspoon. (If preparing the soup the next day, be sure to store leftover turkey meat in an airtight container before placing it in the refrigerator. Top with 1 or 2 ladles full of broth to keep the meat moist.) Before straining the broth, remove the large bones and carcass with tongs. Strain the broth through a sieve covered with wet cheesecloth. Discard the solids. Transfer the broth to a bowl set in a bath of ice water, which will cool the broth quickly and help keep it fresher longer. This can be done the night before and stored in the refrigerator until the next day. In a large soup pot, heat the garlic in the olive oil over medium heat. Allow to brown slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the minced carrots, celery and onions. Sweat over medium-low heat until softened, 7 or 8 minutes. Dice the leftover Thanksgiving vegetables. Add the sage to the soup pot along with the turkey broth and the remaining bay leaf. Bring to a simmer. When simmering, add the Brussels sprouts, green beans and diced turkey meat to the soup. Bring it back up to a simmer. Finally, add the sweet potatoes to the center and gently push them down. Turn the heat off and cover. Allow to sit and steam, 5 to 7 minutes. Let simmer for 5 more minutes and serve with the Mashed Potato Polpetti. Re-season the potatoes with salt and pepper. Stir in the cheese. Take a mayonnaise or peanut butter lid and line with plastic wrap to use as a mold. Pack the potato mixture into the lid, unwrap it and place the patty on a baking sheet. You may refrigerate them covered with plastic wrap until the next day, or fry immediately. To cook, dredge the patties in flour. Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Just before frying, dredge the patties again with flour. Add the patties to the oil without crowding them (you may have to cook them in batches). Cook until the underside is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and brown the other side. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Serve hot with leftover gravy. Makes 6 servings.

Add the olive oil and pasta. Cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Place the pasta in a large serving bowl. For the sauce: In a medium saucepan, combine the figs, broth, orange juice, thyme, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the goat cheese, mascarpone cheese and lemon zest until the sauce is creamy. Pour the sauce over the cooked pasta and toss until all the ingredients are coated. Top with the crumbled prosciutto and serve. Place the cake flour, all-purpose flour, egg yolks and salt in a food processor. Pulse to combine. With the machine running, gradually add the oil then 1/3 to 1/2 cup water until the mixture forms a dough (the dough should stick together if pinched between your fingers). If necessary, add additional water, 1 teaspoon at a time if the dough is too dry. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Gather the dough into a ball and knead until the dough is smooth, 5 to 8 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough into quarters and press flat. Run each piece of pasta dough several times through a pasta-rolling machine, adjusting the setting each time, until the pasta is about 1/8 to 1/16-inch thick. Cut the pasta into the desired shape and use as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42370,&quot;Beef Picadillo with Spaghetti Squash 1 spaghetti squash (about 2 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 onion, diced 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 pound ground beef 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 14.5-ounce can petite-diced tomatoes with green chiles 1/4 cup raisins 1/3 cup pimiento-stuffed olives, halved 1/3 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Halve the spaghetti squash lengthwise and remove the seeds.

Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners and spray with cooking spray. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk the buttermilk, food coloring and vanilla in a spouted measuring cup; set aside. Beat the granulated sugar and butter in a stand mixer (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium speed until very light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. With the mixer still on medium, slowly add the eggs and beat until fully incorporated. Reduce the speed to the lowest setting; with the mixer running, add 1/3 of the flour mixture, then 1/2 of the buttermilk mixture, then 1/2 of the remaining flour mixture, then the remaining buttermilk mixture, then the remaining flour mixture. Scrape down the sides and beat until well mixed. Fill the prepared liners about 3/4 full of batter. Bake until the cupcakes bounce back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Put the flour in a small saucepan. Vigorously whisk in about 1/2 cup milk, making sure to get the whisk into the edges of the pan, until you have a smooth, thick paste. (This step keeps the flour from clumping.) Slowly whisk in the remaining milk until fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is very thick, about 5 minutes. (Toward the end of the process, the mixture will become a thick paste; it may seem to be forming lumps, but whisk vigorously and the lumps will disappear.) Scrape into a bowl, press plastic wrap onto the surface and refrigerate until cool, about 45 minutes. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a hand mixer), beat the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the cooled flour mixture a tablespoon at a time and beat until smooth. Switch to the whisk attachment (or continue with the hand mixer), add the vanilla, salt and 3 to 5 drops green food coloring and whip until very light and fluffy, like thick whipped cream, up to 10 minutes with a stand mixer or 12 minutes with a hand mixer. To assemble: Using a sharp serrated knife, cut 3 cupcakes in half vertically, gently sawing through the paper liners; set aside. Frost the remaining cupcakes. Put the sanding sugar on a small plate and roll the edge of each cupcake 3/4 of the way around in the sugar, making a green border around each with a gap on one side. On a large serving platter, arrange 18 cupcakes in groups of three, pushing them together at the gaps, to make 6 shamrock cakes. Dip the tops of the cupcake halves in sugar and wedge a pointy end of 1 half between 2 of the cupcakes in each group to form the stems. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 42389,&quot;Fried Chicken 2 cups buttermilk 1 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 2 teaspoons plus 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> One 2 1/2- to 4-pound fryer chicken, cut into 8 pieces<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> Maple syrup, warmed, if desired for serving<br> Instructions: Stir together the buttermilk, paprika, cayenne and 2 teaspoons of the salt in a large bowl.

When the sugar syrup is has reached the softball stage, turn the mixer up to high and slowly pour the syrup down the side of the mixer. Let it continue to whip to cool down. When it&#39;s feeling somewhat cooled but still a little warm, start adding the butter a few pieces at a time until you have a smooth, whipped butter cream. Add the almond extract. Use right away or cover and chill. Re-warm or let sit out to warm up to room temperature to use.<br> Make the Cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> In a mixer with a whip attachment, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugar and continue to cream. Gradually add the vanilla and eggs and mix in well. Sift together the dry ingredients; then mix into the butter mixture alternating with the milk. Pour batter into cupcake paper-lined muffin tins filling them 3/4 full. Bake until puffed and firm in the center and light golden brown on top, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool.

Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. If using parsnips, quarter lengthwise and remove the woody core before cutting into 1/8-inch thick slices. Cook vegetables in a large pot of boiling water until barely tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until light brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 cup milk and bring to a simmer. Combine flour and the remaining 1/3 cup milk in a small bowl to make a smooth paste; stir into the hot milk and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce bubbles and thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in 3/4 cup cheese, thyme, salt and pepper. Combine breadcrumbs, the remaining 3/4 cup cheese and 1 tablespoon oil in a bowl. Layer the vegetable slices in the prepared baking dish. Pour the cheese sauce over the top and top with the breadcrumb mixture. Bake the gratin until it is bubbling and the top is golden, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Tips: Beets, carrots and parsnips are easily peeled with a vegetable peeler, but for tougher-skinned roots like celeriac, rutabaga and turnips, removing the peel with a knife can be easier. Cut off one end of the root to create a flat surface to keep it steady on the cutting board. Follow the contour of the vegetable with your knife. If you use a vegetable peeler on the tougher roots, peel around each vegetable at least three times to ensure all the fibrous skin has been removed. To make fresh breadcrumbs, trim crusts from country-style whole-wheat bread. Tear bread into pieces and process in a food processor until coarse crumbs form. One slice of bread makes about 1/2 cup crumbs.

Cover with the bun tops and serve immediately. Toasted Burger Buns I think the taste and the texture of buns are best when lightly toasted. To toast a bun on a grill, grill pan, or griddle, split the bun open, place it cut side down on the grill, and grill until light golden brown, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, you can place the split bun halves cut side up on a baking sheet and cook them under a preheated broiler until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Keep a close eye on them and don&#39;t let them get too brown or else that texture will take on a life of its own and defeat the purpose of starting with a soft bun. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 42399,&quot;Chocolate Bundt Cake with Candied Cherry Sauce Nonstick cooking spray 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 2 sticks unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 4 large eggs 1/2 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon orange zest 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 cup whole milk 2 cups dried cherries 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons dark rum 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract One 1-inch strip lemon peel Juice of 1/2 lemon Juice of 1/2 orange 1 cinnamon stick 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Line muffin tins with 16 \Texas\ liners or 24 regular cupcake liners. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, set aside. Combine the melted butter with the sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the eggs, egg yolks and vanilla, mix on medium speed for 3 minutes.<br> Add a third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix to combine on low speed. Add half of the buttermilk and mix to combine. Repeat with another third of the flour and the rest of the buttermilk, ending with the last third of flour, mixing after each addition. Mix the cake batter on medium-low speed for 1 minute. Scoop the batter into the cupcake liners, not filling more than half way. You may end up having to fill a few more cupcake liners, but don&#39;t overfill.<br> Bake for about 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the cupcakes cool completely before decorating. To make the Frosting: Cream together the butter, shortening and sugar until perfectly smooth. Add the cream one tablespoon at a time until it is nice and creamy, but still holds its shape. Cover tightly if you don&#39;t use it immediately or it will develop a crisp crust. You can use it white or tint the frosting with food coloring. I usually divide the frosting into a few bowls and color each a different color. Cover the frosting when not using. To decorate your cupcakes with roses: Using a disposable pastry bag, fitted with a large rose tip (Ateco #128) and an extra large rose nail (Ateco #914) you can create these large colorful roses. Start by lining up the narrow end of the rose tip with the seam of the pastry bag. Place a thin line of the food coloring along the seam of the bag, that leads to the narrow end of the tip. Fill the bag half way with the frosting.<br> Once your pastry bag is set up with frosting you will create a mound of frosting on the rose nail. This will be the base of your rose. If the mound is too small your rose will tip over as you are piping it. Making it nice and broad along the bottom is key. Hold the bag at a 45degrees angle, wide end of the tip touching the mound you just created, near its top. The narrow end of the tube should be nearly straight up and pointing toward the center of the nail.<br> Squeeze out a ribbon of frosting and turn the nail, holding it between your thumb and forefinger, counter clockwise; swing the rose tip up, around the top of the mound and back down to the starting point. This creates the rose bud. Now make the first row of 3 petals. Hold the tip so the wide end is touching the mound about half way up, starting right where the bud finished off. Tilt the narrow end of the tip slightly away from the center. Squeeze out the frosting, turning the nail counterclockwise and move the tip up (increase the pressure) and then down (decreasing the pressure) in an arch. Form all three petals in this way, starting each one where the last petal finished. Pipe a second row of 5 petals, under the row you just finished. Tilt the tip out even more with this row so the petals appear to be opening up. Overlap the petals to hide any openings between them. You can stop at this point or continue on with a third row of 7 petals. It may take you a few roses to get the hang of it, but then it will go together very fast. Once you are happy with the size and shape of your rose, take a pair of kitchen shears and cut the base of the rose off of the nail. You will want to cut only part way through, so you can lift up the rose on the blades of the shears. Then place the rose on the cooled cupcake. You can pipe leaves at the base of the rose with a leaf tip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42406,&quot;Ragand#250;andreg; No Frying Chicken Parmesan 3/4 cup plain dry bread crumbs 1/2 tsp.

Mash the mixture with a potato masher. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth while pressing with the back of a wooden spoon. (This can be done 4 to 5 days in advance.) Keep refrigerated until needed. Purge the clams: In a bowl, combine the clams, cornmeal, and 4 cups of cold water. Place in the refrigerator for about 30 to 40 minutes, to clean out any sand. Remove the clams from the water and discard the water. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill to remove the seeds (they can be bitter), so that only the juice remains. Set aside. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the cellophane noodles for 4 to 6 minutes, or until done. Strain and put 1/2 cup each of the noodles in 4 wide soup bowls. In a wok fitted with a steamer rack (or circular cake rack), bring the tamarind stock, ginger juice, and tomato juice to a boil. Place the clams on the rack, cover, and cook until they open and release their juice into the broth. Divide the clams among the soup bowls, leaving the broth in the wok. Stir the sweet soy sauce, minced cl, and basil into the broth and simmer for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the fish sauce. Ladle the broth over the clams and garnish with scallions and lemon zest.

In a food processor combine the flour, sugar and salt and process to combine -- about 30 seconds. Add the butter and process until mixture resembles fine meal. With the motor running add the yeast mixture and the milk, in a stream, and continue to process until a dough is formed. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead for 1 minute. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 30 minutes, or overnight. On a lightly floured surface pat the rested dough into a 10 by 4-inch rectangle. Roll the dough into a 14 by 9-inch rectangle. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the butter with remaining 2 tablespoons flour until it is pliable but still cold and firm. Between sheets of parchment or waxed paper roll the butter into a rectangle large enough to cover two-thirds of the dough with a one-inch border all around. Using parchment paper, invert butter onto the bottom two-thirds of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Fold the top-third of the dough down over the top half of the butter. Fold the bottom third up over the top (like a letter) and pinch edges to seal. Turn dough over, seam side down, give it one quarter turn and roll lengthwise into a 20 by 10-inch rectangle. Turn the dough over, seam side up, and fold like a letter. This is one turn. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic, for 30 minutes, or until firm. Arrange dough on lightly floured surface, with folded edge to your left, and roll lengthwise into a 20 by 10-inch rectangle. Fold and chill as before. Repeat process two more times, giving the dough four turns in all. After the fourth turn chill dough for at least 3 hours, or overnight. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Form the croissants: On a lightly floured surface roll the dough into a 25 by 14 by 1/4-inch rectangle. Halve the dough lengthwise into two 7-inch strips. Using a pastry wheel or a long chef&#39;s knife, cut the strips into triangles, each with a base of 4 to 5 inches. Beginning with the base of each triangle, fold 1/4-inch of the dough over onto itself and begin rolling the triangle up to the point. Gently stretch the dough by pulling on the tip as you roll it. Repeat with the remaining triangles. If dough becomes soft, chill. Transfer the croissants to the baking sheets as they are formed spacing them 2 inches apart. Make the glaze: in a bowl whisk together the egg and milk. Brush the croissants with the glaze and let rise, uncovered, in a cool place (about 65 to 75 degrees) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Let croissants rise in a warmer place (about 75 to 80 degrees) for 1 1/2 hours more, or until almost doubled in size. Brush once more with the glaze and place on the center rack of a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 to 17 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to racks to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42419,&quot;Corn and Poblano Lasagna 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 3 cloves garlic, minced, divided 2 cups fresh corn kernels (from about 2 ears), or frozen and thawed 2 cups heavy cream 1 teaspoon fresh thyme Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup thinly sliced white onion 1 large zucchini, thinly sliced lengthwise 4 poblano chiles, charred, peeled, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1-inch strips 12 (7 by 3-inch) no-boil lasagna sheets 2 cups shredded Oaxaca cheese, or mozzarella Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Heat a large Dutch oven, with a lid, over medium-high heat. Season the meat generously with salt and pepper, and sprinkle lightly with the flour. Add the oil to the pot, lay the meat in the pan and sear on both sides until a deep mahogany brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer the meat to a plate. Pour all but about 2 tablespoons of the oil from the pan. Add the onion and garlic to the pan, and cook until fragrant and soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up by hand as you add them to the pot, and cook until a deep brick red, about 2 minutes more. Add the wine, and with a wooden spoon scrape up any browned bits that cling to the bottom of the pot. Add the remaining tomato liquid, beef broth, thyme, and bay leaves, and bring to a boil. Return the roast to the pot, nestle it in the liquid, cover and transfer the pot to the oven. Cook until the roast is just tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the lid and continue to cook, uncovered until tender about 1 hour more. Meanwhile, toss the onions, carrots, parsnips, and turnips with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread out on a baking sheet in 1 layer. You may have to use 2 baking sheets. Once the roast comes out of the oven, raise the temperature to 450 degrees F. Roast the vegetables, turning about halfway through cooking, until caramelized and tender, about 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer the roast to a plate and cover loosely with foil. Skim the fat off the surface of the liquid and discard. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until thickened. For a thicker sauce whisk in the cornstarch mixture and bring to a boil. (Test the thickness of the sauce by spooning some onto a plate and checking the consistency). Stir in the parsley, taste and adjust salt and pepper, as needed. Keep the roast warm in the sauce until ready to slice. Slice the pot roast and lay on a platter; surround with the vegetables. Pour some of the sauce on top and serve the remaining sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 42435,&quot;Green and Yellow Beans with Tarragon Kosher salt 3/4 pound green beans, trimmed 3/4 pound yellow wax beans, trimmed 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.

Cook 1 hour until very tender. Test with a knife-it should pull out easily. Allow an hour for the beets to cool in the cooking liquid. This will give them the right consistency for the sauce. Cut away the very top of the beet and remove the skins. Place them in a food processor and puree as fine as possible. Strain though a coarse strainer into a mixing bowl. If you are using prepared horseradish, squeeze as much of the juice out as possible. (1 1/2 cups will give you 1 cup after squeezing; there is no need to squeeze the fresh.) Mix the horseradish with the beets and add the lemon water and season with pepper and salt, if needed.

Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap and press into a ball. Pat into a 1/2-inch-thick disk and wrap tightly. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Roll the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface or between 2 pieces of lightly floured parchment paper. (If the dough becomes soft, refrigerate until firm.) Center the dough in a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhang under itself and crimp the edges; refrigerate 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly pierce the bottom and sides of the crust with a fork, then line with parchment paper or foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake 20 minutes, then remove the parchment and weights and continue baking until lightly golden, about 10 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Bring 3 cups blueberries, 1/2 cup granulated sugar and the lemon zest to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat, crushing the berries slightly with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Discard the lemon zest. Transfer the blueberry mixture to a bowl; stir in the remaining 3 cups berries and 1/4 cup granulated sugar, the lemon juice, whole-wheat flour, nutmeg and salt. Let cool completely. Make the topping: Combine the nuts, brown sugar, whole-wheat flour, butter and salt. Squeeze the mixture into clumps with your hands and scatter on a baking sheet. Freeze 30 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Pour the blueberry filling into the crust and top with the frozen crumb topping. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until the filling is bubbly and the topping is golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes. (If the topping browns too quickly, cover it with foil.) Transfer the pie to a rack and let cool overnight, or at least 4 hours, so the filling sets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 42456,&quot;Classic Cheese Fondue 12 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated 8 ounces Emmental or other imported Swiss cheese, grated<br> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/4 cups dry white wine<br> 1 clove garlic, finely grated or minced 1/2 teaspoon powdered mustard<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> 1 tablespoon cherry brandy, such as kirsch, optional<br> For serving: cubed baguette, assorted sliced raw vegetables such as celery and bell pepper and assorted sliced fruit such as apples, figs and pears<br> For serving: cubed baguette, assorted sliced raw vegetables such as celery and bell pepper and assorted sliced fruit such as apples, figs and pears Instructions: Toss the Gruyere and Emmental with the flour in a medium bowl. Combine the wine and garlic in a fondue pot or medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Gradually add the cheese mixture while stirring constantly, simmering until the cheese is incorporated and thoroughly melted. Stir in the mustard, nutmeg and cherry brandy if using. If you are using a fondue pot, set it over its burner. Otherwise, pour the mixture into a slow cooker and set it to \warm.\ Serve with an assortment of dippers such as baguette cubes, sliced vegetables and sliced fruit. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42457,&quot;Gingerbread Dutch Baby with Poached Maple Pears and Creme Fraiche 1/2 cup creme fraiche 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest<br> 1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped<br> 1 cup granulated sugar 2 cinnamon sticks<br> One 2-inch strip orange peel<br> 1 vanilla bean, split<br> 2 slightly underripe pears (Bosc or Anjou), peeled, halved and cored<br> 1/4 cup Grade B maple syrup<br> 2 large eggs 1/3 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/3 cup whole milk<br> 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice<br> 1 teaspoon light molasses<br> 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> Powdered sugar, for dusting<br> Instructions: For the creme fraiche topping: Whisk together the creme fraiche, vanilla extract, orange zest and vanilla bean seeds in a small bowl until combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight to allow flavors to meld. For the poached maple pears: Meanwhile, combine 4 cups water, the sugar, cinnamon sticks, orange peel and vanilla bean in a high-sided medium skillet over high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until sugar has dissolved. Reduce the heat to a simmer, add the pears and cook, turning a few times, until a thin-bladed knife meets no resistance, about 20 minutes. Remove the pears to a plate and let cool, then then slice each half in half again. Bring the poaching liquid back to a boil and cook until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups. Remove the cinnamon sticks, orange peel and vanilla bean. Add the maple syrup and the poached pears and cook 1 minute longer. Keep warm. For the Dutch baby: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the eggs in a blender and blend for 1 to 2 minutes, until smooth and pale in color. Add the flour, milk, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, molasses and salt, and blend until smooth. Melt the butter in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat, swirling it up the sides to evenly coat the pan. Pour the batter into the skillet and immediately transfer to the oven. Bake until the pancake is puffed and browned, and crisp at the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Dust the Dutch baby with powdered sugar and cut into wedges. Top each wedge with creme fraiche topping, some poached pears and a drizzle of the pear syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 42458,&quot;Mama Thornton&#39;s Peach Pie 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for bench and cutters 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 2 sticks chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 4 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed 10 ripe but firm peaches 1 lemon, juiced 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon or pinch ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 3 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces 1 egg Special equipment: fluted pizza cutter or fluted ravioli cutter Instructions: Cook&#39;s Note: You can increase the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cups, depending upon the sweetness of the peaches. Peak summer peaches will only need 1 cup. For the crust: In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt and cold butter. Pulse the processor until the mixture resembles fine sand. Remove the lid and add the ice water to the mixture. Run the processor just until the mixture rolls itself into a little ball. If the mixture is a bit dry, add more ice water by the tablespoonful until it comes together. Gather the dough into a ball. With a bench scraper or knife, divide the mixture evenly in half. Shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill at least 30 minutes. At this point you can keep the wrapped dough in the refrigerator for a few days or freeze for later use. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Flour your rolling pin and roll out 1 pie crust to about a 12-inch round and drape over a 9 1/2-inch fluted pie plate. Roll out the other pie crust to about a 10-inch round, and cut this into 1-inch strips with a fluted pizza cutter. For the filling: Peel and cut the peaches into 1/4-inch thick slices (you should have about 7 cups) and toss with the lemon juice and almond extract in a large bowl. Whisk the flour, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in another bowl, making sure there are no lumps. Stir the flour mixture into the peaches and mix well. Pour the peaches into the pie crust. Scatter with the pieces of butter. Top with the lattice strips. Brush away any flour underneath the lattice to make sure it seals well. Crimp the edges to seal. Beat the egg with 1 teaspoon water and brush the lattice and edges with the egg wash. Pop in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, and then lower the heat to 350 degrees F and bake until the crust gets brown, about 50 minutes more. If the edges brown too fast, cover them with strips of aluminum foil about halfway through baking. Cool about 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42459,&quot;Four-Cheese Polenta Pinch of baking soda Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups medium-grind stone-ground cornmeal 3 ounces Asiago cheese, grated<br> 2 ounces Gorgonzola cheese<br> 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving<br> 1 clove garlic, zested on a rasp grater<br> Freshly cracked black pepper 1/4 to 1/2 cup milk, as needed<br> Instructions: Bring 6 cups of water to a rolling boil in a heavy-bottomed 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting, add the baking soda and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and pour the cornmeal into the water in a very slow stream from a measuring cup, all the while whisking in a circular motion to prevent lumps. Cook, vigorously stirring the polenta with a wooden spoon for about 10 seconds once every 5 minutes and making sure to scrape clean the bottom and corners of the pot, until the polenta has lost its raw cornmeal taste and becomes soft and smooth, about 30 minutes. If the polenta looks like it&#39;s drying out too quickly, continue cooking with the lid on.<br> Stir in the Asiago, Gorgonzola, mascarpone, butter, Parmesan and garlic. Season to taste with salt and plenty of cracked black pepper. If the polenta is too thick, thin with some milk as desired. Garnish with freshly shaved Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 42460,&quot;Roasted Peppers in Olive Oil 6 red bell peppers 1/2 bunch fresh oregano 2 cloves garlic, sliced 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place the peppers directly onto the burners of a gas stove. Cook the peppers, turning frequently, until they are charred on all sides. Put the peppers into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let them steam for about 15 minutes. (If you do not have a gas stove preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Coat the peppers with some olive oil and place them on a baking sheet. Cook the peppers until they are soft and have collapsed, about 1 hour. Set the peppers aside until they are cool enough to handle.) Peel, stem, and seed the peppers; cut them into wide strips. Place the warm pepper strips into a shallow serving dish. Top with the oregano, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar. Season them with salt and pepper and mix them gently to combine the flavors. Let them sit to cool and serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Vermentino, Garnacha, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 42461,&quot;Sicilian-Style Cauliflower with Whole Wheat Pasta Kosher salt, as needed, plus 2 teaspoons 3/4 pound whole-wheat penne 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed 5 cups 3/4-inch cauliflower florets (about 1 to 1 1/4 pounds) 1 large shallot, sliced into thin rings 2 cloves garlic, smashed 3/4 cup water 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons golden raisins 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon capers 1 sprig fresh thyme 1 bay leaf 2 teaspoons fennel seeds, optional Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted 3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano, plus more as needed Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat, then salt it generously. Add the penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente--tender but not mushy. Drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink. Transfer to a large bowl. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower, shallots, and garlic, and cook, stirring, until the cauliflower is well browned, about 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 2 teaspoons salt, water, vinegar, raisins, honey, capers, thyme, bay leaf, fennel seeds, if using, and season with black pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until cauliflower is fork tender, about 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the pine nuts and parsley. Remove and discard the thyme and bay leaf. Toss vegetables and pasta together along with the pecorino. Drizzle with additional olive oil, if desired. Serve immediately, passing more cheese at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Gavi, Barbera]&quot; 42462,&quot;Freezer to Oven Berry Muffins 3/4 cup fresh blueberries, raspberries or diced strawberries 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2/3 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs 1 cup milk 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, melted 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup light brown sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened Instructions: For the muffins: Line a 12-cup muffin tin with foil muffin cup liners.<br> Toss the berries with 2 tablespoons of the flour in a small bowl.
