Finely slice each halved onion into thin half-moons and add to the pan along with the salt. Fry for about 5 minutes until the onion begins to soften but doesn&#39;t burn; the salt will help to prevent it from burning. While this is going on, quarter the apples (no need to peel), cut away the cores and chop them roughly, and add them to the softening onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5 minutes. Finely shred the cabbage and add it to the onion-apple mixture in the pan, stirring slowly and patiently to mix. Add the brown sugar and allspice and stir, then pour the pomegranate juice into the pan. Let the mixture come to a bubble, then give another stir, turn down the heat, put on a lid and cook very gently at the lowest possible heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. It really won&#39;t get overcooked. Taste for seasoning only when you&#39;re ready to reheat, as the flavours won&#39;t have mellowed and come together properly until then. To reheat, put the pan back on the stove over a medium to low heat, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 3077,&quot;Renaissance Crostini 1/2 cup raisins 3/4 cup apple vinegar or white wine 1 cup water 1/2 cup pine nuts 4 ounces unsalted butter 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 3 1/2 ounces prosciutto, or smoked ham or bacon, diced Freshly ground black pepper 10 slices Italian bread (1/2-inch thick) Olive oil, for brushing bread Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl combine the raisins, vinegar and 1 cup of water. Let stand at least 10 minutes. Strain the liquid into a bowl and reserve the raisins for garnish. Add the pine nuts, the butter and the sugar to a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir until the sugar is melted but not caramelized, about 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly pour in half of the vinegar and water mixture, then the flour, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes dense. Discard the remaining vinegar and water mixture. Add the prosciutto, sprinkle with a little bit of black pepper and remove from the heat. Coat the bread slices with oil and arrange them on a sheet pan. Bake in the oven until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Spread the prosciutto mixture on the crostini and arrange on a serving platter. Garnish with the reserved raisins and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3078,&quot;Peppermint Frosted Vanilla Bean Plaid Cake Nonstick baking spray with flour, for the pans 2 cups granulated sugar<br> 2 tablespoon vanilla bean paste<br> 3 1/2 cups cake flour<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 4 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 2/3 cup full-fat sour cream<br> 1/2 cup canola oil<br> 1 1/3 cups whole milk<br> Red gel food coloring, for the batter and frosting<br> Peppermint Buttercream, recipe follows 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar (from a 1-pound box)<br> Pinch fine salt<br> 1 teaspoon peppermint extract<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\u202fSpray four 8-inch square baking pans with nonstick baking spray. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla bean paste to a small bowl and whisk to combine.\u202f\u202f<br> Add the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.\u202fStir on low to combine. Add the vanilla bean sugar to the bowl and stir until well combined. Add the butter and mix on medium-low speed until you have a fine crumb texture, about 3 minutes.\u202f\u202f<br> Whisk together the eggs, sour cream and oil in a small mixing bowl until smooth. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and beat on medium speed until just combined. Be sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed to make sure everything is incorporated. Slowly add the milk and mix on low until just combined. (The batter will be very liquid.) Remove a quarter of the batter (15 ounces or scant 2 cups) to one of the prepared baking pans and set aside. Remove another quarter of the batter to a mixing bowl. Add a couple drops of red gel food coloring to the mixing bowl and stir to combine until you have a deep red color. Scrape this batter into another prepared baking pan. Add about half the amount of red gel food coloring to the remaining batter in the mixing bowl and mix until you have a medium pink color.\u202fDivide this pink batter between the two remaining prepared cake pans. (There should be about 15 ounces in each.)\u202f\u202f<br> Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean and the cakes have not turned golden brown, 12 to 18 minutes. Let cool completely in the pans on a wire rack.\u202f<br> Tint 1/2 cup of peppermint buttercream frosting with red gel food coloring to get a deep red color, and set aside 1/2 cup of white. Tint the remaining frosting a light pink color. Place the red frosting in a piping bag fitted with a flat tip for wide stripes, and the white frosting in a piping bag fitted with a flat tip that has 4 to 5 holes in it, for parallel thin stripes.<br> Trim each cake to about 7-inches square so any browned or uneven edges are removed.\u202fCut each cake into at least six 1-inch strips. (If you didn&#39;t have to trim your cake much you might get more; this will just be bonus cake snacks for you.)<br> Place four strips of cake side-by-side, alternating pink and white. Spread about 1/4 cup pink frosting atop these and spread in an even layer. Place one red stripe atop each pink one, and one pink stripe atop each white one.\u202fSpread another 1/4 cup pink frosting atop this layer. Repeat topping the red stripes with pink ones, and the pink strips with white ones. Add another 1/4 cup pink frosting and spread evenly. Repeat topping the pink stripes with red ones and the white stripes with pink ones. Spread 1/4 cup pink frosting in an even layer and place a final layer of pink strips atop the red ones and white strips atop the pink ones. Frost the entire outside of the cake with a thin even layer of pink frosting for a crumb coat. Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes, then cover the outside with a thicker layer of pink frosting. Use a bench scraper to smooth out the sides and make the angles crisp.<br> Beginning with the red buttercream and working crosswise on the cake, pipe three evenly-spaced straight lines up one side of the cake, across the top, and down the opposite side.\u202fSwitch to the white buttercream and pipe two additional sets of lines, running in between (and parallel to) the red lines.<br> Now working lengthwise on the cake, pipe two evenly spaced straight lines with the red buttercream up one side, across the top, and down the other side of the entire cake. Follow with one set of white lines in the center.<br> Switch back to the red buttercream and pipe 2 stripes running horizontally around the sides of the cake. Switch back to the white and pipe a set of white stripes running between the red.<br> Combine the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand\u202fmixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer). Mix on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the peppermint extract, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat until smooth. Use immediately, or refrigerate in an airtight container up to 3 days. Allow to come to room temperature before using, then beat on medium-high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3079,&quot;Teriyaki Pancakes with Broccoli, Sausage and Fried Eggs 6 links breakfast sausage, cut in half 1 12-ounce bag broccoli florets 1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pan Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 6 large eggs 1 cup milk 3 tablespoons teriyaki sauce 3 scallions, finely chopped 1 teaspoon toasted sesame or chili sesame oil 1 teaspoon rice vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Toss the sausage, broccoli, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper on a baking sheet. Bake, stirring, until the sausage is browned and the broccoli is charred, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Separate 2 eggs, putting the whites in a large bowl and the yolks in the well in the flour. Whisk the milk, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and 1/2 tablespoon teriyaki sauce into the yolks, then whisk into the flour; stir in the scallions. Whisk the egg whites until stiff; fold into the batter. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; brush with vegetable oil. Ladle ? cup batter into the skillet for each pancake. Cook, flipping once, until golden, about 4 minutes. Keep the pancakes warm on a baking sheet in the oven as they are done. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the skillet and crack in the remaining 4 eggs; season with salt and pepper. Cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 3 minutes. Whisk the remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce, the sesame oil, vinegar and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl. Divide the pancakes, broccoli, sausage and fried eggs among plates. Serve with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 3080,&quot;The Best Lemon Meringue Pie 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar<br> 6 tablespoons very cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<br> 3 to 6 tablespoons ice water<br> 1 cup sugar 5 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice plus 2 teaspoons gently packed lemon zest 4 large egg yolks<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<br> 5 large egg whites 3/4 cup sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> Pinch fine salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Instructions: For the pie crust: Pulse the flour, shortening, sugar, salt and vinegar in a food processor until the mixture looks like damp sand, about 10 pulses. Add the butter and pulse until you can still see large pea-sized pieces. Sprinkle in 3 tablespoons ice water and pulse until the dough begins to come together. Pinch the dough; if it doesn&#39;t hold together, add up to 3 more tablespoons ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough holds together when pinched. Lay out a sheet of plastic wrap and dump the dough onto the plastic. Using the edges of the plastic, press the dough into a disc. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and preferably overnight. (Freeze up to 2 months.) On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a 13-inch round. Place in a 9-inch pie dish, gently pressing the dough into the edges and letting the excess dough drape over the sides. Refrigerate for 2 hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Trim any excess dough with a paring knife and crimp the edges decoratively or press them down with the tines of a fork. Prick the dough on the bottom all over with a fork. Place a sheet of parchment paper inside the dough and fill with pie weights or uncooked rice or beans. Bake for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment and weights and bake until the crust is deep golden brown on the edges and lightly golden in the center, 10 to 12 minutes more. Let the crust cool to room temperature.<br> For the filling: Whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan. Add the lemon juice and 1 1/2 cups water and whisk to combine. Whisk the egg yolks in a separate medium bowl. Place the sugar mixture over medium heat and cook, continuing to gently whisk, until the mixture begins to bubble and is extremely thick. Temper the eggs yolks by slowly adding half of the hot sugar mixture to the yolks while constantly whisking. Add the tempered yolks to the saucepan and return to the heat. Bring the mixture back to a simmer and cook, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and lemon zest until completely melted and incorporated. Pour the filling directly into the pie crust and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the filling (see Cook&#39;s Note). Refrigerate while you make the meringue.<br> For the meringue: Add the egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment along with the sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Whisk together to combine. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture feels hot to the touch. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and add the vanilla. Whisk on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 5 to 6 minutes.<br> Remove the plastic wrap from the pie and gently mound the meringue on top of the filling. Use an offset spatula to make sure the meringue completely covers the filling and meets the crust all around the edges. (This will seal in the filling and help prevent weeping.) Use the offset spatula to create swirls and peaks in the meringue. Toast the meringue using a kitchen torch or broil in the oven until golden brown, keeping an eye on the meringue if broiling, 1 to 2 minutes. Refrigerate the pie until the filling is completely cool and set, about 4 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 3081,&quot;Duck Breast with Balsamic Vinegar Glaze 1 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons honey 1/4 cup dried currants 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 4 whole duck breasts, approximately 6 to 8 ounces each Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 3 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted 4 minutes in a 250 degree oven Instructions: Combine the balsamic vinegar, honey, currants and cayenne in a small pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and reduce by half to form a thick, syrupy glaze. Remove from the heat and set aside. With the point of a knife, score the skin side of the duck breasts in a crosshatch pattern, being careful not to pierce the flesh. Season the duck breasts with the salt and pepper. Heat a saute pan over medium heat 2 minutes before adding the breasts, skin-side down. Cook over medium to low heat approximately 6 to 8 minutes to render the fat. Carefully remove the excess fat from the saute pan, then turn the breasts over and saute the flesh side 3 to 4 minutes before removing the duck breasts from the pan. The breasts should now be medium rare. Slice lengthwise or crosswise and arrange several slices on each plate. Reheat the balsamic vinegar glaze and drizzle some over each of the duck breasts. Sprinkle with toasted pine nuts and serve with Ginger Chestnut Stuffing &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 3082,&quot;Green Eggs and Ham About 1 1/2 quarts water Salt 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar 2 eggs, room temperature 2 slices country-style bread, each 1/2-inch thick 2 thin slices prosciutto 4 teaspoons chive oil, recipe follows Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat a broiler or a lightly oiled stove-top grill pan. Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Salt the water, add the vinegar, and then lower the heat so the water barely bubbles. One at a time, break the eggs into a custard cup or small bowl, and then pour into the water, trying not to break the yolks. With a slotted spoon, gently lift and shape the whites around the egg yolks until glazed but still liquid, about 2 1/2 minutes longer. While the eggs poach, toast the bread slices on both sides. Put a slice of toast on each of 2 plates. Immediately top with the prosciutto so that it softens from the heat of the toast. Lift the poached eggs out of the water with a slotted spoon, letting excess water drip off, and then place an egg on each toast. Drizzle each toast with 2 teaspoons chive oil and then grind a little black pepper over each. Serve immediately.

Add the remaining 1 cup sugar and mix until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add half the corn syrup, then continue mixing until a bit of the marzipan holds together when squeezed, adding additional corn syrup a little at a time, as necessary; the marzipan in the bowl will still appear crumbly. Transfer the marzipan to a work surface and knead until smooth.<br> To make marzipan mushrooms: Roll 1/3 of the marzipan into a 6-inch long cylinder and cut into 1-inch lengths. Roll half the lengths into balls. Press the remaining cylindrical lengths (stems) into the balls (caps) to make mushrooms. Smudge with cocoa powder. To make holly leaves: Knead green color into 1/2 the remaining marzipan and roll it into a long cylinder. Flatten with the back of a spoon, then loosen it from the surface with a spatula. Cut into diamonds to make leaves, or use a cutter.<br> To make holly berries: Knead red color into a tiny piece of marzipan.

With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients alternately in 3 parts, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients, and mix until combined. Stir with a rubber spatula to be sure the batter is mixed. Scoop the batter into the muffin cups with a 2 1/4-inch ice cream scoop or large spoon. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean. Cool completely in the pans and frost the cupcakes with Red Velvet Frosting. Place the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and mix on medium speed just until combined. Don&#39;t whip! Add the sugar and mix until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 3120,&quot;Roast Duck 2 (5 to 5 1/2 pounds each) ducks, innards and wing tips removed 6 quarts chicken broth Kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Unwrap the ducks and allow them to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. With a fork, prick the skin without piercing the meat. This will allow the fat to drain off while the ducks cook. Meanwhile, in a very large stock pot which can hold the 2 ducks, heat the chicken broth with 1 tablespoon of kosher salt until it boils. Add the ducks very carefully and bring the stock back to a boil. If there isn&#39;t enough stock to cover the ducks, add the hottest tap water to cover. If the ducks float to the top, place a plate on top to keep them immersed. When the stock comes back to a boil, lower the heat and simmer the ducks in the stock for 45 minutes. When the ducks are finished simmering, skim off enough duck fat from the top of the stock to pour a film on the bottom of a 14 by 18 by 3-inch roasting pan. This will keep the ducks from sticking when they roast. Carefully take the ducks out of the stock, holding them over the pot to drain. Place them in the roasting pan, pat the skin dry with paper towels, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt and the pepper. If you have time, allow the ducks to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the skin to dry. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. (Be sure your oven is very clean or it will smoke!) Roast the ducks for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow them to rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 20 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 3121,&quot;Second Day Turkey and String Bean Pot Pies 4 servings or 4 cups Leftover Green Bean Casserole (recommended: Campbell&#39;s Soup recipe) 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup turkey, beef, or chicken stock 1 cup roasted turkey meat, chopped 2 standard puff pastry sheets Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

To a hot saute pan, add 2 tablespoons of the butter and immediately add the apples. Saute over high heat while tossing the apples, cooking until the apples begin to soften and brown on the edges, approximately 3 minutes. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the chopped herbs and season with salt and pepper; continue to cook for 30 seconds. Remove the apples from the heat and let them cool for 10 to 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Lay out the pie dough disks and evenly spread 2 tablespoons of the grated cheddar on each. Place approximately 3 to 4 tablespoons of the apple mixture in the center of each pie dough disk. To form the croustade work from the outside in, folding in 2-inch pleats and continue around until the folds meet each other. The croustade should have an accordion look with a hole in the center; it should look like a small volcano. Either set aside and keep refrigerated until ready to bake, or bake in a 450 degree F oven for 8 to 10 minutes until evenly golden brown. Keep warm until ready to use. To prepare the quail: Slice the fennel very thinly. Heat a saute pan over high heat, add 2 tablespoons of butter, and then add the fennel and saute for 3 to 4 minutes until the fennel starts to become tender and translucent. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Let cool for 10 minutes. Carefully open the breast cavity of each quail and fill the cavity with approximately 1 tablespoon of the sauteed fennel. Do not over-stuff the quail, as they will shrink when cooking. Place the quail in a bowl or shallow container. Add 1 1/2 cups of the red wine, the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of chopped herbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Gently toss the quail to evenly disperse the herbs, salt and pepper. Marinate the quail in the refrigerator, covered, for at least 3 hours and up to 12 hours. In a separate bowl, combine the blueberries and the remaining 1/2 cup of wine and let sit for 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Remove the quail from the marinade and drain off the excess liquid, discarding the remaining marinade. To a large oven-safe saute pan over high heat, add enough vegetable oil to evenly coat the pan (about 2 tablespoons). Place the quail, breast-side down, in the pan and cook for 2 minutes or until evenly browned. Turn the quail over and cook for 1 minute on the other side, or until browned. Place the saute pan in the oven and roast for 8 to 10 minutes, or until fully cooked through. Remove the quail from the pan and immediately add the wine and blueberry mixture. Return the pan to the stovetop and cook over high heat for 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock. Season with salt and pepper and add a healthy pinch of the herb blend. Continue to cook for 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and remove from the heat. Whisk the sauce until the butter is incorporated. Place a warm croustade on each plate. Split the quail down the middle and arrange around the croustade. Drizzle the sauce on and around the quail and evenly distribute the blueberries. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 3130,&quot;Pannukakku 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature<br> 2 cups milk, at room temperature<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Notes)<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting<br> Jam, fresh fruit and whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and place a 9-by-13-inch metal pan on the rack. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a small bowl in the microwave and set aside to cool.<br> Whisk the eggs and yolk in a large bowl until well combined and frothy, about 1 minute.

Stir to moisten the entire surface of the mushrooms. Set aside at room temperature for at least 3 hours and up to 4 hours. When the mushrooms are nearly rehydrated, toss the cabbage with 1 tablespoon salt in a medium bowl and let sit until liquid pools at the bottom, about 15 minutes. Squeeze out as much water as possible from the cabbage in between two hands and transfer the cabbage to a large bowl. Add the pork, 1/2 cup of the mushroom soaking water, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, sugar, white pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix only in one direction using chopsticks until the pork-and-cabbage mixture starts to become sticky. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the neutral oil until evenly mixed. Remove and discard the stems from the mushrooms. Finely chop the mushrooms and add to the pork filling. Stir until combined. Set up a dumpling wrapping station with the following: a small bowl of cold water for sealing, the pork-and-cabbage filling, gyoza wrappers kept in the package and a large plate or baking sheet lined with plastic wrap to prevent the dumplings from sticking. Place one gyoza wrapper in your palm, add 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center, then lightly dab the perimeter of the wrapper with cold water (I use my index finger). Fold into a half-moon shape and seal the midpoint, leaving the sides open. Make 2 pleats starting from the left side of the half-moon folding towards the midpoint then firmly press the pleated side to seal. Repeat the pleating on the right side. Firmly press to seal the dumpling and thin out the edge of the wrapper slightly. Place the finished dumplings on the prepared plate. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling (see Cook\u2019s Note). Whisk together 1/2 cup cold water, 1 teaspoon of the cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon of the flour and 1/4 teaspoon of the white vinegar in a small bowl until the slurry is smooth and free of lumps. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons neutral oil in a large nonstick skillet (about 11-inch) over medium-high heat until shimmering. Arrange 10 dumplings in a concentric circle or flower pattern (place the pointy end of each dumpling in the center of the skillet with the pleated side of the next dumpling facing the flat side of the previous one). Fry until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir the slurry before pouring into the skillet, cover with a lid, and cook over medium heat until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Uncover and cook over medium heat, moving the skillet as needed for even browning, until the skirt looks dry, crisp and golden brown. Remove from the heat, place a large dinner plate over the skillet and carefully invert the dumplings onto the plate with the skirt-side up. Serve immediately with Chinese black vinegar, for dipping. Repeat making the slurry and frying the remaining dumplings or freeze the dumplings on the plastic wrap\u2013lined plate until frozen, then transfer the frozen dumplings to a freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 3132,&quot;Malaysian Indian Curry-Spiced Beef Burgers Canola oil, as needed 1/2 red pepper 1 jalapeno 1/4 red onion, thickly sliced 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed Freshly cracked black pepper, as needed 1/4 cup curry powder, plus more as needed* (See Cook&#39;s Note) 3 medium cloves garlic, grated 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and grated 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon garam masala, optional 1 pound ground beef, 85 to 88 percent lean 2 green onions, chopped 2 teaspoons ketchup 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon soy sauce 1/2 cup homemade or good quality mayonnaise, recipe follows 10 mint leaves, chopped 2 green onions, chopped 1 reserved grilled jalapeno, seeded (from burger recipe) 2 cloves garlic, grated 1 teaspoon curry powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 lime, zested and juiced<br> 1 lime, zested and juiced 1 cup fried onion snacks (recommended: French&#39;s Fried Onions) 1 tablespoon garam masala 4 brioche rolls (if brioche is not available, you can use a sweet and sturdy roll, such as a Portuguese hard roll) 4 brioche rolls (if brioche is not available, you can use a sweet and sturdy roll, such as a Portuguese hard roll)<br> 1/2 English cucumber, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds, about 16 pieces total 1 package pre-washed baby lettuce mix 1 egg yolk 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 1/8 teaspoon sugar 1 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1 cup canola oil Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium and lightly grease the grates with canola oil.<br> Drizzle the red pepper, jalapeno and sliced onions with olive oil, and season them with salt, pepper, to taste, and curry powder.

Brush the patties with olive oil, season both sides with salt and pepper, and put them the grill. Cook the patties to medium-rare or medium doneness, about 3 minutes on the first side, then 4 to 5 minutes on the second side. Make sure to rotate the patties once on each side to achieve nice crosshatch marks. Once cooked, transfer the patties to a plate and tent them with aluminum foil. Allow them to rest for at least 10 minutes.<br> Combine the mayonnaise, mint, green onion, grilled jalapeno, garlic, curry powder, cumin, lime zest and juice in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture is well integrated, but there are still chunks of green onion and jalapeno remaining. Season the puree with salt and black pepper, to taste.

Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, pat dry the filets mignons with paper towels. Brush the filets lightly all over with the oil. Combine the fleur de sel and cracked pepper on a plate and roll the filets on all sides in the mixture, pressing lightly to help the salt and pepper adhere. The steaks should be evenly coated with the salt and pepper. When the pan is extremely hot, add the steaks and sear evenly on all sides (top, bottom, and sides) for about 2 minutes per side. (Be sure the cooking area is well ventilated.) You&#39;ll probably need about 3 turns to sear the sides and about 10 minutes total. Remove the pan from the heat and arrange all the filets flat in the pan. Top each with a tablespoon of butter, then place the pan in the oven.

Toss the pound cake, strawberries and 1 1/2 cups sugar in a large bowl until the cake and berries are coated well on all sides with sugar (they can be a little lumpy and unevenly coated). Thread a piece of cake and a strawberry onto a skewer; repeat 3 times on the skewer. Repeat with the remaining skewers and ingredients. Set the skewers on a rimmed baking sheet. Whisk together the cream, the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and the vanilla in a medium bowl. Beat with a hand or stand mixer until soft peaks form. Cover and refrigerate. Lightly oil the grill grates. Put the skewers on the grill, and grill, covered, until they are lightly marked, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to gently loosen them, and use tongs to flip them over. Continue to grill, covered, until the cake and strawberries are toasted with grill marks and the sugar starts to bubble and harden, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve with the whipped cream on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 3140,&quot;Loaded Cream Cheese Bread Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking sheets and bowl 3 3/4 cups unbleached bread flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon rapid rise dry yeast 1 large egg, beaten, for the egg wash 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/4 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and minced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 1/3 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons minced garlic Kosher salt 1 large egg, beaten 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley Instructions: For the rolls: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, then spray with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook and stir to combine. With the mixer on low speed, add 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups cool water and mix until the dough forms a ball. If the dough is dry and shaggy, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth and firm, about 10 minutes. Add the dough to a lightly greased large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside until the dough doubles in size, 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and divide into four equal pieces. Gently form each piece into a ball and set on one of the prepared baking sheets. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rest 20 to 25 minutes. Brush the tops of the dough with egg wash and bake until the tops are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Prepare the filling: Meanwhile, combine the cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl, mixing until smooth. Transfer to a plastic sandwich bag. Snip one corner of the bag to create a 1/2-inch hole. Prepare the garlic butter: In a small saucepan, melt the butter, then add the milk, garlic and a pinch of salt. Heat over low heat until the milk is warmed through. In a medium bowl (about 6 inches across the top), whisk the egg and parsley together. While constantly whisking, slowly pour the milk mixture into the egg mixture until combined. Cover to keep warm and set aside. (If the butter starts to solidify, reheat very gently.) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Assemble: Slice into the top of each roll to create 8 equal wedges, being careful to not cut all the way through the bottom. Pipe about an inch of filling between the wedges of each roll. Finish by piping a dollop into the center of each roll. Holding a roll upside-down, dip the entire top into the garlic-butter mixture and place on the second prepared baking sheet, cut-side up. Repeat for each roll. Bake until the rolls are dark golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3141,&quot;Butter Toffee Hazelnuts and Dark Chocolate 4 1/2 ounces butter 3 ounces water 14 ounces sugar 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 5 ounces chopped, toasted hazelnuts Tempered Chocolate, recipe follows 5 ounces dark chocolate couverture, chopped, divided Instructions: In a small saucepan, melt the butter and water on high heat. Add the sugar and corn syrup. Wipe down the sides of the saucepan with a damp pastry brush to remove any loose sugar crystals. Cook the sugar mixture to 300 degrees F. Remove from the heat and set the pan over an ice bath for 5 to 10 seconds to stop the cooking. Remove from the ice bath. Add the vanilla and baking soda, stirring to incorporate. Quickly pour the mixture onto a silicone pad and spread thin. Sprinkle with chopped hazelnuts. Let set until completely cool, 5 to 7 minutes. Once the toffee is set, turn over onto a sheet of parchment. Spread a thin layer of fluid, Tempered Chocolate onto the toffee and let set. Once set, the chocolate should be shiny, hard, and should snap with any given resistance. Turn back over and break into desired pieces. Over a double boiler, melt 4 ounces chocolate to 115 degrees to 120 degrees F. Bring the bowl, with the chocolate, to a flat, clean work surface ( preferably marble or stainless steel ), wiping away any excess water or steam from the bowl. With rubber spatula, fully incorporate the remaining 1-ounce chocolate. Bring down the temperature of the chocolate to 80 to 84 degrees F by either stirring constantly in a figure 8 motion, or tabling (see Cook&#39;s Note). Once cooled, test the chocolate by dipping a small strip of parchment paper into the melted chocolate, and then lay it down on a clean work surface. If tempered, the chocolate on the parchment paper should be dry, hard, shiny, and without any streaks in 3 to 5 minutes. If any of these occur, keep stirring (agitating) the chocolate, or table it again, until a parchment paper test shows that the chocolate is tempered. When tempered, bring the chocolate back to the double boiler and reheat to NO HIGHER than 89 degrees F. (Bringing the temperature back up aids in a more fluid working consistency.) Transfer the chocolate to a chocolate warmer or set the bowl on top of a heating pad (at medium setting) to keep in temper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 3142,&quot;Rudolph&#39;s Cranberry Antlers Cocktail 5 cranberries 3 sprigs fresh rosemary 3/4 ounce maple syrup<br> 2 ounces gin<br> 3/4 ounce cranberry juice<br> 3/4 ounce sweet vermouth<br> Splash Champagne<br> 1 marshmallow<br> 2 cloves<br> Instructions: Muddle 4 of the cranberries and 1 of the rosemary sprigs with the maple syrup in a shaker.

Recipe Description: Working on this makeover of a classic Russian Tea Cake made Bridget Klein feel closer to her late sister, Gina, because they are \a great match for her personality: delicate and refined, pretty to look at, and yet a definite character that inspires adoration and loyalty.\ Gina&#39;s middle name, Sarah, means \princess,\ in Hebrew; hence the name of these confections. Klein&#39;s mom \swore these cookies couldn&#39;t be made without butter,\ she says, \until she tasted them.\ Klein continues: \Gina was a traditionalist, too, but I think I might have been able to fool her with these.<br> Recipe Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Pour oil into a medium bowl. Whisk all-purpose flour, white whole-wheat flour, 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, cornstarch and salt in another bowl. Mix half the dry ingredients into the oil by spoonfuls. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add vanilla. Mix in the remaining dry ingredients by spoonfuls until thoroughly combined. (The mixture will resemble creamed butter and brown sugar.) Stir in nuts. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls; place about 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake the cookies until just set, being careful not to let the bottoms get too brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the pan for 2 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly. When the cookies are still warm, but no longer hot, roll them in the remaining 1 3/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar and place them back on the rack to continue cooling. (Reserve the sugar.)

Heat 2 inches of oil to 350 degrees F. Place the rice flour and baking powder in a large heatproof bowl, then whisk to combine and set aside. Combine the brown sugar, salt and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring so that the sugar dissolves. Remove it from the heat and stir it into the rice flour to form a thick, sticky, doughy batter. Let it cool slightly, for about 5 minutes, then turn it onto a surface liberally dusted with rice flour. Knead it, adding more flour as needed, until it is just smooth enough to handle (this may take quite a bit more flour, up to 1/3 cup), for about 2 minutes. It should still be slightly sticky. Divide it into 12 balls and cover them with plastic wrap. Place the sesame seeds in a small bowl or on a plate. To shape, flatten each ball slightly with your thumb, add about 3/4 teaspoon chocolate hazelnut spread and then gather up the sides and pinch to seal shut. Roll it in the sesame seeds to coat it all over, brushing with a bit of water if it&#39;s too dry for the seeds to stick.<br> Fry the balls in batches until they&#39;re browned, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel. Let cool slightly and serve. These are best enjoyed immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 3161,&quot;Lemon\u2013White Chocolate Brownies 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 6 ounces white chocolate, chopped 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 2 large eggs 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 3 large eggs 1 cup granulated sugar 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (from 4 to 5 lemons) 1/4 cup all-purpose flour Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Yellow candies, for decorating Instructions: Make the brownie layer: Preheat the oven to 350?.

Peel the eggplant and slice into 1/4-inch thick slices. Coat each side of the eggplant with the flour. In a separate bowl beat 4 eggs and dip the eggplant into the egg to coat both sides. Then take your bread crumbs and do the same to coat each side. Once the oil is hot, put the eggplant in the hot oil and fry until golden brown. You can also use a deep-fryer and leave in for about 2 to 3 minutes. Once all of the eggplant has been fried, get a rectangular baking pan and start the layering by adding the marinara sauce to the bottom of the pan, then the eggplant, more sauce, fresh mozzarella, Romano cheese, and continue to layer until you have reached the top of the pan. Top off with sauce, mozzarella, and grated Romano Place the eggplant into the oven and cook for 20 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 3163,&quot;Crystallized Flowers 2 large egg whites, at room temperature 1 teaspoon water 1 dozen pesticide-free edible flowers, such as violets, marigolds, and rose petals 1 cup superfine sugar Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the egg whites and water; beat lightly with a fork.

Chop up the reserved rabbit bones. Put the bones and butter in an ovenproof saucepan and roast until browned. Transfer the pan to the stovetop and set over medium heat. Add the shallots, garlic, sage, and rosemary and when they begin to turn golden, add the wine and cook until it evaporates. Add the water and simmer until reduced to one-third of its initial volume. To make the spezzatino: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the reserved rabbit meat into 1-inch cubes and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a roasting pan set over medium heat. Add the rabbit, and let it color on all sides. Add the garlic, shallot, rosemary, and sage, and cook just to develop a little color. Add the wine, let it evaporate, and then add all the rabbit stock. Roast, uncovered, until the meat is tender, 20 to 30 minutes (add water to the pan if the juices begin to burn). Transfer the meat to a plate with a slotted spoon and remove and discard the herb sprigs. Add the cream to the pan gravy and reduce over medium heat until it has thickened but is still a little runny. To Serve: Spoon some of the rabbit in the middle of a plate. Top with Funghi di Bosco. Try and turn the bucatini around the rabbit to make a nest (it won&#39;t completely stay in place), sprinkle chopped parsley on top, and finish with a drizzle of olive oil. To make the dough: Put the flour in a mixing bowl, make a well in the center, and break the eggs and yolks in the middle. Add the olive oil to the well and beat with a fork to incorporate the olive oil with the eggs. Slowly begin to assimilate flour until you have a thick paste and can begin working with your fingers and assimilate the rest. Put the dough on a lightly floured countertop and knead for a few minutes until the dough is elastic. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. To finish: Bring a large pot filled with salted water to a boil. Drop the pasta in the water and cook until the bucatini is al dente (try one to check), 2 to 4 minutes. Put the butter and sage in a saute pan set over medium heat and let the butter solids turn brown. Add the bucatini to the pan along with a little pasta cooking water (this stops the butter from browning) and keep moving the pasta gently in the pan until the water evaporates. Add the cheese. Serve with the sage leaves, if you like. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange the mushrooms in a baking dish. Melt the butter with the sage and garlic in a small pan set over medium heat. When the butter solids have turned a nutty blond, pour the butter (discard the garlic and sage) over the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and roast, turning occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender but still slightly al dente, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer them to a bowl, toss with the parsley, drizzle with olive oil, and keep warm. Melt the fontina in a microwave oven on high heat, cooking for 1 minute intervals, until the cheese is runny. Pour into a pastry bag and immediately roll out the bucatini dough. If the cheese hardens in the meantime, you can reheat it in the microwave for a few seconds, but only if the bag has a plastic (not metal) tip. Roll out the bucatini dough using a pasta machine, always dusting the pasta sheet with flour to prevent sticking, until the sheet is 1/32-inch thick (or slightly thinner, if you can). Cut the pasta sheet crosswise into strips 2 1/2 to 3-inches wide (and about 4-inches long). Brush the strips with egg white and squeeze out a rope of fontina stuffing down the length of the strip, stopping 1/4-inch from each end. Roll the pasta strip over the stuffing until you have a tightly stuffed cylinder. The pasta should roll over itself twice. Pinch the ends closed and then cut off the pinched part to seal the bucatini. Make at least 24 bucatini. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 3165,&quot;Pacific Peach 1 1/2 ounces whiskey liqueur, such as Southern Comfort 3/4 ounce fresh lime juice 1/2 ounce Simple Syrup, recipe follows 1/4 ounce peach schnapps 3 ounces brewed black tea Lemon wedge, for garnish 1 cup granulated sugar Instructions: Fill a pint glass with ice.

Add the Sofrito (see recipe below), water, Worcestershire, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, paprika, black pepper and salt. Toss to coat the pork. Refrigerate and marinate for at least 8 hours up to 2 days. (The longer you marinate, the better.) Preheat the oven 350 degrees F. Cover the Dutch oven and braise the pork until very tender, about 3 hours and 30 minutes. Once you take the pork out, it will be so juicy and tender you will be able to separate it with the gentle touch of a fork. For the Garlic Sauce: Blend the scallions, mayonnaise, water and garlic together until smooth (then sample and taste the power of this sauce!). Refrigerate for up to 3 days. For the Plantains: Fill a large pot about halfway with oil, attach a deep fat-fry thermometer and heat to 350 degrees F. Peel and cut plantains in half lengthwise. Add in batches to the hot oil and fry until golden, about 6 minutes. Remove and flatten each half (I like to use a heavy flat dish). Return batches of the flattened plantains back into the oil about for another minute. Remove to paper towel-lined plate and set aside until ready to use. Assemble: Place a piece of fried/flattened plantain on a plate, top with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and pulled pork. Drizzle with ketchup and garlic sauce and sandwich with another plantain. Enjoy the messy deliciousness. You could eat with your hands, but I prefer using knife and fork to keep appearances. Finely chop the green onions, crushed red pepper, garlic and onion in a food processor. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is soft and translucent. Cool and refrigerate for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 3183,&quot;We Miss You Elvis Cocktail 1/4 cup salted peanuts 2 tablespoons sugar 2 ounces vanilla vodka, such as Smirnoff, plus more for dipping 1 frozen banana 2 ounces white chocolate liqueur, such as Godiva Instructions: Finely chop half the peanuts and mix them with the sugar.

Put the oats, pepitas, and almonds in a bowl and mix evenly. In a small saucepan, warm the oil, apple juice, honey and salt over low heat, stirring until combined. Pour over the oat mixture and toss to coat well. Spread this mixture on the baking sheet and bake in the hot oven for 20 minutes, or until golden, turning over occasionally. Cool, then transfer to a small container and place in freezer until needed. Place the nonfat milk in a sauce pan and cook over low heat, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until reduced to half. Set aside until cool. Remove pits from the dates and chop into pieces the size of peas. Place 1/2 the date pieces in the freezer on a plate and reserve until later. Place the remaining date pieces in the blender with the cooled milk and puree until smooth. Place the yolks and sugar in a bowl and whisk vigorously until pale and fluffy. Meanwhile, bring the Half and half to a full rolling boil and pour immediately over the yolk mixture while whisking all the time. Add the date and milk mixture and the vanilla. Cool and pour into the container of an ice cream machine. Freeze according to the manufacturers instructions, for 2 to 4 hours or until set.

Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Coat with more cooking spray and dust with flour, shaking out the excess. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, 2 to 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, combine the milk and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the milk mixture in two batches. Beat until just combined, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Fold in the sprinkles. Divide the batter between the prepared pans; smooth the tops. Bake until the cakes are light golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in the pans, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Combine the egg whites, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, the cream of tartar and salt in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 4 minutes. In a medium pot fitted with a candy thermometer, heat the remaining 1 cup granulated sugar and the water over medium-high heat, undisturbed, until the thermometer registers 235 degrees F. With the mixer on medium speed, slowly drizzle the hot syrup into the egg white mixture. Increase the mixer speed to high and continue to beat until the frosting is no longer steaming, about 3 minutes. Add the butter, one piece at a time, and continue to beat until thick and smooth, about 2 more minutes. (It&#39;s OK if the frosting looks curdled -- keep beating and it will eventually smooth out.) Add the vanilla and beat until incorporated. Assemble the cake: Place 1 cake layer on a cake stand and spread with 1 cup of the frosting. Place the remaining cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting (this is the crumb coat). Refrigerate until the frosting is set, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the fondant on a confectioners&#39; sugar-dusted surface into a long rectangle, about 2 by 7 3/4 inches. Wrap the fondant around the bent metal straw, leaving about 2 inches bare at the bottom. Pinch the seam to close, then roll the straw and fondant between your hands to smooth it out. (If using a plastic straw, insert a wooden skewer through it for stability.) Cover the cake with the remaining frosting in a smooth, even layer. Mark a spot on the top of the cake that&#39;s slightly off center (this is where the straw will go). Sprinkle confetti sprinkles on the cake so they radiate out from the marked spot and go down the side of the cake. Rub or brush a thin layer of corn syrup all over the fondant-covered straw, then roll in confetti sprinkles, pressing to adhere. Insert the straw into the cake at the marked spot, then place a small treat bag on the bent end, using a little corn syrup to stick it on, if necessary. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 3194,&quot;Ribs with Big Daddy Rub 5 pounds St. Louis style ribs 2 cups Big Daddy Rub, recipe follows 2 liters cola (recommended: Coca-Cola) 4 cups water Apple Cider Buttermilk Dipping Sauce, recipe follows 3 cups brown sugar 1/4 cup kosher salt 1/4 cup smoked paprika 2 tablespoons ground cumin 2 tablespoons hot chili powder 2 tablespoons cayenne 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons red pepper flakes 2 cups apple cider 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons buttermilk 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon lemon zest Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour the chocolate mixture into the front and back cavities of a 2-part medium plastic skull mold (3-by-4-by-4-inch) and tilt to swirl the chocolate around until coated entirely (you can also use your finger to swirl the chocolate around). Tap out any excess and freeze until the chocolate is set, about 5 minutes.<br> Reheat the melted chocolate, if needed, and brush the sides of the mold cavities with a second layer. Freeze until set, about 5 minutes.<br> Carefully unmold the skull halves and fill one with the sliced strawberries. Microwave the melted chocolate again until smooth, about 30 seconds. Use the melted chocolate as glue to carefully attach the skull halves. Refrigerate until ready to serve.<br> For the cake and filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 6-inch round cake pan with 3-inch sides with nonstick spray. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment and spray the paper.<br> Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.<br> Beat the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat on low just to incorporate, then beat on high until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl, and continue to beat until creamy, about 2 minutes (the mixture will look curdled, but will come back together after everything is combined). With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the sour cream in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.<br> Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.<br> Bake until golden on top and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pan, turn the cake out onto the rack, remove the parchment and cool completely.<br> Meanwhile toss the sliced strawberries and granulated sugar in a medium bowl. Set aside for at least 30 minutes to allow the strawberries to release their juices.<br> Cut the cake into 3 layers with a long serrated knife. Place a cake layer on a cake stand and top with half of the strawberries. Spread 3/4 cup of the whipped cream on top. Repeat with another cake layer, the remaining strawberries and 3/4 cup whipped cream. Top with the final cake layer and remaining 1/2 cup whipped cream. Position the skull in the center of the whipped cream. For the strawberry white chocolate sauce: Add the strawberries and granulated sugar to a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the strawberries have broken down and thickened slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and vanilla. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve and return the liquid to the saucepan (discard the solids). Add the cream and red candy melting wafers to the sauce and heat over medium heat, whisking constantly, until melted and hot, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> When ready to serve, pour the hot sauce over the center of the chocolate skull. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 3201,&quot;Puff Pastry-Wrapped Angel Hair Pasta Pie Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 ounces angel hair pasta 2 tablespoons olive oil 5 spicy Italian sausage links (about 1 pound)<br> 1 small onion, chopped 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon tomato paste One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes Nonstick cooking spray, for the springform pan 2 sheets puff pastry from a 17.3-ounce package<br> One 9-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry 12 ounces shredded mozzarella Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Wipe out the pot, add the oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add the sausage, onions and garlic and cook, flipping the sausage and stirring occasionally, until the sausage is browned and the onions are soft and starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until the sauce starts to thicken and the sausage is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and set aside. Add the pasta to the pan and stir to coat.<br> Meanwhile, coat a 9-inch nonstick springform pan with cooking spray. Roll out 1 puff pastry sheet to a 13-inch square. Transfer it to the prepared pan, pressing it into the bottom and up the sides and allowing the excess pastry to hang over the rim. Spread half of the pasta mixture in the pan. Arrange the sausage on top of the pasta around the rim of the pan to create a ring. Evenly spread the spinach in the middle of the sausage ring. Top with the mozzarella, then the rest of the pasta mixture. Place the second pastry sheet on top of the pasta and pinch the edges of both the bottom and top pastry together to seal, then trim the edges. Cut a slit in the center of the puff pastry to allow the steam to escape.<br> Bake until the pastry is browned and puffed on top, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes before serving.

Put the hot rice in a bowl and toss with the Sushi Vinegar. Let cool. Transfer the rice to a medium saucepan and pour the Dashi over it; stir to combine. Bring to a boil, uncovered. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the light-colored soy, then pour the eggs right over the rice without stirring. Cook for 10 to 15 seconds, until the eggs are barely set. Remove the pan from the heat. Divide the rice among individual bowls and top each with wasabi, nori, and mitsuba. Serve immediately. In a large bowl add all the ingredients and stir to dissolve the sugar. Pour into a covered container. The sushi vinegar will keep for at least 2 months The night before using the dashi, wipe the kombu clean with a wet kitchen towel to remove any grit, but do not rub off the white powder; much of the flavor lies in its natural MSG. Place in a medium saucepan and add the spring water. Let stand at room temperature overnight. The next day, remove the kombu and bring the water to a simmer over medium heat. When it reaches a boil, remove from the heat and add the bonito flakes. Let stand until the bonito flakes sink to the bottom of the saucepan, about 15 minutes. Line a wire sieve with moistened, squeezed-dry cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Strain the dashi through the sieve. Use the dashi within a couple of hours of making. Do not refrigerate or freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 3225,&quot;Easy Ghost Cake Nonstick cooking spray 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons cornstarch 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups granulated sugar 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 3 large eggs, at room temperature 2 large egg yolks, at room temperature 2 cups buttermilk, well-shaken 4 sticks (2 cups) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 tablespoons whole milk 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 6 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar (about 1 1/2 pounds) Black gel food coloring Instructions: For the cake: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat one 9-inch round cake pan and one 9-inch square cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line the bottom of each with parchment paper; lightly coat the paper with nonstick spray. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a large bowl until combined. Beat the butter, granulated sugar, oil and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl until the batter is completely combined, smooth and creamy. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Scrape the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Smooth the tops. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the cakes are a light golden brown and a tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer the pans to a wire rack and let the cakes cool for 30 minutes. Run a knife around the sides of the cakes and invert onto the wire rack. Remove the parchment and let the cakes cool completely.\u202f For the frosting: Meanwhile, beat the butter in a stand mixer on medium-high speed until very creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Mix the milk, vanilla and salt in a liquid measuring cup, then add it to the butter. Mix slowly on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium and beat until very smooth. Add half of the confectioners\u2019 sugar and beat on low speed until just combined. Scrape the bowl again with a rubber spatula. Add the remaining confectioners\u2019 sugar and beat on low speed until combined and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then mix on medium-low speed until fluffy and well combined, about 5 minutes. Transfer 1/2 cup of the frosting to a small bowl and mix in black gel food coloring until very pigmented. Set both bowls of frosting aside at room temperature until ready to assemble the cake. For assembling: Once the cakes have cooled completely, place the square cake, domed-side down, in the center of a large cutting board or platter (this will be the body of the ghost). Place the round cake domed-side down and cut in half with a sharp knife into 2 half-moons. Place one half-moon above the square cake with the cut-side adjoining the body (this will be the head of the ghost). Repeat with the other half-moon below the body (this will be the bottom of the ghost from which two arms will be cut). Next, cut a scalloped edge of 3 curves, each about 2 inches wide, into the bottom of the ghost, keeping the cake scrap intact as one piece. Then cut two oval-shaped arms from that cake scrap. Place one arm on each side of the ghost\u2019s body. There should be minimal cake scraps left; enjoy or save for another use. Use a little white frosting to help adhere the head, bottom and arms to the body. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining white frosting, smoothing out the top with an offset spatula. Transfer the black frosting to a piping bag fitted with a small round pastry tip; pipe two eyes and a mouth onto the ghost. Serve right away or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3226,&quot;My Mama&#39;s Marvelous Mulled Wine 2 bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon 1/2 cup brown sugar 12 whole cloves 4 cinnamon sticks 2 cups port (a sweet Portuguese wine) 2 cups brandy Instructions: Combine all the ingredients, except the port and brandy, into a large copper or cast-iron pot (not aluminum).

(Mine is 16 quarts.) Rinse the garlic heads in cold water, then peel off the papery skin. Break the garlic head into individual cloves. Rinse and cut the roots off the cilantro. Cut a piece of cheesecloth the size of a kitchen towel. Put the garlic cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves, achiote seeds and cilantro on the cheesecloth, bring the ends together to make a little pouch, and tie the loosely with kitchen twine. Give the pouch a couple of good whacks with your kitchen mallet, and add it to the pot. Add enough cold water to cover the chicken by at least 2 to 3 inches. Drop in the ham hock, if using. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, skimming foam off of the top as it forms. When the water comes to a boil, adjust the heat so the broth cooks at a steady, but not rolling boil. Cook for 30 minutes. Check to make sure the breasts are cooked through, then remove them from the pan. Cook 15 minutes more, then remove the legs and thighs. Set the chicken aside to make another chicken dish. (If you&#39;re using backs, necks, wings, etc., you don&#39;t have to remove anything.) Leave the backs, necks and wings in to further flavor the broth. Cook for 1 hour. Set a strainer over a large bowl and line the strainer with a couple of layers of cheesecloth. Carefully strain the broth through the cheesecloth. (Ladling it is the easiest and safest way.)

You&#39;ll finish with long ropes of taffy. Cut it into pieces or shape into figures and animals. Some tips when making taffy: Oil the top 1-inch of the saucepans wall to keep the sugar from boiling over. Always use a pan bigger than you think you need to prevent boiling over. Always use a burner as big or bigger than your pans bottom. Never scrape the bottom of the pan at the end, just pour out the syrup.

Beat together the egg and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat together the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the grapefruit zest and chopped basil until incorporated. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br> Reduce the speed to low, slowly pour in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture, in 3 additions, increasing the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters themselves as needed. Once all the flour mixture is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough at least 1 hour and up to overnight. To roll, cut and bake the cookies: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Dust another sheet of parchment paper with flour and put 1 piece of the dough on top. Dust with more flour and top with another sheet of parchment. Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick (about 11 x 9 inches) and place in the freezer for 5 minutes. From 1 piece of rolled dough, cut out cookies with a 3-inch cutter and arrange cookies on the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Refrigerate while you cut the remaining cookies. Reroll and cut any scraps of dough. If the dough becomes very soft and difficult to roll or cut at any point during the process, place on a baking sheet in the freezer for 5 minutes. Bake, rotating the baking sheets front to back and bottom to top about halfway through, until golden brown around the edges, about 12 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes. For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add the grapefruit juice and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes, adding more grapefruit juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, if needed. Color icing as desired with gel food coloring. Fit pastry bags with small round tips and fill with the icing. Decorate the cookies as desired and let dry for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3307,&quot;Blueberry Lemonade 4 cups fresh blueberries 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 6 cups sugar 24 lemons, juiced<br> Instructions: For the blueberry syrup: Put the blueberries, sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan.

For the brine: Combine the apple cider and water in a large, oval Dutch oven. Add the salt and sugar and stir until it dissolves. Add the black peppercorns and bay leaves. Add the brisket and let soak in the brine solution for up to 3 hours in the refrigerator. For the rub: Combine the salt, paprika, pepper, sugar, and onion powder together in a bowl.

Feel free to use whatever ingredients your party likes and has available. This technique is for an indoor clambake. Optimally, a clambake is held on the beach in a rock lined sand pit in which a fire has been going for hours and the red embers have heated the rocks to over 400 degrees. Placing the large wash tin on a few lit burners on the stovetop can create a similar effect. Place rocks down first. Let heat for 15 minutes. Once rocks are hot, place seaweed on rocks then begin to insert the clams. Place one pie tin above the clams. Place leeks and butter in the tin, cover with the second tin. Continue adding rest of ingredients. Pour 2 gallons of fresh water (or sea water if possible) over entire tub. Cover tightly and let steam and cook for at least 20 minutes. When eggs on top have become hard-boiled, the rest of ingredients should be cooked as well. Plate and eat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 3385,&quot;Garlic and Cheese Crack Bread 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon minced garlic<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> One 1-pound cheese sourdough or plain sourdough loaf of bread, preferably an Asiago cheese loaf<br> 1 cup shredded Wisconsin brick cheese 1 cup shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack blend 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning<br> Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Toss together the chicken, cilantro, mint, scallion and 2 tablespoons of the peanut sauce in a large bowl until well coated.<br> Set up your rolling station with a damp cutting board, a medium bowl filled with water and a serving platter. Place the orange, red and yellow bell peppers, beets, carrots, cucumber, rice noodles, chicken-herb mixture and rice paper wrappers nearby.<br> Take 1 rice paper wrapper and wet it with some water until just slightly softened. Lay it on the cutting board and make sure it is completely flat. Arrange 3 mint leaves about 1/4-inch from one another, in the middle of the wrapper (the tips of each mint leaf should be pointing up and away from you). Take 3 slices of yellow bell pepper and lay them over the first mint leaf. Take 3 slices of red bell pepper and lay them over the second mint leaf. Take 3 slices of orange bell pepper and lay them over the third mint leaf. Lay 6 slices of beet, slightly shingled, over the bell pepper layer. There should be about a 1-inch of space above and below the beet edge where the bell peppers peak out slightly. Shingle 6 slices of cucumbers right above the beets and over the pepper ends. Shingle 6 slices of carrots right below the beets and over the pepper ends. Take a bunch of the cut rice noodles, about the same diameter of a silver dollar, and put them on top of the candy cane beet layer, being mindful of keeping them in a tight line. Take a heaping 2 tablespoons of the chicken mixture and put on top of the noodles. Working from the edge of the rice paper wrapper closest to you, fold it over the filling, then fold in the sides, like you are rolling a burrito, and roll up tightly. Put the finished roll on the serving platter and cover with a damp paper towel to keep it from drying out, repeat with the remaining 11 rice paper wrappers and fillings. Serve with the remaining peanut sauce on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3410,&quot;Cucumber Sandwiches 1 English cucumber--seedless, longer than American variety 6 slices white bread Butter to taste Instructions: Slice cucumber, leaving peel on. Spread butter on insides of both slices of bread for each sandwich, to taste. Usually a thin layer will suffice.

Then remove sauce from the heat and add the butter and the chipotle puree. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Barbera, Syrah]&quot; 3412,&quot;Chocolate Decorations 32 ounces white chocolate, tempered (How to Temper Chocolate), method follows 10 ounces cocoa butter, melted Powdered food colors<br> Rubber stamps, a design of your choice, available at craft stores Instructions: Use a sheet of textured acetate approximately 11 by 14 inches, purchased from a home improvement center or an art supply store. Place it on a flat work surface in front of you. Pour some tempered white chocolate onto the plastic and spread with an offset spatula to create a layer that is about 1/8-inch thick. You can gently shake the plastic to help the chocolate become smooth. Use a sharp chef&#39;s knife to cut the chocolate when it begins to set but before it hardens into 1-inch squares. When the chocolate has set completely, arrange the squares so you can easily print on them with the rubber stamps.<br> To print with the rubber stamps: Place a clean dishtowel on a baking sheet and set aside. Place about 1/4 teaspoon powdered food color in small glass bowl. Pour some of the melted cocoa butter into each bowl of color. Mix with a paint brush, you can add more powdered food color if you want a stronger color. You can do as many colors as you want by using separate bowls and dividing the melted cocoa butter between the different colors. Paint some of the colored melted cocoa butter onto the towel. The towel will serve as a blotter. Press the rubber stamp into the color and then delicately onto the chocolate square. The design of the rubber stamp will transfer onto the chocolate. If the colored cocoa butter on the &#39;blotter&#39; sets and/or becomes to hard, simply heat it with a hair dryer or a heat gun. The chocolate squares are ready to serve. How to Temper Chocolate: From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 3413,&quot;Blushing Strawberry Cupcakes 1 pound strawberries, washed and hulled 1/4 cup water 1 (18.25-ounce) box white cake mix 3 egg whites 1/3 cup canola oil 2 egg whites 1 cup sugar Reserved strawberry puree 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Red food coloring Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 (24-count) mini muffin tins with paper liners. In a blender combine the strawberries (reserve about 12 small strawberries for garnish, slicing each into 4) with 1/4 cup water and puree until smooth. Puree should equal about 1 3/4 cups, if not add more water. Set aside 1/4 cup of the puree for frosting. In a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together the cake mix, egg whites, vegetable oil, and 1 1/2 cups of pureed strawberries for 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of bowl to make sure all the batter is well incorporated. Using a mini ice-cream scoop, fill the muffin tins about 3/4 of the way to the top. Bake until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the tins from the oven cool slightly before removing the muffins. Cool completely on a wire rack before frosting. Frosting: In a mixing bowl that fits over the top of a pot of boiling water, combine all of the ingredients, except the vanilla and food coloring. Beat with hand mixer on medium speed, while mixture cooks, until peaks are formed when the beaters are lifted out of the bowl, about 7 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and add vanilla and red food coloring to the desired pink shade. Frost the cupcakes with the colored frosting and garnish each with a strawberry slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 3414,&quot;Pineapple Teriyaki Sauce 1 cup soy sauce 1 medium orange, juiced 1/2 cup mirin 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic 1 1/2 teaspoons minced ginger 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water 1 cup fresh pineapple, grilled and chopped Instructions: In a large saucepan, combine all ingredients, except the cornstarch mixture and pineapple, and whisk to blend.

Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Put the bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Stir until the chocolate melts, then remove the bowl from the pan. Put the eggs, turbinado sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set the bowl over the same pan of simmering water and whisk until the mixture is warm, about 2 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer; beat with the whisk attachment on medium speed until tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the beer and vanilla to a low boil in a saucepan. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the beer mixture, then the melted chocolate, until combined, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the butter until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick comes out with a few crumbs, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack 1 hour, then run a knife around the edge of the pan and remove the ring. Let cool completely. Make the meringue: Microwave the chocolate, butter and corn syrup in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring, until the chocolate melts. Whisk the granulated sugar, egg whites, cream of tartar, salt and 1/3 cup water in a heatproof bowl. Put the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water; beat with a handheld mixer on low speed, then gradually increase the speed to high and beat until soft peaks form, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan; continue beating until the meringue is cool and fluffy. Fold in the vanilla, then fold in the melted chocolate until swirled. Spread the meringue on the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 3433,&quot;Arroz con Pollo 1 (3 to 4-pound) chicken, cut in 8 serving pieces 1 medium yellow onion, quartered, plus 1/2 yellow onion, thinly sliced 4 cups chicken broth, homemade or canned low-sodium broth 1 cup light beer, such as lager 3 tablespoons Delicioso Adobo, recipe follows 1 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 cup fresh chopped cilantro leaves 6 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 3 cups white rice 1 cup fresh or frozen peas 2 medium carrots, fnely diced<br> 8 ounces green beans, trimmed and quartered<br> 1 cup ketchup<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 green bell pepper, cored, seeded, ribbed and thinly sliced 1 cup pimento stuffed olives 1 tablespoon lemon pepper seasoning 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder or flakes 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon parsley flakes 1 tablespoon achiote powder* 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon salt Instructions: Place the chicken, quartered onions, 1 cup of chicken broth, beer, Delicioso Adobo, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 of the cilantro, and garlic in a large pot or skillet over high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and set aside to cool; once cool shred and set aside. Strain the broth into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve discarding the onion pieces. Pour the broth into a measuring cup and add water to make 4 cups of liquid. Return it to the pot or skillet and add the rice, peas, carrots, green beans, ketchup, and salt. Stir well and bring to a boil. Let the liquid evaporate to just below the level of the rice, about 10 minutes, and then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the rice is tender and fully cooked, 25 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the peppers and the remaining sliced onions and cook until they&#39;re tender, 8 minutes. Shred the cooked chicken meat discarding the skin and bones, and add the chicken to the vegetables. Cook until it is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and add the chicken and vegetables to the rice mixture. Stir in the olives, sprinkle with the remaining cilantro and serve. Combine all measured ingredients in a small glass jar with an airtight lid and shake to blend. Store in a cool, dry place for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 3434,&quot;Lamb with Whole Spices and Onions: Kharu Gos 2 to 3 tablespoons sunflower oil One 3/4-inch piece cinnamon stick 3 to 4 green cardamom pods 1 to 2 black cardamom pods, if available 2 to 3 garlic cloves 2 to 3 dried red chiles, torn or snipped into pieces 2 onions, chopped 1 pound boned leg of lamb, cut into 3/4-inch cubes (ask your butcher to saw up the bone and give it to you) 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric 1 heaping tablespoon Ginger/Garlic Paste, recipe follows Salt 1 to 2 large waxy-style potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks 1 tomato, chopped, optional Chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan until a haze forms on top. Add the cinnamon, cardamom, garlic, and red chiles. As soon as the spices swell and change color, add the onions and saute until well browned. Add the lamb and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides. When the liquid in the pan has almost dried up, add the ground spices and the ginger/garlic paste and stir well. Then add some salt and enough water (or stock) to just about cover the lamb. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and summer for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring from time to time and making sure the sides of the pan are kept clean.<br> Add the potatoes and mix them in well, then add the tomato, if using. Cover again and simmer until the lamb and potatoes are tender. Check the seasoning and sprinkle with some chopped fresh cilantro. Stir some in as well, if you like, for an extra kick.<br> Ginger/garlic paste forms the basis of most of India&#39;s cooking. In many recipes in this book I have listed finely chopped garlic and ginger separately to make life easier. However, in some recipes, only a paste will do. Most supermarkets now sell separate jars of ginger paste and garlic paste. All you need to do is blend them together.<br> To make your own, take equal quantities of peeled garlic and fresh ginger and work them to a paste with a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, puree them in a blender with a little water and some bland vegetable oil (not olive oil), stopping regularly to scrape down the sides. The paste will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 months if you mix in a little oil to prevent spoiling. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Shiraz, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 3435,&quot;Cheesy Twice-Baked Potatoes 4 russet potatoes (about 8 ounces each) 1/3 cup sour cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the beaten yolks, then pour back into the saucepan,whisking, and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, coats the spoon and reaches 180 degrees F on a thermometer, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl or measuring cup; discard the solids. Stir often until the mixture cools to room temperature. Lightly press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. (For faster chilling, set the bowl of custard in a bowl of ice water and stir until cold.) For the pineapple swirl: Combine the cream, butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a measuring cup and set aside. Cook the sugar, corn syrup and 1 tablespoon water in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil. Cook without stirring until it reaches a medium amber color, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour the cream mixture into the sugar mixture. Whisk until smooth. Stir in the crushed pineapple and any juices and return to medium heat. Cook for 10 minutes until reduced and thickened. Remove from the heat and let cool 10 minutes. Process in a food processor until pureed, then chill until ready to use. Freeze the cold custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Transfer half of the ice cream to an 8-inch square metal pan and swirl in 1/2 cup of the pineapple with a butter knife, using circular motions to distribute pineapple throughout the cream. Add the remaining ice cream and repeat with the remaining pineapple.

Cut the meat with the grain into 1/2-inch thick slices. Season each piece on both sides with the salt and pepper. Place the flour into a pie pan. Place the eggs into a separate pie pan. Dredge the meat on both sides in the flour. Tenderize the meat, using a needling device, until each slice is 1/4-inch thick. Once tenderized, dredge the meat again in the flour, followed by the egg and finally in the flour again. Repeat with all the pieces of meat. Place the meat onto a plate and allow it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes before cooking. Place enough of the vegetable oil to cover the bottom of a 12-inch slope-sided skillet and set over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the meat in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook each piece on both sides until golden brown, approximately 4 minutes per side. Remove the steaks to a wire rack set in a half sheet pan and place into the oven. Repeat until all of the meat is browned. Add the remaining vegetable oil, or at least 1 tablespoon, to the pan.

Using a mini chopper or mortar and pestle, grind the oregano, parsley, tarragon, sumac, thyme, shallots and lemon zest together with some salt and pepper; the salt will help draw the moisture and flavor from the mixture. Add the olive oil to form a paste. Spread the herb mixture all around the inside and outside of the turkey. Refrigerate the turkey, uncovered to dry the skin, for 24 hours. For the roasting: Remove the turkey from the fridge 90 minutes before roasting and allow it to come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Season the turkey again with salt and pepper. Put the parsley and thyme sprigs in the cavity with the lemon and shallot halves. Put the carrots, celery and onions in the bottom of a roasting pan fitted with a roasting rack. Add a cup of water or stock to the bottom of the pan. Add the turkey to the rack and roast, adding a little more water or stock to the pan if necessary to prevent the drippings from burning, for 30 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to roast, basting the turkey with the pan drippings every 30 minutes, until the thickest part of the leg registers an internal temperature of 155 degrees F, another 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Allow the bird to rest, tented with foil, for at least 1 hour before carving. The temperature will rise to about 165 degrees F during resting. Pour the pan drippings into a saucepan, set the pan over medium-high heat and cook until reduced by one-half, about 10 minutes. Stir in the butter until melted. Pour the reduced turkey drippings over the carved turkey just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 3446,&quot;Meyer Lemon Ricotta Crepes with Candied Almonds 1 cup slivered almonds 1/4 cup granulated pure cane sugar<br> 1 cup fresh ricotta, drained Finely grated zest of 1 Meyer lemon (or a combination of orange and lemon zest) Finely grated zest of 1 Meyer lemon (or a combination of orange and lemon zest)<br> 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream, very cold<br> 4 large eggs 1 1/2 cups whole milk<br> 1/2 teaspoon finely grated Meyer lemon zest<br> 1/2 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled<br> Pinch fine sea salt<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour, sifted<br> Nonstick cooking spray or clarified butter, for the pan<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar<br> Instructions: For the candied almonds: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Mix all the ingredients together and store in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 3450,&quot;Vegetarian Shepherd&#39;s Pie 1 spaghetti squash Roasted Garlic 1 head garlic 1/4 cup olive oil Bread Crumbs 2 cups bread crumbs 1 cup milk 1/4 cup roasted pine nuts 2 eggs, beaten 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley Mashed Potatoes 5 to 6 Yukon Gold potatoes, boiled, but not peeled 1/4 cup melted butter 1/2 cup smooth goat cheese 1 cup 35-percent whipping cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper Vegetables 1 medium onion, chopped 2 carrots, chopped 2 celery stalks, chopped 3 cups sliced mushrooms 6 cups wild mushrooms 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup dried du puy lentils (green), cooked Fried shallots, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. First, cut the spaghetti squash in half and remove the seeds. Place the squash on a baking sheet and bake for 1 1/2 hours. As an alternative, place on a plate and cook in the microwave on high power for about 20 minutes. Put the garlic head on a baking tray. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and put in the oven for 30 minutes or until the garlic is very tender. In a bowl, mix the bread crumbs with the milk. Let stand for 5 minutes until all the liquid has been absorbed. Mix in the pine nuts, the eggs, basil, thyme, and parsley. Put aside. Mash the potatoes with the butter, goat cheese, cooked garlic puree and cream to make them nice and smooth. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper. Remove the spaghetti squash flesh with a fork and put it in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper and put aside. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. For the vegetables: Heat the remaining oil in a large pan and saute the onions, carrots and celery over medium heat until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and mushrooms and continue cooking until brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Add the cooked lentils and the reserved bread crumb mixture. Stir and put aside. In an 8 by 11-inch/20 by 28-cm baking dish, spoon the vegetable mixture onto the bottom. Layer with the spaghetti squash, then the mashed potatoes and smooth them down. Cook in the oven for 30 minutes or so, until the top is slightly browned. Garnish with fried shallots, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 3451,&quot;Dolsot Bibimbap 3/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons doenjang or brown miso paste<br> 4 scallions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish as desired<br> 10 cloves garlic, grated<br> 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger (from a 2 1/2-inch piece)<br> 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar<br> 8 ounces boneless beef short ribs, frozen for 15 minutes and very thinly sliced across the grain<br> 2 3/4 cups water, divided, plus more for rinsing the rice<br> 1/2 ounce (about 1/2 cup) dried shiitake mushrooms 6 tablespoons gochujang<br> 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons rice vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 2 1/8 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste<br> 1/2 English cucumber, peeled and very thinly sliced<br> 400 grams (about 2 cups) short-grain white rice or sushi rice<br> 1/4 cup toasted sesame oil, plus more for drizzling<br> 1 cup bean sprouts<br> 6 ounces whole leaf spinach, washed<br> 1 teaspoon neutral oil, such as canola<br> 4 large eggs<br> Instructions: The meat: In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, doenjang, two of the scallions, 1 tablespoon of the garlic, 1 tablespoon of the ginger, and the brown sugar. Transfer 1/2 cup of this mixture to a gallon-size zip-top bag and add the short ribs. Seal, removing as much air as possible, then massage the bag to thoroughly coat the meat. Transfer to the fridge for at least 4 hours, or up to overnight. The mushrooms: Place the remaining soy sauce mixture in a small saucepan along with 1/2 cup of the water and the dried mushrooms. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender and hydrated, 20 to 25 minutes. Strain, pressing on the mushrooms to remove their liquid. Reserve both the mushrooms and their cooking liquid. Roughly chop or thinly slice the mushrooms, if desired, and set aside near the stovetop. Rinse out the saucepan. The sauce: Combine the gochujang and 2 teaspoons of the rice vinegar with 2 tablespoons of the mushroom cooking liquid in a small bowl. Stir well and season with additional rice vinegar to taste. Set aside for serving. The flavor base: In a small bowl, combine the remaining garlic, remaining ginger, and the 2 remaining scallions. Scoop 1 scant tablespoon of this mixture into the now-clean saucepan. Set the remainder aside as you\u2019ll need it for the final assembly. The pickles: To the saucepan, add 1/4 cup of the water, the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, the granulated sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, place the cucumber slices in a pint-size glass canning jar. When the pickling liquid boils, immediately pour over the cucumbers. Cool to room temperature, cover tightly, and refrigerate. The rice: Place a fine-mesh sieve in a medium bowl. Place the rice in the sieve, then fill the bowl with cold water. Swirl the rice around in the water using your fingers, then remove the sieve from the bowl to drain the rice. Dump the water and repeat until the water is mostly clear, 3 to 5 times. Drain the rice well and transfer to a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the remaining 2 cups of water and season with 1 teaspoon of the salt. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Give the rice a single stir, reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover, and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and rest 10 minutes, still covered. Finally, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork to release excess steam and to help the outer starch to solidify. Transfer to a bowl or, if making ahead, cool completely and transfer to a zip-top bag for refrigeration. The vegetables: Place a well-seasoned 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes. When the skillet just starts to smoke, add 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil, followed by the bean sprouts, 1/2 teaspoon of the flavor base, and 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sprouts start to soften, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl and wipe out the skillet. Add another teaspoon of the sesame oil, followed by the spinach, 1 teaspoon flavor base, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a second small bowl, wipe out the skillet, and add another teaspoon of the sesame oil, followed by the rehydrated mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a third small bowl, then wipe out the skillet yet again. Cook the meat: Place the skillet over medium-high heat, and when it just begins to smoke, add 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil. Add the beef as well as the marinade and cook, stirring often, until the meat is cooked through and the sauce reduces to a sticky glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer meat to yet another bowl, remove the skillet from the heat, and wipe it out. Assemble the bibimbap: Off the heat, coat the skillet (and its sides) with the remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil. Add the rice and press into an even layer. Position the meat over a quarter of the rice, then mound the vegetables, each in their own separate piles, leaving open space between them for the eggs and the center for sauce. Cover the skillet, place over medium heat, and cook until the bottom of the rice is browned and crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat. The eggs: While the rice is crisping, drizzle the neutral oil across a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Evenly space the eggs in the skillet. (I find transferring the eggs in a small bowl helps here.) Leave at room temperature for 10 minutes. Season the egg whites with a few pinches of salt, and place over medium heat. (If you\u2019re using an electric cooktop, begin heating the burner before adding the skillet.) Cook, uncovered, for 4 minutes. If the whites start to balloon up, just poke with a wooden chopstick to deflate. While the eggs cook, lightly lube a platter with oil or nonstick cooking spray. When the 4 minutes are up, slide the eggs onto the platter and rest for 1 minute. Cut into 4 individual egg wedges. Uncover the skillet with the bibimbap. Place a dollop of sauce in the middle of the skillet and place the eggs between the vegetables. Sprinkle with the additional scallions and drizzle with an additional tablespoon of sesame oil, if desired. After the diners all view the lovely order of the dish, I like to stir everything together in front of them just to remind them how mixed up and crazy the world is. Serve with the cucumber pickles and additional sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]&quot; 3452,&quot;Asian Tapas / Amuse Guele 1 pound char, skinless, 1/2-inch dice 1/2 tablespoon rinsed, minced fermented black beans 1 tablespoon minced ginger 1 cup shiitake mushrooms, 1/8-inch dice 2 scallions, sliced 1/16-inch 1/4 cup celery, diced 1/16-inch 3 tablespoons Aioli, recipe follows 1 cup all-purpose flour, in a shallow dish 4 eggs, beaten, in a shallow dish 1 cup panko, in a shallow dish 1 cup baby romaine, 1/16-inch ribbons Salt and white pepper to taste Canola oil to cook 1 cup balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup Chinese vinegar 2 egg yolks* 1 tablespoon sambal 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 cups canola oil 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Salt and black pepper to taste Instructions: In a medium non-stick saute pan, coat lightly with oil and saute black beans and ginger until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan on the bottom of the pan. As it starts to melt, use a spatula to form it into three 2 by 5-inch strips. When the cheese starts to bubble and turn golden brown, remove the pan from the heat. Let cool for 4 to 5 minutes; the strips should be pliable. Pick up one end of a strip with a pair of tongs and lay it across the bottom of an overturned bowl or across a wide cylinder so that the tuile hardens into an arc. Set aside and repeat the process with the other strips. Repeat the entire process with the remaining cheese. (Yields 9 Tuiles) White Truffle-Oil Vinaigrette: Blend all the vinaigrette ingredients except their oils in a 2-quart stainless steel bowl. Whisk in the olive and white truffle oils in a slow, steady stream until it is all incorporated and the sauce emulsifies. Salad: Remove the mushroom caps from their stems. Clean the tops with a damp cloth or towel. Peel the stem using a vegetable peeler; discard the scraps. Slice the mushrooms as thinly as possible, and place in a 2-quart stainless steel bowl. Add the remaining vegetables. Add the vinaigrette and toss well. To serve: Divide the salad among 6 chilled plates. Stand a Parmesan tuile over each salad.

Place the bananas in a freezer bag and freeze for at least 3 hours. In a small bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, milk and vanilla. If your banana slices have been frozen for longer than a day, let them thaw for about 15 minutes. Place the frozen bananas, chocolate mixture and salt in a food processor and blend well, stopping to scrape down the sides often to get a smooth, even consistency. Add a drop of mint extract to the ice cream, blend and taste. For a more intense mint flavor, increase the mint a drop at a time until you achieve the desired taste. Finally, add the chocolate chips into the ice cream and stir by hand until they&#39;re mixed throughout. Scoop the ice cream into single-serving bowls and serve immediately or cover in plastic wrap and freeze.

Add the lard and the butter, and cut them in with a pastry blender until the larger pieces are the size of peas and the mixture begins to clump on the pastry blender. Shuffle through the mixture with your hands, pinching chunks of lard to flatten them. Add 4 tablespoons of the ice water and mix with a fork. Pinch a clump of dough in your hands: If it feels moist and clumps together easily, it&#39;s probably hydrated enough. If it feels really crumbly, add another tablespoon or two of ice water until you can form a baseball-size clump of dough, packing it on as if you were making a snowball. You want to mix the dough as little as possible to ensure it stays tender. Divide the dough in half and form each half into a flat disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.

Pudding: In a saucepan over low heat, add the cream, the scraped vanilla bean and the seeds (or extract) and 1/2 cup of sugar. Whisk to combine. Bring the cream to a boil. While the cream is coming to a boil, whisk the yolks and 1/2 cup sugar together until they are a homogeneous mixture. When the cream comes to a boil, remove it from the heat and whisk in 1/3 of the egg yolk mixture, then immediately whisk in the remaining egg mixture. This is called tempering, it allows you to combine hot cream and eggs without making scrambled eggs. It&#39;s kinda fun! Reserve this mixture until you are ready to assemble the pudding. Discard the vanilla bean. To assemble the pudding: Butter 1 side of the slices of bread and cut them into triangles. Butter an 8 by 8-inch square baking dish and put a layer of bread points, overlapping, in the bottom of the dish. Strain the raisins reserving the whiskey. Sprinkle half of the whiskey soaked raisins on top of the bread layer. Pour half of the cream/egg mixture over the bread and raisins. Repeat this process with the bread and raisins and finally finish with bread. Pour the remaining cream/egg mixture into the dish. Press down gently on the whole thing to compress and really compact the pudding. If all of the cream mixture doesn&#39;t fit into the pan, wait 10 to 15 minutes and then try again. The bread may need a little while to absorb all the cream. MMMMM... don&#39;t skimp on this step. Set the bread pudding dish inside a 9 by 13-inch baking dish or roasting pan and add hot water until it reaches 1/2 to 2/3 of the way up the sides of the pudding dish. Cover the whole thing with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven until the custard has set, about 1 hour. Remove the pudding from the water bath and let it cool for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the top of the custard with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a thin even layer. Put the pudding under the broiler or use a blow torch (This is REALLY fun!) to crystallize the sugar on the top of the pudding. A little bit crusty and burnt and sweeeeeeet! YuuuuuummmY! Serve with the whiskey tea sauce. To make the sauce: While the pudding is baking, combine all the ingredients and the reserved Irish whiskey in a small saucepan and let steep for 15 minutes. Discard the tea bags and the lemon half. Bring the sauce to a boil and then lower the heat and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Taste, the sauce should be very pungent, sweet and spicy (cinnamon and clove--not spicy hot) and a perfect accompaniment to the creamy sweet pudding.

Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast, shaking the pan occasionally, until lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool. Turn the oven temperature down to 325 degrees F. Stir together the melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves and corn syrup and evenly coat the bottom and sides of a 10 inch glass pie plate with the mixture. When the almonds are cool, arrange around the bottom rim of the pie plate, with a few in the center, pressing them into the brown sugar mixture. Arrange the pear halves like spokes of a wheel on top of the brown sugar mixture. In a mixing bowl, combine the pastry flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt and thoroughly mix. In another bowl, whisk together the softened butter, sour cream, egg yolks and vanilla. Add to the dry ingredients and mix with an electric mixer at medium speed about 1 1/2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally, until thick and smooth. Using a spatula, spread the batter evenly over the fruit, building up the outside edges so the cake will be level when baked. Bake 40 to 50 minutes, until golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack and cool 3 to 5 minutes (no longer) and then invert onto a serving plate, repositioning the fruit as necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 3476,&quot;Hearts of Romaine with Blue Cheese and Bacon 8 strips good-quality bacon 1 large egg 2 hearts romaine lettuce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Blue Cheese Dressing, recipe follows 1 cup mayonnaise 1 cup crumbled blue cheese (about 4 ounces) 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 shallot, peeled 1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon celery seeds 2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lay the bacon strips on a roasting rack and bake in the oven until crisp, about 20 minutes. (To make bacon curls: Wrap each slice of raw bacon around a metal skewer in a barber-pole fashion and lay the skewers on the roasting rack.) Pat dry with a paper towel. When cool enough to handle, break into pieces or in half, if using curls. Put the egg in a small saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, cover, and remove from the heat. Set aside for 10 minutes. Drain the egg and roll it between your palm and the counter to crack the shell, then peel under cool running water. Rub the egg through a fine-mesh strainer and set aside. Remove the large outer leaves from the romaine hearts and rinse. Chop these leaves into bite-size pieces and spin dry. (Use an extremely sharp knife to minimize bruising the edges.) Halve the hearts through the cores to make 4 wedges. Rinse under cold running water and shake to air dry. Divide the wedges among 4 plates. Mound some of the chopped romaine on top and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Spoon about 1/4 cup of Blue Cheese Dressing over each salad and top with some of the sieved egg and bacon. Pass the remaining dressing at the table. Pulse the mayonnaise, blue cheese, buttermilk, shallot, lemon zest, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and celery seeds in a food processor to make a chunky but pourable sauce.

Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil. Peel and core the tomatoes: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Have a large bowl of ice water at the ready. Gently lower the tomatoes into the boiling water and blanch them for 60 seconds. Remove with a strainer and transfer them to the ice water. Once cool, slit the skins; they should peel off easily. Remove the cores with a small paring knife. You will need to do this in batches. Discard skins and cores. Prepare the sauce: Coarsely chop the tomatoes and add them to a large stockpot. Place stockpot over medium-high heat, crushing and stirring the tomatoes to keep from burning. Continue until all the tomatoes are added and crushed. Bring the tomatoes to a boil, then reduce heat and keep at a low boil. Reduce to the desired thickness, by a third for a thin sauce, or by half for a thick sauce. Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the sauce. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Add two tablespoons of bottled lemon juice and one teaspoon of salt to each jar; add a teaspoon of sugar to offset the added acidity if desired. Use a ladle to pour the sauce into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight. Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 40 minutes. Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately. Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 3481,&quot;Mulukhiyya 5 cups chicken stock 2 (1) pound packages mulukhiyya 3 tablespoons olive oil 4 minced garlic cloves 2 tablespoons ground coriander 1 tablespoon ground cumin Juice of two lemons Salt and pepper to taste 1 cup cooked long-grain rice Instructions: Bring the chicken stock to boil in a saucepan.

You can use a toothpick to carefully spread out the frosting in the small spaces. Sprinkle with pink sanding sugar for a glitzy effect. Let the frosting dry for 1 full day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3490,&quot;Enchilada Sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup finely chopped red bell peppers 1/4 cup finely chopped onions 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic<br> 2 teaspoons chili powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 beef, chicken or tomato bouillon cube Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup chicken stock<br> One 15-ounce can tomato sauce<br> Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the peppers, onions and garlic and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, cayenne, bouillon cube and some salt and pepper and cook until the spices darken and their flavors are released, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour, stir to combine and cook it for another minute. Add the stock and stir to combine, then allow the liquid to thicken. Add the tomato sauce and 1 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil. Cook until the sauce is nice and thick and reduced by about a third, 5 to 10 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool slightly, then use an immersion blender to completely puree the sauce until smooth. (Alternatively, you can transfer it to a blender to puree it; just make sure the sauce is cooled, as blending hot liquids is dangerous!) The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week and can also be frozen! Just reheat the sauce in a saucepan or skillet for whatever recipe calls for it. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 3491,&quot;Goat Cheese Croutons 1 French baguette, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds Olive oil 4 ounces fresh goat cheese Cracked black pepper Instructions: Brush the sliced baguette with olive oil, toast in a 350 degree oven until crisp and golden.

Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue cooking on a gentle simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Once the beef is tender, let it cool slightly in the braising liquid and then shred with two forks, while still in the pot, so as to let all the shredded beef soak up the delicious sauce. For the tomatillo guacamole: Combine the cilantro, tomatillos, garlic, avocado, jalapeno, onion, lime juice, cumin and salt in a food processor or blender and pulse until combined. For the sopes: Combine the masa harina, flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and slowly add the warm water while incorporating the dry ingredients using a stiff spatula. Once the dough comes together, transfer it to a floured surface and knead it by hand until it is smooth and not crumbly, about 5 minutes. Roll the dough to 1/4-inch thickness and then cut it into 2-inch circles with a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass; you should get 36 circles. Re-roll and re-cut scraps of dough until all of it is used. Create a ridge around the edge of each sope using your thumb, and working from the center outwards. You are trying to make a small well for the toppings to rest in once the dough is fried. Fill a cast-iron skillet with 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil and heat to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, fry the sopes until their edges are crispy and just starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes. Transfer the sopes to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt as they come out of the oil. For the toppings: Melt the butter in a skillet, then add the refried beans. Stir to warm through and loosen the mixture. Set aside. Mix the pickled jalapenos and tomatoes and set them aside. Fill each sope with a layer of beans, followed by some shredded beef and a little tomatillo guacamole. Top each with some of the cabbage, tomato-jalapeno mixture, crema, cotija and cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 3501,&quot;Meatloaf Panini Sandwich 2 1/2 pounds organic or grass-fed beef (80/20) 2 pounds Italian sausage 1/2 cup fresh Italian parsley, chopped 2 yellow onions, chopped 3 tablespoons minced garlic 4 farm-fresh eggs, organic eggs or at the very least cage-free eggs 3 tablespoons organic Italian seasoning 1 tablespoon Himalayan salt or sea salt 1 tablespoon fresh coarse-ground pepper 1 cup organic ketchup 2 cups fresh breadcrumbs (I use gluten-free) 1 tablespoon olive oil 3 yellow onions, peeled and cut in half, then sliced into half-moons 1/4 inch thick 1 tablespoon red balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon organic sugar 2 fresh garlic cloves 1/4 cup grated mix of Parmesan, Asiago and Romano cheeses or just a good Parmesan will do 1/4 teaspoon Himalayan salt or sea salt 1 cup fresh basil leaves 1 cup stemmed kale leaves of choice (any variety will do) 1/4 cup olive oil Mayonnaise, for spreading 24 to 28 slices dense bread or French bread Marinara or meat sauce of your choice, for topping 24 to 28 slices Havarti cheese Instructions: For the mini meatloaves: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

(You can use your hands to mix it really well.) Taste a &#39;lil bit and add a pinch of salt if needed. Divide the cheese mixture into four sections and shape into torpedo-like logs a bit shorter than the length of the chicken breasts. Wrap each in plastic wrap. Freeze until firm, at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Prepare the chicken: Use a paring knife to cut a pocket into the short, fat end of a chicken breast, that will run through much of the length of the breast, without cutting all the way through. It may take a few strokes with the knife. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Remove the stuffing from the freezer and insert one log in each pocket. If necessary, trim the logs to fit into the pockets. Secure the openings with toothpicks. Season and grill the chicken: Preheat the grill for direct and indirect grilling at 350 degrees F and oil the grates. Brush olive oil on the chicken and sprinkle on all sides with salt and pepper. Place the chicken over the direct heat of the grill and cook until a peek beneath reveals grill marks, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and place over the indirect heat of the grill to finish. Remove when a check with a thermometer shows the chicken to be at around 155 degrees F, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the chicken from the grill and tent with aluminum foil for 5 to 10 minutes. The temperature of the chicken should increase to 165 degrees F. Make the glaze: Combine the chicken stock, cranberries, honey, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper to taste in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until reduced and slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove the toothpicks from the chicken, transfer to plates, and serve each with a spoon of glaze over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3506,&quot;Quick Asparagus Benedict 2 bunches thick asparagus (about 1 1/2 pounds) 1 tablespoon olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon white vinegar 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, plus a few sprigs for garnish Instructions: Place a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to broil.<br> Trim off about an inch from the bottom of the asparagus and peel about halfway up.

In a colander set over another bowl, salt the eggplant and let drain for 30 minutes then rinse and dry. Brush the eggplant slices with olive oil and season with pepper. Toss the peppers with a little olive oil. Place both on the grill and cook the eggplant until browned on the first side, about 3 minutes. The slices should be browned between the grill marks when ready to turn. Move them away from direct heat and cook on the second side until tender, about 10 minutes total. Cut the grilled slices into 1/2-inch dice. Cook the peppers, turning as necessary, until charred all over. Remove the peppers to a bowl. Cover and let the peppers steam to loosen the skins. When cool enough to handle, peel, seed, and tear into long, thin strips. Divide the dough into 6 equal balls. Working on a surface free of flour, roll each ball under your palm. As it rolls, it will stick slightly to the surface, creating tension that helps form a tight, round ball. Dust the work surface lightly with flour, pat each ball down lightly, dust the tops with flour, cover with a towel, and let rise for about 15 minutes. With a rolling pin, roll out each ball into a circle 8 or 9 inches in diameter and about 1/8-inch thick. Have the grill ready at medium heat. Have the 1/4 cup olive oil, eggplant, peppers, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, if using, olives, and cheese in bowls and ready by the side of the grill. Brush each dough round with about 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Place on the grill, oiled side up, and cook until browned on the underside, about 2 minutes. Turn and, working quickly, brush each round with another 1 teaspoon olive oil. Then scatter each with 1/6 each of the garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, if using, eggplant, bell peppers, olives, and cheese. Cover the grill and cook until the rounds are browned on the bottom and the cheese has softened, about 7 minutes. Transfer to plates and top each with an equal amount of the arugula.

Add the flour and salt and whisk to create a paste. Add one-third of the milk and whisk until completely incorporated. Add another third and incorporate fully. Add the remaining third and incorporate completely. The batter should resemble heavy cream in consistency. Add more milk if required. Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to its highest setting (but no more than 500 degrees F). Put six 6-inch empty round cake pans on a sheet tray and into the hot oven and allow them to heat through for 15 minutes.

Remove the batter from the fridge and stir gently if the mixture has separated. Working extremely quickly to retain the heat in the oiled pans, split the batter mixture evenly among the 6 pans and return them quickly to the oven. Bake until puffed up and golden brown, about 25 minutes. Don&#39;t be tempted to sneak a peek for at least 22 minutes, as partially risen puddings will collapse and be ruined. When ready, remove the pans from the oven and allow the puddings to cool slightly to set for a couple of minutes before removing. Serve immediately. Meanwhile, for the mashed potatoes: Peel and dice the russet potatoes into equal pieces about 1-inch square.

Cut the tomatoes in 1/2, and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the tomato halves in a grill pan, and cook until each side is seared, roughly 3 minutes per side. Remove the tomato halves from the pan and set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3557,&quot;Stuffed Pork Chops with Roasted Vegetables and Soft Polenta 2 cups milk Kosher salt 1 cup quick-cooking polenta 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup mascarpone 2 fresh sage leaves, cut into chiffonade 2 cups Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved 2 cups cauliflower florets 3 tablespoons olive oil Crushed red pepper Kosher salt Seeds from 1 pomegranate, for garnish 3 pieces bacon, cut into lardons 1/2 Spanish onion, cut into small dice 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 1/2 cup Calvados 1 sprig rosemary, leaves finely chopped 1/2 cup golden raisins Kosher salt 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 1 egg, lightly beaten 3 bone-in pork loin chops, 3/4-inch thick Olive oil, for pan 1/2 cup sherry vinegar 1/2 cup maple syrup Instructions: For the polenta: Bring the milk and 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Season generously with salt. Slowly whisk in the polenta; when all of the polenta has been incorporated, reduce the heat to medium and immediately switch to stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring frequently, until the polenta begins to pull away from the pan; add water if it becomes too thick. When the polenta is thoroughly cooked, it will look creamy and not feel gritty on your tongue. Remove the polenta from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, mascarpone and sage. Cover and keep warm. For the roasted vegetables: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Combine the Brussels sprouts and cauliflower florets in a large bowl. Add the olive oil and some crushed red pepper salt; stir to coat. Pour the vegetables onto the prepared baking sheet and spread in a single layer. Roast until tender and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring halfway through. Transfer to a serving plate and garnish with pomegranate seeds. For the stuffed pork chops: Adjust the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the bacon to a skillet and cook over medium-high heat until almost crispy. Add the onions and sweat for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the apples and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully add the calvados (it may flame) and cook until almost dry. Add the rosemary, raisins and salt to taste. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, along with the breadcrumbs and the beaten egg; stir to combine. Sprinkle the pork chops with salt. Insert a paring knife into the curved side of each chop to make a deep pocket, about 2 inches wide. Stuff the pockets with the breadcrumb mixture. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat and coat the pan with olive oil. Sear the pork chops until golden brown on all sides. Remove the chops to a baking sheet and place in the oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, add sherry vinegar and maple syrup to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until reduced by half. (Keep an eye on the saucepan, as the mixture can burn quickly.) After 15 minutes in the oven, baste the chops all over with the maple-vinegar reduction. Return to the oven for an additional 5 minutes, or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 3558,&quot;Phyllo Tartlets with Smoke Salmon Rillettes 100 phyllo tartlett shells 1 side smoked salmon, minced 1 small red onion, chopped fine 1 bunch chives, chopped very fine 1 cup capers, rough chopped 2 cups aioli 1 jar domestic osetra caviar 2 cups plain yogurt, drained 2 Tbs. fresh dill, chopped fine fresh juice from 2 lemons salt and pepper to taste dill to garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 F.

Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a large, oven-proof pot (such as a Dutch oven) over medium-high heat. Brown chicken on all sides, about 5 minutes per side, then set aside on a plate and reserve. Add the onions and garlic and cook a couple minutes to sweat them down a little. Add the ale and deglaze the bottom of the pot. Add the tomato paste and canned tomatoes and stir well until tomato paste is dissolved. Add carrots, thyme, and plums. Return the chicken to the pot along with any reserved juices. Gently submerge the chicken pieces by nestling them into liquid (this will cook them evenly without drying them out). Return to medium heat and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and continue to simmer on low for 1 1/2 hours until chicken is cooked through and starting to fall off the bone. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3561,&quot;Grilled Shrimp with Mango Salsa 2 (4-ounce) tropical fruit cups, drained (about 1 cup) 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped 1 scallion, finely chopped 1/2 lime, juiced 1 small jalapeno, ribs removed, seeded and minced Kosher salt 24 large shrimp, peeled and deveined Olive oil cooking spray 1 (8-ounce) bag shredded coconut Instructions: Wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Lightly beat the eggs in a separate shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat about 1/3 cup olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat (it?s hot enough when a pinch of panko sizzles when it hits the oil). Working with 2 or 3 chicken breasts at a time, dip each piece in the beaten egg, letting the excess drip off, then press the chicken into the crumb mixture to coat. Add to the hot oil and cook until browned and cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Blend until smooth and creamy. Transfer to a bowl and set aside or cover and hold in the refrigerator until ready to use. For the pretzels: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray with nonstick cooking spray. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface into an approximate 14-by-12-inch rectangle. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut lengthwise into 2 1/2- to 3-inch strips. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the pimiento cheese down the center of each strip. Brush the strips on both sides of the pimiento cheese with the egg wash. Bring the sides of each strip up around the spread and crimp it closed using the tines of a fork. Tie each strip into a pretzel-shaped knot and place them on a baking sheet. Place in the refrigerator until ready to boil. Fill a large pot halfway with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Very slowly add the baking soda and stir until dissolved. Using a spider or slotted spoon, dip each pretzel in the boiling mixture for about 30 seconds each, then place on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Once all the pretzels are dipped, brush them with the beaten egg and sprinkle them with salt. Bake until the pretzels are a deep golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Arrange the bacon on the prepared baking sheet and roast until the bacon is browned and the fat has rendered, 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, finely chop and transfer to a medium bowl. Reserve the baking sheet. Meanwhile, bring a heavily salted pot of water to a boil over high heat (the water should be very salty, even more than the sea). Carefully remove as much of the cauliflower stem as you can without cutting any of the stalks of the florets. Remove any small inner leaves. (You want to be able to freely pipe filling into the nooks of the cauliflower.) Boil the cauliflower until just beginning to get tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Do not overcook, or it will break apart as you stuff it. Carefully remove the head from the water and allow to drain and cool. Add the kale to the same pot and cook bright green, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and squeeze dry. When cool enough to handle, finely chop and transfer to the bowl with the bacon. Add the eggs, scallions, garlic, Muenster, cream, 1/2 cup panko, 1/4 cup Parmesan and 2 tablespoons oregano to the kale mixture and stir to combined. Transfer to a large piping bag (or 1-gallon freezer bag) and cut a 3/4-inch opening at the tip. Turn the cauliflower stem-side up, and start piping the filling in between the stalks of the florets until you&#39;ve used about half of the filling. (The bottom of the head will start to expand, and you will see the filling start to push out from the top in between the florets. Turn the cauliflower right-side up and use your finger to push between the florets to separate them slightly and pipe filling in the gaps. Use all the filling, even if it looks like the cauliflower is going to explode -- it won&#39;t. It will just be full of flavor! Mix together the butter with the remaining 2 tablespoons panko, 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1 tablespoon oregano in a small bowl. Put the cauliflower right-side up in the center of the reserved baking sheet and smear with the butter mixture to coat the entire head. Bake until deep golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes.

Place another triple layer of paper towels on top. If there are additional slices, arrange them on top of the paper towels in a single layer, then top them with another triple layer of towels. Let the salt do the work for 30 to 45 minutes. Firmly press on the eggplant slices to remove as much liquid as possible, then wipe off any excess salt. Pepper both sides of the eggplant. Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F. Set up a standard breading station with 3 pie plates or small baking dishes. Add some flour to one, the beaten eggs to another and the breadcrumbs stirred together with the Parmesan to the third. Season each station lightly with salt and pepper. Dredge each eggplant slice first in the flour, then shake off the excess. Dip in the egg, letting any excess drip, and then coat in the breadcrumbs. Set aside on a wire rack and repeat with the remaining eggplant slices. Heat 1/2 inch of canola oil in 2 large, straight-sided saute pans over medium heat until hot. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Working in small batches, fry a few eggplant slices in each pan, turning once, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to the towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Fit another baking sheet with a wire rack to hold the eggplant warm in the oven while you finish frying the remaining slices. To build the sandwich: slice the burrata into disks (try to keep its shape) and arrange in a single layer on the bottom portion of the loaf. Put a single layer of the warm, crispy eggplant on top, then top with the roasted red peppers and drizzle with the Balsamic Vinaigrette. Use toothpicks to secure the top, then slice and serve. Put the vinegar in a small saucepan with the garlic and shallots and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer, uncovered, until the vinegar reduces to about 1/2 cup. Let cool for about 5 minutes. In a blender, pulse together the vinegar mixture, honey, Italian seasoning and some salt and pepper. While the machine is running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the dressing is combined and emulsified.

In a large bowl, place the chocolate and the butter. Pour the hot coffee over the chocolate and butter and then add the bourbon. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand until chocolate and butter are melted. Remove the cover and whisk to fully incorporate. Set aside until mixture has cooled. Grease and flour 2 (8-inch) round cake pans. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. When coffee mixture has cooled, add the sugar and whisk until blended. Add the flour mixture, half at a time and stir until just combined. Add the eggs, vanilla, and coconut and whisk until well blended. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake for about 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool cakes in pans for about 10 minutes and then cool completely on a rack before icing. While cakes are cooling, make ganache: Place the chocolate in a large bowl. Heat the cream in a saucepan just until it starts to boil. Immediately pour the cream over the chocolate, making sure that all of the chocolate is covered. Cover the bowl and let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk the chocolate until dark and shiny and then let cool to room temperature. The more you whisk this icing as it cools, the stiffer it will get. If you refrigerate the icing before you put it on the cake, it will get very hard and you will have to microwave it for a few seconds to soften it to a spreadable state. Frost cake: Spread ganache over bottom layer of cake. Place the second cake layer on top of the ganache. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining ganache. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 3586,&quot;Sauteed Radishes and Watercress 4 bunches radishes, quartered, leaving a bit of the greens on top for decoration 2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon salt (preferably sea salt) 2 garlic cloves, minced 4 bunches watercress, coarse stems discarded and watercress rinsed, but not spun dry (about 10 cups) Instructions: Trim radishes and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch wedges.

Line two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, add the sugar, gluten-free baking mix, cocoa powder and salt and mix on low speed until combined. Add the eggs one at a time, waiting until each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the milk, oil and vanilla and mix on low speed until combined. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Turn the mixer to low and slowly pour in 1 cup hot water, making sure it is evenly incorporated into the batter. Fill the cupcake liners two-thirds full with the batter and bake until the top of each cupcake is slightly springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 14 to 16 minutes. Immediately turn the cupcakes out of the pans onto a cooling rack and let cool completely. For the mint chocolate ganache filling: Put the cream in a saucepot and heat to a scald over medium heat. Do not boil! Put the chocolate in a mixing bowl and pour the hot cream over it. Let it sit a moment and then gently stir to combine and melt the chocolate. Stir in the peppermint extract, and then set aside to cool and thicken up. The ganache can be made several days ahead of time and kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the mint chocolate chip Italian meringue buttercream: Put the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a heavy saucepan and heat over high heat until the sugar mixture registers 250 degrees F on a candy thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes. While the sugar is cooking, whip the egg whites on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer to the soft-peak stage (the whites will look foamy and white), being careful not to over-whip. (If the whites start to look clumpy, they&#39;ve been over-whipped. If this happens, toss them out and start again. If the whites are beating faster than the sugar is cooking, turn down the mixer speed. You can always turn up the speed if you need to.) Add the cream of tartar and continue whipping. While the egg whites are whipping on medium speed, gently pour the sugar syrup down the side of the mixing bowl. Turn the speed up to high and whip until the mixing bowl no longer feels warm to the touch, about 7 minutes. Turn the mixer back to medium and add the butter in small chunks, whipping until it is completely incorporated. Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the peppermint extract and sea salt. Turn the mixer back to medium-low speed and mix until the peppermint extract is fully incorporated. Add the mini chocolate chips and stir to combine.<br> Fit an 18-inch piping bag with a round tip and twist and hold the bag right by the tip to prevent the buttercream from leaking out.

Add the onion and garlic and saute until soft and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Add the ground beef, sausage, salt, basil, Italian seasoning, oregano and pepper to taste and increase the heat to high. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until browned all over. Add the tomatoes. Pour some of the wine into the empty tomato boxes to rinse out the last bits of tomatoes and add to the pot, along with the remaining wine. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the sauce thickens and the flavors come together, about 1 hour. Add a healthy amount of black pepper. To make the besciamella: Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until just simmering, then turn off the heat. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour to the butter and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens and then loosens again, about 2 minutes. Add the hot milk, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil. Add the nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, whisking almost constantly, for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and use immediately. To make the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread an even layer of the meat ragu over the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce lengthwise across the short side of the pan. Avoid overlapping or allowing them to touch the sides of the pan because they will expand as they cook. Press down slightly to let the sauce spread around them. Cover with one-quarter of the besciamella and sprinkle with one-third of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Add another layer of ragu. Add 3 more noodles, arranging them in the opposite direction from the first layer and breaking 1 of the noodles in half if necessary to fit. Add one-quarter of the besciamella and half of the mozzarella. Make a third layer of ragu, noodles (alternating directions again), besciamella and one-third of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Add another layer of ragu, then the remaining mozzarella, noodles (alternating the noodles again), besciamella and ragu. Cover the pan with foil and bake until heated through, about 35 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is brown and bubbling, about 20 minutes more. During the last 10 minutes of baking, scatter the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano all over. Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 3623,&quot;Air Fryer Baked Brie with Pesto, Sundried Tomatoes and Artichoke Hearts 1 demi baguette, thinly sliced on the bias 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/3 cup marinated artichoke hearts, chopped<br> 1/3 cup sundried tomatoes, chopped<br> 3 tablespoons store-bought basil pesto<br> 1 large egg<br> All-purpose flour, for dusting<br> One sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounce box), thawed<br> One 8-ounce wheel of brie<br> Crackers, sliced red bell peppers and endive, for serving Instructions: Preheat an air fryer to 350F. Brush both sides of the sliced bread with the olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and several grinds of black pepper.

Cut the tip of the bag and pipe a strip of caramel on the uncoated top of each cookie. (If the caramel strips look messy, use your hand to mold and straighten the lines -- at this point, the caramel will be very malleable.) Return the cookies to the rack caramel-side up and refrigerate until hardened, about 20 minutes. Spoon the chocolate over each cookie or dip the caramel side so that it is completely covered with chocolate. After the cookies are completely coated, drizzle the chocolate with a spoon back and forth crosswise over each. Return to the wire rack until cooled and the chocolate hardens, about 2 hours. Store in an airtight container up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3646,&quot;Petite Pain au Chocolat 1 package (17.3 ounces) Pepperidge Farm? Puff Pastry Sheets, thawed 1 1/2 cups Ghirardelli? semi-sweet chocolate chips 1 egg, beaten 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons hot water Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Unfold the pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface. Roll each into a 10-inch square. Cut each into 4 (5-inch) squares, making 8 in all. Place 2 tablespoons chocolate chips in the center of each pastry square. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg. Fold each pastry over the chocolate chips and press to seal. Place the filled pastries onto baking sheets. Brush the pastries with the egg. Bake for 15 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown. Let the pastries cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes.

If your brisket has a thick layer of fat, trim it to a thickness of 1/4-inch. Place the brisket in a roasting pan and generously sprinkle both sides with the rub, using about 3 tablespoons per side and patting it into the meat with your fingertips. The leftover rub can be stored for several months in a jar. You can cook the brisket right away, but it will taste better if you let it cure in the refrigerator covered for at least 4 to 24 hours. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium-low. If using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and run the grill on high until you see smoke then reduce the heat to medium-low. If using a charcoal grill, place a large drip pan in the center, preheat the grill to medium-low, then toss 1 cup of the wood chips on the coals. When ready to cook, place the brisket in the center of the hot grate, fat side up, over the drip pan and away from the heat. Drape the bacon slices over the top of the meat, and then cover the grill. Cook the brisket until very tender, 5 to 6 hours or until the internal temperature reaches about 190 degrees F. Generously mop or baste the meat on both sides with the mop sauce. Wrap the brisket in aluminum foil, and continue cooking until done. If using a charcoal grill, every hour you&#39;ll need to add 12 fresh coals and 1/2 cup wood chips to each side. Transfer the grilled brisket to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Thinly slice across the grain, using an electric knife or sharp carving knife. Transfer the sliced meat to a platter. Spoon the barbecue sauce over the meat or, better yet, serve it on the side. Place all ingredients in a non-reactive bowl and whisk to mix. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt, if necessary. Combine the barbecue sauce, salsa, and vinegar in a non-reactive saucepan over medium heat, bring to a simmer, and let cook until thick and flavorful, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. The sauce can be served hot or at room temperature and may be refrigerated, covered, for up to 48 hours. Bring to room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 3648,&quot;Chocolate Malt Nest Cake 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans 1 cup malted milk powder (such as Carnation Original) 3/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 3/4 cups sugar 3 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1 cup malted milk powder (such as Carnation Original) 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder Pinch of salt 3 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/3 cups sugar 4 large shredded wheat biscuits, crushed (about 1 1/2 cups) 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 cup sugar 3 ounces milk chocolate, chopped Candy eggs, for topping Instructions: Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper, then butter the parchment. Dust the pans with flour and tap out any excess. Whisk the flour, malted milk powder, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a separate large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk. Beat until smooth, about 1 more minute. Divide the batter between the prepared pans; tap on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers of the cakes comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack; run a knife around the edges of the cakes and let cool 10 minutes, then turn out the cakes onto the rack to cool completely. Discard the parchment. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Whisk the milk, malted milk powder, flour, cocoa powder and salt in a small saucepan until combined. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking, until the mixture is thick like pudding, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and press plastic wrap directly onto the surface. Refrigerate until completely cool, about 11/2 hours. When you?re ready to assemble the cake, finish the frosting: Remove the malted mixture from the refrigerator and whisk until creamy. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 8 minutes. Add large spoonfuls of the malted mixture, beating 1 to 2 minutes after each addition and scraping down the bowl as needed (the frosting will look separated). Continue beating until the frosting comes together and is light and fluffy, about 3 more minutes. (Do not chill!) Assemble the cake: Place 1 cake layer on a platter. Spread with 1 heaping cup of the frosting. Top with the second cake layer. Cover the top and side with more frosting, then build up a ring around the top of the cake with the remaining frosting to create a nest. Refrigerate the cake until the frosting firms up, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the topping: Toss the shredded wheat in a large bowl with the melted butter, then add the sugar and toss again. Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees F until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Melt the chocolate in a large microwave-safe bowl in 20-second intervals, stirring, until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool slightly, then stir in the shredded wheat mixture until completely coated. Press the topping all over the top and side of the cake. Refrigerate until set, at least 30 minutes or overnight. Fill the nest with candy eggs. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Malbec]&quot; 3649,&quot;Muffuletta 6 ounces Greek mix pitted olives 3 sun-dried tomatoes<br> 2 cloves garlic<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar<br> Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 sesame seed buns 12 ounces sliced mortadella<br> 12 ounces sliced salami<br> 6 ounces giardiniera, chopped<br> 12 ounces sliced black forest ham<br> 6 ounces sliced provolone<br> 6 leaves green leaf lettuce<br> 12 slices tomato Instructions: For the tapenade: Combine the olives, tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and vinegar in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is chopped but not pureed.

Tear 2 of the bay leaves into small pieces and sprinkle over the vegetables. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons more of the remaining Spanish olive oil and season with salt, black pepper, to taste, and crushed red pepper flakes. Place the fish on top of the sliced vegetables. Using a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, kosher salt and oregano and mash to form a paste. Spread the garlic paste inside the cavity of the fish and into the slits on top. Place the remaining bay leaf inside the cavity of the fish. In the same small bowl that you used to make the garlic paste, combine the tomato puree and vinegar and stir to combine. Pour this tomato mixture all over the fish. Top with the remaining onion and pepper slices and drizzle the remaining olive oil and the wine over the top. Season again with salt and black pepper, cover the dish loosely with aluminum foil, and bake until the fish flakes easily when pierced with a fork, 45 to 50 minutes. Garnish with the parsley and serve hot or warm, with the pan juices drizzled over all. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 3665,&quot;Buffalo Chicken Meatballs with Blue Cheese Sauce 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese<br> 1/4 cup sour cream<br> 2 tablespoons buttermilk<br> 1 teaspoon honey<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 small yellow onion, cut into medium dice<br> 2 tablespoons buttermilk<br> 1 slice white or wheat bread, torn into small pieces<br> 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s<br> 1 pound ground chicken<br> 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs<br> 1 package ranch dressing mix<br> 1 large egg<br> 3/4 cup diced celery Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the aluminum foil 4 ounces blue cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes<br> 5 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> Instructions: For the blue cheese sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, blue cheese, sour cream, buttermilk, honey and garlic powder in a bowl and whisk until blended.

Saute the ancho for 1 to 2 minutes, to until slightly softened. With a slotted spoon, transfer the cl to a blender and add the peppercorns, salt, and water. Blend to a smooth puree. In a large mixing bowl, combine the masa with the cl puree. Knead the dough together well. To test the consistency, flatten a small ball of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Set the masa aside, covered, at room temperature for 1 hour to allow the flavor to develop. Pull off a ball of dough about 2 inches in diameter. Push a piece of the cheese into the dough and form the dough around it into a football shaped croquette, encasing the cheese completely. Finish making the croquettes and heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil to 375 degrees. Fry the croquettes in the hot oil, burning them over when golden, for about 3 to 4 minutes.

When I&#39;m frazzled, I firmly believe that a \tray-bake\ is the safest way to go. Enjoy the easefulness of the oven: you just throw everything in, and you&#39;re done. I think I&#39;d go to the supreme effort of laying on a green salad as well but, other than that, you may kick up your flamenco heels and enjoy the fiesta. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put the oil in the bottom of 2 shallow roasting pans or quarter sheet pans, 1 tablespoon in each. Rub the skin of the chicken in the oil, then turn skin side up and put 6 pieces in each pan. Divide the chorizo sausages and the baby potatoes between the 2 pans. Sprinkle with the onion and the oregano, then grate the orange zest over the contents of the 2 pans. Bake for 1 hour, but after 30 minutes, swap the top pan with the bottom pan in the oven and baste the contents with the orange-colored juices. Transfer the chicken mixture to a large serving platter and serve. Making Leftovers Right Chicken Quesadillas: You can reheat what remains (removing the bones from the chicken first) within 2 days, maybe with some canned diced tomatoes, sherry, and orange juice, but my absolute favorite final destination for this dish is a quesadilla. When I was last in Kansas City, that shining city of lights, I breakfasted on a chicken, pepper jack, and potato quesadilla (as one does) and it inspired me. So, just get as many soft flour tortillas as your leftovers command, take the bones out of the chicken, dice the meat along with the chorizo and potatoes, and stir in some diced, shredded, or grated cheese (Cheddar, mozzarella, Monterey Jack, all are possible), dollop some of the mixture into each tortilla, fold, then griddle or fry. Make sure the chicken is piping hot. And do see p.433 for more in-depth instruction. This makes for a splendid hangover-banishing breakfast or near-instant dinner, the sort you chow down on while watching something compellingly bad on TV. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 3679,&quot;Wolfgang Puck&#39;s Recipe for Pizza Dough 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey or sugar 3/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees F) 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons olive oil Tomato sauce and cheese Cheese, tomatoes, olives Salmon, sour cream mixed with chopped dill Cheese, chili oil, pesto Instructions: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4 cup of warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil, and when absorbed, scrape in the dissolved yeast. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of water and knead on low speed about 5 minutes. Turn out onto a board and knead 2 or 3 minutes longer. Dough should be smooth and firm. Let rise in a warm spot, covered with a damp towel, about 30 minutes. (Dough will stretch when lightly pulled.) Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be loosely covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for 1 to 2 days. Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F. Place a pizza stone in the oven. To prepare each pizza, place a ball of dough on a lightly floured surface. Press down on the center, spreading the dough or roll into a 7 or 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. Brush lightly with oil and arrange the topping of your choice only over the inner circle. Arrange the pizza on the baking stone and bake at 610 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pizza is nicely browned. Transfer to a firm surface and cut into slices with a pizza cutter.

Using a small knife, slice away the bitter pith and with it the thinnest possible layer of fruit. Cutting against the membranes, release each section of grapefruit intact; remove any seeds. Set the sections aside for the moment and, working over a bowl, squeeze as much juice from the membranes as you can, to use in the cocktail sauce; discard the membranes.</li><li>Halve, pit and peel the avocados, then rub the exposed fruit with the cut lemon to keep it from darkening. Slice each avocado half into 3 wedges and give the wedges a squirt of lemon juice.</li><li>Arrange the lettuce in an even layer in the bottom of a large shallow bowl. Mound the tomatoes in the center of the bowl and surround them with alternating slices of grapefruit and avocado. Sprinkle the tarragon over the tomatoes. Cover the salad and keep it refrigerated until serving time. (The salad can be made a couple of hours ahead of time and kept tightly covered and chilled.)<br> The Crayfish:</li><li>If the crayfish are cooked and peeled, move on to the cocktail sauce. If they&#39;re live, bring 1 gallon of water to a boil in a stockpot. Add all the ingredients, return to the boil, and simmer, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and cool the crayfish in the water for 10 minutes. Drain and discard the cooking liquid.</li><li>To peel crayfish, twist off and discard the head. Peel off the upper three sections of shell, then, holding the meat in one hand and the tip of the tail in the other, squeeze the tail while pulling the meat out of the shell. The vein in the center of the crayfish should come off with the shell. If it doesn&#39;t, remove it by hand, then use your finger to rub off any yellow coral that clings to the meat. Set the crayfish aside.<br> The Cocktail Sauce:</li><li>Boil the grapefruit juice until it is reduced to 2 teaspoons; cool.</li><li>Whisk the yolk, mustard, salt and pepper to taste, and cayenne together in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, add the oil in a slow stream. When the mixture is emulsified, like mayonnaise, whisk in all the other ingredients, including the cooled grapefruit juice. Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary. (The sauce can be kept in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.)<br> To serve: Arrange the crayfish on the tomatoes sprinkle with almonds, and serve the sauce on the side.<br> To drink: A light, dry Alsatian Gewurtztraminer or, perhaps, a Muscat Sec. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 3689,&quot;Cajun Cabbage Skillet 2 tablespoons canola oil 8 ounces chicken andouille sausages, sliced diagonally 1/4-inch thick (about 1 heaping cup)<br> 1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced (about 2 scant cups)<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/2 small head green cabbage, cored, halved crosswise and sliced 1/4-inch thick (about 6 cups)<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1/2 small sweet-tart apple such as Gala or McIntosh, cored and sliced 1/8-inch thick (about 3/4 cup)<br> 1 large scallion, thinly sliced (about 1/4 cup)<br> Hot sauce, for serving<br> Instructions: Heat a large cast-iron skillet or high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat.

Serve with salt and vinegar potato chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 3705,&quot;Hurricane Cocktails 10 ounces fresh orange juice 10 ounces sour mix, or fresh lime juice 3 tablespoons superfine sugar, or more to taste 1 large orange, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices 12 ounces light rum</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/Heat the oil in a large.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Heat%20oil%20to%20375%20degrees.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Heat oil to 375 degrees</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/Herbed%20Gravy.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Herbed Gravy</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
