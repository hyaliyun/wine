serving Instructions: In a large bowl, combine beef, 1/4 can mushroom soup, bread crumbs, egg, onions, and steak seasoning. Mix thoroughly and shape into 4 oval patties. Heat oil and 1 tablespoon butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown patties on both sides and transfer to a plate. Add remaining butter and cognac (remove pan from heat when adding cognac.) Saute mushrooms for 7 to 8 minutes. Add beef stock and whisk in gravy mix until smooth. Stir in remaining mushroom soup. Return patties to skillet and spoon gravy over top. Cover pan and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Serve Salisbury Steaks and Mushroom Gravy over hot cooked rice. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 7442,&quot;Pacific Rim Grilled Steak and Noodle Salad 1 beef flank steak (1-1/2 to 2 pounds) Noodle Salad (recipe follows) Toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onions (optional) 2/3 cup teriyaki marinade and sauce 1/2 cup orange marmalade 3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 4 garlic cloves, minced 8 ounces uncooked whole grain or wheat spaghetti 2 cups broccoli florets 1 medium red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips 1 cup carrots, cut into 1/4-inch diagonal slices 1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped Instructions: Combine marinade ingredients in glass measuring cup, whisking until just blended. Cover and refrigerate 2/3 cup for dressing. Place beef steak and remaining marinade in plastic bag; turn steak to coat. Close bag securely and marinate in refrigerator 6 hours or as long as overnight, turning occasionally. Prepare Noodle Salad. Meanwhile, remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Place steak on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, covered, 11 to 16 minutes (over medium heat on preheated gas grill, 16 to 21 minutes) for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning occasionally. Carve steak diagonally across the grain into slices; sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions, if desired. Serve steak with noodle salad. Noodle Salad: Cook whole grain or wheat spaghetti according to package directions, adding broccoli florets, red bell pepper and carrot during last 3 minutes of cooking; drain. Place pasta mixture in large serving bowl. Stir in fresh basil. Heat reserved 2/3 cup dressing in microwave on HIGH 30 to 60 seconds or until hot, stirring once. Add to pasta mixture, tossing to combine. Set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 7443,&quot;Chicken Salad Sandwiches With Walnut-Dill Pesto 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon 1 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 small bunch dill, leaves and tender stems (about 1 cup) 1/4 cup walnuts 1 small clove garlic 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1 2 1/2-pound rotisserie chicken, skin removed and meat shredded 2 tomatoes, sliced 1/2 head Boston lettuce, leaves separated 8 thick slices country white bread, lightly toasted Potato chips, for serving (optional) Instructions: Combine the onion, lemon juice, sugar, 1/4 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl; set aside. Put the dill, walnuts and garlic in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until the mixture comes together, scraping down the sides of the processor as needed. Transfer the dill pesto to a large bowl and stir in the lemon zest and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Drain the onion and squeeze dry. Drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Divide the lettuce and tomatoes among 4 pieces of bread; top each with some chicken salad, onion and another piece of bread. Serve with chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7444,&quot;Honey-Orange Souffle Softened unsalted butter, for the dish 6 tablespoons sugar, plus more for the dish 6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 6 ounces goat cheese, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 5 large eggs, separated, at room temperature 1/3 cup fresh orange juice 1/3 cup honey Kosher salt Segments from 1/2 orange, roughly chopped Instructions: Prepare the souffle: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and generously butter a 4-cup souffle dish. Wrap the dish with a buttered parchment collar (see right). Sprinkle the inside with sugar and shake out the excess. Combine the cream cheese, goat cheese, orange and lemon zests and the vanilla in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks until incorporated. (At this point, the mixture can be covered and refrigerated up to 6 hours; bring to room temperature before continuing.) When ready to bake, put the egg whites in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium speed until foamy. (Make sure the bowl and beaters are clean.) Increase the speed to medium high and gradually add 6 tablespoons sugar; beat until stiff and glossy. Stir one-third of the egg whites into the cheese mixture to lighten it, then gently fold in the rest until just incorporated. (It&#39;s OK if a few streaks of egg white remain.) Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish and bake in the center of the oven until puffed and golden, about 35 minutes. Meanwhile, make the compote: Combine the orange juice, honey and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan over medium heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Let cool slightly, then add the orange segments. Remove the souffle from the oven and remove the parchment collar. Serve immediately with the compote-the souffle will start sinking after a couple of minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 7445,&quot;Spicy Garlic Chicken Wings With Chow Chow and Blue Cheese Dip 2 pounds chicken wings, separated at the joint, tips discarded<br> 1 cup white vinegar<br> 1 cup kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1/4 cup dried whole cl de arbol<br> Canola oil, for frying<br> 1 cup peeled garlic cloves<br> 1 cup olive oil<br> 2 cups Frank&#39;s RedHot, or other hot sauce 3 stalks celery, thinly sliced on the bias 2 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced on the bias<br> 1 cup cider vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 cup crumbled Maytag blue cheese, or other blue cheese 1/2 cup Greek yogurt<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon celery salt Instructions: For the wings: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Combine the wings, vinegar, salt, sugar and cl in a large pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Once at a boil, remove from the heat, strain the wings and pat them dry. Place the wings on a baking sheet. Bake until the wings are dry, about 15 minutes. While the wings bake, fill a large, deep pot with 3 inches of oil. Place over medium-high heat and bring to 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, fry the wings until crispy and cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes per batch, raising or lowering the heat as necessary to keep the oil at temperature. Drain the wings on a wire rack set over a sheet pan.<br> Meanwhile, combine the garlic and olive oil in a medium saucepan. Place over medium heat until the oil just simmers. Cover the pan, adjust the heat and simmer until the garlic is tender, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then transfer the oil and garlic to a blender and blend until smooth. Add the hot sauce and pulse until combined. Add a little water if necessary so the mixture is about as thick as syrup. Pour the sauce into a very large bowl. Add the wings and toss to coat.<br> For the chow-chow: Combine the celery, carrots, vinegar, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and let cool. Drain.<br> For the dip: Combine the blue cheese, yogurt, mayonnaise, pepper and celery salt in a food processor. Blend until smooth.<br> Serve the wings with the dip and chow-chow on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 7446,&quot;Caramel Pear Ice cubes 1/2 cup pear infused vodka 1/2 cup apple juice 2 tablespoons Spiced Simple Syrup, recipe follows Pear slice 2 cups packed brown sugar 2 cups water 3 cinnamon sticks 2 tablespoons juniper berries 2 tablespoons cloves 5 whole star anise Instructions: In a martini shaker filled with ice, combine the vodka, juice and simple syrup. Shake well and strain into a martini glass. Garnish with a slice of pear. In a pot combine the sugar, water, and spices. Bring up to a simmer, stirring occasionally until all the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture thorough a strainer and discard the whole spices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 7447,&quot;Thai Style Fried Chicken with Lemongrass Sauce 1 gallon canola oil, for frying 2 cups sweet chili sauce (mae ploy) 2 cups minced lemongrass 1 cup fish sauce 1 cup minced garlic 1 cup minced ginger 1 cup minced garlic chives 4 cups all-purpose flour 4 ounces salt 2 ounces dark chili powder 2 ounces garlic powder 2 ounces paprika 4 eggs 4 cups milk 2 pounds boneless chicken thighs 4 cups rice flour Instructions: Heat the oil to 325 degrees F.<br> Combine the sweet chili, lemongrass, fish sauce, garlic, ginger and garlic chives in a pot and warm over medium-low heat. Mix together 2 cups of the flour, the salt, dark chili powder, garlic powder and paprika in a large bowl.

Put the tofu between 2 plates, and weight the top plate down with about 4 pounds (3 large cans or a large, heavy skillet) for about 20 minutes to remove excess moisture. Meanwhile, whisk together 1/2 cup of the vinegar, 1/2 cup water, the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until the sugar and salt dissolve. Add the carrots and cucumbers, toss to coat and chill until ready to serve. Whisk together the mayonnaise and Sriracha in a small bowl; set aside. Pat the tofu dry, and cut it into 8 1/2-inch-thick slices. Grate the garlic into a large bowl, and stir in the hoisin, the remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar and the oil. Add the mushroom caps, and stir to coat. Lightly oil the grill grates. Shaking off any excess marinade, put the mushroom caps on the grill. Grill them for about 1 minute, rotating them once to char more of the cap, then flip and cook until almost tender, 30 seconds to 1 minute more. Transfer the mushrooms to a platter, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Toss the tofu in the marinade, then grill, marinade-side down, for 2 minutes. Flip, and grill the second side for 2 more minutes. Transfer the tofu to the platter. Open the rolls, and grill, cut-side down, until just toasty, about 2 minutes.

The slow-fry method: Melt the lard in a large (4-quart), heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. When it has melted but is not yet very hot, add the pork, water and lime zest. Cook with the lard at a gentle simmer, turning the pork occasionally, for about 40 minutes, until it is barely tender. Raise the heat to medium-high. If all of the water hasn&#39;t yet evaporated, the lard will come to a rolling boil, which will eventually diminish into small bubbles as the water evaporates. After the change occurs, the carnitas will need about 10 minutes to brown. Watch them carefully and remove when they are a light golden brown. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. The boil-then-fry method: Place the meat in a single layer in a wide, heavy saucepan, add enough water to cover the meat by 1/2-inch, measure in the salt, and set over medium heat. Simmer, partially covered, turning the pork occasionally, until the meat is barely tender, about 40 minutes. Uncover, raise the heat to medium-high, and quickly boil away the liquid. When you hear the meat begin to fry in its own rendered lard (once the water is gone), turn the heat down to between medium and medium-low. Let the pork fry, turning frequently, until evenly browned, about 30 minutes. Remove the ribs from the pan, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with a little salt. While the meat is cooking, prepare the guacamole, scoop it into a serving bowl and garnish. Serve the crispy ribs on a warm serving platter and pass the guacamole to eat along with them. Or cut the meat off the bones and roll with the guacamole into tacos. In a medium-size bowl, mix the finely chopped onion and chiles with the optional tomato, garlic, and cilantro. Close to the time you are going to serve, halve the avocados lengthwise by cutting from the stem to flower ends, around the pits. Twist the avocado halves in opposite directions to loosen the meat from pits, then scoop out the pits, and reserve. Scrape the avocado pulp from the skins and add it to the bowl. Using your hand or a spoon, roughly mash the avocado while mixing in the other ingredients, making a course, thick mass. Flavor with salt, then enough lime juice to add a little zing, if you wish. Return the pits to the guacamole and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the mixture. Set aside for a few minutes to let the flavors blend. The guacamole is very attractive in a pottery bowl or Mexican mortar, sprinkle with chopped onion, cilantro, radish slices and/or queso fresco (cheese); radish roses really dress it up. about 3 cups, serving 6 as an appetizer, 12 to 15 as a dip &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 7495,&quot;Provencal Potato Gratin 4 large clove garlic, smashed 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1 medium yellow onion, sliced 1 red pepper, peeled, seeded and diced (3/4 cup) 1/4 cup dry white vermouth 2 pounds Yukon gold or other waxy potatoes (about 4 to 5), peeled 1 cup water 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 1 pound plum tomatoes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Place in a blender with the butter and puree. Set aside. For the sausage balls: Grease a rimmed baking sheet with the oil. Combine the sausage, cheese, pancake mix, chives, a big pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a large bowl and mix well. Roll into 1 1/2-inch balls (about the size of a Ping-Pong ball). Place on the prepared baking sheet in an even layer, leaving 1 inch between balls. Bake until cooked through and browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve with the applesauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 7511,&quot;Western Skillet Eggs 1/2 cup half-and-half or whole milk Pinch of cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 shallots, sliced 2 large green bell peppers, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch strips 1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved 1/4 pound thinly sliced ham, cut into 1-inch pieces 4 slices sourdough bread, torn into pieces (about 2 cups) 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for topping 8 large eggs Instructions: Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Whisk the half-and-half, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste in a small bowl. Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook until just softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the bell peppers; cook until the peppers are soft and the shallots are golden, 5 to 6 more minutes. Add the tomatoes, ham, bread, parsley and 1/4 cup water and cook until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Remove from the heat. Make 8 evenly spaced indentations in the bread mixture with the bottom of a ladle or small measuring cup. Crack an egg into each indentation. Slowly pour the half-and-half mixture over the eggs. Bake, rotating the skillet a few times, until the whites are set, about 15 minutes. Top with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 7512,&quot;Rice 2 cups long-grain rice 3 cups water or chicken broth 1 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the rice in a medium saucepan with a cover.

Smooth the rice to make an even surface, cover and heat over low to medium-low heat until all the liquid has been absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7513,&quot;Classic Cupcakes with Lemon Meringue Frosting 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs, room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 4 large egg whites 2/3 cup sugar 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest Pinch cream of tartar Pinch fine salt 1 to 2 drops pastel food coloring Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the muffin tin with cupcake liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until light and foamy, about 2 minutes. While beating, gradually pour in the butter and then the vanilla. While mixing slowly, add half the dry ingredients, then add all the milk, and follow with the rest of the dry ingredients. Take care not to over mix the batter. Divide the batter evenly in the prepared tin (about 1/3 cup batter per cup cake.) Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool cupcakes on a rack in the tin for 10 minutes, then remove. Cool on the rack completely. For Meringue: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a mixer&#39;s bowl above the water. Whisk the egg whites, sugar, lemon juice and zest, cream of tarter and salt in the bowl by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until meringue is cool and holds a soft peak, about 5 minutes. Add a few drops of desired food coloring and continue beating until it holds stiff peaks. To decorate: Using a spoon, offset spatula or piping bag, dollop, spread or pipe meringue on top of each cupcake. Use the back of a spoon to create peaks and valleys in the cupcake as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7514,&quot;Chickpea-Potato Dip 1 large all-purpose potato, scrubbed Kosher salt 5 cloves garlic One 15.5-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar Crushed red pepper flakes, for garnish Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish 1 large cucumber, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds Half an 18-ounce bag of pita chips (about 3 cups) Instructions: Put the potato in a medium saucepan, add enough water to cover and salt generously. Bring to a simmer, then cook until fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Add the garlic, cook for 2 minutes, then drain. When the potato is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and cut the potato into chunks. Transfer the cooked potato and garlic to a food processor. Add the chickpeas, oil, 1/2 cup cold water, vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt. Process, scraping down the bowl a few times, until the mixture becomes a creamy puree. Transfer the dip (serve at room temperature or chilled) to a serving vessel, drizzle oil over the top and sprinkle with pepper flakes and parsley. (The dip can be made a day ahead and refrigerated.) Serve with cucumber rounds and pita chips for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o]&quot; 7515,&quot;Bacon, Egg and Shrimp Fried Rice 1 1/2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil 3 eggs, lightly beaten 4 ounces pancetta or bacon, diced 1 clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon peeled and grated fresh ginger 4 ounces bay shrimp 4 ounces fresh or frozen peas (about 3/4 cup) 2 cups cooked jasmine rice (preferably day old) 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil Sea salt and freshly ground white pepper 2 scallions, chopped Instructions: Heat a wok over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil. Add the eggs, reduce the heat a bit and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes to scramble. Remove and set aside. Reheat the wok and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon peanut oil. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta, garlic and ginger, then stir quickly. Once the pancetta begins to turn brown, 1 to 2 minutes, add in the shrimp and peas and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes more. Add the cooked rice and stir well to break it up in the wok. Add the scrambled eggs back in, season with the light soy and toss to coat the rice. Add in the toasted sesame oil and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately garnished with chopped scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 7516,&quot;Fresh White Bloody Mary 4 green tomatoes, roughly chopped 1 hot house cucumber, roughly chopped 2 ribs celery, peeled to remove tough outer fibers and roughly chopped 3 cups seedless green grapes, plus more for garnish 1 jalapeno, seeded 2 tablespoons horseradish 1 tablespoon superfine sugar 2 lime wedges, plus more for garnish Crushed ice 2 to 3 ounces vodka, chilled 1 tablespoon salt and freshly ground black pepper, on a small plate Cucumber spears, celery sticks, for garnish Instructions: Add the tomatoes, cucumber, celery, 3 cups of grapes and jalapeno to a blender and puree. Set up a sieve lined with cheesecloth over a large bowl and pour in the pureed mixture. Set the bowl in the refrigerator while it strains. Once you have the extracted the liquid, remove it from the refrigerator. Add the horseradish, superfine sugar and 2 lime wedges to a pitcher and muddle with a wooden spoon. Stir in the extracted tomato juice, some crushed ice and a few splashes of vodka. Stir to combine. Rub a lime wedge on part of the rim of each glass. Dip the rim into the salt and pepper mixture so it sticks to the wet part of the rim. Pour the drink into the glasses and garnish with cucumber spears, celery sticks and a few grapes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 7517,&quot;Snickerdoodle Skillet Cookie 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 large egg 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat, then set aside to cool slightly, 5 minutes. Whisk the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt together in a medium bowl. Vigorously whisk 1 cup of the granulated sugar, brown sugar and egg together in a large bowl. Whisk in the melted butter. (Do not wipe out the skillet.) Add the flour mixture and continue whisking until the dough comes together. Let the dough and buttered skillet rest, separately, in a cool place for 30 minutes. (This allows the dough to firm up and the skillet to cool.)<br> Mix together the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and the cinnamon in a large bowl. Shape the dough into a large ball and gently roll it in the sugar mixture until evenly coated.<br> Place the dough ball in the center of the prepared skillet. Bake until the sides are browned, the center is still soft, and the surface of the cookie cracks, about 35 minutes, rotating once halfway through. Cool on a wire rack at least 15 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve warm or room temperature. Store in a sealed container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 7518,&quot;Roasted Carrots and Red Leaf Lettuce Salad with Buttermilk Herb Dressing 1 small bunch carrots with leafy green tops 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> 1/2 teaspoon sea salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup buttermilk 1/4 cup plain yogurt<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon honey<br> 3/4 teaspoon sea salt<br> 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons minced chives<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill<br> 2 tablespoons chopped carrot leaves (from the reserved tops)<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano<br> 1 head red leaf lettuce, torn into pieces 3 tablespoons chopped pistachios<br> 3 tablespoons chopped dried cherries<br> 3 ounces crumbled extra sharp Cheddar Instructions: For the carrots: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut the green leaves from the carrot tops, then rinse, drain and set them aside to use for the dressing. Use a vegetable brush to clean the carrots (leave the peel on to give the carrots texture). Cut them on the diagonal into 1-inch pieces. In a small bowl, toss the carrots with the olive oil, honey, salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking sheet and roast until tender and caramelized (I like mine to be on the borderline of starting to burn), about 20 minutes. Keep an eye on them; they burn easily! Let cool completely. For the dressing: While the carrots cool, make the dressing. Whisk the buttermilk, yogurt, olive oil, vinegar, honey, salt and pepper in a bowl until emulsified. Stir in the chives, tarragon, dill, carrot leaves and oregano. For the salad: In a large salad bowl, toss the lettuce, pistachios, cherries, cheese and carrots with the dressing. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7519,&quot;Salmon Mousse 1 pound salmon fillet, skin off and pin bones removed 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound soft cream cheese 1/4 cup brandy 1 lemon, zested and juiced Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: For the salmon: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

For the crust: Put the butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl, cover with a paper towel and melt in the microwave in 10-second increments. Brush a 9-inch springform pan with some of the melted butter.<br> Stir together the remaining butter with the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the pan, taking care to get the crust evenly to the edges. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool. Place the pan on a large sheet of foil and wrap up the sides. Place in a roasting pan.<br> For the cheesecake: Beat together the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sour cream and vanilla and beat until just combined. Mix in the eggs by hand, one at a time, until just combined. (Take care not to overmix or the cheesecake will puff up and crack.) Pour the batter evenly over the crust, smoothing the top. Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come about halfway up the sides of the foil-wrapped springform pan. Bake until the outside of the cake is set but the center is still slightly loose, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.<br> Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in the oven for another hour. Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan to a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edge and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours.<br> Run a knife around the edge of the pan once more and unlock to unmold the cheesecake.

It will be thin, like pancake batter; transfer it to a liquid measuring cup to make filling the muffin cup easier. Divide the batter evenly among the cups of the prepared muffin tin. Top each with a mound of apple filling. Bake for 15 minutes (the cupcakes will spread quite a bit). Remove the tin from the oven, gently brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Continue to bake until the tops of the cupcakes, which bake and puff around the apple filling, spring back when pressed, 6 to 8 minutes more. Let the cupcakes cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. For the whipped topping: Beat the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and sour cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture forms soft peaks. Transfer it to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag (snip off the tip). Pipe a dollop of whipped topping onto each cupcake (don&#39;t completely hide the cupcake), and sprinkle with cinnamon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7536,&quot;No-Bake Peanut Butter Bars 2 sticks salted butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan 1 cup chunky peanut butter<br> 2 cups powdered sugar<br> One 12-ounce box vanilla wafers One 12-ounce bag mini semisweet chocolate chips 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter<br> 1/2 cup chopped peanuts Instructions: For the filling: Grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with some butter.

Fry the onions in the skillet, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes. Add the red and green bell peppers and continue to cook until the onions are deep golden brown, at least another 5 to 10 minutes (maybe longer). Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the pie crust on a floured surface and press it into a large, fluted, deep tart pan (or a deep-dish pie pan).<br> Whip the cream, eggs and some salt and pepper in a large bowl, then mix in the cheese, ham and onion-pepper mixture. Pour into the pie crust. Put the pan on a rimmed baking sheet, cover lightly with aluminum foil and bake for 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the quiche is set and the crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer. (The quiche will still seem slightly loose, but will continue to set once removed from the oven.) Allow to sit for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting. If using a tart pan, remove the quiche from the pan. Cut into slices with a sharp serrated knife and serve! In a large bowl, gradually work the shortening and butter into the flour with a pastry cutter until it resembles a coarse meal, 3 to 4 minutes. In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork and pour it into the flour/shortening mixture. Add the cold water, white vinegar and salt. Stir together gently until the ingredients are incorporated. Separate the dough into 2 pieces and place each piece into a large ziptop bag. Using a rolling pin, slightly flatten each ball of dough into a disc (about 1/2 inch thick) to make rolling easier later. Seal the bags and place them in the freezer until you need them. If you will be using the dough immediately, it&#39;s still a good idea to put it in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to chill.

Allow them to steep while you prepare the other ingredients, at least 30 minutes.<br> Roast the pecans on a baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Allow them to cool, then process to a fine consistency in a food processor; set aside.<br> Toast the bolillo in the oven directly on the rack until toasted and golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool, then tear into large pieces and process in a food processor to make fine breadcrumbs; set aside (there should be about 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs).<br> Toast the sesame seeds in a small pan over medium heat, stirring, until just beginning to turn light brown, about 3 minutes. Grind in a coffee or spice grinder until finely ground; set aside.<br> In an 8-quart pot, add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil and set over medium heat.<br> Drain the water from the chiles, tomatoes and garlic and begin blending them in a blender on high speed in batches. Add 1 cup of chicken broth to each batch, then pour into the 8-quart pot. Raise the heat to medium high and start adding the other ingredients. First, add the peanut butter and stir until it is well blended into the mixture. Next, add the ground sesame seeds and stir until you work out any lumps that may be visible in the sauce. Do the same with the finely ground pecans and chocolate tablet. Add the breadcrumbs, 1 teaspoon black pepper, cumin, cocoa, sugar, chopped chocolate and bouillon. Cook, stirring and working out any lumps that may be visible in the sauce. If you think the sauce is too thick, add another cup of broth. Bring down the heat to medium low while you start to sear the chicken.<br> Heat a griddle (the type you use for pancakes) or large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and sear on the griddle for 6 to 8 minutes per side.<br> Add the chicken to the sauce and allow to simmer until the chicken is very tender and the mole is thickened, 45 to 60 minutes. Taste occasionally for more salt or sweetness to your liking.\u202f<br> I like to accompany my mole with homemade Tex-Mex rice and bolillos. Enjoy.

Cover the container with parchment paper and tape it shut. Make the front and back: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Use a paring knife to cut a piece that is about 9 inches wide by 10 inches tall. You will need 2 of these pieces. Let the chocolate set slightly. While the chocolate is still pliable, curve each piece around the glass container and gently pinch the sides together. It will take a moment for the chocolate to set but this will give the bag its unique shape. When the chocolate is set, pull the glass container from the middle and peel off the acetate. Make the handbag base: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Use a paring knife to cut a base that is the shape of the space between the front and back. This is easy to do if you allow the chocolate to set slightly. Set the molded front and back on top of the chocolate and use a sharp paring knife to trace around the outside. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Use tempered chocolate to glue the piece into place at the bottom. Make the weaving strips: Roll out the dark molding chocolate to a 20-inch long rectangle. Use cornstarch to keep the modeling plastic from sticking to the rolling pin or the work surface. Use a sharp paring knife to cut 1-inch wide strips that are about 18 inches long. Repeat using the white molding chocolate. You will need 9 dark strips and 8 white strips for the weave. You will need 2 to 4 more strips for the handle strap, depending on the length of the strap, and a few inches for the logo. Weave the dark and white chocolate strips so the woven piece is slightly larger than the solid handbag. Place the handbag on its side so you can access the front. Use a pastry brush to paint a thin layer of tempered chocolate onto the front of the handbag. Carefully lift the woven piece and position it on top of the tempered chocolate, adhering it to the front of the bag. Use a sharp paring knife to trim as necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 7558,&quot;5 Bean Chili 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef 2 cups chopped onion 1 (15-ounce) can light red kidney beans, drained 1 (15-ounce) can dark red kidney beans, drained 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained 1 (15-ounce) can butter beans, drained 1 (15-ounce) can pinto beans, drained 2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans diced tomatoes with jalapenos 2 (1 1/4 ounce) packets chili seasoning mix 1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce 1 cup water Salt and pepper Suggested servings: cornbread, sour cream, cheese, chips, and fresh cilantro Instructions: In a skillet over medium-high heat, brown ground beef with the onions.

Grease the bottoms and sides of two 8-inch round cake pans. Prepare the cake batter according to the package instructions. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake the cakes, rotating the pans halfway through, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Let cool in the pans about 10 minutes, then turn out onto cooling racks and let cool completely. For the frosting: Meanwhile, combine the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla, salt and 3 tablespoons milk the in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer). Mix on low speed until mostly incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until smooth, adding more milk as necessary to make a spreadable frosting.<br> Transfer 1 cup of the frosting to a small bowl and tint with the brown gel food coloring. Scrape the brown frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch plain round tip (number 804).<br> Tint the remaining frosting with the lemon yellow and golden yellow gel food coloring. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain round tip (number 803) with 3 cups of the yellow frosting.<br> Cover the remaining yellow frosting (about 3 1/4 cups) with plastic warp and reserve for frosting the cake. To assemble: Place one cake layer upside down on an extra-large cutting board or platter (at least 20-by-14-inches). Using a serrated knife, cut the other cake layer into 8 wedges. Lightly trim the rounded side of each wedge so it is flat; discard the trimmings. Arrange the wedges around the cake, trimmed side against the cake, to create a sunflower shape. Pipe a circle of yellow frosting around the center cake to create a 1/2-inch border.<br> Spread the reserved yellow frosting in the bowl evenly over the top and sides of the cake, (including the petals), leaving the circle inside the piped border unfrosted.<br> Pipe a continuous spiral of brown frosting inside the 1/2-inch yellow border, starting at the edge of the border and working in towards the middle until the center of the cake is filled.<br> Place one brown candy on its edge in the center of the brown frosting. Place a second candy next to it, leaving a candy-size space between. Continue to place candies around the center, working out towards the edge and arranging the successive rows of candies in the spaces between the previous rows until the center of the cake is filled. Holding the pastry bag with the remaining yellow frosting at a 45-degree angle, pipe a small dollop of frosting on the edge of one of the cake petals, stopping and pulling the bag off the dollop to create a tip. Repeat the dollops, working out toward the tip of the petal until the petal is filled. Repeat with the remaining petals.

Add the salt. Place the eggs over high heat and bring to a boil, then turn off the heat, cover the pot and let sit for 13 to 15 minutes. Prepare an ice bath. Remove the eggs from the pot and place into the ice bath to cool. For the filling: Peel the eggs, cut them in half and place half of the yolks in a food processor. Add the basil, chives and 1/2 cup of the mayonnaise to the processor and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the filling to a resealable plastic bag. Clean out the bowl of the food processor. Place the remaining egg yolks into the clean processor, add the roasted red peppers and remaining 1/2 cup mayonnaise and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a second resealable bag. Add the red food coloring and 1/2 teaspoon of the vinegar to 2 cups of room temperature water in a bowl and mix well. Add half of the egg whites (make sure you remove the membranes from the egg halves so they don&#39;t affect the dyeing process) and let soak until the desired color is achieved, at least 15 minutes. Repeat the same process with the green food coloring and remaining vinegar. It will take longer to get a deep green color. Remove the eggs from the dye and pat dry. Arrange on a serving tray and pipe the green filling into the red egg halves and the red filling into the green egg halves. Garnish the green filling with chopped chives. Garnish the red filling with finely chopped red pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7581,&quot;Cauliflower Melt 1 head cauliflower 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 teaspoons mustard powder<br> 2 teaspoons smoked paprika<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 1/4 cup yellow mustard Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon stone-ground mustard<br> 1 tablespoon honey Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 4 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature 8 slices sourdough bread 8 ounces butterkase or gruyere cheese, shredded 2 pears, thinly sliced Instructions: Roast the cauliflower: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

With a sharp knife, make several small cuts in the meat, without cutting all the way through. Press a sliver of garlic into each cut. If you have any garlic left over, set it aside. In a shallow, non-reactive pan, mix together the olive oil, rosemary, salt, pepper, and any leftover slivers of garlic. Place the steak in the olive oil marinade and turn to coat. Let sit at room temperature for about 1/2 hour. Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill for direct grilling over high heat. Remove the steaks from the pan, discard the marinade, and place the steaks on the grill. A thicker steak (such as the porterhouse) will take at least 10 minutes per side to reach medium-rare (145 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer) and a thinner steak (such as the T-bone) will take as little as 7 minutes per side. Remove the steak from the grill and place it on a cutting board. Cover the meat with a piece of aluminum foil to keep it warm, and allow the meat to rest for 5 minutes before slicing it against the grain. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 7583,&quot;Sweet Potato Pudding Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the baking dish 2 1/2 pounds medium sweet potatoes (about 3), poked with a fork<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, room temperature<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 cup sugar<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 tablespoon self-rising cornmeal<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 cup pecan halves<br> 1/2 cup packed brown sugar<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk the cocoa powder and instant espresso in a large bowl. Pour in the vegetable oil, water, milk and vanilla extract and whisk until smooth. Add the baking soda, baking powder, salt and eggs and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the granulated sugar until well combined. Fold in the flour until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out with just a few crumbs, 33 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely in the dish, about 1 hour. Freeze until hardened, about 1 hour. For the buttercream: Meanwhile, fit a piping bag with a 1/2-inch round tip. Combine the sugar, butter and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld mixer). Mix on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium high and mix until smooth and thick but pliable. Adjust the consistency if needed by mixing in the milk. Transfer the buttercream to the piping bag. If the buttercream has become too soft and warm, refrigerate until chilled, about 10 minutes. With a short side of the cake dish facing you, pipe 7 rows of buttercream crosswise on the cake 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart. Return the cake to the freezer until the buttercream is very cold, about 30 minutes. For the fudge frosting: Whisk the confectioners\u2019 sugar, buttermilk and vanilla in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the cocoa powder, corn syrup and salt and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Fit the saucepan with a candy thermometer, reduce the heat to medium low and cook until the mixture reaches 240 degrees F. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the butter a few pieces at a time, whisking constantly, until the frosting is smooth. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Pour half of the fudge frosting over the buttercream rows, tilting the dish slightly so that the entire surface is covered and the fudge drips down the sides of the cake. Return the dish to the freezer until the fudge hardens, about 10 minutes. Repeat frosting with the remaining fudge and refrigerate the cake for 20 minutes to let the fudge harden before serving. Be sure to use a sharp knife to cut the cake; the fudge is sticky, especially around the edges of the cake. The cake can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 7587,&quot;String Beans with Garlic 1 1/2 pounds French string beans (haricots verts), both ends removed Kosher salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon good olive oil 2 to 3 garlic cloves, sliced Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Blanch the string beans in a large pot of boiling salted water for just 1 1/2 minutes.

If using masa harina, mix it with the hot water, then knead until smooth, adding more water or more masa harina to achieve a very soft (but not sticky) consistency; cover with plastic and let rest 30 minutes. When you&#39;re ready to bake the tortillas, readjust the consistency of the fresh or reconstituted masa, then divide into 15 balls and cover with plastic. Heat a large, ungreased, heavy griddle or 2 heavy skillets: one end of the griddle (or one skillet) over medium-low, the other end (or the other skillet) over medium to medium-high. Cut 2 squares of heavy plastic to fit the plates of your tortillas press. With the press open, place a square of plastic over the bottom plate, set a ball of dough in the center, cover with the second square of plastic, and gently flatten the dough between. Close the top plate and press down gently but firmly with the handle. Open, turn the tortilla 180 degrees, close and gently press again, to an even 1/16-inch thickness. Open the press and peel off the top sheet of plastic. Flip the tortillas onto one hand, dough side down, then starting at one corner, gently peel off the remaining sheet of the plastic. Lay the tortilla onto the cooler end of the griddle (or the cooler skillet). In a about 20 seconds, when the tortilla loosens itself from the griddle (but the edges have not yet dried or curled), flip it over onto the hotter end of the griddle (or onto the hotter skillet). When lightly browned in spots underneath, 20 to 30 seconds more, flip a second time, back onto the side that was originally down. If the fire is properly hot, the tortilla will balloon up like a pita bread, When lightly browned, another 20 or 30 seconds, remove from the griddle (it will completely deflate) and wrap in a towel. Press, unmold and bake the remaining balls of masa, placing each hot tortilla on top of the last and keeping the stack well wrapped. Resting. Let the wrapped stack of tortillas rest for about 15 minutes to finish their cooking, soften and become pliable. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 7591,&quot;Lasagna with Bolognese Meat Sauce 3 cups hot milk 6 tablespoons butter 6 tablespoons flour 1/2 each teaspoon salt and ground white pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 small onion, chopped 1/2 cup chopped celery 1/2 cup finely chopped carrot 1 pound ground beef Salt and pepper 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 cups canned plum tomatoes, seeds removed and roughly chopped 1 cup water 2 pounds fresh pasta sheets, cut into strips 4 by 17 inches 12 quarts water in a large pot suitable in which to cook the pasta 2 tablespoons salt A large bowl of water with ice cubes to cool the pasta 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus additional grated cheese Instructions: For the bechamel: Gently heat the milk over a low flame but do not boil. While the milk is heating put the butter into a sauce pot and slowly melt over low heat. When the butter is melted whisk in the flour gradually to avoid lumps and gently cook this roux. Using a wire whisk, very slowly begin to pour the hot milk into the roux, a little at a time. Avoid lumps by going very slowly. When all the milk has been added, add the seasoning, turn the heat very low and cook for 20 minutes. When finished allow to cool somewhat before using in the lasagna recipe. For the Bolognese: Heat the oil and butter together, over low heat, in a heavy bottomed pot. Add the onion, celery and carrot and cook until wilted. Add the meat and, breaking up the meat with a fork or spoon, cook gently and stirring frequently. Season the meat with salt and pepper, add the wine and allow the wine to cook completely down to almost dry before adding the tomatoes and water. Adjust the heat to a slow simmer and, being careful not to cook too rapidly, cook the meat and tomato sauce for between 3 to 4 hours. Stir frequently to avoid scorching the bottom of the pot and keep an eye on this simmering pot. When the sauce has cooked for several hours and the excess water has cooked off, remove from the heat and allow to cool before assembling the lasagna. For the pasta: Bring the 12 quarts water to the boil. Before cooking the pasta have all the equipment and ice water ready for the cooking and chilling process. Add the salt to the pasta pot, reboil and begin to blanch or parcook the pasta in batches. Cook each batch for 2 to 3 minutes in rapidly boiling water before using a large wire strainer to scoop out the cooked pasta, submerge in the ice water and then resume cooking another batch of pasta using the same method. Small bathes ensure uniform cooking and cooling. When the pasta sheets have cooled in 1 or 2 minutes, remove them from the water and place them on paper towels to dry. When all the pasta has been cooked in this manner the lasagna may be assembled. To assemble and bake the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spread some bechamel on the bottom of the baking pan. Top with a layer of pasta sheets. Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on top of the pasta, top with a layer of bechamel, evenly sprinkle on some grated Parmigiano cheese and top with another single layer of pasta. Do this layering process until all of the ingredients have been used and making sure that the final and top layer is bechamel sauce with Parmigiano sprinkled on. When the baking dish is completely filled the lasagna is ready to be baked. Place into the oven and bake for 45 minutes until the top has browned and the edges are crispy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 7592,&quot;Halibut Green Curry 1 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish 1 cup packed fresh mint leaves 1/3 cup coconut milk 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 2 teaspoons light brown sugar Juice of 1 lime, plus wedges for serving 1 small clove garlic One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped 1/2 serrano pepper, seeded Kosher salt 1 large bunch kale, stemmed, washed and torn into bite-size pieces Four 6-ounce fillets halibut, about 1/2-inch thick (skin removed) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions for al dente. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, red peppers and paprika and cook, stirring occasionally, until the peppers are heated through and the butter is fragrant and vibrant red, about 2 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Add the shrimp and cook until they are firm and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the cooked pasta, Parmesan and 1 teaspoon salt and toss until well coated (see Cook&#39;s Note). Sprinkle with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 7602,&quot;Florence&#39;s Orange Cake 2 sticks butter, softened, plus more for greasing 8 ounces all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 8 ounces caster sugar (superfine) Finely grated zest of 1 orange 4 eggs 1 teaspoon baking powder Juice of 2 oranges, for cake, filling, and icing 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon butter, softened 8 ounces icing sugar (confectioners&#39;), sifted Finely grated zest of 1 orange Orange juice, as needed 11 ounces icing sugar (confectioners&#39;), sifted Crystallized flowers, for decorating, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the sides of 2 (8-inch) sandwich or cake pans or a (11-inch) springform pan with melted butter, and dust with flour. Line the base of each pan with greaseproof or parchment paper.<br> Cream the 2 sticks butter in a large bowl or in an electric food mixer until soft. Gradually add the sugar, and orange zest, and continue to beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well between each addition. Sift the 8 ounces flour and baking powder into the mixture, and stir. Gently, stir in 1 tablespoon of the orange juice.<br> Divide the mixture evenly between the 2 prepared pans, making a slight hollow in the center of each cake so that it will rise evenly without forming a peak. Bake in the oven until a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cakes, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let the cakes sit for 5 minutes, and then turn out onto a wire rack, and cool completely.<br> To make the orange filling: Cream the butter until very soft, and then add the sugar and orange zest. Gradually beat in 1 tablespoon of the orange juice to create a smooth, soft mixture.<br> To make the glace icing: Add enough orange juice to the sugar for a spreadable icing. If it is too soft, it will run off the cake, but if it is too stiff, it will be difficult to spread.<br> When the cakes are cool, carefully slice each cake in half horizontally. If baking a single cake, slice the cake horizontally into two or three even layers. Spread the orange filling between the cake layers, and sandwich the pieces together. Using a palette knife, spread the glace icing over the top and sides, and decorate with the crystallized flowers, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7603,&quot;Pan Seared Shrimp and Scallop Skewers 8 (6 to 8-inch) bamboo skewers 16 jumbo deveined, peeled shrimp 16 sea scallops Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon sweet paprika, 1/3 palmful 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, eyeball it 1 lemon zested and juiced 2 tablespoons chopped flat leaf parsley, a handful 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan Instructions: Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium high to high heat.

Add water until a loose puree is achieved. Whisk in oil. For extra spicy, use less oil. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7606,&quot;Charred Corn Guacamole with Corn Chips 4 ears Perfectly Grilled Corn, recipe follows 4 tablespoons canola oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced 1 serrano cl, finely diced 1 small red onion finely diced 1 lime, juiced 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves Blue, yellow and white corn chips, as accompaniment 4 ears corn Kosher salt Instructions: Heat the grill to high. Remove the husks from the grilled corn and discard. Brush the ears of corn with 2 tablespoons of the canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the ears until the kernels are lightly golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the kernels from the ears. Place the avocado in a medium bowl and mash slightly with a fork. Add the corn, serrano, onion, lime juice, remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, cilantro and salt and pepper and gently stir to combine. Serve with fried corn chips or warm flour tortillas. Heat the grill to medium. Pull the outer husks down the ear to the base. Strip away the silk from each ear of corn by hand. Fold husks back into place and tie the ends together with kitchen string. Place the ears of corn in a large bowl of cold water with 1 tablespoon of salt for 10 minutes. Remove corn from water and shake off excess. Place the corn on the grill, close the cover and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, or until kernels are tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove the husks and eat on the cob or remove the kernels. How to remove corn kernels from cob: To remove kernels from cobs of either raw or cooked corn, stand cob upright on its stem end in a large pan, holding tip with fingers. Cut down the sides of cob with sharp paring knife, releasing kernels without cutting into cob. Run dull edge of knife down the cob to release any remaining corn and liquid. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 7607,&quot;Quick Tip: Cauliflower 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 large head cauliflower 1 cup chicken stock Instructions: In a covered Dutch oven, heat the extra-virgin olive oil over medium to medium-high heat.

Add the egg and vanilla extract. Mix again on low speed, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl intermittently. Add the flour and salt. Mix on low speed until a dough is formed and there are no longer streaks of butter in the mixing bowl. The dough will be thick and should not be sticky.<br> Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> Divide the dough in half, place one half on a lightly floured work surface and roll to a thickness of slightly greater than 1/4 inch. Cut out a total of 15 cookies using a 4-inch rectangular cutter. Put 7 on one baking sheet and 8 on the other. Cut out the centers from 5 of the cookies using a 2-inch rectangular cookie cutter. Chill the cut-outs for 20 minutes. Wrap the remaining dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown around the edges. Remove the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Let the baking sheets cool, then re-line them with parchment. Repeat the rolling, cutting, chilling and baking with the remaining dough half, for a total of 30 cookies, 10 with cut-out centers.<br> For the royal icing: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder on low speed until combined. Add the water and beat on medium-high speed until very stiff peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the lemon extract and beat on low speed until combined. Place 1/4 cup of icing into each of three bowls. Cover the remaining icing in the mixer bowl with a damp paper towel to prevent drying. Tint one bowl of icing with red, one with pink and one with black (leave the icing in the mixer bowl white). Add drops of water to all 4 bowls to thin the icing to flood consistency. (Check the consistency by dragging a spoon through the center of each icing; when the icing is perfect flood consistency, the indentation should completely disappear in 10 seconds. Thin with more water, or thicken with additional confections&#39; sugar as needed.) Transfer each color of icing to a separate piping bag or decorator squeeze bottle.<br> Cut a sheet of parchment paper into 10 small strips, each about 4 inches by 2 inches. Write sentiments of love on one side of each strip, such as \Love you more than cookies!\ and \You&#39;re Sweet!\ <br> Place 10 whole rectangular cookies on a work surface covered with parchment paper. Pipe white royal icing around the outer top edge of each cookie. Place a cookie with a hollow center on top of each iced cookie. Fill each with 1 tablespoon confetti heart sprinkles. Pipe white royal icing around the outer top edges of the hollow cookies. Fold the love notes so the ink side is on the inside of the fold and will not touch the cookies. Insert a folded love note into each hollow cookie and top with a whole cookie.<br> Pipe a line of white royal icing around the outer top edges of the cookies and flood the inside so that icing completely covers the top of the cookies. If there are gaps in the icing, use a toothpick to push the icing into the gaps so they are filled. Let the iced cookies stand until completely smooth and dry, about 3 hours.<br> When the icing is dry, use the white royal icing to pipe a triangular envelope flap on half (five) of the cookies. Use a toothpick to scrape away the point of each triangle to make room for the seal decoration. Use the red royal icing to pipe a small seal in the middle of each envelope. Pipe white royal icing lines down from both sides of the envelope flaps to the bottom corners of the cookies to create envelope folds. Use the pink royal icing to pipe several small hearts on the envelopes. Use the food color marker to draw a perforated line across the center of the cookies with \open here\ instructions.<br> On the remaining cookies, pipe three equal-sized horizontal lines using black royal icing on the front centers of the cookies for address lines. Use the red royal icing to make a heart in the upper right-hand corner of the cookies for a postage stamp. Use the black food color marker to draw wavy lines to the left of the stamps. Further embellish the cookies with X&#39;s and O&#39;s in the top left corner, and add the name of the recipients to the top address line. Draw half-circle postage marks on the sides of the cookies using the food color marker or leftover black royal icing.<br> Let the cookies stand until set, about 3 hours. Package the cookies in cellophane bags tied with baker&#39;s twine. If necessary, include opening instructions so the recipient will be aware of the messages inside the cookies.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7610,&quot;Cibar Lounge S&#39;Mores Martini 1 marshmallow 1 small piece of chocolate from a chocolate bar 1/4 cup crushed graham crackers 1 orange segment 1 teaspoon chocolate sauce 3 ounces chocolate-infused vodka 2 ounces chocolate liqueur Ice Instructions: Using a toothpick, skewer the marshmallow and chocolate piece together.

Add the butter and the egg. Mix until the dough comes together in a nice ball. Form the dough into 24 balls. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the balls on cookie sheets that have either been lined with parchment paper or slightly (very slightly) greased with butter. Gently press the balls with your thumb, ever so slightly, squishing the ball. If you are not using parchment paper, lift the balls from the sheet and then put them back, this will avoid sticking later on. Bake for 8 to10 minutes, checking the cookies periodically. You can rotate the cookie sheets after 4 minutes to ensure that the cookies are baking evenly. Remove the pans from the oven and put the cookies on a cooling rack or a clean surface. Allow them to cool at least 15 minutes. Filling: Put the butter, shortening, and vanilla into a bowl, and mix with an electric mixer on low speed. Gradually add the powdered sugar and mix until the filling is light and fluffy. When the cookies are cool, smear a small amount of the filling on 1 side of half of the cookies. Top with the remaining cookies, creating that famous whoopee-pie look. Refrigerate the cookies for about 20 minutes before serving. To add a touch of elegance to this dessert, try infusing milk with lavender. Add a little milk, 1 tablespoon of honey, and a little crushed lavender to a blender. Blend on high for about 3 minutes. Refrigerate for about 20 minutes, then stir with a spoon and serve! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7615,&quot;Shower Dome Cakes -Tablescape Centerpiece Nonstick cooking spray and all-purpose flour for pans 3 (18.25-ounce) boxes white cake mix 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened 9 egg whites 3 3/4 cups buttermilk 2 (16-ounce) cans white frosting 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons meringue powder 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/4 to1/3 cup warm water Cornstarch, for rolling fondant<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray each stainless bowl with nonstick cooking spray and coat lightly with flour, tapping out the excess. Put the bowls on 2 sheet trays.<br> In an extra large bowl add the cake mixes with the butter and combine with a hand mixer. Add the egg whites, 1 at a time, and incorporate. Slowly add buttermilk and mix on medium until well incorporated, about 2 minutes. Fill each stainless bowl 2/3 of the way to the top with the batter. Bake until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 to 50 minutes. (Large cake will take closer to 50 minutes, smaller cakes closer to 30 minutes.) Remove the cakes from oven and cool. When cool enough to handle, unmold and cool upside down on a wire rack. You will have 1 (9-inch), 2 (7-inch), and 2 (5-inch) cake domes. Keep any extra batter in refrigerator. Cool down pans in between baking times. If there is still excess batter, bake off cupcakes for shower favors.<br> To decorate:<br> For the gum paste leaves, knead and roll out the gum paste to 1/16-inch thickness. Using the leaf cutter, cut vine leaves from gum paste. Using the back end of a butter knife make leaf veins by pressing lightly into the gum paste. Repeat until you have about 80 leaves. Set out on a sheet tray lined with a wrinkled piece of plastic wrap to dry completely. (This step is best done a couple of days ahead of time.) To make loops for around the base of the cake, roll gum paste into a very thin rope. Cut into 3-inch pieces, pinch ends together to form a loop using a dab of water, if necessary, to stick ends together. Dry flat on a sheet tray. (You will need 24 (3-inch) loops for the large cake, 40 (2-inch) loops for medium cakes, and 32 (1-inch) loops for the small cakes.)<br> Adhere each cake to a corresponding cake board with a dab of icing. Ice each cake in a very thin smooth layer with an offset spatula. Put in refrigerator to set up. Working with 1 cake at a time, put a second slightly thicker layer of icing on cake, being sure to clean the knife frequently to keep the icing smooth. (If icing is too loose try mixing in 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar to stiffen it a bit.) Knead the fondant to soften slightly. Using a flat surface dusted lightly with cornstarch, roll the fondant to a large (1/4-inch thick circle about 18 inches in diameter for the large cake). Lift with backsides of your hands and put over the center of iced dome cake. Using your hands lightly dusted with cornstarch, smooth fondant down and around the sides of the cake. Lift cake up and trim the excess fondant close to the cake board with kitchen shears or a paring knife. Put on a cake pedestal. Repeat until all of the cakes are covered.<br> To make royal icing for the vines: In a medium bowl beat together the 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, the meringue powder and the lemon juice with a hand mixer and slowly add in a little water until smooth. Continue to add water by the teaspoonful with beaters running until the icing will drop from the beaters but hold a line when drawn in with the back of a spoon. Fill a pastry bag fitted with small round tip. Pipe vines for leaves all around the cakes, using long strokes holding tip just off surface of the cake. Adhere dried gum paste leaves in groups along the vines with a small dab of royal icing. Lastly adhere the loops along the base of the cake with a small dab of royal icing as well. Put on the table in descending-size order. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7616,&quot;Bill&#39;s Healthy Won Tons with Creamy Chive Prosciutto Sauce 16 (2 by 2-inch) won ton wrappers 1 onion, julienned 2 cloves garlic 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 ounce morels 1 ounce shiitake mushrooms, sliced 2 ounces button mushrooms, sliced 1/2 russet potato, washed and cubed 1/4 pound asparagus, thinly sliced 1 cup chopped kale 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil leaves 1 lime, juiced Sea salt and pepper 6 egg whites Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Use the back of a wooden spoon to slightly break up the raspberries. Cook, stirring regularly, until the raspberries have completely broken up and are saucy, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain mixture over a bowl slightly pressing the pulp to release as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp and seeds. Cool liquid completely. Add the sweetened condensed milk, lemon zest and lemon juice to a large bowl and stir to combine. In a separate large bowl add the heavy cream and whip with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. In batches, delicately fold the whipped cream into the sweetened condensed milk mixture, making sure it&#39;s fully incorporated before adding another batch. Pour half of the whipped cream mixture into a 9-by-5 loaf pan and spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of the raspberry sauce over the top. Using a wooden skewer or a chop stick, swirl and slightly stir the raspberry sauce into the whipped cream mixture. Top with the remaining whipped cream mixture and spoon another tablespoon of raspberry sauce on top. Once again, swirl the sauce into the whipped cream mixture. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and place in the freezer. Freeze until solid, 6 to 8 hours, preferably overnight.

Place whole coriander, allspice, anise, cumin, fenugreek, mustard and peppercorns on a sheet tray evenly spread out. Bake 3 to 5 minutes. Place the ingredients in a spice grinder or blender and grind to a fine consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in a bowl with the turmeric and store in an airtight container for later. For the oxtails: Combine the flour and smoked paprika in a large bowl and set aside for later. Remove 2 ounces of the dredge and set aside for thickening the sauce. Combine the salt, pepper and 1/2 ounce curry rub in a bowl and mix well. Place the oxtails in a large bowl. Sprinkle the oxtails with all of the seasoning. (The oxtails should be coated heavily.) Dredge each oxtail in the flour dredge, then shake any excess flour off. Place on a sheet tray and let sit 2 to 4 hours. For the Caribbean bouquet garni: Unfold a 12-by-16-inch piece cheesecloth completely so that its length is perpendicular to your waist. Place the thyme, bay leaves and chiles at the bottom of the cloth and roll up, folding the outside of the cloth in to close the ends. Wrap up until it is tight, then and tie off with the butcher&#39;s twine, leaving the string long so it can be tied to the pot. For the braised oxtails: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the garlic, carrots, celery and onion in a container. In a large rondeau, heat up the oil to its smoke point, 2 to 3 minutes. Sear the oxtails until bronzed on each side, then remove from the oil. Reduce heat if pan is smoking too hard, then add the diced vegetables and saute until they are translucent. Add the salt, allspice, paprika, pepper and 1/4 cup curry rub and continue to saute to toast the spices, 3 to 5 minutes. Add reserved flour dredge and mix well to incorporate, stirring for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. (This will help thicken the sauce as it braises.) Deglaze the pan with the sherry and bring up to a simmer. Add the chicken stock, tomato paste and oxtails and bring up to a boil. Tie the bouquet garni to the side of the pan and cover tightly with parchment and foil. Bake 1 1/2 hours, then add beans, recover, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally to prevent the beans from sticking, until oxtails are fork-tender, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours more. For the Caribbean braised oxtail: Place 12 ounces hot oxtails in a saucepan with 2 cups sauce on medium heat. When the pan starts to boil, add the butter and cilantro. Baste each piece of oxtail 5 to 6 times with a spoon and turn off the heat. Mount all the rice to one side of a deep bowl and place the oxtails on top for height. Place the sauce on the other side of the bowl. Place Mango Chow on top and garnish with the cilantro sprigs, followed by 4 rings shaved chiles. Combine garlic, mangos, lime juice, chiles, cilantro, salt and pepper in a bowl.

For the chicken: Place about 2 tablespoons of the cactus stuffing on one side of each chicken breast. If you have remaining stuffing, reserve it for garnish. Top with the cheese. Using a brush, coat the edges of the chicken breasts with the egg and fold over the chicken to close. Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat and add the canola oil. Season the chicken breasts with the salt and pepper. Carefully place each stuffed breast in the hot pan. Cook each side until seared and a nice crust forms, about 3 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a sheet pan and bake until the internal temperature is 165 degrees F, about 25 minutes.<br> For the sauce: Reduce the heat to low under the saute pan that was used for the chicken. Add the cumin, coriander and paprika and cook, stirring, until toasted, for a minute or two, taking care not to burn the spices\u2014add a little oil to the pan if it looks dry. Add the lime zest and juice and cook, stirring, until the juice has reduced. Very carefully add the tequila; it may ignite, but not for too long. Stir in the chicken stock, salt and pepper; lower the heat and cook until reduced, about 10 minutes.<br> Place the chicken in a serving dish, cover with the sauce and garnish with any reserved cactus stuffing and chopped fresh parsley.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 7640,&quot;Smoky Cola Jerky 1 cup cola 1/3 cup soy sauce 1/3 cup rice vinegar (not seasoned) 1/4 cup honey Kosher salt 1 to 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon onion powder 2 pounds boneless beef sirloin (about 1 inch thick) Instructions: Bring the cola, soy sauce, vinegar, honey and 1 tablespoon salt to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until reduced to 1 cup, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the chipotles, paprika and onion powder; let cool completely. Trim the excess fat from the beef and slice on an angle into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Combine the strips and cola mixture in a resealable plastic bag and shake to coat. Press the air out of the bag, seal and let marinate in the refrigerator at least 24 hours and up to 3 days. Position a rack in the center of the oven; line the bottom of the oven with foil. Drain the meat, discarding the marinade. Stick a toothpick through the end of each strip of meat. Starting at the back of the oven and working forward, arrange each piece of meat between the grates of the oven rack so the toothpicks rest on the grates and the meat dangles below (do not let the meat touch the rack). Alternately, cook the beef in a dehydrator according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Heat the oven to 200 degrees F. Bake until the jerky is dry but still bendable, 2 to 3 hours. Carefully remove from the oven and remove the toothpicks. Let cool completely. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 7641,&quot;Shrimp and Melon Gazpacho 1 pint vegetable broth 1 1/2 pounds 21 to 30 size deveined shrimp with shells on (you can use smaller shrimp if you like, but these are easy to clean and still economical) 2 cucumbers, peeled, seeds removed, and diced large 2 ripe tomatoes, seeds scooped out (leave pulp intact) and diced large 1 teaspoon minced fresh jalapeno, stem and seeds removed and diced (protect your hands and eyes and avoid breathing in the fumes of any hot peppers) 1 small red onion, diced 2 tomatillos, diced 1/2 cantaloupe, seeds removed, scooped from rind and diced 1/2 honeydew melon, seeds removed, scooped from rind and diced 1 fresh lemon, halved and seeds removed 2 tablespoons chopped chives Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a saucepan. You will be using it as a court bouillon - a poaching liquid for the shrimp. The court bouillon is not actually part of the soup. Poach the shrimp in their shells until just pink and remove to a platter to cool. (Shrimp cooked in its shell retains more flavor). While the shrimp are cooling, combine the cucumbers, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, tomatillos, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon in a food processor and pulse to coarsely chop. Remove to a bowl and squeeze in the juice of the fresh lemon, being careful not to drop any remaining lemon seeds into the mix. Add the chopped chives, and stir to combine. Peel the shrimp and finely dice. Stir the shrimp into the fruit/vegetable mixture and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Chill well.

Salt the boiling water and cook pasta to just-shy of al dente. Cook the broccolini for 3 minutes, then shock in a bowl of cold water and drain well. Return the pan that you cooked the broccolini in, to the stove top over medium heat and add 3 tablespoons butter. When the butter has melted, whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the milk and whisk to combine. Cook the sauce for 5 minutes, to thicken, then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, to taste. Reduce the heat to low. When pasta is almost ready, and the provolone and Asiago cheeses to the sauce. Heat the broiler or the oven to high. In a large bowl, combine the pasta with the spinach, broccolini and sauce.

Scoop the ice cream into 8 tight round balls using a 1-ounce cookie scoop (about 2 packed tablespoons each). Freeze on the prepared pan or in the egg carton cups until solid, at least 4 hours or overnight. Place a large piece of parchment paper on a work surface. Using a fine-mesh sieve, dust the parchment generously with cornstarch. (Use more cornstarch than you think you need \u2014 the dough will be very sticky.) In a large bowl, whisk the rice flour, sugar, water and food coloring until smooth. Pour the mixture into a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring and folding with a rubber spatula, until a stiff tacky dough forms, 5 to 7 minutes. (It\u2019s OK if it looks lumpy at first; it will smooth out.) The dough should be very thick and feel slightly tough and rubbery.<br> Transfer the dough to the parchment and dust the top generously with cornstarch. Place another piece of parchment over the dough and carefully press into a thin disk. Let the dough cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Roll out the dough into a large round or oval, about 1/4 inch thick. Using a 4- to 4 1/2-inch fluted or plain round cookie cutter, cut out as many rounds as possible. Gather the scraps to cut out more rounds, dusting with more cornstarch as needed (you should have at least 8 rounds). Dust a plate with cornstarch; make sure the dough rounds are dusted with cornstarch, then stack them on the plate and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Assemble the mochi: Use plastic gloves if you have them. Line a small baking sheet or a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with parchment paper, dust generously with cornstarch and place in the freezer. Fill a small dish with cool water. Working with one dough round at a time, gently brush off any excess cornstarch and place the round flat in your hand. Working quickly, place a scoop of ice cream into the center of the dough. Gently pull up the edges of the dough to enclose the ice cream, using a small dab of water if the seams aren\u2019t sticking. Gently stretch, twist and pinch the dough together at the seams to secure. Immediately place the mochi seam-side down in the cold pan in the freezer. Repeat with the remaining dough rounds and ice cream balls. Cover the mochi with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 1 to 2 hours. Let soften for a few minutes before eating. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 7664,&quot;Mustard Seed Tuille with Raspberry Sorbet 8 ounces softened butter, plus more for greasing baking sheet 10 ounces sugar 4 egg whites 8 ounces cake flour 2 tablespoons brown mustard seeds 16 ounces fresh or frozen raspberries 8 ounces sugar 1/2 cup water 1 lemon, juiced 1 egg white, optional Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a medium size bowl, combine the butter and sugar, and beat until fluffy. Add the egg whites one at a time, beating thoroughly before adding the next. Fold in flour and mustard seeds.

Remove from the baking sheet with a pallet knife, and shape over a bottle turned on its side. Let tuilles harden over bottle, remove, and set aside. To make the raspberry sorbet, puree raspberries and strain through a sieve. Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan and stir over gentle heat until sugar has dissolved. Turn heat up, and boil for 5 minutes until liquid forms a sticky syrup. Once the syrup has cooled, add the puree and the juice of 1 lemon. Freeze in an ice cream maker for 20 minutes. Alternatively, place mixture in a bowl and put in freezer. When edges begin to freeze, whisk an egg white, and fold into the partially frozen mixture. Return to freezer until frozen. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7665,&quot;Pumpkin Spice Sheet Pan Pancakes 4 large eggs, beaten 5 cups buttermilk 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 10 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/4 sticks), melted<br> 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 tablespoon baking soda 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice<br> 1 small apple, cored and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons caramel sauce 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1 large carrot, peeled and grated (about 1 cup) 2 tablespoons raisins 1 cup frozen cranberries, thawed 1 teaspoon orange zest plus 1 tablespoon orange juice 2 tablespoons cream cheese, at room temperature 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Whipped cream and maple syrup, for serving Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F.

Add the apples and cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the caramel, stir until well coated and set aside.<br> Add the brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of the pumpkin pie spice to the reserved batter and stir to combine. Set aside.<br> In separate small bowl, mix together the carrots, raisins, 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar and 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. Set aside.<br> In another small bowl, stir together the cranberries, orange zest and juice and remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar. Set aside.<br> Arrange the baking sheet with a long side facing you. Visualize the pan divided into 4 equal quadrants. Each quadrant will hold a different pancake topping. Arrange the apples over the surface of the upper left quadrant. Next to it on the right, dollop the brown sugar-pumpkin pie mixture, about 1 teaspoon at a time. (You want to see a lot of brown dots sitting on top of the batter.) Using a toothpick or small skewer, swirl the mixture into the batter, making a marbled pattern.<br> Sprinkle the carrot mixture over the lower left quadrant under the apples. Use a butter knife or offset spatula to gently mix the carrots into the batter. Sprinkle the cranberry mixture in the lower right quadrant, discarding any extra liquid. Put the sheet pan in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 400 degrees F. Bake, rotating halfway through, until golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center of the pancake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.<br> Spread the cream cheese over the carrot section using a butter knife or offset spatula. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the confectioners&#39; sugar, followed by the remaining 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. Stir together the remaining 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and drizzle over the swirled pumpkin spice section.<br> Serve the pancakes with maple syrup and whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7666,&quot;Warm Salad with Grilled Fruits, Roasted Endive, Crushed Nuts, and Maytag Bleu Cheese 4 nectarines 4 pears 4 plums 8 heads Belgian endive 4 heads frisee 4 heads radicchio 6 ounces walnuts 6 ounces hazelnuts Butter 12 ounces Maytag bleu cheese Salt Pepper 3 ounces sherry vinaigrette 3 ounces olive oil 6 ounces walnut oil 3 to 4 shallots, minced Salt Pepper Instructions: In advance, split fruits in half, season and grill (if ripeness is an issue, finish by roasting).

Melt 1 stick of the butter in a small saucepan, then bring to a boil and cook until there are light brown specks in the butter, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the browned butter into a small bowl and whisk in the sugar until dissolved. Whisk in the milk; the mixture should be lukewarm, around 110 degrees F. Next, whisk in the active dry yeast. Set aside until foamy, 5 minutes. In a large bowl, mix together the flour and salt. Make a well in the center, add the eggs and whisk the eggs together with a fork. Pour the browned butter mixture into the well. Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour into the liquids. Continue stirring just until a shaggy dough comes together. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead with floured hands until the dough becomes very smooth, about 5 minutes. Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil. Add the dough, turning it once to coat. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down the dough. Melt the remaining 1/2 stick of butter and use half of that to grease the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Divide the dough into thirds and divide each third into 10 balls. To create smooth tops: roll each ball between your palms, and then stretch the dough across the top of the ball, pinching the excess at the bottom. Place the dough balls, seam-side down, in the prepared baking dish -- 5 to the short side, 6 to long side. Cover and let rise until slightly puffy, 30 minutes. Brush the tops with the remaining butter and sprinkle generously with flaky sea salt. Bake until the tops are golden brown and the rolls sound hollow when lightly tapped, 15 to 17 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7692,&quot;Sweet Potato and Mushroom Carbonara 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes 6 slices bacon<br> One 8-ounce package cremini mushrooms, cleaned, stemmed and sliced (about 2 1/2 cups sliced)<br> 2 cups baby kale<br> 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish<br> 4 large eggs<br> Chopped chives or fresh parsley leaves, for serving Instructions: Peel the sweet potatoes and pass through a spiralizer.

Grease and flour a 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. In a separate mixing bowl, beat the eggs and mix in the sour cream, and vanilla. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter and stir in the cocoa powder, and hot water. Bring the mixture to a boil and then remove from the heat. Cool slightly, and incorporate the cocoa mixture with the dry ingredients, mixing just until blended. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool completely. For the frosting: In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the peanut butter and mix until smooth. Remove from the heat. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the milk, and powdered sugar until fully incorporated. Stir in the vanilla, and slowly incorporate the peanut butter mixture, blending well after each addition. Frost the cake while both the frosting and cake are still warm. Top with nuts, if desired. Cook&#39;s Note: Making a sheet cake is the best bang for your buck when it comes to dessert for a group. To vamp it up, take small biscuit cutters and create tiered cakes that can be dusted with powdered sugar. Cake scraps can be saved for a delicious trifle the next day. Sheet Cake Variations: Chocolate Fudge Frosting: instead of peanut butter frosting, replace peanut butter in frosting recipe with 1/3 cocoa powder. Prepare the frosting the same way. Toasted Coconut: In addition to topping with nuts, top cake with toasted coconut. Caramel/Fudge Cake: Drizzle warm caramel sauce and/or fudge sauce over frosting just before serving.

Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until incorporated. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture in 2 batches until just incorporated. Divide the dough between 2 pieces of plastic wrap; shape into disks. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. (The dough can be frozen for up to 1 month; thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out the dough on a floured surface, dusting with flour as needed, until about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out shapes with 2- to 4-inch dog-shaped cookie cutters and arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. (If the dough becomes too soft as you work, return it to the refrigerator until firm.) Gather the scraps and refrigerate until firm; reroll once to cut out more cookies. Chill the cutouts 30 minutes.<br> Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the cookies, switching the pans halfway through, until slightly puffed and just golden, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely before icing.<br> To decorate the cookies, divide the Basic Royal Icing into bowls and tint as desired with food coloring. The thicker icing will be used to outline your decorations. To make the flood icing for filling, remove three-quarters of the desired color icing to a small bowl and stir in a few drops of water until flooding consistency is achieved -- you can run a knife through it and it flows back to where it was in 10 seconds. Transfer the flood icing to a piping bag fitted with a number 2 round tip. Transfer the remaining thick icing to a piping bag fitted with a number 1 round tip. Use additional piping bags and tips for different colors of icing. Draw outlines of your decorations with the thicker royal icing, then pipe a generous amount of the same-colored flood icing inside the border of each design. Using a toothpick, spread the icing to cover the cookie. If making a design, decorate with more colored icing while the flood icing is still wet, using a toothpick to swirl to colors together as desired. Decorate with sugar pearls if using. Let the cookies set at room temperature, at least 1 hour. Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons water and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft glossy peaks form, adding up to 1 more tablespoon water if necessary, about 5 minutes. Cover the bowl with a damp paper towel and plastic wrap until ready to use to prevent the icing from drying out. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7725,&quot;Mini Meatball Soup 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream 2 carrots, peeled and chopped 2 ribs celery, chopped 1 medium onion, chopped 2 bay leaves, fresh or dried Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound ground beef, pork and veal combined 1 egg, beaten 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano, a couple of handfuls 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs, a couple of handfuls 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated or ground nutmeg 6 cups chicken stock or broth 2 cups water 1 1/2 cups dried pasta, rings, broken fettuccini or ditalini 1 pound triple washed fresh spinach, coarsely chopped Grilled 4 Cheese Sandwiches, recipe follows* Recipe courtesy Rachael Ray 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 3 tablespoons butter 1 clove garlic, cracked away from skin 8 slices crusty Italian semolina bread 1 cup shredded provolone 1 cup shredded mozzarella 1/2 cup grated Parmesan or Romano 1 cup shredded Asiago Instructions: In a deep pot over medium heat add oil, chopped carrots, celery and onions and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Cover pot and cook veggies 5 or 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the veggies cook, combine meat, egg, garlic, grated cheese, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg. Uncover your soup pot and add broth and water to the pot. Increase heat to high and bring soup to a boil. When soup boils, reduce heat a bit and start to roll meat mixture into small balls, dropping them straight into the pot. You are making meat dumplings that will cook in the broth. When you are done rolling the meat, add pasta to the soup and stir. Cover and simmer soup 10 minutes. When pasta is tender, stir in chopped spinach in batches. When spinach has wilted into the soup, the soup is done and ready to serve. Adjust your seasonings. Serve soup with crusty bread or grilled 4 cheese sandwiches. In a small skillet over medium low heat, combine oil, butter and garlic. Cook garlic in butter and oil gently for 2 or 3 minutes. Remove garlic butter mixture from heat. Place a large nonstick skillet on the stove over medium high heat. Using a pastry brush, brush 1 side of 4 slices of bread with garlic oil and place buttered side down in skillet. Top each slice with equal amounts of the 4 cheeses, distributing them equally over the 4 slices. Top each sandwich with another slice of bread brushed with garlic butter, buttered side up. Flip the grill cheese sandwiches a few times until cheeses are melted and gooey and bread is toasty and golden. Cut grilled 4 cheese sandwiches from corner to corner and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 7726,&quot;Beachcomber Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon table salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 sticks unsalted butter (1/2 pound), room temperature 1 3/4 cups packed light brown sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 cups old-fashioned oats 1 cup milk chocolate chips 3/4 cup toasted flaked unsweetened coconut 3/4 cup finely chopped toasted pecans Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle. Place flour, baking powder salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl and whisk to combine; set aside. Combine butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat over medium speed until mixture resembles wet sand and is airy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next. Add vanilla extract. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture in 2 parts, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients and mix until evenly combined. Using a 2-inch ice cream scoop, drop dough onto baking sheets, spaced about 1-inch apart. Bake until cookies are puffed, set, and tops and undersides are golden brown, rotating sheets halfway through, about 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool on sheets 2 minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7727,&quot;Cauliflower Parmesan 1 medium head cauliflower 1 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt 3 large eggs, beaten 2 cups panko breadcrumbs About 1 cup olive oil 2 1/2 cups marinara sauce, from a 24-ounce jar 1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup torn fresh basil leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a plate with paper towels. Pull off the leaves from the base of the cauliflower and cut off the stem, but do not cut out the core. Slice the cauliflower into 1-inch thick slices, aiming for about 3 nice \steaks\ from the center. The rest will break into smaller florets, and that is okay. Mix the flour with 1 teaspoon salt in a shallow bowl or pie plate. Put the eggs in another shallow bowl and panko in a third shallow bowl.<br> Add 1/4 inch olive oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working with the larger pieces first, add the cauliflower to the flour and turn to coat. Shake off the excess, then dip in the egg to coat. Let the excess egg drip off, then coat thoroughly in the panko. Fry the cauliflower in batches to avoid overcrowding, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to the lined plate to drain and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining smaller pieces of cauliflower (leave out any tiny crumbly pieces).<br> Spread 1 cup marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Arrange the fried cauliflower on top, then spoon 1 cup of the sauce on top of the cauliflower. Arrange the mozzarella over the sauce, then spoon the remaining 1/2 cup marinara over the top. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and bake until bubbling and lightly browned in spots, about 35 minutes. Sprinkle with the basil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 7728,&quot;Rhubarb Streusel Pot Pie 4 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons sugar 12 ounces (3 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/2 cup ice water (strain out the ice just before using) 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 6 cups rhubarb, washed, leaves and brown edges trimmed off, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 14 stalks) 1/4 cup cornstarch Instructions: Pie Crust: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter. Turn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape into round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) On a floured surface, roll out 1 disk of dough into a square large enough to cut 4 circles about 6 inches in diameter (the dough will be about 3/16-inch thick). Using an individual (4-inch) pie pan as a guide, and leaving an extra inch of dough all the way around, cut the dough into circles with the tip of a sharp knife. Line the individual pie pans with the dough circles, then crimp the edges decoratively. Repeat with the remaining dough to make a total of 8 individual pie shells. Arrange the lined pie pans on a sheet pan and refrigerate, uncovered, 30 to 60 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar, and the cinnamon. Add the butter and, using your fingertips, pinch the ingredients together into a sandy, crumbly mixture. Do not overmix; as soon as the mixture is sandy, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use. In a large bowl, toss the rhubarb, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and cornstarch together. Divide among the pie shells, mounding the filling high (it will cook down during baking). Sprinkle the topping over the pies, gently pressing the topping onto the rhubarb with your hand. Bake until the rhubarb is tender and the topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7729,&quot;Petits Pois a la Francaise 2 tablespoons butter 16 pearl onions, peeled and halved 4 slices bacon, cut into lardons 1 pound/2 kg/2 cups shelled fresh peas 1/2 cup/125 ml chicken stock Salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 1 bib lettuce, cored and sliced Instructions: Melt the butter in a saute pan. Add the onions and cook 2 minutes, then add the bacon and continue cooking until done. Add the peas and stock. Season. Cover and cook until the peas are almost tender. Add the lettuce and stir through. Cover 1 minute to wilt. Check the seasonings, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7730,&quot;Buttery Herbed Dinner Rolls 1 cup milk, warmed to about 110 degrees F 1 tablespoon active dry yeast 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus more for the bowl and pan 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus more for the bowl and pan<br> 1 tablespoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt 1 large egg, lightly beaten 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling Instructions: Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the milk and yeast and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. With a fork, stir in the butter, sugar, salt and egg. With the mixer on low, add the flour and then the herbs. Increase the speed to medium and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.<br> Lightly butter a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, then cover and set in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 4 hours, depending on the temperature of your house.<br> Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Transfer the dough to a work surface and cut into 18 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a tight ball. Transfer the dough balls to the prepared pan, spacing them evenly (rolls will touch once they have risen). Cover and set in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.<br> Finish the rolls: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Very gently brush the rolls with some melted butter and sprinkle with some flaky sea salt. Bake until golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Brush with more melted butter and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7731,&quot;Nebraskan Runzas For the dough: 1 1/4-ounce packetactive dry yeast 3 tablespoons sugar, plus a pinch 4 large eggs 3 3/4 cups bread flour,plus more for the counter 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) salted butter, softened, plus more for the bowl 2 teaspoons fine sea salt For the filling: 1 pound 85 to 90 percent lean ground beef Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons salted butter 1 large Vidalia onion, diced 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme (or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried) 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary (or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried) 1 tablespoon canola oil, plus more for the baking sheets 8 ounces baby spinach Instructions: Make the dough: Combine 3/4 cup warm water (approximately 110 degrees F),the yeast and a pinch of sugar in a large mixing bowl and let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add 3 eggs and whisk to combine. Add half of the bread flour and beat with a wooden spoon until good and thready, about 3 minutes. Add the butter, the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, the remaining flour and the salt and mix well. The dough will be a little sticky. Let rest 15 minutes. Knead the dough to develop the gluten until it feels tight and smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly buttered bowl, cover and let it rise for 1 hour at room temperature. Then chill in the refrigerator,1 to 2 hours or overnight. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide it into 8 even portions. Roll each one into a ball and leave on the counter, covered loosely, to warm up, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef, season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook, breaking up the beef, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a bowl. Drain and discard all but a film of the fat from the skillet. Add the butter; when it has melted, add the onion. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and rosemary and cook 3 minutes. Add the mixture to the bowl containing the beef. Without cleaning the skillet, add 1 tablespoon canola oil. Saute the spinach over high heat until wilted and the excess liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute. Chop the spinach, then add it to the beef mixture and set aside to cool. Roll out the dough: Flatten a dough ball on a heavily floured surface and roll out into a 3-by-5-inch rectangle. Then make wrapping flaps from the four corners of the rectangle by rolling out each corner thinly so you have a thick rectangle with four thinner triangular wings at the corners. Fill the runzas: Spoon 1/2 cup of the beef filling into the center of the dough rectangle and wrap the flaps over it, pinching to close. Flip the bundle over in your hands, gently forming the runza into a fat football shape. Set the runza seam-side down on an oiled baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining filling and dough balls, arranging them on 2 oiled baking sheets. Let the runzas rise about an inch, uncovered, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Whisk the remaining egg and 2 tablespoons water to make an egg wash and brush it thinly over the tops of the runzas. Bake until golden brown, 25 minutes. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7732,&quot;White Chocolate Chunk-Macadamia Nut Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1 cup light brown sugar 1 egg 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 8 ounces (1 1/2 cups) white chocolate baking squares), cut into small chunks, or white baking chips 3/4 cup roughly chopped, unsalted, toasted macadamia nuts Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Using a mixer, beat the butter in a large mixing bowl until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the brown sugar and mix together until smooth. Add the egg and vanilla. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Blend in the flour mixture in 3 stages and stir in the white chocolate and the nuts. Scoop out walnut-sized mounds of the cookie dough and place on the cookie sheet, leaving 2-inches between the mounds. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the cookies are golden. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and transfer the cookies from the parchment to cooling racks. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. Freeze for longer storage. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7733,&quot;Cornflake Macaroons 4 egg whites Pinch salt Pinch cream of tartar 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup pecan pieces, toasted 1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted 1 cup tightly packed corn flakes Instructions: Set a rack in the middle and top third of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. In a completely clean, dry mixing bowl, with an electric mixer, whisk the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar until very foamy and almost creamy. With the mixer still running, sprinkle in the sugar. Continue to whisk on high speed until fluffy, thick, and shiny. Whisk in the vanilla. Fold in the pecans, coconut, and corn flakes.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add 1/2 cup ice water and pulse until the dough just starts to come together. Divide the dough between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and form each into a disk; wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Make the filling: Toss the peaches in a bowl with 3/4 cup sugar, the flour, lemon juice and spices. Lightly dust a large piece of parchment paper with flour. Roll out 1 piece of the dough into a 12-inch round on the parchment. Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the filling, mounding it slightly in the center; dot with the butter and refrigerate. Roll out the second piece of dough into a 12-inch round and cut it into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Lay half of the strips on the pie in one direction, leaving about 1 inch of space between each strip. Lay the remaining strips on top, crossing them diagonally to make a lattice pattern (no need to weave); trim the edges of the strips, leaving a small overhang. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edge of the crust with your fingers. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush on the crust edge and lattice top. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 425 degrees F. Put the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and continue baking until the pie is golden and the filling is bubbly, 50 minutes to 1 hour. (Cover loosely with foil if the top is browning too quickly.)

Using sharp kitchen shears or a knife, cut the backbone out of the turkey, reserving it for stock. Flip the turkey so it&#39;s breast-side up, then press down on it with your hands to flatten the bird. Whisk together the orange juice, oil, maple syrup and garlic in a large bowl. Reserve half of the marinade and set aside. Season the turkey on both sides with salt and pepper and place the turkey into the bowl with the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Remove the turkey from the refrigerator an hour before grilling, so it can come to room temperature. Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only on medium-high heat. Place the turkey skin-side up over indirect heat and cover the grill. Maintaining a temperature of 375 to 400 degrees F, smoke the turkey until it reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, about 90 minutes. Baste the turkey with the reserved marinade every 30 minutes during cooking. Remove the turkey from the grill and rest, tented with aluminum foil, for at least 20 minutes before carving. (Alternatively, you can bake the turkey on a rimmed baking sheet in a 375 to 400 degrees F oven for 90 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7795,&quot;Better than Trendy Baked Tomato and Feta Pasta Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking dish 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar<br> 2 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 pints cherry tomatoes<br> 6 to 8 mini bell peppers, halved and seeded (about 2 cups)<br> One 20-ounce package refrigerated cheese tortellini (6 cups)<br> 2 cups chicken stock<br> One 8-ounce block feta, sliced into about 8 pieces<br> 4 to 6 fresh basil leaves, torn<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Douse the pan with half of the vermouth or wine, cover the pan with a lid and cook 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the lid, add the tomatoes and gently stir into the potatoes. Set fillets on top of the potatoes and douse with the remaining vermouth or wine. Season the fish with salt and pepper, to taste. Set lid in place and cook until the fish is opaque, about 6 to 8 minutes. Top the fish with parsley, the juice of 1/2 a lemon and garnish with a liberal drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. To serve, transfer the fish and sausage mixture from the pan into shallow bowls to hold the juice. Use the crusty bread to soak in the juices at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Rioja, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 7814,&quot;Basic Coconut Macaroons 3 large egg whites 1/2 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 14-ounce package sweetened shredded coconut Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Meanwhile make the Tomato and Mint Salad. Remove the cores from six tomatoes and quarter. Sprinkle with a little salt, sugar and black pepper. Toss immediately in a little French dressing; sprinkle with 1 to 2 teaspoons of chopped mint and basil.<br> Slice a medium cucumber, sprinkle with salt, 1 to 2 dessertspoons of wine vinegar and plenty of sugar. Stir in 2 teaspoons of finely chopped fennel.<br> To assemble the Salmon Mayonnaise, put a portion of salmon on each plate when it is just cold. Garnish with a little lettuce, pipe some Potato Salad onto the lettuce and put a little Tomato and Cucumber Salad on the plate as well as one spoonful of egg mayonnaise. Garnish with tiny spring onions and watercress and a segment of lemon. Additional mayonnaise can be served separately or put into a bowl on each plate.<br> Piped Potato Salad: Add French dressing, finely chopped parsley, chives and mayonnaise to 1 litre (1 3/4 pints) stiff, freshly mashed potato to taste. Pipe onto individual leaves of lettuce.<br> Mayonnaise: Most people don&#39;t seem to be aware that mayonnaise can be made, even with a hand whisk, in under five minutes. The great secret is to have all your ingredients at room temperature and to drip the oil very slowly into the egg yolks at the beginning. Good quality ingredients are essential to a successful mayonnaise.<br> Put the egg yolks into a bowl with mustard, salt and the white wine vinegar. Put the oil into a measuring jug. Take a whisk in one hand and the oil in the other and drip the oil on to the egg yolks, drop by drop, whisking at the same time. Within a minute you will notice that the mixture is beginning to thicken. When this happens you can add the oil a little faster, but not too quickly or it will suddenly curdle. Taste and add a little more seasoning and vinegar if necessary.<br> If the mayonnaise curdles, it will suddenly become quite thin, and if left standing the oil will start to float to the top. You can easily rectify the situation by whisking another egg yolk or 1 to 2 tablespoons of boiling water into the mayonnaise, half a teaspoon at a time, until it emulsifies again. Lower the eggs gently into boiling salted water, bring the water back to the boil and hard-boil the eggs for 10 minutes in boiling water. Drain and put immediately into a bowl of cold water. (Eggs with a black ring around the yolk have been overcooked.) When cold, shell and slice in half lengthways. Sieve the yolks and mix the sieved egg yolk with mayonnaise. Add chopped chives and salt and pepper to taste. Fill into a piping bag and pipe into the whites. Garnish with a sprig of parsley or chervil and serve on a bed of lettuce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 7818,&quot;Vegetable Gumbo 2 pounds greens (collard, mustard or turnip), washed, stemmed 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/4 cup flour 2 cups finely chopped onions 1 cup finely chopped green bell pepper 1 cup finely chopped celery 1 (16-ounce) can plum tomatoes, drained, coarsely chopped 3 bay leaves 1/4 cup hot sauce 1 teaspoon file powder Cayenne pepper, to taste 1/2 teaspoon dried leaf thyme 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon basil 1/4 cup chopped parsley 3 garlic cloves, chopped 6 cups vegetable stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1 (10-ounce) package frozen okra 1 (16-ounce) can kidney beans, drained, rinsed 2 cups cooked white rice, warm Instructions: In a medium saucepan add greens and enough water to cover.

Remove any turkey parts from the cavity and reserve for another use if desired. Dry the turkey well with paper towels inside and out. Sprinkle the cavity with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Stuff with the thyme, rosemary, lemon wedges and half of the onion wedges.<br> In a small bowl, mix together the 4 tablespoons room temperature butter with the paprika to make a smooth, spreadable mixture. Using your hands, carefully separate the skin from the flesh of the turkey from the breasts toward the legs, making sure not to tear the skin. Spread about half of the butter mixture evenly between the skin and flesh on one side. Do the same on the other side using the remaining butter mixture. Any residual butter on your hands or in the bowl can be rubbed on the outside of the turkey. Sprinkle the outside of the turkey with 2 teaspoons salt, making sure to get it all over the surface.<br> Scatter the celery pieces, whole carrots and remaining onion wedges in the bottom of a roasting pan. Place the roasting rack in the pan, making sure it is level. Pour the broth into the pan. Transfer the turkey to the rack, tuck the wings back under the body and tie the legs together with butcher&#39;s twine.<br> Cut a 20-inch piece of cheesecloth and fold twice, creating 4 layers. Submerge the cloth in the melted butter, making sure it is completely saturated with it. Gently squeeze the cloth, then re-form so there are 4 layers and place on top of the turkey, covering it completely. Use a turkey baster to baste the cheesecloth with some of the remaining melted butter.<br> Roast for 30 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Baste the turkey with the pan juices and more of the melted butter. Continue to roast, basting with butter and pan drippings every 30 minutes, for an additional 2 hours.<br> Very gently remove the cheesecloth from the turkey, taking care not to tear the skin (see Cook&#39;s Note). Baste one more time, then return the turkey to the oven with the breasts facing towards the back and roast until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of a thigh measures 165 degrees F, about another 30 minutes. Let rest for 30 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7820,&quot;Ballymaloe Brown Yeast Bread 16 ounces/4 cups (450 grams) strong (stone-ground) wholemeal flour OR 14 ounces/3 1/2 cups (400 grams) strong (stone-ground) wholemeal flour plus 2 ounces/1/2 cup (50 grams) strong white flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon black treacle or molasses 3/4 ounce to 1 ounce (20 grams to 25 grams) fresh non-GM yeast 15 fluid ounces/ scant 2 cups (425 milliliters) water at blood heat plus 10 fluid ounces/1 1/4 cups (275 milliliters) Sunflower oil Sesame seeds, optional Instructions: When making Ballymaloe brown yeast bread, remember that yeast is a living organism. In order to grow, it requires warmth, moisture and nourishment. The yeast feeds on the sugar and produces bubbles of carbon dioxide which causes the bread to rise. Heat of over 122 degrees F/50 degrees C will kill yeast. Have the ingredients and equipment at blood heat. White or brown sugar, honey golden syrup, treacle or molasses may be used. Each will give a slightly different flavour to the bread. At Ballymaloe we use treacle. The dough rises more rapidly with 1 ounce (25 grams) yeast than with 3/4 ounce (20 grams) yeast. We use a stone ground wholemeal. Different flours produce breads of different textures and flavour. The amount of natural moisture in the flour varies according to atmospheric conditions. The quantity of water should be altered accordingly. The dough should be just too wet to knead - in fact it does not require kneading. The main ingredients - wholemeal flour, treacle and yeast are highly nutritious. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F/230 degrees C/gas mark 8. Mix the flour with the salt. In a small bowl or mixing cup, mix the treacle with 15 fluid ounces/ scant 2 cups (425 milliliters) water and crumble in the yeast. Sit the bowl for a few minutes in a warm place to allow the yeast to start to work. Grease a 5 by 8-inch (13 by 20 centimeters) loaf tin with sunflower oil. Meanwhile, check to see if the yeast is rising. After about 4 or 5 minutes it will have a creamy and slightly frothy appearance on top. When ready, stir and pour it, with all the remaining 10 fluid ounces/1 1/4 cups (275 milliliters) water into the flour to make a loose, wet dough. The mixture should be too wet to knead. Put the mixture into the greased tin. Sprinkle the top of the loaves with sesame seeds, if you like. Put the tin in a warm place somewhere close to the cooker or near a radiator perhaps. Cover the tins with a tea towel to prevent a skin from forming. Just as the bread comes to the top of the tin, remove the tea towel and pop the loaves in the oven for 20 minutes, then turn the oven down to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C/gas mark 6 for another 40 to 50 minutes, or until it looks nicely browned and sound hollow when tapped. The bread will rise a little further in the oven. This is called \oven spring. If, however, the bread rises to the top of the tin before it goes into the oven it will continue to rise and flow over the edges. We usually remove the loaves from the tins about 10 minutes before the end of cooking and put them back into the oven to crisp all round, but if you like a softer crust there&#39;s no need to do this. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7821,&quot;Blue Cheese-Stuffed Turkey Burgers 3 pounds ground turkey breast* 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning 4 (1-inch) chunks blue cheese 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 hamburger rolls (preferably whole-grain) Instructions: In a large bowl, combine turkey and poultry seasoning.

Greeks like to use winter squash, especially pumpkin, to make savory and sweet pies, fritters and croquettes, casseroles and myriad other dishes with fall&#39;s telltale vegetables, but these dishes are virtually unknown outside the country. It&#39;s traditionally made with pumpkin, but since most pumpkins in the U.S. are grown for carving jack-o&#39;-lanterns (and not for cooking), we&#39;ve modified the recipe to work with readily available butternut squash. The original dish calls for Greek pilaf rice, a short-grained, polished rice that is hard to find outside the country, so we&#39;ve substituted instant brown rice. Grate the squash through the large holes of a box grater. Heat oil in a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until soft and lightly colored, 10 to 12 minutes. Combine 2 tablespoons water and tomato paste in a small bowl and stir it into the pan. Add rice and stir to coat. Add the squash, in batches if necessary, and stir until it has reduced in volume enough so that you can cover the pan. Increase the heat to medium-high, pour in 1 3/4 cups water (or broth) and wine, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, stirring once or twice, until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and the squash is tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Add fennel fronds, oregano, salt, cinnamon and pepper; gently stir to combine. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.

Add the shallots, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, garlic, thyme and the remaining 3/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook until the mushrooms are soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Blend the peas and 1 can lentils until smooth in a blender. Transfer the pureed peas and lentils to a medium bowl. Add the remaining 1 can lentils, 1/3 cup cornmeal, mayonnaise, lemon juice and the mushroom mixture. Form 1/3-cupfuls of the mixture into eleven 3/4-inch-thick slider patties. Sprinkle 1/4 cup cornmeal on a baking sheet. Place the burgers on top of the cornmeal. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup cornmeal on top of the burgers. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup oil over medium heat in the skillet. Cook the burgers until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side. For the mayonnaise: Mix the mayonnaise, basil and lemon zest until smooth in a small bowl. Working in batches, place the bread in the skillet and cook until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. The bread can also be grilled or toasted in an oven. Smear the mayonnaise on the bread and top with the lentil burgers. Serve with avocado if using, tomato, lettuce and top with the remaining the bread slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 7826,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Spicy Chicken Sandwich Remake 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 2 cups buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup hot sauce<br> 2 tablespoons Hungarian hot paprika<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Peanut oil, for frying<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 2 brioche hamburger buns<br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 teaspoon chipotle in adobo sauce<br> 6 dill pickle slices<br> Instructions: For the marinade/batter: Use kitchen scissors to cut 6 to 7 small horizontal slivers, about 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep, into each chicken breast, to give them potential for crispies when fried. Set aside. Whisk together the buttermilk, hot sauce, paprika, a nice pinch of salt and plenty of grinds of pepper in a medium bowl. Add to a resealable bag or large bowl along with the chicken and soak for 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. Bring the chicken to room temperature before frying. Heat several inches of oil in a pot or deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry (reserving the marinade), then set aside. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch and baking powder in a large bowl. Slowly add the marinade liquid while whisking to form a pancake batter consistency. (If you go too far, just add more flour or about 2 tablespoons of water, depending on the texture.) Dust the chicken with some flour, then dunk in the batter to coat. Dust the chicken again with flour, then shake gently and slowly drop into the hot oil. Fry in batches until cooked through and golden on the outside, about 8 minutes. Remove and season with a pinch of salt and rest briefly on a few scrunched paper towels on a plate. For the sandwich: Butter both sides of each bun.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, then continue to cook until the potatoes are fork-tender (but the skins are still fully intact), about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set aside. While the potatoes cook, use sharp kitchen shears to cut lengthwise through the shells along the back of the shrimp, stopping at the tails and making sure to cut through the edge of the flesh. Devein the shrimp while keeping the shells as intact as possible. Transfer the shrimp to a large bowl and refrigerate while you make the butter sauce. Melt 1/2 stick of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 2 sticks butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until completely melted and starting to bubble, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the fish sauce, lime zest and juice, cayenne pepper if using, and the remaining 3 tablespoons Cajun seasoning. Stir to combine and add more Cajun seasoning if desired. The butter sauce should be very strongly seasoned. Cover with a lid and set aside. Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a gas grill, leave one or two burners on low or off; for a charcoal grill, bank the coals on one side of the grill). The ideal cooking temperature is 375 to 400 degrees F. On a large rimmed baking sheet, lay out 2 extra-long pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil with 8 inches of overhang on all sides of the baking sheet. Top with 3 of the banana leaves, overlapping them slightly to cover the foil completely. Moisten both sides of the banana leaves with a damp cloth (this will help prevent tearing). Cut the remaining banana leaf in half crosswise and set aside. To the bowl of shrimp, add 1/4 cup of the butter sauce and toss to combine. Arrange the shrimp in the center of the banana leaves in a single layer. In the empty bowl (no need to clean it out), combine the cooked potatoes, corn, sausage, and 1/2 cup of the butter sauce (reserve the rest for serving) and toss gently to combine. Arrange the vegetables and sausage on top of the shrimp. Cover the shrimp mixture with the halved banana leaf. Gently fold the sides of the bottom banana leaves up and over the shrimp mixture. Use 2 long pieces of kitchen twine to tie the banana leaf packet together. Do not pull the twine too tight or it will rip the banana leaves. Fold the foil overhanging from the longer sides of the baking sheet over the banana leaves then fold over the foil from the shorter sides. Transfer the foil packet to the grill. Cook for 45 minutes. Use oven mitts or 2 large metal spatulas to transfer the packet back onto the baking sheet. Carefully open the foil, cut away the twine, and unwrap the banana leaves (discard the ones directly on top of the shrimp mixture). Drizzle the remaining butter sauce over the seafood boil and stir to combine. Serve immediately with warm toasted bread, lime wedges and hot sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 7830,&quot;Ginger and Lime\u2013Marinated Swordfish 1 lime, juiced 1 tablespoon ginger, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 onion, sliced 3 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound swordfish Instructions: In a bowl combine juice of the lime, ginger, garlic and onion.

Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.<br> Remove the silver skin on the backside of the ribs and discard. Place the racks of ribs on the prepared baking sheet, meaty-side up. (If the racks of ribs are too long for your baking sheet, arrange on 2 lined baking sheets, cutting the racks in half as necessary.)<br> For the dry rub: In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, cumin, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Sprinkle the rub generously on top of the ribs, saving just enough for a light rub on the underside. Tightly cover the entire baking sheet with another sheet of foil and bake until the meat falls easily off the bone when you pierce it with a fork, 2 1/2 hours.<br> For the beer-b-q sauce: Meanwhile combine the ketchup, beer, honey, Worcestershire, sugar, mustard, garlic powder and onion powder in a medium bowl and set aside.<br> Remove the ribs from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat a grill for cooking at medium-high heat. Using a pastry brush, brush a medium layer of beer-b-q sauce on the meaty side of the ribs. Gently place the racks of ribs, meaty-side down, on the grill and cook until there is a nice char on the meat, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from grill and let rest for another 5 minutes. Slice and serve with your favorite sides! &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Merlot, Malbec]&quot; 7833,&quot;Honey Hoisin Glazed Wings 12 chicken wings, wing tips removed, split at the joint 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper 1/4 cup rice vinegar 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper 1/2 cup honey 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce 1 tablespoon soy sauce 2 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced 2 teaspoons black and white sesame seeds, for serving Instructions: Arrange an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the broiler.

Frost the sides first, building extra frosting at the top of the sides. Then, frost the top. Since this part of the cake is supposed to look like the center of a sunflower, the frosting should not be smooth, but should swirl into peaks. To create this swirled, peaked effect, lightly run the palette knife through the frosting and gently pull up. Using a spatula place the cake in the center of a platter that is at least 20-inches by 20-inches or you can use a piece of cardboard that is covered with foil. To create the petals: Using a serrated knife, cut the second 9-inch cake in half. Then, cut each of the halves in half again. You should have 4 triangles. Cut each of these 4 triangles in half again to create 8 triangular pieces. Using a paring knife, trim each of the eight petals to curve slightly inward so they hug the outside of the center of the cake. Be careful not to trim off too much. Start at the corner of the curved edge, and trim a slightly rounded arc that ends at the opposite corner of the rounded edge. Using the yellow frosting and a small spatula or palette knife, frost the top and 2 sides. There is no need to frost the curved edge. Once the pieces are frosted, place them around the cake. Looking at the cake as though it was a clock, place the petals at 12, 3, 6 and 9. Place the remaining four petals in between 12 and 3, in between 3 and 6, in between 6 and 9 and in between 9 and 12. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 7839,&quot;Spicy Sriracha Popcorn 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 cup popcorn kernels<br> 4 tablespoons butter<br> 2 teaspoons sriracha<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Coat the bottom of a large pot with the vegetable oil. Pour in the popcorn kernels, cover and set over medium-high heat. When you hear the first kernels pop, begin to shake. Continue to cook, shaking, until all the corn is popped. When you no longer hear popping, remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl. In a pan, melt the butter, add the sriracha and stir. Drizzle over the popcorn and toss.

Add the garlic, onions, peppers, paprika and some salt and pepper. Partially cover and cook to tender, 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the stock and tomatoes, and simmer to combine the flavors. Cool the goulash and store for a make-ahead meal. Reheat over medium heat, adding a splash of stock or water if mixture is too thick. To serve, bring a large pot of water to boil for the pasta while the sauce reheats. Salt the water and cook the macaroni to al dente. Reserve a little starchy cooking water before draining. Stir a few spoons of sour cream into the goulash. Incorporate the macaroni into the goulash and add the starchy water as you go to keep the mixture from becoming too dry. Top the goulash with blue cheese crumbles and herbs, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 7841,&quot;Nantucket Cranberry Pie, Cooking Thin Slim Down 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries 1/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup chopped walnuts, optional 3/4 cup flour 3/4 sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the butter in a 9-inch round non-reactive baking dish. Set pan in oven long enough to barely melt butter or melt in microwave. Remove from oven, swirl pan to coat evenly with butter, set in a warm place. Toss cranberries with sugar and walnuts, set aside. In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.

Serve warm &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Vinho Verde]&quot; 7842,&quot;Lavender Shortbread 8 tablespoons (1 stick) cool unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons dried or fresh lavender flowers Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cream the butter until soft in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add 1/4 cup sugar and mix until incorporated. Stir together the flour, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix at low speed just until the ingredients are almost incorporated, then add the lavender, and mix until the dough starts to come together. Flour a work surface, turn the dough onto it, and knead it 5 to 10 times, to bring the dough together and smooth it out. Reflour the work surface. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to a little less than 1/4-inch thick to fit an 8 by 8-inch square baking pan lined with parchment. To transfer to the pan, roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, lift it up, and unroll into the pan. (Or, press the dough thoroughly into the pan with your fingers.) Prick the shortbread all over with a fork, or use a pique-vite (dough docker) if you&#39;ve got one, to prevent any buckling or shrinking. Sprinkle the surface evenly with 1 tablespoon of the remaining sugar. Bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, deflate the dough by knocking the pan once against the oven rack then rotate the pan to ensure even cooking and a flat surface. Bake 10 to 15 minutes more, until golden all over and very lightly browned. As soon as it comes out of the oven, sprinkle the surface evenly with the remaining tablespoon of sugar. Let cool about 5 minutes. Using a very sharp knife, cut into 3 rows by 5 rows making about 1 1/2-inch by 3-inch bars. Let cool completely in the pan. Remove from the pan and store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 7843,&quot;Lemon Sorbet 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 teaspoons lemon zest Juice of 6 lemons (about 1 cup) 3 tablespoons limoncello Instructions: Add the sugar, 1 cup water and lemon zest to a medium saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups cold water, the lemon juice and limoncello. Place in the fridge until chilled, about 2 hours.

Wrap in damp paper towel to keep moist until ready to serve. In large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic and saute briefly until brown. Add the onion and brown lightly, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, add a pinch each of salt and pepper (go easy on the salt because the anchovies will add that extra bit of saltiness). Continue to cook until the onion is well browned, about 5 minutes. Add the anchovies and cook and stir until they melt into the onion. Add the chili flakes, then the caper juice and stand back to avoid getting splattered. Stir and scrape all around the pan. Add 1/4 cup of the vinegar, return the heat to high, and boil until reduced and thick, 1 to 2 minutes. In a separate pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the eggplant and saute until browned and cooked through, about 6 minutes. Saute only a small bunch at a time, to avoid letting the eggplant boil in its own juices. If the pan gets too dry, add more olive oil as the cooking progresses - if you add too much olive oil early in the process, the eggplant will absorb all of it and still need more. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the pan well so nothing burns. Season with salt and pepper. Scrape into a bowl. Add the garlic-anchovy mixture to the eggplant with the capers and remaining vinegar. Stir well, then scrape into a bowl. Stir in the roasted peppers and parsley and taste again for seasoning. Let cool to room temperature before serving. When ready to assemble, place 1 to 2 tablespoons of caponata in chilled lettuce cups. Wrap into ball and enjoy. Brush peppers with olive oil (this carries the heat into crevices, helping the skin to blister more evenly). Roast the peppers whole under a broiler or on the stovetop, or grill, turning occasionally until the skins blister and char all over. Place in paper bag, and let steam to loosen the skins, for about 15 minutes. Working over the bowl to catch any juices, peel off the skins. Seed the peppers, then slice into long strips and place in a clean bowl. Pour the juices left in the steaming bowl over the peppers and refrigerate for up to several days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Gavi, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 7845,&quot;Watermelon Cube with Aged Balsamic Vinegar About 1/2 pound seedless red or yellow watermelon flesh 1/2 lime Aged balsamic vinegar, for garnishing Instructions: Cut the watermelon flesh into 6 (1 1/2-inch) cubes.

Use a 4-inch round cutter to cut out a hole in the exact center of two of the cakes. Using an offset spatula or butter knife, add a 1/4-inch layer of the frosting to one of the whole cakes, which will become the bottom layer. Then place one cake with a hole in it over the top of the bottom layer. Frost that cake with a 1/4-inch layer of frosting. Place the second cake with the hole over the top and frost that cake with a 1/4-inch layer of frosting. Set the remaining whole cake aside for a later use. Measure the height of the barrel created in the cake center. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Dust flour on a clean surface and roll out the pie crust to 1/8-inch thick. Use a ruler to cut 15 strips of pie dough, 1-inch wide and the height of the cake, and then use the 4-inch round cutter to cut a round of pie dough. Transfer the pie strips and round to the prepared baking sheet. Bake the dough until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Frost the inside of the barrel of the cake. Drop the pie round into the bottom of the barrel to create the bottom. Lightly press the baked pie strips into the sides of the barrel directly next to each other until the barrel is fully formed. Pour the cherry pie filling into the center of the barrel. Finally place the remaining whole cake on top to cover. Cover the entire cake with the remaining chocolate frosting. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar to serve. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Slowly drop in the cubed butter and mix until the mixture resembles wet sand. In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and heavy cream, then pour the mixture into the bowl of the stand mixer and whip until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a clean cutting board and cut in half. Using your hands, gently push each half of dough into a disc and wrap each in plastic wrap.

Cover and let soak at room temperature for 4 hours. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a 14-inch wok over high heat. Cook the noodles according to the package directions until tender all the way through, about 3 minutes. Strain the noodles and divide them between two plates. Lift small amounts of noodles up and down with chopsticks to cool the noodles and form each plate of noodles into an 8-inch \u201cbird\u2019s nest\u201d shape. Let them cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, lightly cover with plastic wrap and set aside.<br> Meanwhile, cut the chicken thighs into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Mix the chicken and 3/4 teaspoon each salt, sugar, cornstarch, light soy sauce and Shaoxing wine together in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Mix in 1/2 teaspoon neutral oil until combined. Cover and refrigerate.<br> Once the mushrooms are nearly rehydrated, bring 6 cups of water in the same wok to a boil. Blanch the carrots until slightly tender, about 1 minute. Strain the carrot out of the water with a spider or slotted spoon and place on a plate to cool slightly. Bring the water back to a boil, add the bok choy and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes. Strain the bok choy and place with the carrot. Set aside.<br> Prepare the scallions by cutting them into 2-inch pieces, then thinly slicing them lengthwise. Chop the garlic so everything is ready for stir-frying.<br> Meanwhile, mix the oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon light soy sauce, and the dark soy sauce together in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.<br> Mix 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 5 tablespoons cold water in a small bowl until smooth. Set aside.<br> Remove the mushrooms from the water with a slotted spoon (reserve the soaking water). Squeeze the water from the mushrooms, cut off and discard the stems and thinly slice the caps. Mix the sliced mushrooms with 1/2 teaspoon each salt, sugar, cornstarch, light soy sauce and Shaoxing wine in a small bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon neutral oil and mix until combined. Mix the mushroom soaking liquid with the oyster sauce mixture until combined.<br> Pour enough neutral oil into a wok (about 5 cups for a 14-inch wok) so it comes 2 inches up the sides but not above halfway up the wok. (See Cook\u2019s Note.) Heat over high heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.<br> As the oil is heating up, loosen the noodles again just before frying by using chop sticks to separate and fluff them. Transfer one cooled noodle nest into a large spider, slowly and carefully lower it into the hot oil (step away from the wok as the oil may splatter for the first few seconds). Fry for 5 minutes. Flip the noodles using the spider and chopsticks, push any noodles back that are sticking out to keep the shape, and fry until the edges of the nest are crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the crispy noodles to a paper towel\u2013lined plate. Wipe off as much oil as possible; the nest will crisp more as it sits.<br> Repeat with the remaining nest of noodles, adding more oil to the wok if necessary to make sure the noodles are completely submerged. Drain on another paper towel\u2013lined plate. Carefully discard the oil.<br> Heat the wok over high heat until smoking. Pour in 1 tablespoon neutral oil and swirl it around the wok to coat the surface. Spread the chicken in an even layer and fry undisturbed until it starts to brown, about 2 minutes.

Let stand until bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Combine 5 cups flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yeast mixture and mix on medium-low speed, adding a little more flour or water, if needed, until a rough, sticky ball of dough forms, about 1 minute. Let rest 5 minutes, then mix on medium low until no longer sticky, about 1 more minute. Transfer the dough to an oiled surface and knead with oiled hands until smooth, about 10 times. Let rest 5 minutes, then knead briefly again and transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Divide the dough into 4 balls, dust with flour and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours before making the pizzas. Make the sauce: Crush the tomatoes in a bowl using your hands. Stir in the olive oil, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the oregano. Cover and let stand 2 hours. Position a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack; preheat to 500 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. Stretch each ball of dough into a 12-to-14-inch round on individual sheets of parchment paper. Let rest 15 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic from the sauce. Spread a thin layer of sauce on each pizza, leaving a border. Top with one-quarter each of the mozzarella, parmesan, cherry peppers, soppressata and radicchio; drizzle with olive oil. Slide 1 pizza (on the parchment) onto a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet, then slide onto the hot stone in the oven. Bake until the crust browns, 12 to 15 minutes. Top with oregano. Repeat to make 3 more pizzas.

Add the carrots, celery, onion, and garlic. Continue to cook for about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook stirring slowly for 3 more minutes. Optional: you can dust the short ribs at this time with flour to help thicken the sauce. Add the rest of the ingredients and cover. Cook for about 2 hours on low heat (simmer) or until the meat begins to pull from the bone. When done remove from the pan and strain the liquid. You can now thicken the sauce or leave as is and season with salt and pepper. Serve with truffle mashed potatoes and haricots verts. Truffle mashed potatoes are standard mashed potatoes with chopped black truffles and a little truffle oil added to them. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 7859,&quot;Dark Chocolate Hazelnut BonBon Spiders 1 pound dark chocolate couverture 10 ounces heavy cream 2 ounces butter, room temperature 1 teaspoon hazelnut extract 80 polycarbonate chocolate molds Red cocoa butter, for treating mold Tempered Dark Chocolate Couverture, recipe follows 80 whole hazelnuts 1 pound 6 ounces dark chocolate couverture, divided Instructions: For the hazelnut ganache: Put the chocolate couverture in a medium bowl and set aside. In a medium saucepan, scald the heavy cream. Pour the scalded heavy cream over the chocolate couveture and set aside for 3 to 5 minutes to allow the scalded milk to melt the chocolate. With a rubber spatula, gently stir the chocolate and heavy cream until fully blended and smooth. Add the butter and stir with a rubber spatula to incorporate. Add the hazelnut extract and stir to incorporate. Pour the mixture into a large pastry bag and set aside. Pre-treat the polycarbonate chocolate mold with red (or any color desired) cocoa butter. Once the cocoa butter is set, brush each mold with a thin layer of tempered chocolate. Fill the entire mold with the fluid tempered chocolate and tap on work surface to release air bubbles. Quickly invert the mold and tap out excess chocolate. With a putty knife, scrape off the rest of the chocolate, let the mold rest upside down for 1 minute, and then scrape off surface of mold again. Let the chocolate set. Fill each mold with hazelnut ganache, 3/4 of the way full. Let the hazelnut ganache set. Pour the fluid tempered chocolate over the mold and spread thin, scraping off any excess. Tap mold on surface to release any air bubbles, and then scrape excess chocolate again. Transfer the finished mold to the freezer and let set for 2 to 3 minutes. Pull out the mold, invert, and tap on clean work surface to release finished bonbon. To assemble: Dip the hazelnuts in fluid tempered chocolate and let set. Attach to finished bonbons with a small dab of tempered chocolate. With a small pastry bag, pipe the tempered chocolate on parchment paper in a 1 1/2-inch upside-down V-shape. Repeat to make 80. Once set, lift the piped tempered chocolate and attach to the bonbons with a small dab of tempered chocolate to look like the legs of a spider. Over a double boiler, melt 1 pound 4 ounces chocolate to 115 to 120 degrees F. Bring the bowl with the melted chocolate to a flat, clean work surface (preferably marble or stainless steel ), wiping away any access water or steam from the bowl. With a rubber spatula, fully incorporate the remaining 2 ounces chocolate. Bring down the temperature of the chocolate to 80 to 84 degrees F by either stirring constantly in a figure 8 motion, or tabling (see Cook&#39;s Note). Once cooled, test the chocolate by dipping a small strip of parchment paper into the melted chocolate, and then lay it down on a clean work surface. If tempered, the chocolate on the parchment paper should be dry, hard, shiny, and without any streaks in 3 to 5 minutes. If any of these occur, keep stirring (agitating) the chocolate, or table it again, until a parchment paper test shows that the chocolate is tempered. When tempered, bring the chocolate back to the double boiler and reheat to NO HIGHER than 89 degrees F. (Bringing the temperature back up aids in a more fluid working consistency.) Transfer the chocolate to a chocolate warmer or set the bowl on top of a heating pad (at medium setting) to keep in temper. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 7860,&quot;Instant Pot Spinach and Mushroom Lasagna 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 pound button mushrooms, sliced Kosher salt 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> 2 cups whole milk 20 ounces frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry<br> 1 cup chopped fresh basil 1/2 cup whole-milk ricotta 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 clove garlic, finely grated 1 1/4 cups grated Parmesan One 24-ounce jar marinara sauce One 9-ounce box no-boil lasagna noodles 1 cup grated mozzarella Instructions: Add the butter to a 6-quart Instant Pot? and set to high saute (see Cook&#39;s Note). When melted, add the mushrooms and 2 teaspoons salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the flour and nutmeg and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the milk, bring to a boil and cook until thick and creamy, about 5 minutes. Transfer the bechamel sauce to a medium bowl and set aside. Add 2 cups water to the pot (no need to clean the pot first) and put the rack in the bottom with the handles folded under. Meanwhile, mix together the spinach, basil, ricotta, red pepper flakes, garlic, 1 cup Parmesan and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until completely combined.<br> Spread 1/2 cup marinara sauce on the bottom of an 8-inch round cake pan. Break 4 lasagna noodles into large pieces and arrange in an even layer over the sauce. Spread another 1/2 cup marinara sauce evenly over the noodles.

Saute the red onions and garlic until tender. Add the wine, beef base, pepper and 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to boil and reduce by one-third, about 10 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pan. Heat over medium-low heat. Mix the cornstarch with 3 ounces water to make a slurry. Whisk small amounts of the slurry into the sauce until the desired consistency is reached. Keep warm. For the lamb-stuffed cabbage: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the dark green outer leaves and the cores from the cabbages and wrap each head in plastic wrap with a little water. Microwave on high until softened, about 12 minutes. Separate the heads into individual leaves. Combine the ground lamb, Cheddar, whiskey, wine, breadcrumbs, garlic, celery, eggs, red peppers, green peppers, shallots, onions, scallions, 2 tablespoons salt and 1/2 tablespoon pepper in a large bowl. Mix by hand until all ingredients are fully incorporated. Stuff cabbage leaves with about 2 3/4 ounces of the lamb mixture; then roll the leaves around the filling. Place the rolls, seam-side down, in a large baking dish. Fill the pan halfway with water and drizzle the melted butter over the rolls. Cover with foil and bake until tender and very lightly browned, about 1 hour. Spoon the demi-glace sauce over the cabbage rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 7862,&quot;Baja Fish Tacos Vegetable oil, for frying 1/4 red cabbage, thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups) 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped Juice of 1 lime, plus wedges for serving 2 tablespoons honey or agave nectar 1/2 cup mayonnaise Kosher salt 12 corn tortillas 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon chili powder Freshly ground pepper 1 1/4 pounds skinless halibut fillet, cut into 2-by-1/2-inch pieces 1 Hass avocado 1/2 cup fresh salsa Instructions: Heat about 3 inches vegetable oil in a medium pot over medium-low heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F.

Remove necks and giblets and put into a large saucepan. Add onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks, and the chicken stock. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat and let simmer until reduced to about 2 cups. Strain and reserve; this is the turkey stock that you will use for the gravy. Wash the turkeys, inside and out, and dry well. Coat inside and out with half of the olive oil. Season each turkey on the outside generously with the spice rub, pressing it in to adhere. Place 4 rosemary sprigs and 2 lemon halves inside the cavity of each turkey. Arrange 4 of the halved carrots and 4 celery stalks on each of 2 half-sheet pans or baking sheets. Position each turkey on top of the carrots and celery so that the turkey does not rest directly on the bottom of the pan. Drizzle turkeys with remaining olive oil. Roast until an instant-read thermometer (inserted deep into the thigh but away from the bone) reads 165 degrees F and juices in the thigh run clear when pierced with a fork, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours; begin checking at 2 hours. Remove from the pans and let rest for 15 minutes before carving. Reserve pan juices for gravy. While turkeys are resting, make the gravy. In a medium heavy saucepan, cook flour and butter over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a blond roux is formed. Add pan juices and then reserved turkey stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and let simmer until thickened and ready to serve. Carve turkey as desired and serve with gravy. Put the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium heat. Watch carefully, tossing frequently so the seeds toast evenly. When light brown and fragrant, pour the seeds onto a plate to cool. They must be cool before grinding, or they will gum up the blades. Pour the seeds into a blender and add the salt. Blend to a fine powder, shaking the blender occasionally to redistribute the seeds. Store in a tightly sealed glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7864,&quot;Chicken Fried Steak 2 eggs 2 cups milk, at room temperature 3 cups flour 2 teaspoons meat seasoning 2 cups frying oil, preferably Canola 8 (6-ounce) tenderized beef cutlets at room temperature (or tenderized center cut boneless pork chop, or tenderized boneless chicken breasts) Mashed potatoes, recipe follows 1 pound baking potatoes, like russets, peeled and cut in quarters 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) butter 2 cups half-and-half or 1 1/2 cups milk 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon black pepper Instructions: Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl and set this egg wash aside. Combine the flour and meat seasoning in another bowl and set aside. Heat the oil in a heavy 14-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees. Use a deep frying thermometer to check temperature. The oil should pop loudly when a drop of egg is dropped in. Dip each of the first 4 cutlets in the egg wash mixture. Dredge them in the flour, then dip them back into the egg wash, and very gently place them in the hot oil. As you carry them 1 at a time from the egg wash to the skillet, hold a plate under them to catch the dripping egg wash. There&#39;ll be a regular explosion of noisy oil popping. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until breading is set and golden brown. Gently turn them with a long handled meat fork or long metal tongs. Be careful. Cook another 3 minutes. Carefully remove them from the skillet and drain on a platter lined with paper towels. Let oil reheat and repeat process for other 4 cutlets. Boil potatoes until tender. Drain and mash with butter, half-and-half, salt and pepper. Beat until smooth.

Coat peppers with olive oil and place on a foil lined baking sheet. Salt liberally. Bake in the oven, turning every 10 minutes until peppers are blistered and black, about 20 to 30 minutes total. Meanwhile, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a hot saute pan. Add the serrano chiles and the garlic. Lower the heat to moderate, and cook, turning occasionally, until the chiles are softened, lightly browned, and blistered on all sides. Remove the pan from the heat and let the chiles cool in the oil for several minutes When the roasted bell peppers are blistered and blackened, removed them from the oven, place in a glass bowl and cover with plastic wrap. This will steam the skins off and make them easier to remove. After 15 to 20 minutes, remove the peppers and peel. Remove the seeds, stems and ribs. Do not run under water \u2013 this will just wash the flavor off! You should have about 4 cups. Note: You can roast the peppers under the broiler or over a gas flame, if you prefer, but I like to do them in a hot oven. It takes a little longer, but you don&#39;t have to monitor them as closely. Chop the garlic finely, then use the side of your knife to mash them to a paste \u2013 a pinch of grey salt will help this process. Mashing insures that the garlic add just an undercurrent of flavor, with no big pieces to bite into. Add to the blender. When cool enough to handle, peel the chiles and remove the stems and seeds (or leave some or all of the seeds if you prefer a spicy sauce). Then add the tomato puree and the oregano (no need to chop the oregano because it&#39;s going to be blended in). Add to the blender the olive oil used to roast the chilis and garlic. Turn the blender on high until everything is smooth and thick. Turn a medium saute pan on high for 30 seconds with about 1/4 cup of olive oil. Stand back as you pour the blender mixture into the pan. Be careful, it can splatter. This second heating brings the flavors together. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and the red wine vinegar. The vinegar gives it a little sharpness and protects it in the refrigerator for about a week. Ladle it into canning jars and store in the refrigerator for a week. It can be frozen for 5 months. Preheat a grill to high. Season the steak with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Grill the steak to medium-rare, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and let rest for 10 minutes. To a large pot of boiling, salted water, add the spaghettini and cook to al dente. Drain and toss with the salsa rossa. Slice the flank steak thinly against the grain and place on top of the pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 7866,&quot;Blueberry and Mascarpone Turnovers 1/2 cup mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons sugar, plus extra for sprinkling 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1/3 cup fresh or frozen and thawed blueberries 2 (9-inch) refrigerated pie crusts 1 egg, beaten Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Special equipment: a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix together the cheese, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and lemon zest until smooth. Stir in the blueberries. Using a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut the pie dough into 12 circles. Place the dough on the prepared baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the edges of the dough with the beaten egg. Place about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cheese mixture in the center of the dough. Fold the dough in half to enclose the filling and pinch the edges to seal. Using the tines of a fork, gently crimp the sealed edges. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. While the pastry is chilling: In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) Fry the turnovers for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until golden. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with sugar while still hot.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix the olive oil with the orange juice, zest, and half of the rosemary to flavor the oil. Pour the rosemary oil over the lamb and rub it into the meat really well; season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Place the racks of lamb side by side in a large roasting pan, with the rib bones facing up; wrap the bones in foil to prevent blackening in the oven. Toss the radishes with a little oil and put them in the roasting pan next to the lamb. Roast until the internal temperature of the meat at the thickest point registers 130 degrees F for medium-rare doneness, about 40 to 50 minutes. The radishes should be tender and golden. Remove the racks of lamb to a carving board to rest, tent them with foil. Drain the excess fat from the roasting pan and set the pan on two burners over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the flour into the pan drippings and stir to cook out the starchy taste of the flour. Gradually pour in the wine, stirring constantly to scrape up the brown bits and avoid lumps.

Cut the potatoes into 1/3-inch slices and then slice into 1/3-inch sticks. Fill a large bowl with water and soak potatoes, submerged, for at least 30 minutes up to 24 hours. This will help remove the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing. Heat a heavy stock pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer with oil to 325 degrees F. Remove potatoes from the water, and pat dry to remove excess water. Add 2 handfuls of potatoes to hot oil. There should be at least 1-inch of oil above the potatoes. Par cook until potatoes are light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove potatoes, gently shaking off excess oil and let drain on rack. Repeat until all of the potatoes are par cooked. Raise heat of oil to 350 degrees F. Cook potatoes again, 2 handfuls at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from oil, shake off excess oil, and season lightly in a bowl with salt and pepper. Repeat until all potatoes are cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7896,&quot;BLT Bar 27 slices thick-cut bacon 24 leaves green leaf lettuce<br> 12 deli slices sharp Cheddar 3 large red onions, thinly sliced<br> 27 slices cooked thick-cut maple bacon<br> 24 slices soft white sandwich bread<br> Heirloom Tomato and Watermelon Salad, recipe follows Homemade Mayonnaise, recipe follows Quick Pickles, recipes follows Ketchup 8 cups 1 1/4-inch chunks red and yellow heirloom tomatoes 4 cups 1 1/4-inch chunks seedless watermelon<br> 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/2 cups feta, cut into 1/2-inch chunks 1/2 cup torn fresh basil leaves 4 large egg yolks 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 2 cups vegetable oil<br> Juice of 2 lemons<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Pinch freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/2 cups cider vinegar 1/2 cup brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1 tablespoon celery seeds<br> 1 tablespoon coriander seeds<br> 1 tablespoon mustard seeds<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill 1 cucumber, sliced into thin discs<br> 1 jalape?o, seeded and sliced thinly, optional<br> 1/2 small onion, thinly sliced<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Transfer the pan to the stovetop and set over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, rosemary, and sage. Add the wine and let it evaporate. Add the water and simmer the stock until it has reduced to one-quarter its original volume; you should have about 1 cup of stock. Strain out the solids and reserve. To make the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grind the reserved quail meat in a meat grinder; you&#39;ll need 1 pound of meat. In a medium bowl, immerse the bread in the milk until it&#39;s soaked. Meanwhile, combine the quail meat, sausage, eggs, Parmesan, parsley, and 1 teaspoon of the sage in a large bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Squeeze the bread to remove excess milk (discard the milk) and add it to the bowl. Mix well. Divide the mixture in half, and form each half into a loaf no wider than 3-inches in diameter. Roll each loaf in the breadcrumbs. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Melt 4 tablespoons of butter with the olive oil in a large ovenproof saute pan set over medium-high heat. When the butter solids turn brown, sear both meatloafs until browned on all sides (if they don&#39;t both fit, sear them one at a time, adding more butter for the second loaf). Add the shallots, garlic, sage sprigs, and rosemary to the pan. When the onion begins to color, add the wine, let it evaporate, and then add 3/4 cup of the quail stock. Bake until the juices run clear when pricked with a skewer, 45 to 60 minutes. Transfer the meatloaf to a clean plate, remove and discard the sage and rosemary sprigs, and make the sauce in the pan. Add the cream and use a hand blender to puree the pan sauce. Set the pan over medium heat and let it reduce to a pleasing saucy consistency. To make the cabbage: Heat the butter and olive oil in a large braising pan set over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, cook until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the cabbage and carrots, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low heat. When the cabbage begins to wilt, add the wine, and let it evaporate. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of quail stock. Let the pan dry out, reduce the heat to very low, cover tightly, and braise until the cabbage is very tender and starts to color and stick to the pan, 45 minutes to 1 hour. To serve: Cut the meatloaf into 1/3-inch thick slices and then cut each slice in half. Use an ice cream scoop to portion about 1/4 cup of polenta in the middle of a plate. Press a piece of plastic wrap on top and flatten the polenta to a circle that&#39;s about 4-inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick. Fan the meatloaf slices over the polenta, scoop some braised cabbage alongside and spoon the sauce over everything. Finish with freshly ground pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or ideally overnight until set. Just before serving pour the cream into a chilled bowl. Whip the cream with a whisk or a hand held mixer, and continue beating until soft peaks form. Take care not to over-beat the cream or it will be grainy. Serve each pudding with a dollop of whipped cream on top. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Port]&quot; 7910,&quot;Yakgwa 3 cups all-purpose flour Kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon finely ground black pepper 1/3 cup toasted sesame oil, plus more as needed 1/3 cup soju, plus more as needed 1/3 cup Ginger-Infused Simple Syrup, recipe follows Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola, for deep-frying 1 3/4 cups jochung (see Cook\u2019s Note) 1/4 cup honey 2 tablespoons sugar One 1/2-inch piece ginger, sliced into thin coins 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pine nuts, for garnish 1 cup granulated sugar One 1/2-inch piece ginger, sliced into thin coins 1 tablespoon honey Instructions: For the cookies: Whisk together the flour, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the sesame oil and toss with a rubber spatula until some, if not most, of the flour granules are hydrated in the oil and become pea-size pieces. Transfer the flour mixture to a fine-mesh sieve set over a large bowl. Use a metal spoon to scrape the mixture in the sieve to help it pass through. The resulting dough will resemble a coarse ground cornmeal. Add the soju and ginger-infused simple syrup and toss together with the rubber spatula until just combined. Put your hands in the bowl and gently knead and press the dough into a ball until there are no specks of dry flour. Do not overwork the dough. Keep in mind that the dough is supposed to be very dry and crumbly. It\u2019s OK if some dough breaks apart. You\u2019ll know the dough is ready when it\u2019s pressed and pinched together, but holds its shape. Gather the dough, adding 1 teaspoon of soju at a time if needed. Gently pat down the dough into a square and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate and let rest for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the coating syrup. For the coating syrup: Bring the jochung, honey, sugar, cinnamon, ginger and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl to cool. Roll the rested dough into a 1/2-inch-thick large square (about 7-inches-by-7-inches), lightly brushing the work surface or rolling pin with sesame oil as needed. Cut the dough in half vertically. Flip over one half and place it directly on top of the remaining half. Press down on the dough and roll it out into a 1/2-inch-thick square again. Repeat the process of cutting, flipping, layering and rolling out the dough two more times. Cut the final dough square into 16 pieces (each about 1 3/4 inches). Make a small hole in the center of each cookie with a toothpick and set aside. Heat at least 1 inch of oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 300 to 320 degrees F. Line a sheet tray with paper towels. Add all the cookies into the oil (it is OK to overcrowd in this case) and fry, carefully stirring constantly with long chopsticks or a long-handled wooden spoon, until the cookies are deep golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to the prepared sheet tray and let cool. Toss the cooled cookies in the coating syrup in a large bowl and let sit for 4 to 8 hours. Tranfer the cookies to another sheet tray fitted with a cooling rack and garnish the center of each cookie with 3 pine nuts. Let sit for 1 hour and serve. For the ginger-infused simple syrup: Bring the sugar, ginger and 1 cup water to a boil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and whisk in the honey. Let cool and discard the ginger slices. The syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Use it to sweeten hot coffee or tea, or in a cocktail. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7911,&quot;Beer Battered Green Beans 4 cups tempura mix 1 pint beer 1 pound string beans 2 tablespoons heavy cream 2 tablespoons flour Pinch salt Instructions: Preheat a deep fryer to 300 degrees F, or in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way.

Working from the top down, cut away the peel and pith to expose the flesh. Cut out the orange segments, leaving the membrane behind. Squeeze any juice from the membrane into a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining orange. You should have about 1/4 cup juice. Reserve the segments. Whisk the cream, vinegar, mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper into the orange juice. While whisking, pour in the olive oil in a slow, steady stream to make a creamy, slightly thick dressing. Chill while you make the salad. For the salad: Sprinkle the shrimp with the Old Bay and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the shrimp in two batches until just cooked through, about 3 minutes per batch. Remove to a plate to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Combine the shrimp, reserved orange segments, avocado, cucumber and fennel in the bowl with the dressing and toss gently. Mound the lettuce on a platter or individual plates and top with the salad. Garnish with fennel fronds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 7916,&quot;\Old Bay\ Grilled Steak Fries 1 tablespoon ground bay leaves 2 1/2 teaspoons celery salt 1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon ground mace 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 6 Idaho potatoes, scrubbed 1 tablespoon salt 1/4 cup vegetable oil Instructions: Combine all spices in a small bowl.

Toss the lamb with the rosemary, garlic, oil, and the vinegar and let marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. While the lamb is marinating, blanch the potatoes and carrots. In well-salted boiling water cook the potatoes for 5 or 6 minutes then transfer with a skimmer to a platter or sheet tray. Cook the carrots for 2 or 3 minutes and reserve with the potatoes. Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan on medium-high heat until the oil begins to smoke. While the oil is heating, remove the lamb from the marinade and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the lamb with the flour and toss to coat. Shake excess flour from the meat and add half to the pan in a single layer so as to sear the meat on all sides, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove to a plate. Repeat with remaining lamb. Carefully place the potatoes and carrots in the pan used for the lamb. (The olive oil will have lots of flavor from the lamb.) Season with salt and pepper and saute until lightly caramelized, about 4 minutes. Stir from time to time and regulate the heat so the vegetables do not caramelize too much on one side. Transfer to a platter or large plate so that they can be spread out in a single layer. Pour off and discard the residual oil in the pan. With the pan still on medium heat, deglaze with the wine and reduce by half then add the stock. Bring to a simmer and reduce again by half. Add the seared lamb to the pan and gently toss to incorporate with the pan sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. In a Dutch oven or large, deep baking dish, add the lamb, wine and broth mixture and rosemary. Cover then place in the pre-heated oven for 45 minutes. Add the potatoes, carrots and spring onions to the stew. Mix carefully to incorporate. Add a little stock or water, if necessary, to keep the stew moistened. Continue to cook in the oven, covered, until the meat and vegetables are tender, about 10 more minutes. Stir in the parsley and lemon zest. Taste and add salt and fresh ground pepper if needed. Serve directly from the baking dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 7925,&quot;Simple Baklava 1/2 cup almonds 1/2 cup walnuts 1/4 cup chopped dried apricots 1/4 cup plain bread crumbs 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves Pinch of salt 1 stick butter, melted, divided 3 tablespoons honey 12 sheets phyllo dough Instructions: Special equipment: 2 mini-muffin tins Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the almonds, walnuts, apricots, bread crumbs, sugar, cinnamon, ground cloves, and salt in a food processor. Run the machine until the mixture is very finely chopped.

To diminish the fat and produce a crispy skin, begin by trimming the excess fat from the body. Rinse the duck thoroughly, inside and out, and pat dry with paper towels. Season the bird inside and out with a generous amount of salt and pepper. To prepare the stuffing: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, celery seed, prunes, apples, and 4 sage leaves; season with salt and pepper; saute for 10 minutes until soft. Add the bread cubes and toss the mixture together to combine. Put the stuffing in a large mixing bowl and moisten it with a squeeze of lemon and the heavy cream; give it another toss and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the stuffing into the duck cavity. Rip off a foot long piece of aluminum foil and lay it on an insert rack fitted in a roasting pan, let a bit of the foil hang off the end. Lay the duck, breast-side up, on the foil; tuck the wing tips back under the duck, and fold the excess foil over the end of the duck with the stuffing. The foil will protect the stuffing from burning and falling into the delicious duck fat. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roast the duck for 21/2 to 3 hours, rotating the pan every 20 minutes or so. It may seem like a bother, but it&#39;s the best way to ensure an even crispy skin. The legs will wiggle easily when the bird is done and an instant-read thermometer will register about 180 degrees F when inserted into the thigh. Take the insert rack out of the pan and set the duck on a cutting board to let it rest before carving. Now you have a whole lot of duck fat in the bottom of the roasting pan. Pour out all but a couple of tablespoons of the duck fat into a container and reserve. For the gravy: Place the roasting pan, with the couple of tablespoons of duck fat, on the stove over 2 burners set on medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour and stir to make a paste.

Coat the bottom of another smaller saute pan with olive oil. Sprinkle the fish with salt on both sides. When the large saute pan is screaming hot but not quite smoking, lay the fish fillets in the pan, skin-side down. Do not crowd the pan, you may have to work in batches. After you put the fish in the pan, place the other small saute pan directly on top of the fish fillets. This applies gentle pressure to the fish and forces the skin to have contact with the pan and will create crispy skin. Cook the fish for 3 to 4 minutes and then remove the top pan.

In a shallow dish, combine muffin mix with flour, then stir in eggs, milk and melted butter. Season the mix with chili powder, cumin, cayenne and scallions. The batter will be a thick, sticky biscuit dough. Place a hot dog in the bowl of batter and swoosh it around to coat it. Remove coated dog to a nonstick cookie sheet and use your fingers to spread batter on any exposed dog spots. Don&#39;t coat it too thick, just shy of 1/2-inch should do the trick. If it&#39;s too thick it will just slide off the dog while it&#39;s baking, leaving the dog exposed. If that happens don&#39;t sweat it, they will still taste great. Repeat until all 8 are coated. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until evenly deep brown all over. Serve the oven baked corn dogs with your favorite hot dog condiments. Serve with Sweet Relish Slaw Salad and with some baked or reduced-fat chips alongside the dogs. In the bottom of a medium, shallow bowl combine relish, vinegar, oil, garlic, bay and cloves. Let stand 5 minutes then fish out the garlic, bay and cloves. Add cabbage salad and toss, let stand 10 to 20 minutes in the refrigerator.

Place the beans in a colander or strainer and rinse well under cold running water. Drain. Place the beans in a large stockpot or bowl, add the water (it should cover the beans by 2 inches) and soak for 8 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.<br> Heat the oil in a very large stockpot over medium-low heat. Add the bacon and saute, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 15 minutes.<br> Add the onion, carrot, and garlic to the pot and sweat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft but not browned, about 10 minutes.<br> Drain the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with 8 cups stock and the bay leaves. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, uncovered, until the beans are tender and the vegetables have practically dissolved, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Stir the soup occasionally to make sure the beans aren&#39;t sticking to the bottom of the pot. If the soup becomes too thick, add additional stock or water. Most of the beans should keep their shape, but some will fall apart enough to thicken the soup.<br> Remove the pot from the heat and season with salt, pepper, Tabasco, dry sherry, and vinegar. Remove the bay leaves.<br> Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with any combination you like of sour cream, diced onion, fresh cilantro leaves, and chopped hard-cooked egg. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7981,&quot;California Asparagus Sandwich 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon olive oil 8 squares focaccia bread, 5x5 inches, or puffy pizza crust baked without toppings 1-1/2 cups (lightly packed) baby lettuces or arugula 1 cup roasted red bell pepper pieces 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced about 1/4-inch thick (may substitute regular mozzarella, provolone or mild Swiss) 16 cooked asparagus spears 4 slices pancetta or thick bacon cooked almost crisp and broken into 3-inch pieces Instructions: Have ingredients at room temperature. Make Lemon Aioli (flavored mayonnaise) by whisking together the lemon zest, juice and garlic, which has been slightly mashed with the salt (use a sharp knife tip on a cutting board). Whisk in the mayonnaise and olive oil. Spread on smooth side of each square of focaccia, using a generous 1/2 tablespoon. Divide remaining ingredients among 4 squares focaccia, layered in the order listed. Top with remaining 4 squares focaccia. Cut each sandwich in half into two triangles. Sandwiches can be served at room temperature or warm in a 450-degree oven a few minutes, especially if regular mozzarella was substituted for fresh. Sandwiches are not meant to be served hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Ros]&quot; 7982,&quot;Gravy from Roast Drippings 1 cup red wine 2 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable broth 1 bay leaf 5 to 6 black peppercorns Instructions: Remove roast from pan and pour off any fat. Place over high heat (use 2 burners if necessary) and deglaze pan with wine and broth, scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula. Once these solids are dissolved, pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3. At this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast. To create a gravy, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux. Return to a simmer, whisking constantly. Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce, but not a thicker one. Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool, it&#39;s a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 7983,&quot;Chicken Breast with Veloute Sauce 1 chicken breast, skin on (chef can remove if desired) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 3 cups chicken stock<br> 1 ounce clarified butter<br> 1 ounce all-purpose flour<br> Instructions: Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and sear the chicken for 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over, reduce the heat to medium and cook until done, about 5 more minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and let stand 5 minutes. In the pan that was used to cook the chicken, deglaze with the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Then lower the heat so that the stock just stays hot. Meanwhile, in a separate heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the clarified butter over a medium heat until it becomes frothy. Take care not to let it turn brown. With a wooden spoon, stir the flour into the melted butter a little bit at a time until it is fully incorporated, giving you a pale yellow paste called a roux. Heat the roux for another few minutes or so, until it has turned a light blonde color. This helps cook off the raw flour flavor. But since this is a white sauce, you don&#39;t want to let the roux get too dark. Using a wire whisk, slowly add the hot chicken stock to the roux, whisking vigorously to make sure it&#39;s free of lumps. Simmer until the total volume has reduced by about one-third, stirring frequently to make sure the sauce doesn&#39;t scorch at the bottom of the pan, about 30 minutes. Use a ladle to skim off any impurities that rise to the surface. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7984,&quot;Cheese-Stuffed Portobellos Nonstick cooking spray 4 6-inch portobello mushroom caps 4 cups spinach, chopped 1 cup breadcrumbs (preferably panko) 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 2 shallots (1 finely chopped, 1 thinly sliced) 1 large tomato, diced 3 tablespoons grated pecorino romano cheese, plus shaved pecorino for topping 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup ricotta cheese 4 stalks celery, peeled and thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Mist a foil-lined broiler pan with cooking spray. Put the mushrooms gill-side down on the pan; broil 5 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the spinach, breadcrumbs, mozzarella, chopped shallot, tomato, 2 tablespoons each pecorino and olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a medium bowl. Remove the mushrooms from the broiler and turn them gill-side up on the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Mound the spinach filling on the mushrooms and top with the ricotta. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon pecorino and broil until the filling is heated through and the ricotta is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the celery, sliced shallot and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Top with shaved pecorino.

Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to soften but not brown, about 8 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water, the sugar and cl flakes. Cook the onions until almost all the liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 12 minutes. Add the apple cider vinegar and simmer until the marmalade is thick, stirring often, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cool. For the grilled sausages: Prepare a grill to medium-high heat. Brush the sausages with oil. Grill the sausages, turning them constantly, until golden and cooked through, or when an instant-read thermometer inserted in a sausage reads about 165 degrees F, about 14 minutes. Spread each baguette with the mustard. Place the grilled sausages on top of each baguette and top with the onion marmalade and Tomato Chutney. Boil a pot of water. Prepare a bowl of ice water. Cut the stem of the tomatoes using a paring knife. Slice a shallow X in the bottom end of the tomatoes. Plunge the tomatoes into the boiling water for a few seconds, using a slotted spoon. Transfer the tomatoes to the ice water. Remove the tomatoes and peel away the skin. Chop the tomatoes roughly. Pour the oil into a medium saucepan and heat over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, red wine vinegar and sugar and cook, stirring half way through the cooking time, until slightly thickened and the tomatoes have broken down, about 20 minutes. Add the herbs de Provence and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook the chutney, about 5 minutes. Let the chutney cool slightly before serving.

Remove 1/4 inch of the crust from the ends of the loaf, then cut the loaf crosswise into 4 even pieces. Use a fork to score one cut end and gently dig a square hole into each piece of bread to make a box, leaving a 1/2-inch layer of bread around the walls and bottom (see Cook&#39;s Note). Save the removed crumbs for another use.<br> Microwave the butter and a large pinch of salt in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 1 minute. Brush the bread boxes inside and out with the melted butter. Put 1 slice of cheese at the bottom of each bread box. Put the boxes open-side up on a baking sheet and bake until the cheese melts and the inside of the bread is lightly browned and crispy in parts, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Season the pork chops liberally with salt and pepper. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the pork chops and cook until browned on both sides and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Rest for 5 minutes then slice thinly against the grain. Layer each bread box with 4 dill pickle chips, a quarter of the sliced pork, 1 1/2 teaspoons mustard, 4 more dill pickle chips, 2 slices deli ham and top with 1 additional slice of cheese.

Add the onions and thyme to the skillet with the remaining butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the sherry to the skillet; cook until evaporated. Add the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce and return to a simmer. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half and the onions are caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Trim the ends off the bread loaf. Cut the bread on an angle into 12 slices, leaving the bottom of the loaf intact. (You can position chopsticks along the long sides of the bread to keep from cutting all the way through the loaf.) Transfer to the baking sheet. Brush the reserved melted butter between the bread slices and all over the loaf. Set aside about one-third of the onions. Fill every other slice of the loaf with the remaining onions, starting with the first slice. Fold the roast beef and tuck into the onion-filled slices, along with the cheese. Top the loaf with the reserved onions and any onion juices. Bake until the cheese is browned and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Pull apart or slice into individual sandwiches.

Line two sheet pans with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.<br> In a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, beat the egg whites on low to medium-low speed until they form soft peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and beat in the sugar 1 teaspoon at a time. Beat until the mixture is glossy and thick; it will resemble marshmallow cream.<br> Remove the bowl from the mixer and scrape any meringue off the whisk. Sift the cornstarch over the meringue, add the vinegar and vanilla, and gently fold until everything is incorporated.<br> Dip a very large spoon into warm water. Let excess water drip off, then scoop into the meringue. Drop the meringue onto one of the prepared pans; the shape of the spoon is oval, so when you place the meringue on the sheet pan, it should resemble a jumbo egg. Continue scooping, rinsing the spoon in warm water after every scoop for neat, smooth meringues.<br> Bake the meringues into the oven and bake until they are very light and dry and easily lift off the pan, at least 90 minutes. If they start to color slightly, lower the oven by at least 25 degrees F. Don&#39;t rush the meringues; when in doubt, leave them in longer. Turn off the oven (don&#39;t open the door). Let the meringues cool slowly in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the pans from the cool oven. The meringues are ready to be filled when totally cooled.<br> Fit a piping bag with a doughnut-filling tip or a plain number 5, 6 or 7 tip.

Remove any that you find with a needle-nosed pliers or tweezers. With a sharp knife cutting across the width of the salmon, divide it into 4 equal portions. Lightly salt the salmon and let sit a couple minutes; this will help you get crispy skin.<br> Heat a 2-count, about 2 tablespoons, of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is almost smoking. Season the salmon with pepper, and rub about 1 1/2 tablespoons butter on the skin side of each fillet. Add the salmon to the pan, skin-side down. To get super crispy skin, cook the salmon almost to completion, about 6 minutes.<br> Flip the salmon and cook until flesh side is nicely seared, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Transfer the salmon to a platter and serve with the Smashed Potatoes. Put the potatoes into a large pot, cover them with cold water, and add a large pinch of salt. If they&#39;re large, cut them in half. Bring to a boil and simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain. Stick a fork into the potatoes, 1 at a time, lift them out of the colander and peel with a paring knife. Toss the potatoes into a bowl and roughly crush them. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.<br> Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil with the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the butter melts.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the tomatoes out on the prepared baking sheet. Smash the garlic cloves with your knife blade; mince, sprinkle with some salt, and then smear to a paste using flat side of the knife. Whisk together the oil, herbs and garlic; drizzle over the tomatoes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast the tomatoes until soft and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Set aside. For the scones: Adjust the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper in a large bowl. In a second bowl, whisk together the 3 eggs, cream and hot sauce until combined. Cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add the wet ingredients and the cheese and ham to the dry ingredients; mix until a dough just comes together--the dough should be wet. Transfer the dough to a generously floured work surface and pat out to a 1-inch thickness. Cut into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit cutter; transfer the rounds to the prepared baking sheet, spaced a few inches apart. Re-roll the scraps and cut more scones. Beat the remaining 1 egg with a touch of heavy cream; brush the scones with the egg wash. Bake the scones until golden brown on top and bottom, about 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a baking rack to cool completely. To assemble the McScones: Slice the scones in half horizontally. Put 2 or 3 roasted tomato slices on the bottom halves. Heat the butter and oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Fry the eggs, in batches if needed, until the whites are set and the yolks still runny, about 2 to 3 minutes; season with a little salt and pepper just before done. Using the biscuit cutter, cut the eggs around the yolks to make rounds that fit the scones. Set the eggs on the scones, atop the tomato slices; add a bit of watercress, and finish up with the top half of each scone. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 8005,&quot;Herbed Ricotta Bruschettas 2 cups ricotta, store-bought or homemade (recipe follows) 3 tablespoons minced scallions, white and green parts (2 scallions) 2 tablespoons minced fresh dill 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 round sourdough bread Good olive oil 1 whole garlic clove, cut in half Green Salad Vinaigrette (recipe follows) 4 cups whole milk 2 cups heavy cream 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons good white wine vinegar 8 to 10 cups salad greens or mesclun mix 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 lemons) 1/2 cup good olive oil 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Prepare a charcoal grill with hot coals or turn a gas grill to medium-high heat. Combine the ricotta, scallions, dill, chives, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and set aside. Cut the bread in half and cut each half into 6 thick slices to make 12 slices total. When the grill is hot, brush the bread with olive oil and grill on each side for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from the grill and rub each slice of bread with the cut side of the garlic clove. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and spread with the herbed ricotta. Serve 2 warm slices per person with the green salad on the side. Set a large sieve over a deep bowl. Dampen 2 layers of cheesecloth with water and line the sieve with the cheesecloth. Pour the milk and cream into a stainless-steel or enameled pot such as Le Creuset. Stir in the salt. Bring to a full boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar. Allow the mixture to stand for 1 minute until it curdles. It will separate into thick parts (the curds) and milky parts (the whey). Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined sieve and allow it to drain into the bowl at room temperature for 20 to 25 minutes, occasionally discarding the liquid that collects in the bowl. The longer you let the mixture drain, the thicker the ricotta. (I tend to like mine on the thicker side, but some prefer it moister.) Transfer the ricotta to a bowl, discarding the cheesecloth and any remaining whey. Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The ricotta will keep refrigerated for 4 to 5 days. Place the salad greens in a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pour enough dressing on the salad to moisten. Toss and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 8006,&quot;Pat&#39;s Spicy Fried Wings 1 tablespoon seasoning salt 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 teaspoons black pepper 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons poultry seasoning 1 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning 6 whole chicken wings, cut in 1/2 at the joint 2 eggs 2 tablespoons hot sauce 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 cups all-purpose flour Vegetable oil, to fry Dipping Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons horseradish 1/4 tablespoon chili sauce 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a small bowl whisk together seasoning salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, cayenne pepper, poultry seasoning, and lemon pepper.

Add the corn and chicken stock. Cook until the corn is cooked and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool slightly, and then place the corn in a blender and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Cook&#39;s Note: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. For the salsa: In a small mixing bowl, combine the corn, lemon juice, vinegar, cilantro, scallion and red peppers. Season with salt and pepper.<br> For the oysters: Set three shallow bowls next to one another. Place the flour in the first bowl, then place the buttermilk and egg in the next bowl and place the cornmeal in the last bowl. Use a fork to whisk the egg into the buttermilk. Dredge the oysters, one at a time, in the bowl with the flour, shaking to remove any excess. Then dip the oyster into the bowl with buttermilk. Once covered in the egg wash, place the oysters into the cornmeal.<br> Set a large saute pan over medium heat and add the olive oil.

Cook for about 30 seconds, until the crpe is lightly browned. Using a spatula, carefully flip the crpe to cook the other side, about 30 seconds. Slide the crpe onto a plate. Cool slightly, then transfer to a clean, dry surface. Arrange crpes in a single layer to cool completely. Repeat with remaining batter, buttering pan occasionally. If crpes are browning too quickly, reduce heat to medium. To make the frosting: In a chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth, 30 seconds. Switch to the whisk attachment and add the heavy cream, sour cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Whip on medium speed until almost stiff peaks form (tips almost stand straight). To make the cake: On a platter, place one crpe and spread with a generous 1/4 cup of the frosting. Top with a crpe, then evenly spread on a generous 1/4 cup of the chocolate-hazelnut spread. Top with sliced strawberries. Repeat with the remaining crpes, frosting, chocolate-hazelnut spread, and sliced strawberries. Cover the cake and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. To serve, sprinkle the cake with powdered sugar. Top with whipped cream and the halved strawberries. Use a serrated knife to slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 8014,&quot;Salted Caramel Samoas Cannoli One 15-ounce container whole-milk ricotta cheese 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 12 Samoas? or Caramel deLites? cookies, finely chopped<br> 1/2 cup salted caramel sauce<br> 10 ounces dark melting chocolate<br> 12 pre-made cannoli shells<br> 1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut, toasted<br> Instructions: Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth and place over a small bowl.

Roll the dough into a 12-inch diameter circle that is about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 10-inch tart pan by rolling the dough around the rolling pin. Line the tart pan with the dough. Dock the dough and set aside. Make the almond cream. Spread a layer of almond cream inside the tart. Pit and quarter the fresh apricots. Arrange them on top of the almond cream by standing them on end. Sprinkle slivered almonds on top of the tart and bake for about 40 minutes. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Place the almond flour, cake flour and cold butter in the mixing bowl and mix until combined. Add the salt and powdered sugar. Mix until combined. Add the egg and mix until combined. Shape into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for about 1 hour to chill dough. Roll the dough to the desired size on a lightly floured work surface. Baking instructions vary and will be specified in any recipe using this dough. The dough will keep, well wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for 1 week or in the freezer for 1 month. Thaw the dough in the refrigerator until ready to use. If you want to store the dough already rolled into a tart pan, wrap it in plastic wrap. It is possible to buy almond flour (use 1 cup if you do) but it just as easy to make your own. Place the slivered almonds (no skin preferred) and granulated sugar into the food processor. Pulse until the almonds and sugar reach the consistency of flour. It is best to pulse because the heat of the blade will cause the release of the oil from the almonds. Mix in the flour. Mix in the butter. Add the egg and mix until the mixture becomes light and creamy. Do not overmix or the gluten in the flour will overdevelop and the almond cream will lose its delicate texture when baked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 8016,&quot;Bok Choy Salad 1 medium head bok choy, diced 4 green onions, sliced 1 (3-ounce) package ramen noodles 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon tamari Instructions: Combine bok choy and onions and chill.

Form 7-ounce balls with the dough and roll lightly with flour. Put them in a proof box at room temperature for 2 hours after you roll it. Place the balls side by side and put a cover on it that is very tight so no air is let in, otherwise it will get dry. For the meat: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute the onions in 4 tablespoons of the butter until they are golden brown. Then add in all the allspice, salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Then add the meat and continue to stir to avoid clumps. Cook the meat for 15 to 20 minutes. In another pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter until hot. Add the pine nuts and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes, stirring so the pine nuts do not burn. After the pine nuts are cooked, pour on top of the cooked meat. Let the meat cool off at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Beat the eggs until well combined and light in color, about 5 minutes. Mix the sugar and flour together and gradually add to the eggs using low speed. Add the corn syrup, vanilla and salt and blend well, again using low speed. Fold the nuts in by hand and pour the mixture into the prepared pie crusts. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for 1 hour longer. The pie will rise up and form cracks on the top, and the filling will be set when baking is complete. Remove pie and let it cool before cutting. Combine the butter, shortening, 2 cups of the cake flour, and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. Blend together. Stop mixer, scrape the sides and add remaining 2 cups of cake flour and remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour. Blend to combine completely. Mix sugar and salt into 1/4 cup of the water and add it to the flour mixture. Blend briefly and add the remaining water if needed. The dough should not be overworked and should make a solid piece when held in your hand. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured smooth surface and knead it several times. Divide the dough into portions and flatten it. Wrap unused dough in plastic. Roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Re-roll any scraps for a second pie crust. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Prick bottom and sides of pastry with fork. Bake 12 minutes or until light brown.

Season the oxtails with salt and pepper and dust each piece with a little flour. Sear the oxtails in a cast iron casserole with a little oil until golden brown. Transfer to a perforated pan or a rack set over a plate to drain the extra fat. In a braising pan, sweat the mirepoix in a little oil. Add the tomato paste and cook together with the vegetables. Deglaze the pan with the sherry and a little of the red wine, stirring and scraping the pan to release the stuck-on flavor. Add the remaining red wine, bring to a simmer, and let the alcohol evaporate. Add the veal stock and bay leaf. Put the oxtails in the sauce, cover the pan, and braise until the meat falls easily off the bone with a fork, about 2 1/2 hours. When cool enough to handle but still warm, separate the meat from bones. Strain and reserve the braising jus. To make the bread stuffing: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large pan over medium high heat and add the bread cubes, tossing them until they&#39;re toasted. Transfer to a large bowl. Pour the milk in a dish and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Pour the milk over the bread and let it get completely absorbed. Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of sunflower oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until they&#39;re softened but have not taken on any color. Add them to the bread mixture. Let the mixture cool to body temperature and then add the egg yolks. Add parsley. Mix everything together and put in a pastry bag. To make the crepinette: Line the inside of a 5-inch ring mold with caul fat. Place 3 ounces of the braised oxtail meat along the inside of the mold and pipe some bread stuffing in the remaining space inside the mold. Close the crepinette with overlapping caul fat, making sure the crepinette is holding together. Place the crepinette in a pan and cover with some of the reserved braising jus. Cook simmering over medium heat, until fully cooked through. To make the liquid Yukon gold mash: Put the potatoes in a saucepan with the stock, water, thyme, rosemary, and bacon. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender. Drain the potatoes. Peel them and process through a potato ricer while still hot. Work in the cold butter and hot milk to get a creamy and runny mash. To make the truffle jus: Cook the remaining braising jus in a saucepan until reduced by one-third, continually degreasing the upcoming fat. Add the chopped black truffle and truffle jus. To serve: Put a generous spoonful of the liquid Yukon gold mash in the middle of the plate. Place the crepinette on top and drizzle the truffle jus on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Ribera del Duero]&quot; 8038,&quot;Stuffed Pork Tenderloin 2 pounds pork tenderloin Salt Freshly cracked black pepper 2 cups medium diced mango 2 to 3 cups medium diced pineapple 3/4 cup finely grated fresh coconut (save the milk) 1/2 cup torn cilantro leaves 1/2 cup minced red onions 3 cloves minced garlic 1/4 cup minced chives 2 tablespoons honey Coconut milk, as needed Instructions: Preheat a grill to 375 degrees F.
