Adjust the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. In a food processor, combine the roasted vegetables, cilantro, vinegar, adobo sauce, coriander, cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Process until evenly combined but still with some texture, similar to crushed canned tomatoes. Pour into a large saucepot and stir in the tomato puree and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, just to combine the flavors. Remove from the heat and season with salt. Place the shredded chicken in a bowl, mix with 2 cups of the enchilada sauce and let marinate for at least 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt as needed. Meanwhile, wrap the tortillas in foil and place in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until softened. Spread 2 cups of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch broiler-proof baking dish. Remove the tortillas from the oven. To the center of each tortilla, add 1/4 cup of the marinated chicken, a sprinkle of Monterey Jack, and some enchilada sauce. Wrap the tortillas around the filling (they should be about the size of a cigar) and place seam-side down in the baking dish. Pour the remaining sauce evenly over the enchiladas. Sprinkle with the remaining Monterey Jack and the olives. Bake on the center rack for 20 minutes, until the sauce just begins to bubble up around the edges. Turn the oven to broil and cook until the cheese has browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes. Serve the enchiladas with queso fresco, sour cream, avocado, cilantro and lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72428,&quot;It&#39;s Just Pork...and Chutney 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons chili powder 2 tablespoons ground cumin 2 tablespoons fennel seeds 2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 pork tenderloins (1 package contains 2 loins) Olive oil, for searing Cranberry Chutney, for serving, recipe follows 1 yellow onion, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 tablespoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon cl flakes Pinch ground clove One 6-ounce bag dried cranberries (see Cook&#39;s Note) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the cinnamon, chili, cumin, fennel, paprika, pepper and salt. Rub each pork loin generously with the seasoning blend. Let the pork sit 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature. Preheat a large, oven-proof saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Place the pork tenderloins in the pan and sear the pork on all sides until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place the seared pork into the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer reads 155 to 160 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the tenderloins from the oven, place them on a plate or cutting board, tent with foil and allow the meat to rest 10 minutes. Cut the pork into 1-inch thick slices and spoon liberal amounts of Cranberry Chutney over the pork and enjoy! In a medium saucepot, add the onions, garlic, 1/2 to 3/4 cup water, vinegar, sugar, ginger, allspice, fennel, cl and cloves. Bring the mixture to a boil. Add the cranberries to the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the mixture until the cranberries have reconstituted and start softening and breaking down. If too much liquid evaporates, just add more water and keep cooking until you achieve the desired consistency. The chutney should be on the firmer/chunkier side of a jelly. Once the chutney is cooked, season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72429,&quot;Lemon Icebox Pie 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature 1 (14-ounce) can condensed milk 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoons lemon zest 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 prepared graham cracker crust Instructions: Combine the cream cheese, milk, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla in a large bowl. Mix on medium speed until smooth. Pour into the pie crust. Refrigerate overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72430,&quot;Tuile Biscuit 2 ounces flour 2 ounces powdered sugar 1 egg white 2 fluid ounces melted butter Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Into a large bowl, sift together the flour and sugar. In a small bowl, mix the egg whites and butter together. Slowly add to dry ingredients. Mix so all lumps are removed. Using a silicone mat, lay out a stencil (whatever shape you desire), and spread batter with a pallet knife so the batter is the same thickness as the stencil. Place in the freezer for 3 to 4 minutes and remove. Run a knife around the inside edge of the stencil, making sure not to alter the shape of the biscuit. Bake on a sheet pan for 4 to 6 minutes until lightly brown around the edges. Remove from the sheet pan with a metal spatula, as biscuit will continue to bake on hot pan. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 72431,&quot;Muffin Tin Cranberry Crumbles Nonstick cooking spray, for the muffin tin and offset spatula 4 cups frozen cranberries (12 to 14 ounces)<br> 1/2 cup dried cranberries 1 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3/4 cup pecans, finely chopped<br> 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, lightly packed 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes<br> 1 large egg, at room temperature, lightly beaten<br> Instructions: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Liberally spray a standard 12-cup nonstick muffin tin with cooking spray and set aside. Combine the frozen cranberries, dried cranberries, 3/4 cup granulated sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a medium saucepan. Stir to combine, then cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the frozen cranberries start to burst, 8 to 10 minutes. Use the back of a rubber spatula to gently smash the cranberries, then stir again to combine. Set aside to cool slightly; the mixture will thicken up as it cools. Combine the flour, pecans, dark brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, salt and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl. Stir to combine, then use a pastry blender or 2 butter knives to cut the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Use a fork to stir in the egg, then use your hands to work the mixture until a crumbly dough forms.<br> Scoop 2 slightly heaping tablespoons of the dough into each cup of the prepared muffin tin, then use your hands to press the dough down until it forms a flat crust that comes slightly up the sides. Evenly divide the cranberry mixture among the 12 muffin cups (it will be about 2 heaping tablespoons each). Use your hands to crumble the remaining dough into large streusel pieces, then sprinkle evenly on top of the cranberry layer in each cup, leaving the edges slightly exposed.<br> Bake, rotating the muffin tin halfway through, until the streusel is crispy and golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.<br> Cool the cookies completely in the muffin tin set on a cooling rack. Spray a small offset spatula liberally with cooking spray, then use it to loosen the edges of the cookies before carefully lifting them out of the muffin tin. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72432,&quot;Deviled Chicken Thighs Vegetable oil, for the baking sheet 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 cup Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 1/2 cups panko<br> 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives (or parsley) 2 teaspoons paprika 8 small bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 pounds), skin removed Kosher salt Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven; preheat to 425 degrees F. Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet.<br> Combine the butter and garlic in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave to melt the butter, about 1 minute. Whisk in the Dijon and 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne.<br> In another large bowl, combine the panko, Parmesan, chives, paprika and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Sprinkle the chicken thighs with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Dip the chicken in the mustard mixture to coat and roll in the panko on all sides. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet so the pieces do not touch. Bake on the center oven rack until the coating is browned and crispy and the chicken is no longer pink near the bone, about 40 minutes.<br> Transfer to a large platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 72433,&quot;Gravlax and Mustard Sauce 5-6 pound side of boneless filet of salmon, skin left on 2 red onions, sliced wafer thin bunch fresh dill, leaves pulled off the stem, chopped 1/4 cup salt 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup green peppercorns, coarsely chopped 1 tablespoon juniper berries, lightly crushed juice of 2 lemons mixed with 1 teaspoon vanilla Instructions: With tweezers or pliers, pull out the intermuscular bones of salmon. In a non-reactive dish (glass, porcelain, enamel or stainless) large enough to accommodate the salmon without crowding, scatter half of the sliced onions and sprinkle half of the dill on the onions. In a small mixing bowl combine the salt, sugar, peppercorns and juniper berries and mix them well. Rub half of this mixture into the flesh side of the salmon and spoon rub half the juice and vanilla on the flesh; set the salmon, flesh side down on the dill and onions. Rub remaining salt mixture into skin side of salmon and remaining lemon juice mixture over that. Lay remaining dill on salmon, then cover with last of onion slices.

Cream the butter and sugar on medium speed for about 2 minutes.<br> (We are cutting little holes in the butter with the abrasive sugar, and those little holes will expand from the leavening properties of the baking powder during baking so we can get that soft cakey texture for the cookies.)<br> Scrape down the bowl with a spatula, add the eggs one at a time, and mix on medium until incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat until blended.<br> Turn off the mixer and add the flour mixture. Mix on low speed until the flour disappears.<br> Use a number 40 (1 1/2 tablespoons) scoop to portion out your cookies, then roll the portioned dough into small balls. Roll the balls in the sifted powdered sugar, and place on the sheet pan at least 2-inches apart.<br> Bake for 13 to14 minutes, until the surface of the cookies have cracked and puffed up. The cookies will not be browned. Cool the cookies on a wire rack and serve.<br> Creaming the butter and sugar together is such an important step.

Saute the shallots for 3 to 5 minutes, or until slightly golden. Add the garlic and chiles and saute, stirring constantly, for 1 minute more. Add the cumin, paprika and cayenne and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes more, until the aromas are released but the spices are not burned. Remove pan from heat and add lime juice, butter to taste, salt and pepper. Set the mixture aside while you preheat a broiler or prepare a grill for highheat cooking. Cut lobsters in half lengthwise and season with salt and pepper. Grill at high heat for approximately 8 minutes, shell side down. Then reduce the heat or move the lobsters away from the hottest part of the fire, rotating them 180 degrees to help them cook evenly, but keeping the shell side down. Grill at low heat for 5 minutes more. Spoon the spice mixture over the lobsters at the end of grilling for the last few minutes. Serve immediately with plenty of lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 72455,&quot;Warm Roasted Red Beet Tarte Tatin 4 large red beets, washed and trimmed 16 ounces commercial puff pastry (thawed if frozen) or homemade puff pastry 8 ounces unsalted butter 1 cup sugar Serving suggestion: Baby arugula salad in hazelnut vinaigrette, and goat cheese or Herbed Chevre, recipe follows. 1 1/2 cups fresh chevre, warmed to room temperature 1 teaspoon finely minced shallots 1/4 teaspoon finely minced garlic 2 tablespoons white truffle oil* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup finely minced mixed fresh herbs (parsley, chives, thyme, tarragon) Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap the beets in foil and roast them until they are easily pierced with a knife, about 1 1/2 hours. Allow the beets to cool slightly then peel them using a paring knife. Cut off the stem and root end of each beet, leaving each with 2 flat sides. Slice the beets in half horizontally creating 8 disks. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, punch out a circle from each half. Set aside the 8 beet circles. Turn the oven up to 425 degrees F. Roll out the pastry very slightly so that it is an even thickness. Cut the pastry into 8 (3 1/4-inch) rounds. Wrap the rounds in plastic and chill well. Prepare the caramel (see Cook&#39;s Note below). Place the pie tins on a large baking sheet. Combine the butter and sugar in a heavy-bottomed stainless steel pan. Melt the mixture over high heat. Cook the caramel until it is almost chestnut brown then remove it from the heat. Quickly but very carefully ladle or pour enough hot caramel into each pie tin to just cover the bottom. Allow the caramel to cool and harden. Slice each beet round diagonally 3 or 4 times and divide the slices between the tart tins. Cover each tin with a round of puff pastry. Bake the tarts in the oven until the pastry is puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. Remove the tarts from the oven and allow them to cool for about 5 minutes (the caramel should still be hot and soft but not molten?if it cools too long just reheat the tarts long enough to melt the caramel). Carefully turn out each tart onto a plate, letting the juice and caramel run onto the plate. The pastry should be on the bottom and the red beet on top. Serve warm, garnishing each plate with a quenelle of goat cheese or Herbed Chevre. Cook&#39;s note: Making the caramel for the bottom of the tart pans is a dangerous process. The caramel gets very hot and can cause serious burns. Be careful! To clean caramel-coated pots and spoons: Boil water in the pot and submerge spoons and ladles. The caramel will soften and is then easy to wash away. Again, be careful. <em>Available at gourmet stores Combine the chevre, shallots, garlic, truffle oil, and olive oil in a food processor or mixer. Pulse or mix just until the ingredients are combined. By hand, fold in the mixed herbs. Transfer the cheese to a bowl, cover with plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.</em> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72456,&quot;Microwave Artichokes 2 globe artichokes, about 8 to 12 ounces each Melted butter and lemon wedges if you are serving them hot Vinaigrette or salad dressing, if you are serving them chilled Instructions: Cut off stem and with a sharp knife trim the base so artichokes sit flat. Make a cut across the top of the leaves, parallel to the base. With scissors, trim the leaves so they have straight edges. To cook conventionally, bring a large shallow pan of salted water to a boil. Submerge artichokes, cover tops with a heat proof heavy plate to keep them submerged and cook for 35 to 45 minutes or until a leaf in middle can be pulled out easily. Drain them upside down so water runs out. To cook in microwave, wrap each one individually in microwavable plastic wrap and set them in a round plate. Microwave for 10 minutes or until a center leaf can be pulled out easily. Remove plastic wrap (carefully; it will be hot). Serve as is, with each person pulling out a leaf and dipping it in melted butter, or remove cone of dinner leaves in one fell swoop and reserve them for later. With a small spoon scoop out choke. Replace cone of leaves, upside down and serve with melted butter seasoned with lemon or vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 72457,&quot;Chicken With Arugula Pesto Kosher salt 6 ounces orecchiette (about 1 1/2 cups) 1/2 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into pieces 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 3 cups baby arugula 1/2 cup firmly packed fresh parsley 2 tablespoons almonds or hazelnuts, toasted 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 4 small skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds) 2 medium tomatoes, halved 2 teaspoons whole-wheat breadcrumbs Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.

Add the eggs and olive oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Beat the eggs with a fork, then use the fork to break the wall of the well and incorporate the flour into the eggs. Gather the dough into a ball; don&#39;t worry if there are lumps. Using the heels of your hands, push the dough away from you, then fold it back over itself and push again (put your whole body into it!). Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and supple, 10 to 15 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at least 1 hour at room temperature. For the filling: Drizzle olive oil into a large deep pan. Add the pancetta, place over medium-low heat and cook until crisp. Add the garlic and cremini, oyster and shiitake mushrooms, season with salt and saute until the mushrooms are soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Add the white wine and let cook until completely reduced. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Mix the ricotta Parmigiano-Reggiano and , taleggio in a large bowl. Stir in the mushroom mixture, eggs and parsley and season with salt. Transfer the filling to a large pastry bag and refrigerate if not using immediately. Cut the dough into four pieces. Flatten one piece slightly, then run it through the widest setting on a pasta roller twice, dusting with flour in between if it feels sticky. Fold the length of dough into thirds and run it through the roller two to three more times. Continue running the dough through the roller, reducing the width setting between each run, until you reach the second-to-last setting and the dough is about 1/16 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Layer half of the dough sheets between parchment paper, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 month (you&#39;ll only need half of the dough for the ravioli recipe). For the ravioli: Place the lengths of dough on a floured surface. Lightly brush the lower half of each strip (the part closest to you) with water. Snip the corner off the pastry bag; pipe 1-inch balls of filling, 2 inches apart, onto the lower half of each strip. Fold the dough over the filling to meet the bottom edge. Press around each ball of filling with your index fingers, making sure there are no air bubbles. Cut out the ravioli using a 2-to-3-inch round fluted cutter. Pinch around the cut edges of the raviolis and transfer to a baking sheet dusted with semolina. For the sauce: Add chicken stock and butter to a large deep pan, season with salt and cook until the sauce is thickened, reduced by half and looks velvety. Season with more salt, if necessary. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil; add the ravioli and cook 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer with a skimmer or slotted spoon to the pan with the sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, shaking the pan. Sprinkle in the sage and remove from the heat. Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano and swirl to combine.

Add a few drops each of green and yellow food coloring and mix gently with a pastry brush. Do not fully mix; you want to have a few shades of green in the dish. Lay out the wafer paper on a piece of parchment lightly coated with cooking spray. Brush with the food coloring mixture to fully cover, painting darker shades of green in some spots. Let dry until crisp, at least 2 hours. Coat a 1 1/2-quart ovenproof bowl and 3 muffin cups with cooking spray. Prepare the cake mix as directed; fill the muffin cups with batter, then pour the rest into the bowl. Bake at 325 degrees F, 15 minutes for the cupcakes and 45 to 50 minutes for the bowl cake. Let cool. Make the croutons: Cut the cupcakes into 3/4-inch squares. Toast under the broiler until lightly browned; set aside. Remove the bowl cake and cut in half horizontally with a long serrated knife. Spread frosting on the bottom half and cover with the top half. Place the bowl cake in a salad bowl that&#39;s slightly larger than the cake. Frost the top of the cake. Reserve 1/2 cup frosting for the dressing. Tear the green-tinted wafer paper into small pieces and arrange on top of the cake; reserve a few pieces for the dressing. Shave the white chocolate into thin shards with a vegetable peeler. Sprinkle the white chocolate and cake croutons on top of the cake. Melt the reserved frosting in the microwave until pourable. Crumble some reserved green wafer paper into the frosting to look like herbs; stir, then pour into a salad dressing bottle. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 72474,&quot;Cranberry Knots Basic Dinner-Roll Dough, recipe follows 1/2 cup finely chopped dried cranberries<br> 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Nonstick cooking spray All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1/2 cup whole milk 3 tablespoons sugar 1 1/4 -ounce packet active dry yeast 4 1/4 to 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 large eggs, lightly beaten Mix-ins (herbs, spices, cheese, etc.) Vegetable oil or cooking spray, for the bowl Instructions: Make the Basic Dinner-Roll Dough, using the cranberries, lemon zest and nutmeg as the mix-ins. Let rise as directed. Lightly coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Lightly flour the top of the dough and pat into a rectangle. Cut the dough into 24 equal pieces with a bench scraper or chef&#39;s knife. Roll each piece into a 7- to 8-inch-long rope. Tie each rope into a knot. Arrange on the prepared baking sheets. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let stand until puffy, about 45 minutes. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Brush the knots with the beaten egg. Bake, switching and rotating the baking sheets halfway through, until the rolls are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Warm the milk and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan or in the microwave until very warm (110 degrees F). Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; mix in the sugar, yeast and 1 cup flour until combined but still lumpy. Let stand until the mixture is very bubbly, about 30 minutes. Add the butter, salt and 2 cups flour; mix on medium speed until smooth and elastic, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in the eggs until combined, scraping the bottom and side of the bowl as needed. Add 1 1/4 cups flour and the mix-ins, if using; mix until the dough is smooth and starts to gather into a loose ball, about 4 minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky; if it&#39;s too wet, add the remaining 1/4 cup flour. Lightly oil a large bowl; scrape the dough into the bowl and turn to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72475,&quot;Date Bran Jingle Balls 2 cups bran flakes cereal 3/4 cup whole pitted dates 1/2 cup pecans, toasted 3 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened 2 teaspoons brandy, orange liqueur or orange juice 1/2 cup finely chopped nuts, date sugar, coconut or toasted wheat germ Instructions: Trisha Kruse, an administrative assistant, created quick, easy, no-bake date-nut balls to fill that special niche in your holiday repertoire.

With wire-mesh deep frying basket or other 1/4-inch metal screen, gently separate eggs from egg sack over bowl, by rubbing sack along screen. Take care not to scrape membrane from the egg sack, even if it means leaving some eggs behind. Pour brine mixture over eggs and allow to soak 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Soaking times for other salmon species: Sockeye or Red: 6 minutes; Pink or Humpy: 8 minutes; Coho or Silver: 10 minutes; King or Chinook: 14 minutes). While eggs soak, use tweezers to remove bits of membrane and broken eggshells. When soaking is complete, pour eggs into colander to drain. Rinse eggs quickly with cold water and drain for a few minutes. Cover colander with plastic wrap, place over bowl, allowing it to continue draining in refrigerator. After 8 to 12 hours, transfer the now-sticky eggs into glass bowl. Gently fold in just enough olive oil to make the individual eggs shiny and slick. Serving Suggestions: Salmon or ?red? caviar prepared this way is much less salty than the commercial variety, allowing the sweet flavor of the fresh roe to emerge. Because of the lower salt levels however, it should be refrigerated and consumed within 3 to 4 days. Its mild flavor lends itself to serving with cream cheese and crackers. A traditional favorite is salmon caviar atop celery sticks stuffed with cream cheese. Salmon caviar is delightful when added to salads with creamy herb or ranch-style dressing. This mild version of salmon caviar will be a welcome alternative to the more strongly flavored ?ikura? salmon eggs used in Japanese sushi or sashimi. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 72482,&quot;Cuban-Style Orange Citrus Grilled Mahi-Mahi Four 4-ounce mahi-mahi fillets Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup Food Network Kitchen?

In a medium saucepan scald the milk with 1 of the vanilla beans. Split vanilla bean. Beat the milk very gradually into the egg mixture. Return the mixture to the pan and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for about 10 minutes, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. (Be careful not to let the mixture boil or the eggs will curdle). Remove vanilla bean. Place the pan over ice and stir occasionally to prevent a skin from forming. While the custard is cooling, beat the whites with the salt, 4 tablespoons of the sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar until stiff peaks are formed. In a 12-inch skillet, bring the water to a boil with the lemon juice. Lower the heat. Using a large kitchen spoon, carefully slide 8 scoops of meringue, one scoop at a time, into the simmering water. Poach the meringue for 1 1/2 minutes then turn over and poach for 2 minutes longer. Remove the meringues with a slotted spoon to a clean kitchen towel. For the caramel syrup: Place sugar and water in saucepan and swirl (shake pan with circular motion) over moderately high heat until the sugar has dissolved completely. Then let the sugar boil, swirling the pan occasionally, until the syrup turns a light, nut brown. This will take 3 to 4 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat as soon as the desired color is reached; if you let it darken too much, it will have a bitter taste. Pour 1/3 cup of water into the preceding caramel and simmer, stirring, until the caramel has dissolved. To assemble the dessert, pour the custard in a large serving bowl and float the meringues on top. Combine. Immediate drizzle the caramel syrup over the meringues and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 72494,&quot;Banana Peanut Butter Pancakes with Peanut Butter Syrup 3/4 cup Hungry Jack?

Blend on medium speed for 15 seconds, until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Scrape down the sides of the blender and pour in 3 tablespoons of melted butter. Blend it again for a second just to incorporate. Refrigerate the batter for 1 hour to let it rest. If the crepes are made immediately, they have a tendency to be rubbery; when you let the batter rest, the crepes have a better texture and a softer bite. Put an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat and brush with a little melted butter for added assurance. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and swirl it around so it covers the bottom evenly; pour back any excess. Cook for 30 to 45 seconds, until the crepe batter sets. Lightly bang the edge of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the crepe; then flip it and cook another 30 seconds. The art of flipping a crepe in the air takes practice, so make sure no one is looking when you get the first one going. If this intimidates you, use a heatproof rubber spatula to loosen and flip the crepe. The crepes should be pliable, not crisp, and lightly brown. Slide them onto a platter and continue making the crepes until all the batter is used. Cover the stack of crepes with a towel to keep them from drying out. This makes 10 crepes. Assembly: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Forming the blintzes is kind of like making burritos. Spoon 1/4 cup of the Cheese Filling along the lower third of the crepe. Fold the bottom edge away from you to just cover the filling; then fold the 2 sides in to the center. Roll the crepe away from you a couple of times to make a package, ending with the seam side down. Put an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Brush with melted butter. Pan-fry the blintzes for 2 minutes per side until crisp and golden. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 10 minutes so the egg in the filling cooks slightly and the cheese sets. Using a spatula, transfer the blintzes to serving plates. Spoon the Blueberry Sauce on top, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar, and serve right away. Serve with chopped banana and remaining Blueberry Sauce. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve. In a food processor, combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, confectioners&#39; sugar, lemon zest, and egg and blend until smooth. Chill the filling to firm it up a bit so it doesn&#39;t squirt out of the blintzes. Combine the butter, blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice in a small pot over medium-high heat. Bring up to a low boil and stir gently until the berries break down and release their natural juices. The consistency should remain a bit chunky. It will thicken up when it cools down slightly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72499,&quot;Killer Chilied Mushroom and Cashew Pate 4 tablespoons whole butter, unsweetened 1 pound mushrooms, sliced 1/2 large onion, minced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 1/2 teaspoons cl powder, or to taste 1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste 1 teaspoon coriander 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1 cup roasted cashews 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish Freshly ground black pepper to taste Instructions: In a medium skillet, over a high heat, melt the butter. Saute the mushrooms 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onion, cook until translucent then add the garlic for a minute or so, then the spices. Cook until the mixture is fairly dry. Cool. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade or blender, chop the cashews finely and slowly; add the oil to make a paste. Add the mushroom mixture and continue mixing until smooth. Taste and add more cl powder or salt, if necessary. Place in a serving bowl and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 72500,&quot;Roasted Sweet Garlic and Thyme Risotto with Toasted Almonds and Breadcrumbs 2 large heads garlic, whole and unpeeled Approximately 1 quart (1.1 litres) chicken stock 1 tablespoon olive oil 3 shallots or 2 medium onions, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 head celery, finely chopped 14 ounces (400 grams) risotto rice 2 wine glasses dry white vermouth or dry white wine Sea salt 1 good handful fresh thyme, leaves picked Freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 ounces (70 grams) butter 4 ounces (115 grams) freshly grated Parmesan 51/2 ounces (155 grams) shelled and peeled almonds, lightly crushed, cracked or chopped 2 handfuls coarse fresh bread crumbs Olive oil Instructions: For the basic risotto: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Roast the whole garlic heads on a dish in the oven until soft, about 30 minutes. Stage 1: Heat the stock. In a separate pan heat the olive oil, add the shallots or onions, garlic, and celery, and fry slowly for about 4 minutes. When the vegetables have softened, add the rice and turn up the heat. Stage 2: The rice will now begin to fry, so keep stirring it. After a minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring, it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavors will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence. Stage 3: Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of salt. Separate the roasted garlic cloves and squeeze out the sweet insides into the risotto. Add the thyme and black pepper to the risotto. Turn down the heat to a highish simmer, so the rice doesn&#39;t cook too quickly on the outside. Keep adding ladles of stock. Stage 4: Remove from the heat and add the butter and Parmesan. Stir gently. Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 to 3 minutes. This is the most important part of making the risotto, as this is when it becomes outrageously creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat as soon as possible while the risotto retains its perfect texture. In a frying pan toast the almonds and bread crumbs in a little olive oil until crisp and golden. Season with a little salt. Set to one side. Serve the risotto with the toasted almonds and bread crumbs sprinkled over the top. Lovely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 72501,&quot;Chocolate Chestnut Buche de Noel 7 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 small can, 250 grams, Chestnut Cream or Sweetened Chestnut Puree 1/3 cup rum Buttercream, recipe follows 1 Genoise sheet cake, baked Meringue Mushrooms, recipe follows Sprigs of fresh Pine or Holly Instructions: Place chocolate in a small bowl with 1/4 cup water. Set bowl in a pan of barely simmering water, stirring frequently until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool. Combine 1/2 cup, or more to taste, of chestnut cream into 1 slightly rounded cup of buttercream. Set aside. Assemble the Buche: Peel parchment liner from cake. Lift foil under cake and invert it onto a second sheet of foil. Remove the original foil, peeling away the browned genoise \skin\ stuck to it. Moisten the cake with the rum, using a pastry brush. Spread chestnut buttercream evenly over the cake. Roll the cake tightly, the long way, into a \log\ using the foil to aid you if necessary. Wrap log tightly in foil. Freeze until hard, or at least firm. The firmer the cake, the easier it will be to decorate. Log may be completed to this point, and kept frozen, up to 6 weeks. Stir chocolate mixture into remaining buttercream and refrigerate or freeze until needed. Finish and Decorate the Buche: Soften reserved chocolate buttercream and beat just until smooth. Unwrap the frozen log. Trim a fraction of an inch from each end to even the edges. Spread the log with most of the reserved chocolate buttercream. Do not frost the ends. Use a fork to texture the buttercream so that it resembles the bark of a tree. Dip a sharp knife in hot water, then wipe dry. Cut the diagonal \stump\ off each end of the log. Set stumps aside. Transfer log to a serving platter. Affix stumps to the log. Cover bare spots with buttercream. Use the fork to touch up the bark effect as necessary. Decorate with sprigs of pine and meringue mushrooms. Store in the refrigerator. For best flavor and texture, remove Buche from the refrigerator at least an hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 72502,&quot;Grilled Polenta Crackers with Roasted Pepper Salsa 1 tube, 24 ounces, prepared polenta, plain or sun-dried tomato flavor, cut into 1/2-inch slices 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it 3 roasted red peppers, drained well, 1 large jar, 16 ounces 1/2 cup calamata black olives, pitted 2 tablespoons capers 3/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, a couple of handfuls 1/2 white onion 1 clove garlic 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Instructions: Preheat grill pan to high.

Add the onions, season with salt, and bring the pan to a medium heat. Cook the onions, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the zucchini and season lightly with salt. Cook the onions and zucchini, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the beaten egg mixture (be sure that the mixture is smooth-no hunks of egg white). Using a small, heatproof rubber spatula, stir the zucchini mixture throughout the eggs. Don&#39;t worry about messing up the eggs, they will smooth out. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked egg mixture to run to the sides of the pan to create a wide, flat \scrambled egg. Swirl the pan around occasionally to loosen the eggs from the bottom of the pan. When the eggs are three-quarters of the way cooked through, sprinkle the middle third of the omelet with the grated fontina and most of the chives (save some chives for garnish). Turn off the heat. Using the spatula, fold the left third of the omelet over the cheese/chive mixture. Press gently to secure. Gently shake the pan to be sure that the omelet is loosened from the pan. Gently lay the right third of the omelet down on a serving plate and flip the other 2/3 of the omelet on top. The omelet should be folded like a letter. Garnish the top with the remaining chives and serve with Mesclun Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette. For the vinny: In a small mixing bowl, combine the vinegar and mustard. Mix until smooth. While mixing, start adding the oil into the vinegar/mustard mix drop by drop. Really-one drop at a time! One the drop has mixed in, add the next drop-this shouldn&#39;t really be an arm workout. When the mixture starts to look smooth and velvety, the oil can be added a little bit faster. Continue this way until all the oil has been added. When done, it should look very smooth, shiny, and homogeneous. Add the garlic and season with salt. Taste it, it should taste good! Season with salt again, if needed. To assemble the salad: Toss together the mesclun, cukes, tomatoes, and onions. Dress lightly with the vinaigrette. (You will not need to use all the dressing you made. Store the extra in the fridge and bring to room temperature when ready to use.) Season vinaigrette with salt, if needed. Taste! The salad should be very flavorful but not soggy. Plate the salad, piling it up so the lettuce looks fluffy and healthy and is adorned with the veggies. Using a veggie peeler, shave the cheese on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 72505,&quot;Sourdough, Wild Mushroom, and Bacon Dressing 1 1/4 pounds sourdough bread, crusts trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 12 cups) 1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, coarsely chopped 1/2 pound oyster mushrooms, coarsely chopped 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced 4 tablespoons canola oil, divided Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 pound slab bacon, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 large Spanish onion, finely diced 5 cloves garlic, finely chopped 3 to 5 cups homemade chicken stock or low sodium canned chicken broth 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the bread onto a large baking sheet (or 2 smaller baking sheets) in an even layer and bake, stirring a few times, until lightly golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove and let cool. Once cooled, put the cubes into a very large bowl. Increase the heat to 375 degrees F. Combine the mushrooms in a large baking dish or baking sheet, toss with 3 tablespoons of the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven, stirring several times, until soft and golden brown, about 25 minutes. While the mushrooms are roasting, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of the canola oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat in the saute pan and place back on the stove over high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add 3 cups of the chicken stock and the herbs, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer. Add the mushrooms to the bread, and then add the onion/stock mixture, egg, salt and pepper, and gently stir until combined. The dressing should be very wet, add more stock as needed.

Cream together with a sturdy spoon (or the paddle attachment) until smooth, then mix in the eggs and the extracts. Knead by hand (or switch to the dough hook attachment) and mix in the sponge and the flour. Add the water, as needed, to make a very soft dough. The finished dough should be very supple and soft, easy to knead, and not wet or sticky. It will take 10 to 12 minutes with the electric mixer and close to 15 minutes by hand to achieve this consistency. (Dough with high amounts of fat and sugar usually take longer to knead because the gluten requires more time to set up.) The finished dough should pass the windowpane test (see NOTE below) and register 77 to 88 degrees F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into two equal pieces. Form each of the pieces into a boule. Lightly oil two 9-inch pie pans and place 1 boule, seam side down, in each pan. Mist the dough with spray oil and loosely cover the pans with plastic wrap. Proof at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough fills the pans fully, doubling in size and overlapping the edges slightly. (If you only want to bake one loaf, you may retard the second in the fridge for 1 day, although it will take 4 to 5 hours to proof after it comes out of the refrigerator.) Very gently brush the loaves with egg wash. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Bake the loaves for 50 to 60 minutes, or until they register 190 F in the center. After 30 minutes, check the loaves and rotate 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. Because of the high amount of sugar, the dough will brown very quickly, but don&#39;t be fooled into thinking it is done. It will get darker as the center gradually catches up with the outside, but it will not burn. The final color will be a rich mahogany brown. Remove the bread from the pie pans and place on a rack to cool. The bread will soften as it cools, resulting in a very soft, squishy loaf. Allow the bread to cool for at least 90 minutes before slicing or serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72518,&quot;G.

While the beans are simmering, roast the peppers over an open flame, gently turning them so the skin is equally charred, and carefully ensuring not to overcook them. Remove from flame and cover with a damp towel for a few minutes. After this, the peppers are ready to be peeled. Once the skin has been removed, briefly dip them in water to ensure the peppers are clean and ready to be stuffed. For the filling: place the soaked black beans in a large pot or pressure cooker with the garlic and cover with water. Cook for 1 hour until beans are soft and creamy. Once the beans are cooked, puree them in a blender until they form a smooth paste. In a casserole dish, heat the oil or lard, add the chopped onions, and fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Next, add the mashed beans and fry them together with the onions. Season with salt and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes. Gently slice open the peppers, remove the seeds, and fill the cavity with the refried bean paste. Gently fold the pepper over and press gently to maintain its shape.

Season the beef brisket well with salt and pepper. Crush the thyme and rosemary together with a mortar and pestle and rub the herb mix into the beef, coating it evenly. Rub the beef well with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Heat a large saute pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes until the pan is nearly smoking. Add the beef to the hot pan and sear well on one side until browned before turning the beef over and searing the other side. When the beef has been well browned on both sides, remove from the pan and set aside. Add the onions to the saute pan and cook them until golden brown. Add the red wine to the onions and reduce by half. Pour the onions into a large heavy roasting pan and spread evenly across the bottom before putting the beef on the bed of onions. Add the carrots, garlic, hot beef/water and celery bundle to the beef in the roasting pan and place, uncovered, into the oven. All the combined liquid should rise only 2/3 as high as the meat is thick. Add additional water to maintain the braising liquid height. Cook for 1 hour before turning the beef over.

Set the squash on its side. Position a large chef&#39;s knife in the ridge between the wedges and use a heavy wooden kitchen spoon to pound it in a bit. Continue to pound and rock the knife blade to get through the tough stem and then split the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Cut along each rib to make wedges. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle the squash wedges with some salt and pepper and lay them flat in the pan. Sear until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Flip, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan, and continue cooking until the second side is deep golden brown, another 8 minutes or so. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the wedges are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. If they are getting too dark, cover them with foil. For the walnut-parsley pesto: Press out the cloves from the Roasted Garlic heads and add them to a food processor along with the walnuts, parsley and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Pulse until pulverized. With the motor running, drizzle in the walnut oil. Add the Parmesan and some lemon juice, and pulse until just combined. For the tahini sauce: Whisk together the tahini and lemon juice in a small bowl (it will look thick and slightly dry). Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the sauce is smooth but still thick (it should be pourable). Season with salt and pepper. To serve, arrange the squash on a platter, drizzle with tahini sauce, spoon over some pesto, and scatter the pomegranate seeds over the top. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the tops off the garlic heads, exposing the cloves but leaving the heads intact. Set the heads on a large piece of foil, drizzle with the walnut oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Wrap up the foil to make a pouch and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the garlic is soft and roasted, 35 to 40 minutes.

Simmer for 20 minutes until grapes are tender and skins have completely discolored. Using a potato masher squash the grapes to release all of the juices. Do not puree in a blender otherwise your gelee will be cloudy and pick up parts of the skin. Pour the mixture through a sieve over a large measuring cup or bowl with a spout and use the back of a ladle to firmly press the pulp - this will extract as much juice and flavor as possible. This should yield about 3 cups (24 ounces) of liquid. If it is more or less add water or pour out some of the liquid, otherwise the gelatine ratio will be off. Slowly whisk in the gelatin powder, making sure you continue to whisk until it is all fully incorporated. Divide the grape jelly mixture into 4 to 6 glasses depending on the size of your glasses. Gently agitate to remove any surface bubbles then refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours, or overnight, until set. To make the salad: In a small pot, over medium heat, add the sugar, cold water, sliced lemon and ginger. Bring to a simmer, then add in the basil and shut off the heat to allow the mixture to steep, 20 minutes. Cut the grapes in half through the middle and add to a large mixing bowl. Dress the grapes with a little of the syrup and toss to combine. Discard the basil and reserve the extra syrup. To make the whipped cream: Using a balloon whisk, whip the cream, sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Fold the ginger into the whipped cream but reserve a few pieces for garnish. To assemble the dish: When the gelee is set, remove it from the refrigerator and top each glass with a spoonful of the grape salad and a quenelle of the ginger whipped cream. Garnish with basil buds and some slivers of ginger. Drizzle each glass with some of the reserved lemon-ginger syrup and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 72552,&quot;Pork Chops with Green Olives and Lemon 2 pork chops, on the bone Salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch sugar 2 tablespoons olive oil 3/4 cup/175 ml white wine Skin 1 preserved lemon, chopped 1/2 cup/85 g green olives, with pits Small handful chopped fresh rosemary or thyme Roasted Cherry Tomatoes Branch cherry tomatoes Olive oil, for drizzling Instructions: Season the chops with salt and pepper. \Season\ also with sugar, sprinkling judiciously over both sides of the chops, as if it were salt.

Set limes aside until just cool enough to handle. Through the feed opening of a running blender, add 1 at a time, garlic, ginger, vinegar, soy sauce, and scallions. Then, leaving the blender running, squeeze in the juice from the microwaved limes. Place the swordfish in a nonreactive container and pour the marinade over. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours. To marinate the fiddleheads: Place the fiddleheads in a nonreactive bowl. Make the vinaigrette, by adding, 1 at a time, through the feed opening of a running blender the vinegar, garlic, and Dijon mustard. Then, leaving the blender running, add the olive oil in a slow thin stream. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and pour over the ferns. Cover and let sit in the refrigerator for about 6 hours. (Marinating them this way is an alternative to cooking them.) Make the salsa while you are heating the grill for the fish. Whisk together the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar in a bowl and add the olive oil in a slow thin stream while continuing to whisk. Chop the basil leaves and add to the bowl along with the tomatoes, shallots, and scallions. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. (Be sure to taste before seasoning, because the soy is likely to lend saltiness.) Brush the marinated fish with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the fish, leaving each side undisturbed for the first few minutes to prevent tearing of the flesh. Let rest, then transfer to a cutting board and carve into slices. Place some salsa in the middle of a serving dish, top with sliced fish and garnish with marinated fiddleheads. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 72556,&quot;How to Make Sushi Rice 2 cups sushi or short grain rice 2 cups water, plus extra for rinsing rice 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt Instructions: Place the rice into a mixing bowl and cover with cool water.

Toss the chicken in the seasoned yogurt marinade until evenly coated. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 24. (Overnight works best.) For the sauce: Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large Dutch oven or wide heavy pot over medium heat. Toss the fenugreek seeds, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon and clove in the butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly darker and very fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the onions, season with 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden and beginning to caramelize, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until very fragrant and the ginger starts to turn golden and sticks to the bottom of the pot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garam masala and chili powder and cook, stirring occasionally, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up into pieces with a spoon, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced by half and the tomatoes are very tender, about 30 minutes. Discard the bay leaves and cinnamon stick (but leave the other whole spices).<br> Let the hot sauce cool for about 5 minutes or so, then transfer it to a blender filling no more than halfway. Remove the center cap from the lid and place it on the blender. Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters, and pulse until smooth. (If your blender is small, you may need to work in batches.) Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the cream to the blender and puree until creamy. Pour into a clean pot and bring to a simmer. Season with salt.\u202f<br> Meanwhile, arrange a rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside.\u202f\u202f<br> \u202fArrange the chicken in a single layer on the rack. Broil until the chicken starts to brown in spots, 3 to 6 minutes per side (it will not be cooked through). Remove from the broiler. When cool enough to handle, cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces. Add the chicken to the simmering sauce, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.\u202f<br> Stir in the cilantro. Serve with rice and naan alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72562,&quot;Konrad&#39;s Pork Shoulder Gravy 2 tablespoons caraway seeds 2 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 2 teaspoons smoked paprika<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 3 1/2 pounds skin-on, bone-in pork shoulder 1/2 cup mustard<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 1 clove garlic, crushed<br> 1 sprig fresh thyme<br> 8 cups chicken broth<br> 3 bay leaves<br> 1/2 cup pickle juice (from a jar of baby dill garlic pickles)<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons cornstarch Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the caraway seeds, garlic powder, smoked paprika and salt. Remove and reserve a third of the spice mix in a separate small bowl. Score the pork shoulder on the cap side with a sharp knife, making 8 shallow cross-cuts. Add the pork shoulder to the large bowl with the spice mix, then rub the entire pork shoulder with the spice mix. Cover with the mustard and let sit for 20 minutes. In a soup pot, heat the olive oil and vegetable oil on high heat, then add the pork shoulder on the scored-skin side. Sear all sides of the meat to lock in the deep flavor and juices. Add the garlic and thyme. Add the chicken broth, bay leaves and pickle juice and let it simmer, covered, until the meat falls off the bone, 1 1/2 hours. Shred the meat to bite-size pieces in the pot. Add more of the reserved spice mix to taste.

Place fish fillets on a baking sheet and then season fish with salt and pepper. Place under the broiler and cook until done on 1 side. Watch carefully, as it may only take a couple minutes, depending on the thickness of your fish fillets and the proximity to the broiler. Remove from broiler and turn each fish over. Top each fillet with about 1/2 cup sauce. Return to the broiler and cook until fish is done on the other side and fully cooked through in the middle. If you are unsure about doneness, cut into the center of 1 fillet; it should be opaque. (You can cover up the cut with the sauce.)

Remove from heat, add remaining 1 quart cold water, and stir. Set brine aside to cool to room temperature. Put turkey in a large container and cover with the brine. Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours. (If you want to brine the turkey overnight, use half the amount of salt and sugar.) For rub: Crumble annatto paste into a food processor and blend with the garlic, oregano, coriander, black pepper, salt, and allspice. Add the fruit juices and the olive oil and process to make a pasty sauce. Drain and pat the turkey very dry. Smear the rub all over the bird. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Prepare an outdoor grill with a large medium-heat fire for direct and indirect grilling. Position a drip pan under the grate on indirect side of the grill. Place turkey, breast side up, over the drip pan and grill, covered, until meat is cooked about halfway through, about 50 minutes. Turn and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 170 degrees F, about 50 minutes more. Move turkey to direct heat and rotate to evenly brown the skin in the last 10 minutes of cooking. Transfer to a carving board, cover, and let rest 10 minutes before carving. Shopsmart: Annatto paste is a Mexican flavoring composed of ground annatto, or achiote, seeds mixed with herbs-usually oregano-and spices. The rust-color paste is then pressed into a compact brick.

Work in the lard and slowly add the marsala. Knead together with fingers until the dough comes together. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Form the dough into a disk and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour. Set the smooth rollers of a pasta maker at the widest setting. Unwrap the dough and cut in half. Lightly flour 1 half (keep the remaining half covered with plastic wrap). Flatten the floured dough into an oval and feed through the rollers. Turn the dial down 2 notches and feed the dough through the rollers again. Fold the dough back to its original oval shape and repeat the process of putting the dough through the pasta rollers. Continue to feed the dough through the rollers, making the space between the rollers narrower by 2 notches each time, until the dough reaches a thickness of roughly 1/8 inch. Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. Transfer the rolled dough to a lightly floured surface and cut out 4 or 5 rounds with a floured 4-inch round cutter. Transfer the rounds to a baking sheet and keep covered with more plastic wrap. Roll out the remaining dough and cut rounds in the same manner. Gather the scraps and let stand 10 minutes. Roll out the scraps and cut in the same manner. Heat several inches of oil in a large Dutch oven until it registers 350 degrees F. Lightly spray the cannoli tubes with nonstick spray. Brush the bottom edge of 1 dough round with the egg white. Wrap the dough around a tube, overlapping the ends (egg white edge should go on top), and then press the edges together to seal. Make 5 more shells in the same manner (keep remaining rounds covered with plastic). Fry the dough on the tubes one at a time, turning with metal tongs, until it is one shade darker, about 45 seconds. Wearing oven mitts, clamp the end of the hot tubes with tongs, 1 at a time, and, holding the tube vertically, allow the shell to slide off the tube onto paper towels, gently shaking the tube and wiggling the shell as needed to loosen. (If you allow the shell to cool it will stick to the tube and shatter when you try to remove it.) Transfer the shells to paper towels to drain and cool the tubes before reusing. Wrap the remaining dough around the tubes and fry in the same manner. For the filling: Combine the heavy cream and tangerine zest in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Combine the sugar and tangerine juice in a medium saucepan and cook until deep amber colored. Slowly whisk in the cream mixture and cook until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and let cool and thicken slightly. Combine the drained ricotta and cream cheese in the bowl of a mixer, add a few tablespoons of confectioners&#39; sugar to sweeten, and beat until light and fluffy. Fold in the tangerine caramel sauce. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and fill the cannoli shells. Dip the ends in the almonds and chocolate and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 72613,&quot;Bacon-Wrapped Chicken Sandwich 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 (6 to 8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 slices bacon 1/2 cup apple juice 2 ciabbata rolls, halved lengthwise and toasted 1 tablespoon whole grain Dijon mustard 1 medium head Belgian Endive, TK, cored and thinly sliced lengthwise 1 medium gala, braeburn, or pink lady apple, cored, halved and thinly sliced Instructions: Place chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper and use a frying pan to gently pound the breasts to an even thickness. (They should be about 1 inch thick.) Combine flour, salt, and freshly ground black pepper in a wide, shallow dish and mix thoroughly. Coat each breast by dredging it in the flour mixture then shaking off excess flour. Wrap one piece of bacon around each piece of chicken and secure with a toothpick. Heat oil in a medium, heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium heat. When it shimmers, add chicken breasts and cook until bacon is well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Add the juice, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until cider is reduced by 1/3, and chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and remove toothpicks. To make a sandwich, spread mustard evenly on cut sides of bread. Layer half of each endive and apple slices alternately on one piece of bread, top with a chicken breast, drizzle with pan juices, season with freshly ground black pepper, and close sandwich. Repeat to make a second sandwich. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72614,&quot;Steamed Snails with Lemongrass 5 dried shiitake mushrooms 6 escargot, in shells 3 ounces ground pork or chicken 2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 pinch salt 1 pinch sugar 1 teaspoon red chili flakes 5 stalks lemongrass Instructions: Start by soaking the mushrooms in hot water until soft.

Leave to slowly melt, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in another bowl add the sugar to the egg yolks and beat until it has dissolved and is silky-smooth. Whisk the whites in a clean bowl with a tiny pinch of salt until they form soft peaks. Cook&#39;s Note: You should be able to hold the bowl upside down over your head without them falling out! In a third bowl, beat the cream until it forms soft peaks. Once the chocolate has melted, carefully lift the bowl out of the pan and put it to one side. Mix 2 1/2 ounces/ 75 ml of amaretto and the cocoa powder into your egg yolks then tip the whipped cream in and mix again. Fold through the melted chocolate until everything is well combined. Finish by tipping in the egg whites and keep folding gently, from the outside in, doing a figure-of-eight, until the mix is smooth and evenly coloured. Spoon or ladle the mousse into a big serving bowl or divide it between little glasses or cappuccino cups. Cover with cling film then pop in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours until set. Right before you&#39;re ready to serve your guests, dust some cocoa powder over the mousse. Pop the dried cherries in a small pan with the rest of the amaretto then top up with enough water to just cover the berries. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat off and leave to stand for a bit. Bash up the packets of sesame snaps in a pestle and mortar then open them and tip the contents into the mortar. Serve that next to your chocolate mousse with a bowl of those beautiful cherries on the side so everyone can dig in and customize their own mousse. It may look a bit rustic, but honestly, it&#39;s the best chocolate mousse I&#39;ve ever tasted! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 72628,&quot;Mambo Sauce 3/4 cup ketchup 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup hot sauce 1/4 cup pineapple juice 2 tablespoons white vinegar 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce Instructions: In a small saucepan, combine the ketchup, sugar, hot sauce, pineapple juice, vinegar, smoked paprika and soy sauce over medium heat; bring to a simmer.

Combine the olive oil, lime juice, soy sauce, salt, cl powder and cumin in a bowl. Reserve about 1/4 cup marinade in a squeeze bottle for later use, then pour the rest into the bag with the steaks. Seal the bag and press out all the air, making sure all sides of the steaks are evenly coated. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Remove the steaks from the bag and shake off any excess marinade. Place on a wire rack-lined baking sheet and return to the fridge, uncovered, for another 2 hours. (This will make sure the steaks get a beautiful rich color when seared.) Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon canola oil. Give the steaks a generous sprinkle of salt, then put in the hot skillet. Sear until a crust has developed, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove to a cutting board. Without cleaning the skillet, add the remaining tablespoon canola oil, followed by the peppers and onions, and cook until slightly softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Meanwhile, slice each steak in half with the grain. Now turn the steaks 90 degrees and slice against the grain into 1/4-inch strips. When the peppers and onions are almost finished cooking, add the steak to the hot skillet for a final sizzle and season with salt and pepper. Squirt the reserved marinade into the hot skillet to create a steamy sizzle.

Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix. Pour in 1 tablespoon olive oil and continue to mix until a smooth dough is formed. If the dough is too dry drizzle in a bit of water, if it is too wet sprinkle in some more flour. Dust some flour on a work surface, knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. To make the dough by hand: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface, shape into a mound, and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall and mix it with the beaten eggs. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a smooth dough. Dust some flour on the work surface; knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. To roll out the dough: Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the piece you are not using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine set at the widest setting 2 or 3 times. Guide the dough with your hand as it emerges from the rollers to prevent it from puncturing or stretching. Dust the sheets with extra flour whenever the dough gets sticky. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again 2 or 3 times. Continue reducing the setting and rolling until the machine is at its narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick for ravioli. Roll out the other half. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 72682,&quot;Nacho Cheese Corn Chip-Encrusted Mozzarella Sticks 2 large eggs 4 ounces nacho cheese corn chips<br> One 8-ounce box frozen mozzarella sticks<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Add the lobster tails and boil for 8 to 10 minutes until the shells curl and the lobster meat turns white. Drain, transfer to a cutting board, and cool for 15 minutes. Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, cut through the top shell lengthwise. Remove the meat and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil. Keep hot over low heat. In a large saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Cook until the butter begins to foam and then turns brown, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Add the onion and cook, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with the butter. Add the brandy and simmer until the liquid has almost evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of stock and stir until almost completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue adding the stock, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition of stock to absorb before adding the next. Cook until the rice is tender but still firm to the bite, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the Parmesan cheese, the remaining butter and 2 tablespoons chives. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the risotto to a large serving bowl.

Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with the remaining cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and cream. Add the mixture to the large bowl. Transfer 1/2 cup of the cream mixture to a small bowl and color it with 4 drops of the blue food coloring. Transfer 1 1/4 cups of the cream mixture to a medium bowl and color it with 8 drops of the red food coloring. Transfer 1 3/4 cups of the cream mixture to a second medium bowl (do not color it). Cover all 4 bowls and refrigerate while you assemble the cake.<br> Split the angel food cakes in half horizontally using a long, serrated knife. Keeping the layers stacked, cut each cake in half vertically. Arrange 2 of the stacked halves from one cake on a large platter or cake board so that they create an S shape; slide the ends so they are slightly offset. Repeat with the second cake, nestling the halves up against those of the first cake so that together they resemble a thick curved line. (There will be some gaps between the cakes.) Repeat with the third cake. Trim the edges of the arches along the short ends of the cake to create a more or less straight line (these will be the ends of the flag). Use half of the cake scraps to fill in the holes between the cake stacks. Reserve the other half of the scraps.<br> Remove the top pieces from the cake stacks and set them aside. Spread the bottom pieces with 3 cups of the undyed cream mixture in the large bowl. Scatter the strawberries and blueberries on top. Dollop with 3 more cups of the cream mixture and spread it evenly.

Peel the pears, leaving stem intact, if present. Remove bottom stem end with a small melon baller, and continue to scoop up into the pear to remove the core. Place the pears right in the Riesling mixture (poaching liquid) after they are peeled and cored to prevent them from discoloring. (The acidity of the wine keeps them from browning). Add just enough water to cover the pears. To keep the pears submerged in the poaching liquid, cut a circle of parchment paper the size of the pan and lay on the surface of the liquid. Place a small plate on top of the paper to make sure the pears are completely submerged. Cook the pears over medium-high heat, just until the liquid comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and poach the pears until they are just soft. The pears should be tender enough to pierce with a knife. This takes about 20 to 25 minutes for ripe medium pears, but this can vary depending on the size, variety and ripeness of the pear. Remove the pan from the heat and cool the fruit completely in the poaching liquid. Refrigerate the fruit in the liquid in a sealed container until ready to serve. (The fruit will hold for 4 to 5 days, the longer the fruit is stored in the poaching liquid, the fuller the flavor). Pour about half of the poaching liquid into a skillet and bring to a boil over high heat. Continue to cook and reduce until the liquid gets syrupy and about the consistency of honey. Meanwhile, whip the cream together with the sugar and cardamom until cream just holds soft peaks. Refrigerate until ready to serve. To serve, place a pear in a bowl or on a plate. Drizzle with reduced Riesling syrup and garnish with a dollop of whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 72712,&quot;Spinach Salad with Smoked Salmon 6 ounces smoked salmon, chilled 6 ounces fresh spinach, stemmed and washed, dried 1 large bunches of fresh chives, snipped finely 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 to 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 kirby cucumber, peeled and cut with vegetable peeler lengthwise into long thin strips 6 slices high quality country French bread, cut on bias and grilled or broiled Instructions: Cut salmon into fine strips and chill until serving time.

Sprinkle half of the butter cubes over the top of the flour and process for 10 seconds. Sprinkle the remaining half of the butter over the mixture and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, with some butter bits no bigger than peas. With the motor running, add the buttermilk through the feed tube and process until the dough just begins to come together. Transfer to a flat surface and lightly knead until the dough comes together. Form into 2 flat disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (You will need only 1 for the pie; the remaining dough can be frozen for up to 1 month.) Lightly spray a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom with nonstick spray. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch round that is 1/8-inch thick and fit it into the tart pan. Roll rolling pin over tops of pan to trim dough flush with rims and lightly prick bottoms and sides all over with a fork. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pan on a baking sheet. Spray the shiny side of a 12 piece of aluminum foil and line the shell shiny-side down with the foil and fill with pie weights. Bake on the middle rack in the oven until the crust sets and turns a pale golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil and pie weights and continue baking until golden brown and baked through, about 15 minutes longer. Transfer the tart pan to a baking rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is caramelized, about 4 minutes.

Add 2 cups of the milk, bring to simmer and scrape the bottom and sides of pan and carefully transfer the mixture to a medium saucepan. Puree the mixture with an immersion blender until smooth; bring to a simmer. In a bowl whisk the sugar, cornstarch and salt together until combined. Add the remaining 1 cup of milk and whisk until the cornstarch is dissolved. Whisk this mixture into the banana mixture and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 4 minutes.Whisk together the remaining tablespoon of brown sugar and yolks in a small bowl until smooth. Ladle some of the thickened mixture into the egg mixture to temper the yolks. Pour the yolk mixture into the pot and cook until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, WHISKING THE ENTIRE TIME. Once the mixture has thickened let it come to a boil for exactly 1 minute, whisking a few times. Remove from the heat, whisk in the softened gelatin and vanilla and strain through a coarse mesh strainer into a bowl. Cover the surface of the custard with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until set, at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours. Once pudding is set, whip the custard in the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment on high speed until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add the heavy cream and whip until light and fluffy, about 20 seconds longer. Transfer the filling to the cooled pie shell. Place plastic on top and let chill in refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and add the chicken. Mix gently to combine using your hands. Cover the bowl and refrigerate to allow the flavors to meld and marinate the chicken, about 30 minutes. Form 2 ounces of the mixture onto each skewer, skewering three-quarters of the way through. Place the skewers onto a baking sheet and refrigerate for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the hot sauce, honey and ketchup, stirring to combine. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. For the dipping sauce: While the sauce is cooking, blend the mayonnaise, buttermilk, lemon juice and 2 ounces of the bleu cheese in a blender until smooth. Scrape the sauce into a medium bowl, stir in the remaining 2 ounces bleu cheese and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. For cooking: Prepare a grill for direct heat grilling over medium-high heat. Brush the grill with a towel soaked in 2 tablespoons of the canola oil. Place the skewers on the grill and grill until slightly charred, about 2 minutes. Turn the skewers and brush with the butter-hot sauce. Continue to cook the skewers, turning and brushing with the sauce until cooked completely, about 5 minutes. Remove the skewers from the grill and brush with the additional sauce. Serve with the bleu cheese dipping sauce and garnish with more celery leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 72743,&quot;Shrimp Ceviche Served in Coconuts 1 lemon, halved 1 head garlic, halved 3 bay leaves 8 peppercorns Sea salt 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled 2 cups coconut milk 1/2 cup lime juice (about 6 to 8 limes), plus more for drizzling 1 red onion, sliced thin 2 serrano chiles, sliced thin 1/2 bunch freshly chopped cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish 4 coconuts 2 cups rock or kosher salt, for serving Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Instructions: Make the ceviche: Put a large pot of water over high heat and add the lemon, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns and salt, to taste. When it comes to a boil add the shrimp and turn off the heat. Let the shrimp poach just until they are cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the shrimp to a sheet pan and refrigerate. When they are cool slice them in half lengthwise. Combine the coconut milk, lime juice, onion, chiles, and cilantro in a large bowl and season it with salt. Add the cooled shrimp and let them marinate, refrigerated, for about 1/2 hour. Prepare the coconut shells: Take a hammer and hit the coconut repeatedly (not too hard) around its equator, turning the coconut in your hand. It will eventually split into 2 halves. Drain the liquid from the coconuts. To serve: Pour the salt onto a large platter and nestle the coconut halves into the salt so they stand upright. Divide the ceviche among the coconut halves; garnish with drizzles of lime juice, olive oil and cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 72744,&quot;Chocolate Fondue 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream, reserve 1/4 cup to thin if fondue begins to thicken 4 bittersweet chocolate bars, chopped, 3 1/2 ounces each 2 tablespoons Frangelico or Amaretto liqueur, optional 1/4 cup finely chopped hazelnuts or almonds, optional Hazelnut or almond biscotti Salted pretzel sticks Cubed pound cake Sliced bananas Stem strawberries Sectioned navel oranges Ripe fresh diced pineapple Instructions: Heat 1/2 cup cream in a heavy non-reactive saucepot over moderate heat until cream comes to a low boil.

Place the milk in a pan. Halve the vanilla beans lengthwise; scrape out the seeds with a paring knife, then add the seeds and pods to the milk. Bring to a simmer, then cover and remove from the heat. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Remove the vanilla pods from the milk. Gradually whisk one-third of the warm milk into the egg mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the remaining milk in the pan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, 6 minutes. Continue boiling until the mixture is custard-like, 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Slice the butter into pieces and whisk into the custard, then stir in the gelatin mixture. Microwave the chocolate until melted, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring. Mix 2 tablespoons hot water with the espresso. Transfer half of the cream filling to a bowl, then stir in the chocolate and espresso. Transfer the remaining cream filling to another bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the chocolate and vanilla creams and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours. When ready to fill the puffs, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks with a mixer. Fold half into the vanilla cream filling and half into the chocolate filling. Transfer each filling to a large pastry bag with a 1/4-inch tip and set aside. (To do this cleanly, cuff the open end of the pastry bag over your hand.) For the Pastry Puffs: Unfilled puffs can be frozen for up to a week. To re-crisp, thaw, then brush with a beaten egg; bake 5 minutes at 350 degrees. While the fillings chill, make the pastry puffs: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Bring 1 1/2 cups water, the butter, sugar and salt to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring to melt the butter. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon to make a paste. Return to the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste is shiny and pulls away from the pan, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer the paste to a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed to cool, 1 minute. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Transfer the dough to a large pastry bag with a 1/2-inch tip. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, dabbing a bit of dough under the corners to keep the paper in place. Pipe 1 1/2-inch balls of dough onto the paper (about 48 total). Smooth the dough peaks with a wet finger. Bake until puffed, 15 to 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake until golden, 15 minutes. Turn off the oven; keep the puffs inside 10 minutes to dry out. Pierce each puff with a dry piping tip; transfer to a rack to cool. To Assemble: Fill half of the puffs with chocolate cream and half with vanilla: Insert the tip of the pastry bag into the hole and squeeze until full. Chill the filled puffs 30 minutes before assembling the tower. Make the caramel: Mix the sugar, corn syrup and 1 cup water in a saucepan, cover and bring to a boil over high heat; don&#39;t stir. Uncover and boil, swirling the pan, until the syrup turns deep amber, 20 minutes. Immediately dip the bottom of the saucepan in a large bowl of ice water for a few seconds to stop the cooking. Transfer the caramel to a liquid measuring cup and cool slightly (it should still be liquid). Be careful-the caramel will still be hot! Draw a 7-inch circle on parchment paper. Partially dip each filled puff into the caramel and let the excess drip off. Arrange the puffs around the circle. If the caramel hardens, microwave until soft, 45 seconds. Fill the base circle with more puffs for stability, then continue building a conical tower of smaller circles. Top the tower with a single puff. Line your work surface with parchment paper-the next step can be messy. Dip the tip of a fork into the caramel and quickly wave it in circles around the tower to create a web of caramel strands.

Shingle the bread slices, in rows, over the bottom of the dish so that they are overlapping slightly (like rows of slanted books). Whisk the eggs, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla and salt in large bowl until smooth and well combined. Add the milk and cream to the bowl and whisk until well combined. Pour the egg mixture evenly over the bread slices, making sure that all slices are well coated. Cover the casserole dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. For the brown sugar crumble: Whisk together the brown sugar, flour and salt in a medium bowl. Add the butter and work it into the dry ingredients with your fingers (or a pastry cutter) until the mixture is crumbly with pea-sized bits of butter. Mix in the pecans. To assemble: Give the bread slices in the casserole dish a gentle push into the custard, dollop the pumpkin pie puree over the bread slices and sprinkle the crumble evenly over the top. Bake the casserole until the top is puffed and browned and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes (it will still be a little jiggly when the casserole dish is tapped but it will continue to cook a bit out of the oven). Check the casserole about halfway through the baking time and tent it with foil if the topping is browning too quickly. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 72764,&quot;Petite Croque Monsieurs 1 French baguette, sliced 1/4-inch thick (24 slices) 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/4 cup country-style Dijon mustard<br> 6 slices Black Forest ham<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> One 6-ounce block Gruyere cheese, shredded<br> Instructions: Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and spread each slice with 1/2 teaspoon mayonnaise. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Place half (12) of the bread slices, mayonnaise-side down, in the pan and toast until browned, about 3 minutes. Return the toasted bread to the baking sheet, toasted side down, and spread 1 teaspoon mustard on each of the untoasted sides. Fold each slice of ham into thirds, as if folding a letter, then cut in half to yield 12 squares. Place the ham squares on top of the mustard. Preheat the broiler to high. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until combined; cook until light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, slowly add the milk and cook until the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the salt and nutmeg. Add 1 cup shredded Gruyere; whisk until melted and the sauce is smooth, about 1 minute. Remove the Mornay sauce from the heat, spoon 1 tablespoon over each square of ham, and then top with 1 teaspoon of the remaining cheese.

Add the butter and mix until coarse and sandy. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks and cream together. Add to the flour mixture and mix at low speed just until combined. Turn out onto a work surface and form into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick, this should be done in small batches as the dough gets soft fast. With a large round cutter cut out disks and keep them chilled while you roll and cut the rest of the dough. Line 3-inch diameter by 1 1/4-inches tall metal collars with the disks and chill. Bake the tart shells blind by lining them with plastic wrap (that&#39;s right!) and fill with raw rice then gather the plastic wrap up to contain the rice. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes then remove the rice packets and bake 2 more minutes to crisp them. Meanwhile, make the filling. Let crusts cool slightly. To make the filling, in a saucepan, heat the half-and-half, cream, salt, and vanilla bean over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse 10 to 15 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together. Whisking constantly, gradually add the hot cream mixture. Strain into a large bowl to smooth the mixture and remove the vanilla bean. Add the rice and raisins and toss well. Spoon filling into baked tart shells. Reset the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and bake the tart for 20 to 25 minutes till the custard is set.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange the bacon on 2 sheet trays. Using a pastry brush, brush both sides with the sambal. Bake, rotating the sheet trays and flipping the bacon, until golden brown and crispy, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate or on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to cool and drain off excess oil. For the eggs: Brush the bottoms and sides of two 8-inch square baking pans with the melted butter. Set aside. Put the flour in a medium bowl and whisk in the milk a little at a time until smooth. Add the eggs, salt and pepper and whisk until smooth. Pour into the prepared baking pans and sprinkle the scallions over the top. Scatter the cream cheese evenly on top. Bake until the eggs are just set and the edges have just begun to pull away from the sides of the pans, 20 to 25 minutes. Finish with flakey salt. Cut each pan of eggs into 4 squares, for a total of 8. To assemble: Place each bagel cut-side up on a sheet of foil large enough to wrap the whole bagel. Add a slice of American cheese to each bottom half. Top each with a square of eggs. Top each with a slice of cheese and 3 slices of bacon. (Add ketchup and hot sauce too, if you like.) Wrap the bagels up in the foil. Slice and serve immediately with ketchup or hot sauce if you wish. In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, salt and yeast . Add the water and 1 tablespoon of the barley malt and mix to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and slightly sticky. Transfer to an oiled bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Let the dough sit at room temperature for an hour, then turn it out onto a clean work surface. Divide it into 8 equal parts and stretch them into smooth balls, making sure to seal any dough seams well. Shape the bagels by sticking your thumb through the center of each ball and using your fingers to gently stretch a 2-inch hole. Cover the bagels with a towel and let rise for 15 minutes. Arrange the oven racks in the upper middle and lower middle positions. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the baking soda and remaining tablespoon barley malt. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and grease them well. Lay out a clean kitchen towel near your pot of boiling water. Working with 3 bagels at a time, boil them for 1 minute on each side (use a timer for this). With a slotted spoon or spatula, transfer them briefly to the kitchen towel to catch any excess moisture, then transfer to the baking sheets. Brush the bagels with the egg white and sprinkle with the sesame seeds and salt. Bake the bagels for 10 minutes, then switch the positions and rotate the pans and bake until golden brown, 6 to 8 more minutes.

Heat the oil in a large heavy pan over medium heat. Finely chop the onion, add to the pan and season with salt. Do the same with the celery and carrot and cook with the onion until they&#39;re softened, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often to ensure it doesn&#39;t stick. Once the veggies have softened slightly and the onion has turned translucent, grate in the garlic. Stir for a minute until fragrant and then add in the beef. Using a wooden spoon, breakdown the beef so it&#39;s in small pieces and continue to stir until all the meat has browned, about 10 minutes. At this point, stir in the tomato paste and then the red wine, stirring until all absorbed. Top with the beef stock and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer, add in the thyme, bay leaves and season with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Leave to cook until you have a rich thick sticky sauce and most of the liquid has gone, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Peel and dice the potatoes. Add to a large pot of salted boiling water and boil until fork tender, about 25 minutes. Drain completely. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher, leaving a bit of purple chunks for texture. Add in the butter and the milk to loosen and season with salt and pepper. Now all your elements are ready for building your rainbow cottage pie. Spoon a thick layer of the beef in a 9- by 13-inch glass baking dish, pressing down to pack it in. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half across the equator and lay them cut-side down over the beef, making sure there are no gaps. Completely cover the tomatoes with the spinach, pushing down gently to flatten and tucking into the corners. Sprinkle the cheese on top of the spinach (this will go gorgeously gooey in the oven). Spoon the mashed potatoes on top in 4 equal dots and then smooth over to cover the whole of the top, making sure no spinach is on show. Use the back of a spoon to add a bit of texture (like frosting a cake) to the mash so it crisps in the oven. Bake until crisp and bubbling and the tomatoes are juicy, 30 to 35 minutes. Leave to sit for 10 minutes - if you can - before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 72789,&quot;Sparkly Strawberry Churros 2 quarts neutral oil 2/3 cup (147 grams) granulated sugar<br> One 1-ounce/28-gram bag freeze-dried sliced strawberries<br> 1 vanilla bean, split and seeded (bean reserved)<br> 3 tablespoons fine hot pink sanding sugar<br> 2 tablespoons (29 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 2 tablespoons (30 grams) unrefined coconut oil, at room temperature<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup (142 grams) all-purpose flour<br> 1 large egg, at room temperature<br> Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat to 365 degrees F.

Bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until the potatoes are very tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Once the water is at a simmer, add the garlic cloves to the water and cook until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the garlic from the water. Cool the garlic slightly and then coarsely chop it. Add the garlic to a food processor along with the almonds and 1/2 cup of oil. Process until the mixture becomes a thick paste.

Make sure the spaghetti is fully covered with the egg. Add a dash or two of salt, to taste, noting that the leftover spaghetti is already seasoned with salt. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan. To test oil temperature, drop a piece of spaghetti into the pan. If it sizzles upon contact, the oil is ready. Pour the spaghetti mixture into the pan and flatten it out like a pancake. Fry for 2 minutes on high heat, or until golden brown. To flip the pasta, cover the pan with a plate larger than the pan, and hold it covered. Flip the pan and plate together to transfer the pasta onto the plate, then slide the uncooked portion back into pan and continue cooking for another 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove the pizza pasta from the pan and place it on a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Serve warm or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Chianti, Barbera, Vermentino]&quot; 72805,&quot;Spicy Italian Corn Bread 1/2 tablespoon butter 2 (8 1/2-ounce) packages corn muffin mix (recommended: Jiffy) 1 tablespoon chili powder 2/3 cup whole milk 2 large eggs, stirred to blend 1/2 cup drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan. Whisk the muffin mix and chili powder in a large bowl to blend. Mix in the milk and eggs. Stir in the tomatoes. Spread the batter in the prepared pan.

Line 1 baking sheet with paper towels and 2 more pans with silpats or parchment paper. Trim the end of the beets. Peel the beets, keeping their round shape to make round chips. Slice into paper thin rounds using a knife or mandoline, adjusting the setting if necessary. In a medium saucepan, combine the vinegar, 1 cup water, and the sugar and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the beets and boil for 1 to 2 minutes to soften slightly and flavor them. Remove from the heat and let the beets stand in the liquid for 5 to 10 minutes, to cool slightly. (The beets can be prepared to this point refrigerated for up to a week in the liquid, before baking.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beets to the towel-lined pan to drain. Lay the beet slices out on the silpat lined baking sheets. The slices can be close to each other, but they should not touch. Place in the warmed oven to dry for 10 to 12 hours, or until crisp and dry. Remove the chips from the oven and, using a small offset spatula, transfer them to a cooling rack. Once cooled, the chips can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week. For the Duck: Turn the duck breast skin side down. With a sharp knife, make a cut down the length of the center bone, just to break it. Smack the blade across the bones just to break them slightly; do not cut through the meat. Cutting the bones and leaving the breast on them will prevent the meat from shrinking and curling as it cooks. Season the duck breast with salt, pepper, and sugar. In a large saute pan, heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil over medium high heat. Reduce the heat to medium. Place the breast in the pan, skin side down, and cook slowly, adjusting the heat if necessary, for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown. When browned, remove the breast from the pan and place on a cutting board. Separate the breast meat from the bone. Chop the carcass into small pieces. For the Sauce: Add the chopped bones to the oil remaining in the pan, increase the heat, and saute until the bones are richly browned. Add the shallots and saute for about 2 minutes, or until translucent. Add the garlic, diced beets, 1 teaspoon sugar, and the balsamic vinegar. Pour the red wine into the pan, and bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom to remove all the browned bits. Simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and strain. Sprinkle the breasts with the cinnamon. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat in a saute pan just big enough to hold the breast. Place the breasts skin side down in pan, place a small heavy pot on top of the breast to weigh it down, and cook for about 4 minutes to crisp the skin. Remove from the heat. Just before serving, swirl the butter into the sauce. Cut the duck breast in half. If serving 4 people, cut each breast half into 2 pieces. Place the duck on the serving plates; spoon the sauce to the side, garnish with a beat chip, and sprinkle the duck with fleur de sel and black pepper. Serve the remaining beet chips on the side, with beaucoup de LOVE. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 72807,&quot;Quick Italian Rum Cake Cups 1 package lady fingers or 4 individual serve store bought sponge cakes 3 ounces rum 2 cups vanilla instant pudding, prepared to package directions or 4 servings store bought prepared vanilla pudding 8 strawberries, sliced 1 teaspoon sugar 1 pouch, 3 ounces, sliced almonds, available on baking aisle of market Instructions: Separate lady fingers or spread out 4 individual sponge cakes on a work surface.

Once combined, form a smooth, soft dough with your hands. Roll out the dough on a surface dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar until it is about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out different shapes with 1 1/2-inch cookie cutters, rerolling the mixture until it is used up. Keep any mixture you are not working with covered with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water or put the chocolate in a bowl and microwave at 30-second intervals, stirring between each one. Dip the peppermint creams into the melted chocolate until they are half covered, then let them cool and set on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If you are storing the creams, pop them in an airtight container spaced apart, dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar and separated between layers of parchment to keep them from sticking together. They can be stored for 2 to 3 days at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 72823,&quot;Old South Burgers with Peach Compote 1 pound Ground Beef (93% lean or leaner) 1 cup diced peaches, fresh or frozen 1 cup diced sweet onion 1 cup Budweiser beer 1/4 cup packed brown sugar 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary 1/4 cup goat cheese 4 pre-baked biscuits, split Instructions: 1)To prepare peach compote, heat large skillet over medium heat until hot.

Set aside. For the three cheese waffle hash browns: Preheat a waffle iron to medium. Toss the shredded potatoes in a bowl with the melted butter, the three cheeses and the salt and pepper. Mix until well combined. Spray the top and bottom of the waffle iron well with cooking spray. Put a mounded cup of the potato mixture (about 1 1/4 cups worth) in each well and gently pat down. (They will start to sizzle.) Close the waffle iron and cook until the hash browns are golden brown and crispy; time will vary based on your waffle iron, but it will take roughly 12 minutes. (Check on them occasionally to make sure they aren&#39;t burning.) Use a butter knife or fish spatula to gently and very carefully remove the hash browns. They are very fragile when they are hot and just out of the iron. For the flank steak: Meanwhile, preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high. Pat the steak dry and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Grill the steak for about 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Set on a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes.

Line a sieve with cheesecloth and transfer potatoes to the sieve. Set sieve over a bowl, twist cheesecloth into a pouch, squeezing out some moisture. Let mixture drain for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, pour off liquid from the bowl but leave the white potato starch that settles in the bottom of the bowl. To that starch add shallots, eggs, flour, 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt and freshly ground pepper. Return drained potatoes to this mixture and toss to combine. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Line a baking pan with paper towels. When you are ready to eat, in a large skillet heat 1/4 inch of oil over medium high heat until hot. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of potato mixture and cook for 3 to 4 minutes a side; latkes should be golden and crisp on both sides.

Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the pork is a crisp golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cracklings to a small ovenproof dish, leaving the fat in the pot, and reserve until later. Add the butter, onions, savory or thyme, and bay leaf to the pot and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 8 minutes, until the onions are softened but not browned. Add the potatoes and stock. If the stock doesn&#39;t cover the potatoes, add just enough water to cover them. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil, cover, and cook the potatoes vigorously for about 10 minutes, until they are soft on the outside but still firm in the center. If the stock hasn&#39;t thickened lightly, smash a few of the potato slices against the side of the pot and cook for 1 or 2 minutes longer to release their starch. Reduce the heat to low and season assertively with salt and pepper (you want to almost over season the chowder at this point to avoid having to stir it much once the fish is added). Add the fish fillets and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, then remove the pot from the heat and allow the chowder to sit for 10 minutes (the fish will finish cooking during this time). Gently stir in the cream and taste for salt and pepper. If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely. Otherwise, let is sit for up to 1 hour at room temperature, allowing the flavors to meld. When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat; don&#39;t let it boil. Warm the cracklings in a low oven (200 degrees) for a few minutes.

F to 105? F), plus more for the millet 1 tablespoon dry millet 1/4 cup molasses 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl and baking dish 1 cup whole-wheat flour 1/2 cup rye flour 1/4 cup yellow cornmeal 2 tablespoons hemp hearts 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 large egg, lightly beaten Rolled oats, for sprinkling Instructions: Stir 1 cup all-purpose flour with the sugar, 3/4 teaspoon yeast and 3/4 cup warm water in a large bowl. Cover and let stand at room temperature until bubbly and about doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, cover the millet with more warm water in a small dish and set aside. Stir the yeast mixture a bit to break it up. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon yeast and 1/2 cup warm water, the molasses and olive oil. Stir to combine (it may look lumpy). Add the remaining 1 cup all-purpose flour, the whole-wheat flour, rye flour, cornmeal, hemp hearts and salt to the yeast mixture. Drain the millet and add to the bowl. Stir everything together with a rubber spatula until there is no dry flour left. Let stand to hydrate the flour, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface. Dust the top of the dough with more flour and knead just until well combined but still a little tacky, adding a bit more flour as needed (you should only need a few tablespoons), about 3 minutes. Lightly rub a large bowl with olive oil. Add the dough, turn to coat and cover the bowl. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350? F. Rub the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with olive oil. Form the rolls: Turn out the dough onto a clean surface and gently pat into a square; cut into 12 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, pull the corners into the center and press gently to adhere. Turn the piece over and gently roll into a ball. Transfer to the baking dish, using a bench scraper if they stick. Cover the dish and set aside until the rolls are slightly puffed, 30 to 45 minutes. Brush the tops of the rolls with the beaten egg and sprinkle with a few rolled oats. Bake until well risen and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.

In a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag, add the beer, mustard, agave, salt and pepper. Stir well to combine, then add the turkey breast, making sure it is fully coated with the marinade. Put the bag into a bowl to avoid any leakage and refrigerate for 45 minutes. Do not marinate it longer than 45 minutes or the breast will become overly salty. While the turkey is brining, prepare the Red Bell Pepper Pesto. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F. Drain the turkey brine and put the breast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan (Chef&#39;s Note: Do not rinse turkey). Roast until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, on an instant-read thermometer, inserted in the thickest part of the breast, about 1 hour. Remove the turkey from the oven and allow it to cool. This entire process can be done ahead of time. Refrigerate the meat until you are ready to assemble the sandwich. After the turkey has cooled, remove all of the meat from the bone and slice it diagonally into 1/2-inch thick portions. Roughly chop 3/4 cup of the giardiniera vegetables and add them to a small bowl. Add 4 tablespoons of the Red Bell Pepper Pesto and toss to combine. Slice the bread, and lightly spread the pieces with some of the leftover pesto. Begin layering your sandwich with the provolone on the bottom, then the sliced turkey and the giardiniera mixture. Top everything with the Rojo Rings, cover with another slice of bread and then serve. Set a grill to high heat. Grill the red bell peppers until the skins have blackened. Remove them from the heat and put them in a small bowl. Cover the bowl and let them steam. Cool them from 10 minutes to 1 hour, then carefully remove the skin and seeds. Do not rinse them with water. Add the roasted peeled peppers, basil, garlic, cheese, nuts, red pepper flakes, anchovy paste, salt and pepper to a food processor. Pulse until fully combined. Gradually add in the olive oil while the processor is running and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Refrigerate the pesto until ready to use. In a heavy bottom skillet or deep-fryer, heat the oil to 370 degrees F. Combine the hot sauce, ketchup and water in a shallow bowl until incorporated. In 4 separate, shallow bowls or pie pans, separate the buttermilk, flour and panko and put all the bowls in this work order: buttermilk, flour, hot sauce mixture, panko bread crumbs. Dip the onion rings into the buttermilk, then in the flour, then into the hot sauce mixture and finish them with the panko. Submerge the rings in batches and deep-fry until bright red and starting to brown, about 2 to 3 minutes, turning as needed. Once fried, remove them from the oil to a plate lined with a paper towel and sprinkle with sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 72853,&quot;Better Beef Lasagna 12 ounces whole-wheat lasagna noodles (15 noodles) 8 ounces lean ground beef (90 percent lean or higher) 2 teaspoons olive oil 8 ounces portobello mushrooms, diced (about 3 large mushroom caps) 4 cups good quality store-bought marinara sauce 1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained 1 egg, lightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Pinch ground nutmeg 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 3 ounces grated part-skim mozzarella cheese (about 2/3 cup) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cook the noodles al dente according to the directions on the package. Drain them well then lay out on waxed paper to prevent them from sticking to each other. Heat a large nonstick skillet over a medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until no longer pink, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks, about 3 minutes. Transfer the meat to a plate, discarding any fat remaining in the pan. Add the oil to the same pan and heat over a medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally until all the liquid has evaporated and they begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Return the meat to the pan. Stir in 2 cups of the tomato sauce and simmer for 2 minutes. In a medium bowl combine the ricotta cheese, spinach, egg, the salt, the pepper and nutmeg.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72858,&quot;Big Cheese Squeeze 2 slices of bread, cut thin (as far as bread selection goes, all I&#39;ll say is the bigger the loaf the bigger the sandwich) 1 teaspoon (or more) smooth Dijon mustard 1 cup Grated cheese Semi-hard, semi-soft combo like smoked gouda and Gruyere or Fontina with a young Asiago. Good quality olive oil for spritzing. Instructions: Find 2 heavy skillets that will nest together. Two (10-inch) cast iron skillets are ideal. Heat them over high heat. Meanwhile, spread mustard on one slice of bread. Distribute the cheese evenly over the mustard, season with fresh black pepper and top with second piece of bread. Spritz the bread surface that&#39;s staring up at you with olive oil using either a Misto or a pump sprayer. A light coat will do, don&#39;t soak. When the pans are hot enough to vigorously sizzle a drop of water, remove them from the heat and place the sandwich, top-side down in the middle of one pan. (if your pans are a different size, this would be the smaller one.) Spritz the slice now facing you, as well as the bottom of the other skillet. Lay the skillet right on top of the sandwich. If the top pan isn&#39;t cast iron, weigh it down with a brick, can, or something of similar heft. Wait patiently, crack a beer. When you hear the first bit of cheese run out and sizzle on the pan, it&#39;s done. This will take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully remove the top skillet, (you may need to coax it off with a spatula, but I doubt it). Just look at it. It&#39;s perfect ... better than mom&#39;s. (no reason to tell her) Remove to a plate, count to 10 and slice it in half. Take a bite. Take another.

Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a Dutch oven (12-inch diameter) over medium-high heat. Lay half of the chicken pieces skin-side down in the skillet. Cook the chicken, until golden-brown on both sides, turning once, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken. Reduce the heat to medium, add the carrots and celery, and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the rosemary, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the lemon juice, and scrape up any browned bits that cling to the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the broth, onions, lemon zest, and 1 teaspoon salt and bring just to a boil. Return the chicken skin-side up to the pot, taking care that the skin is just over the surface of the liquid, and then put the stew in the oven. Cook, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through, tender, and lightly glazed and brown, about 40 minutes. Baste the chicken occasionally in the last 20 minutes of cooking. Meanwhile, use a fork to work the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into the 2 tablespoons flour to make a paste. Remove the stew from the oven. Remove and discard the rosemary and arrange all the vegetables and chicken (reserving the juices in the pan) in a serving dish/bowl. Place the Dutch oven over medium heat and whisk the butter/flour mixture into the juices until dissolved. Bring to a boil and simmer until thickened.

Line two 12-cup cupcake tins with paper liners. (To avoid cupcakes sticking if they overflow slightly, lightly spray the tops of the pans.) Put tins on a baking sheet. Set aside. Process sugar and butter in a food processor until very creamy, scraping sides as needed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, pulsing after each addition. Add the milk, water, and vanilla and process to blend. Whisk both flours, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dry ingredients, in 3 batches to the wet, pulsing, and then scraping batter off the sides of the processor as needed after each addition. Process until the batter is very smooth and pourable like pancake batter, about 2 minutes. Evenly pour the batter into the prepared cups, filling them 3/4 of the way full. Bake until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and the tops are golden, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly in tin, and turn out of tin when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a rack before frosting. Whisk the milk and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Slowly beat the butter and sugar, in another medium bowl, with an electric mixer until incorporated. Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes.

Line an 8-inch by 12-inch/20 cm by 30 cm sided baking sheet with parchment which you&#39;ve buttered on both sides. Put the eggs and sugar in a glass or metal bowl, set it over a pot with an inch/2.5 cm of simmering water in the bottom (do not let the bowl touch the water) and beat until tripled in volume and very thick and ribbony, like cake batter. This will take about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Sift the flour and nuts over the batter and gently fold together. Pour the batter into the pan so that it is evenly distributed. Bake until slightly golden on top, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, get set up for unmolding the cake: lay a damp tea towel on a cutting board or on the back of another baking sheet. When the cake comes out, flip it onto the towel, carefully peel off the paper, trim the edges it you want, and roll immediately. Set aside to cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Whip the cream into stiff peaks with a hint of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. Unroll the cake from the towel and set the towel aside. Sieve over a dusting of cocoa powder and spread the cream over the cake leaving a 1-inch border, and roll the cake up again. Set on a platter seam-side down.

Transfer to the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining noodles.<br> Heat 1/2-inch of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and line a plate with a paper towel. Drop a few breadcrumbs into the oil; if they sizzle, the oil is hot enough. Working in batches, fry the noodles, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and the cheese is melted and starting to ooze through the sides, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to the lined plate and repeat with the remaining noodles, making sure to heat the oil back up between each batch.

Add the egg and beat until fluffy. Blend in the vanilla. Sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt, mixing until just combined. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. On a floured surface, roll half of the dough to 1/8-inch thick. Cut into circles using a 3-inch round cookie cutter or the top of a drinking glass. Gather and reroll scraps. Repeat with remaining dough. Place the cookies on a greased baking sheet and bake for about 8 minutes, until just golden. Do not allow cookies to brown. To decorate, melt the chocolate chips in the microwave in a heatproof bowl for 1 minutes. The chips may look unmelted, but stir them with a spoon to see if they have actually softened before putting them in for another minute, if necessary. Spoon the melted chocolate into a zipper-lock bag. Seal the bag, pressing out any air. Use a toothpick to make a very tiny hole in one corner of the bag to release a very thin stream of chocolate for writing. To make the spiderwebs, spread white royal icing smoothly over the surface. Immediately, before the icing can set, pipe a spiral of chocolate over the surface, starting in the middle and working outward. Starting in the center, use a toothpick to pull outward through the icing, making a spiderweb design. With beaters or a standing mixer, whip the egg white and lemon juice until frothy. At medium speed, beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, a little at a time, until the mixture is thick but still liquid enough to beat. Then beat on high until the mixture is thick and glossy, about 3 minutes. Cover the surface with plastic wrap while waiting to use it. Royal icing will set to a firm, glossy finish when applied to a cookie. The icing can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 72894,&quot;Rosemary-Lemon Starter 2 tablespoons sugar 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves removed 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 8 ounces vanilla-flavored vodka 4 large handfuls of small or crushed ice cubes Instructions: In a tall glass or drink shaker, add the sugar and rosemary.

Dust a tray with flour and arrange the ravioli on the tray, dusting with more flour. Repeat with the remaining dough, egg wash, and filling. Refrigerate, covered, until needed. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, over high heat, add the oil and the remaining butter. Cook the butter until it begins to brown. Drain the ravioli and toss into the browned butter, turning to coat both sides. Add the remaining Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and hazelnuts and serve immediately. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of the water. Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine and pinch the dough to test it. If it&#39;s too dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball. Turn out on a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, until a smooth ball is formed. Loosely wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the other pieces covered in plastic while you roll out 1 piece at a time, by hand with a rolling pin or through the rollers of a pasta machine, stretching the dough to the desired thickness. If using a pasta machine, set the rollers at the widest opening. Flatten the first piece of dough into a thick strip no wider than the machine, to enable it to pass through the rollers. If necessary, dust the pasta very lightly with flour. Run the pasta through the machine. Fold in thirds, crosswise, and run through the machine again. Repeat this procedure 2 or more times, until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic. Set the machine to the next smaller opening and run the dough through the rollers. Continue rolling and stretching the dough, using the smaller opening each time, until the next to the last or the last opening is reached, dusting lightly with flour only as necessary. (The strip of dough will be long. If you don&#39;t have enough space on your worktable, halfway through the rolling process cut the strip of dough in half and continue to work with each piece separately, keeping the unused dough covered). Adjust the cutting mechanism to the desired width, cut the noodles, and allow them to dry before cooking. A convenient way to dry pasta is to arrange the cut pasta on a pastry tray sprinkled with flour, preferably semolina flour. As 1 layer is completed, sprinkle flour over the noodles, place a piece of parchment paper over them, and continue layering with noodles and flour. Dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 72907,&quot;Chocolate\u2013Peanut Butter Oatmeal Muffins 1 1/2 cups rolled oats 1 cup milk (2%, whole or almond) 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour (or more all-purpose flour) 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup unsalted butter or coconut oil, melted and slightly cooled 1/2 cup creamy unsweetened peanut butter or almond butter 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1/2 cup pure maple syrup 3/4 cup dried cherries, blueberries or raisins 3/4 cup chopped dark chocolate 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes Super seed mix, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400?

Bring the chocolate up to 113 degrees F. Turn off the heat, remove the bowl from the simmering water, and let cool, stirring until it reaches 82 to 86 degrees F. It will begin to set a little around the edges at this point. Return the bowl to the hot (now turned off) water for a few seconds at a time, until it reaches 88 to 91 degrees F. Do not let it go over 91 degrees or it will go out of temper. Pour melted milk chocolate in a candy mold with individual fluted cups to coat the insides. Pour the excess chocolate back into the bowl and let set or chill to set. Meanwhile, mix the peanut butter with the powdered sugar. Using a small spoon or pastry bag with a large plain tip fill each chocolate cup with the peanut butter filling leaving room for a chocolate seal and chill slightly. Using a paper cone or pastry bag filled with melted milk chocolate, fill in the surface of the cups to enclose the filling with chocolate. Let set, then turn out of the mold. Notes about the recipe: I have two recipes for this, one where you blend the peanut butter right with the milk chocolate and then pour it into the molds which is a more direct route to the same end flavor. The other is more traditional and the one I&#39;ve done here with the filling separate from the outer chocolate shell. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 72922,&quot;Red Rice with Spinach and Dried Cherries 1 1/2 cups red rice Kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large white onion, halved and thinly sliced Pinch of sugar Freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons grated peeled ginger 1/2 cup dried cherries 1 10-ounce package baby spinach Juice of 1 orange Instructions: Combine the red rice, 3 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan.

Heat the oil in a medium skillet and cook the sauce over medium heat, stirring, until the oil is absorbed and the sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Cool. Rub the jerk paste all over the chicken halves, cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours. Prepare an outdoor grill with a medium-high fire for both direct and indirect grilling. Position a drip pan under the grate on indirect side. Place the chicken, skin side down, over direct heat and cook until skin crisps and has definite grill marks, about 4 minutes per side. Move to indirect heat over the drip pan and cook skin side up, covered, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 35 to 40 minutes. Let the chicken rest about 5 minutes, then cut into pieces and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 72931,&quot;Ancho cl Brussels Slaw 1 pound Brussels sprouts, thinly sliced 3 ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded and cut into rings 1/4 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons sour cream 2 teaspoons honey 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Serve the mushrooms in the buns with sliced tomato, red onion, butter lettuce, mustard, mayonnaise and ketchup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 72933,&quot;Rompope-Filled Churros 2 cups red and/or green sanding sugar 1/2 cup cinnamon 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 extra-large eggs 2 to 3 quarts vegetable oil 1 recipe Rompope Pastry Cream, recipe follows 2 cups milk 1/3 cup blanched almonds 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 cinnamon stick 4 extra-large egg yolks 1/4 cup cornstarch Kosher salt 2 tablespoons butter 1/3 cup dark rum Instructions: Combine the sanding sugar and cinnamon in a large shallow dish or pan that&#39;s large enough to roll the churros in (at least 8-inches wide). Set aside. Set up a baking sheet lined with a bunch of paper towels for the finished churros. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the butter, sugar, salt and 1 cup water to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Sift the flour into the saucepan and stir for about 1 minute. (The mixture will immediately form a sticky ball.) Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. With the mixer running on low, add the eggs one at a time. Mix until the eggs are well incorporated. Fill a Dutch oven or pan with 2-2 1/2 inches of oil and place it over high heat. You want the oil to be at 345 to 365 degrees F during the frying process; use a thermometer to monitor the process closely. When the oil hits 340 degrees F, turn the heat down to medium and try to maintain the temperature range. Fit a pastry bag with a large closed-star tip and fill it 3/4 full with the churro dough. Squeeze the dough directly into the oil in 4 inch lengths, using scissors or a paring knife to separate the dough from the bag. You can fry 4 - 5 churros at a time, use metal tongs to keep them separated in the pan, about 2 minutes on each side until the churros are deep golden all over. Gently remove the finished churros with tongs and place them directly into the cinnamon-sugar mixture, rolling to coat them evenly. Place them on the paper towel lined sheet tray. Repeat until you&#39;ve used all the dough. Poke a hole in the end of each churro with the tip of a paring knife. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large (3/16-inch, #801) round tip with the Rompope Pastry Cream. Take each churro, insert the pastry tip in the end and fill. Repeat until all churros are filled. Serve warm. Combine the milk, almonds and granulated sugar in a blender and puree until smooth. Transfer to a pot, add the cinnamon stick and bring the mixture just to a boil over medium heat, scalding it. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks, cornstarch and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Slowly whisk in the scalded milk mixture, then return the mixture back to the pot over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until thick and you can see the trails of your whisk, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, then the rum. Cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 72934,&quot;Crab Louis 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chili sauce 2 tablespoons sour cream 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 4 scallions, minced Kosher salt 2 cups (about 1 pound) cleaned, cooked lump or jumbo lump crab meat, chilled Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 small bunch chives, minced 1 head Bibb lettuce, leaves separated 1 cup cherry tomatoes, preferably Sweet 100, or grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise 2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and quartered 1 large lemon, sliced, for squeezing Instructions: Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, chili sauce, sour cream, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, half the scallions and a pinch of salt.

Line an 8-inch round cake pan with a large sheet of parchment paper, pressing it into the edges of the pan and leaving an overhang on 2 sides (the extra parchment will help you unmold the loaf later). Whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl. Add the butter cubes to the flour mixture and toss to combine. Use a pastry blender or your fingertips to cut or rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the currants and caraway seeds. Whisk the buttermilk and egg together in a separate bowl or liquid measuring cup. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the buttermilk mixture into the center. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to stir the mixture until it starts to come together in a shaggy mass. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Turn the dough mixture out onto the floured surface and knead a few times to bring it together. Shape it into a domed disk. Place the dough into the prepared cake pan and cut a cross about 1/2-inch deep into the surface of the dough with a sharp knife. Bake until the top is puffed and lightly browned and a cake tester comes out clean, 60 to 75 minutes. Remove from the oven and use the parchment overhang to lift the bread from the pan.

Add the garlic and rosemary and cook about 1 minute, or until garlic is lightly browned.<br> Add the veal and pork and cook, smashing the meat apart with a wooden spoon, to keep it from clumping together. Cook for about 2 minutes and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the mushrooms and continue to cook about 4 minutes, evaporating any liquid and caramelizing the meat.<br> Add the porcini juice to the meat and cook for 1 minute to evaporate. Add the veal stock and cook for 2 minutes. Add the marinara and the wine. Reduce the heat and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the parsley.<br> Toss 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan into the sauce to help it bind. Add some reserved pasta water, as necessary, if the sauce appears too dry. Top with the remaining Parmesan. Heat the olive oil in a large non-reactive pot over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the parsley and garlic and cook briefly to release their fragrance. Add the tomatoes, basil and salt. Simmer briskly until reduced to a sauce like consistency, stirring occasionally so nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. The timing will depend on the ripeness and meatiness of your tomatoes and the size of your pot. If the sauce thickens too much before the flavors have developed, add a little water and continue cooking.<br> Taste and adjust the seasoning. If the sauce tastes too acidic, add the baking soda and cook for 5 more minutes. If it needs a touch of sweetness, add the sugar and cook for 5 more minutes.

Put the plate in the oven and heat the nachos until the cheese is totally melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Then dive right in and devour them. In a large, heavy pot, brown the ground beef with the garlic over medium heat until the beef is totally cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain off most of the excess fat, leaving a little behind for moisture and flavor. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and cayenne. Stir together well, cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally; if the liquid level seems low, add up to 1 cup water to keep it from burning. After an hour, stir in the kidney and pinto beans. In a small bowl, combine the masa harina with 1/2 cup water and stir together with a fork until it&#39;s smooth. Pour the masa mixture into the chili. Stir together well, then taste the chili and adjust the seasonings. Simmer the chili for another 10 minutes to thicken, then turn off the heat and let it cool.

Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Render the bacon bits in a medium high-sided saute pan over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon bits and reserve for serving later; reserve the rendered fat. Add the reserved rendered fat, heirloom tomatoes, garlic, some basil, vinegar and some olive oil to a medium saucepan and turn the heat to low. Allow the tomatoes to confit in the rendered fat until they are tender and have lost some of their juice, about 10 minutes. Rinse the branzinos under cold water and dry off with paper towels. Sprinkle the surface and cavities of the fish with salt and pepper. Slice the lemons into wheels and place in the cavities of the fish along with some fresh basil leaves. Place the fish on a sheet tray and bake until the fish is cooked through and the skin has crisped, 15 to 20 minutes. For the grits: Add 375 grams water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the polenta and stir to combine. Add the mascarpone and salt and stir until the mascarpone is melted. Stir in the butter, banana and Parmesan until completely incorporated and melted into the polenta. Place the halved romaine on the grill, cut-side down, and sear until grilled, about 2 minutes. Arrange the grilled baby romaine on a large platter. Top with the branzino, spoonfuls of the tomato vinaigrette and grits, then garnish with the bacon crumbles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 72981,&quot;Deep-Dish Pizza 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 packet fast-acting yeast 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon oil 1/2 cup cornmeal 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 large onion sliced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 green bell pepper or frying pepper, stem and seeds removed, and sliced 1/2 pound Italian sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (oregano, thyme, parsley) Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella Instructions: Dissolve salt and sugar in 1 1/2 cups warm water that is between 100 and 120 degrees F. (Warm water is needed to activate the yeast, but if it is too hot, it will kill the yeast. Use a candy thermometer to test the temperature.) Stir in entire contents of packet of yeast and allow the mixture to \form a head\ (like on a beer), which takes about 15 minutes. Place flour into mixing bowl and add yeast mixture. Stir to combine and then knead until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Knead for a few minutes so the dough becomes elastic. Cover bowl with a clean cloth and allow to rise and rest for 30 minutes. Then punch the dough down, knead again briefly, cover the bowl with the cloth and allow to rise a second time. For the filling: Heat the olive oil in a saute pan and cook onion until it begins to caramelize. Add garlic and sliced pepper, and cook until they soften. Add pieces of sausage allowing them to brown. Pour off fat and stir in tomato sauce and Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper. Cook together for a few minutes to allow flavors to blend, then remove from heat and set aside briefly. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. On a floured surface, stretch the dough into a 14-inch circle which is thicker around the edges. Transfer to a lightly greased 11-inch pie pan and shake cornmeal over the dough. Spoon the tomato/sausage mixture into the dough and sprinkle mozzarella over the top. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the pie sets up, about 10 to 15 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 72982,&quot;Homemade Pineapple Upside-Down Sundae 3 cups heavy cream 1 cup whole milk 3/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract Kosher salt 5 large egg yolks Pineapple Swirl: 1/2 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup light corn syrup One 8-ounce can crushed pineapple in juice 8 slices pound cake (1/2 inch thick) 8 slices canned pineapple Whipped cream, for serving 8 cherries with stems Instructions: For the ice cream: Whisk the cream, milk, sugar, vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the beaten yolks, then pour back into the saucepan, whisking, and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, coats the spoon and reaches 180 degrees F on a thermometer, 6 to 8 minutes. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl or measuring cup; discard the solids. Stir often until the mixture cools to room temperature. Lightly press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. (For faster chilling, set the bowl of custard in a bowl of ice water and stir until cold.) For the pineapple swirl: Combine the cream, butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a measuring cup and set aside. Cook the sugar, corn syrup and 1 tablespoon water in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, stirring occasionally. Increase the heat to medium high and bring the mixture to a boil. Cook, swirling the saucepan once or twice so that the caramel cooks evenly, until it reaches a medium amber color, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour the cream mixture into the sugar mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour about 3/4 cup of the caramel into a measuring cup and set aside. Stir the crushed pineapple and any juices into the remaining 1/2 cup caramel in the saucepan and return to medium heat. Cook until reduced and thickened, about 12 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes and then process in a food processor until pureed. Chill until ready to use. Freeze the cold custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Transfer half of the ice cream to an 8-inch square metal pan and swirl in 1/2 cup of the pineapple mixture with a butter knife, using circular motions to distribute the pineapple throughout the cream. Add the remaining ice cream and repeat with the remaining pineapple. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 2 to 3 hours. To assemble: Warm the caramel sauce in the microwave at high power for 30 seconds. Put a slice of pound cake in the bottoms of 8 bowls and top with a slice of pineapple, a scoop of ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream. Drizzle with caramel sauce and top with a maraschino cherry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 72983,&quot;Grilled Hanger Steak with Brandied Green Peppercorn Sauce 2 pounds hanger steak, trimmed<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons canola olive oil blend, plus more for drizzling 2 shallots, finely diced<br> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves<br> 1/4 cup brandy<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 2 tablespoons chopped green peppercorns, rinsed and drained<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Bring a large cast-iron grill pan to medium-high heat. Pat the steak dry and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil. Place the steak into the pan and sear until browned (without moving the steak), 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the steak over and cook a further 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. Remove the steak from the pan and add to a cast-iron pan. Put the steak into the oven for 5 minutes to finish cooking through. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest on a plate while you prepare the sauce. Place the cast-iron pan over medium heat and add the oil to heat. Once heated, add the shallots to the pan. Saute until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the thyme leaves, and then remove the pan from flame (for safety purposes) and add the brandy. Ignite the brandy by returning to the stove top and tilting the pan toward the open flame, or carefully lighting with a lighter or match. Once the flames subside, add the cream and swirl to incorporate. Add the peppercorns and simmer the sauce until it has reduced by two-thirds to a smooth, slightly thick consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Add any pan drippings to the sauce. Season with salt, if needed. To finish, remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the butter. To serve, slice the rested hanger steak into 1/2-inch strips, against the grain, and serve with a drizzle of brandied green peppercorn sauce over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 72984,&quot;Bucatini with Shaved Zucchini, Bacon and Pecorino 6 slices thick-cut bacon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 medium zucchini 1/4 cup grated pecorino or Parmesan, plus more as needed 1 pound bucatini pasta 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil (chiffonade) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cut the pound cake lengthwise in 4 equally thin rectangular slabs. Cut 1 of the rectangles in 1/2 widthwise, then cut another 1 of the rectangles in 1/2 lengthwise. You should have 2 full slabs, 2 thin rectangular strips, and 2 squares. Begin layering the meatloaf pan with 1 of the full slabs on the bottom, then the 2 strips on either side. Place the 2 squares of pound cake vertically on each end of the pan. The loaf pan should now be completely encased in pound cake. Lightly brush, our drizzle, the pound cake with the liqueur and leftover coffee, reserving some for the top piece. Scoop the ice cream into the cavity of the pound cake and smooth it out with a small offset spatula or your fingertips so that it is all even around the pan. Once the pan is full of ice cream, pour the remaining liqueur and coffee over the remaining piece of pound cake. Top the ice cream with the remaining piece of pound cake and press down. Cover the cake with the plastic wrap and put back in the freezer for at least an hour. Using the overhanging plastic wrap, remove the ice cream cake from the loaf pan.

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, uncovered and stirring a few times, until the rice absorbs the liquid, about 7 minutes. (The rice will only be par-cooked; it will continue to cook in the leaves.) Spread the rice out on a baking sheet to cool. When the rice is cooled, stir in the dill, parsley, green onion, pistachios and lemon zest; taste for seasoning. Lay a grape leaf on a work surface shiny-side down. Scoop 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of the filling (depending on the size of the leaf) in your hand and lightly mold it into a log. Put the rice filling near the stem end of the leaf, fold the stem end over the filling, then fold both sides toward the middle and roll up into a cigar. Continue with the remaining leaves and filling. Lay the reserved grape leaves on the bottom of a small Dutch oven (this will keep the dolmades from sticking). Tightly fit the dolmades in the pan in a concentric circle, making several layers if needed. Drizzle some of the remaining lemon juice over each layer. Add enough water or stock to just come halfway up the side of the rolls (do not cover them) and drizzle with the remaining olive oil and a pinch of salt. Cut out a round of parchment to fit over the dolmades. Place a plate on top of the parchment and a bowl on top of the plate (to hold the rolls down while cooking). Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, cover the pot and cook (making sure it is simmering and not boiling), until the rice is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes longer. Carefully remove the rolls to a serving dish. Serve warm, at room temperature or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 72996,&quot;Roast Beef Hash and Eggs 1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, unpeeled, 3/4-inch diced 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, 1/2-inch diced Good olive oil 2 cups sliced yellow onion (2 onions) 12 ounces (1-inch-thick-sliced) cooked roast beef, cut in 1-inch cubes 6 ounces Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon Sriracha 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 4 extra-large eggs 4 (1/2-inch-thick) slices bread from a boule, toasted 2 tablespoons minced chives, for serving Instructions: Place the diced potatoes in a medium saucepan, add water to cover by 2 inches, plus the vinegar and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, heat a large (12-inch) saute pan over medium heat, add the bacon, and saute for 6 to 8 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer the bacon to a plate using a slotted spoon. Put the potatoes in the saute pan and cook over medium to medium-high heat, tossing occasionally with a spatula, for 6 to 8 minutes, until the potatoes are lightly browned. If the pan is dry, add a few tablespoons olive oil. Add the bacon, onion, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper, toss well, and cook over medium heat for 8 minutes, tossing occasionally. Add the beef, Brussels sprouts, and Sriracha, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, tossing occasionally, until heated through and the sprouts are crisp-tender. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium (10-inch) saute pan. Carefully crack the eggs into the corners of the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until the whites are almost cooked. Cover the pan and cook over low heat for one minute, until the whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny. Spoon a serving of hash and place a piece of toast on each of 4 dinner plates. Place an egg on top of each piece of toast. Sprinkle with chives and salt and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 72997,&quot;Sea Bass Veracruzana 1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless sea bass, or other firm fleshed fresh fish, cut in 4 portions Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil, or butter 1 small yellow onion, peeled and thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 2 to 3 jalapenos, stemmed and sliced into 1/4-inch disks 1 lime, cut in 1/8ths 1 tomato, cored and seeded, cut in strips 1/2 cup Spanish green olives (picholines), pitted and sliced 1/2 bunch fresh oregano leaves, washed and roughly chopped 1/2 cup white wine 3/4 cup fish stock or clam juice Instructions: Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper.

Pour about 2 inches of water into a large saucepan and set up a collapsible steamer inside. Steam the onions until easily pieced by a knife, about 30 minutes. (For more tender onions you may steam them a little longer; however, they might be somewhat harder to hollow out. Either way they&#39;re delicious!) Set aside to cool.<br> Slice off about a third of the top portion of each onion. Using a paring knife, cut out the insides of each onion, leaving about 4 outside layers intact, to make a container for stuffing. Chop the onion insides and tops.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until crispy and the fat has rendered, about 3 minutes. Add the chopped onion, herb sprigs, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and sugar. Season with pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Add the wine and cook until dry, scrapping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to get up any browned bits, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cream and remove from the heat. Remove and discard the herb sprigs. Stir in the cheese and mustard.<br> Lightly butter a baking dish. Season the inside of the onions with salt and pepper, and spoon the stuffing into each onion cavity, mounding it slightly on top. Set the onions in the dish.<br> Heat the butter in the skillet. Add the breadcrumbs and stir until they absorb the butter. Spoon the buttered breadcrumbs on top of each onion.<br> Roast the onions until well browned and heated through, about 40 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73000,&quot;Pizza with Tomato, Mozzarella and Basil 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 2 cups canned plum tomatoes, crushed by hand, seeds removed 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper 1 teaspoon dry oregano 2 12-inch pizza crusts (recipe follows) 4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced 8 basil leaves Ceramic pizza stone Pizza peel 3 1/4 cups unbleached flour 2 teaspoons salt 1 cup warm water 1 envelope active dry yeast 3 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Set the pizza stone into a cold oven and preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a small sauce pan set over a low flame, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute before adding the tomatoes. Season the tomatoes with the salt, pepper and oregano and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Working on a lightly floured surface, pat one of the pizza dough balls into a flat round shape, working from the center outward. While forming the shape of a pizza crust, work with the tips of the fingers and form a 1/2-inch thick edge. Continue to work outward trying to achieve as even a thickness as possible. When the pizza dough is formed into shape transfer the dough to the peel and drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the surface. Sprinkle half the Parmesan cheese evenly over the oiled pizza dough and spoon 3 tablespoons of sauce over the surface. Evenly spread half of the mozzarella over the tomato and finish building your pizza with a few basil leaves roughly torn by hand. Place the pizza onto the pizza stone in the oven by sliding the pizza off of the peel and onto the hot stone. Repeat the process for the second pizza. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the surface is bubbling and the bottom of the crust is well browned.; In a bowl, combine the flour and salt, and mix thoroughly. In a separate stainless steel bowl, combine the water and yeast, and using a whisk, add 2 tablespoons of oil. Let rest for 5 minutes. Pour the water into the center of the flour, and with a spatula, stir to combine well into a sticky mass. Pour this mass out onto a lightly floured surface and begin to knead the dough by working the dough with the heel of the palm of your hand. Push outward and pull the inside edge over the top. Repeating the process over again to create a smooth ball of dough free of stickiness. Place the ball of dough into a clean stainless steel bowl that has been brushed with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise at room temperature for 1 1/2 hours or until it has doubled in size. When the dough has risen it can be divided in half and the two pieces formed into two balls which will later be patted into the traditional pizza shape.

You should be able to rub the mixture between your fingers and feel almost no grit. Add the cocoa powder and pulse very briefly just to mix. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites to very soft peaks and beat in the granulated sugar until the mixture is glossy, 1 minute, more. Sieve the almond-cocoa mixture over the egg whites and gently fold it in, being careful not to crush too much air out of the egg whites. Using a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip, pipe 1 1/2-inch circles of the mixture onto the parchment-lined baking sheets. Very gently poke a whole almond into the top of each one. Bake in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until firm, turning the pans around halfway through the cooking time to cook them evenly. Transfer the sheets of paper onto damp tea towels and let stand for 5 minutes, then peel the macaroons off and finish cooling them on a rack.

Mix together the yogurt and salt, and spoon into the cheesecloth. Wrap the edges of the cloth over the top of the yogurt, and place the sieve over a large bowl to collect all the whey that drips off. Place your contraption in the fridge and let it drain overnight. What&#39;s left on the top of the cheesecloth is labne!<br> For the vinaigrette: Use a sharp knife to separate the skin of the preserved lemon from the flesh. Discard the flesh. Cut the skin into a julienne, and then into a small 1/8-inch dice. Mix together the preserved lemon, olive oil, lemon juice and a small pinch of salt. Pit the green olives; I use a cherry pitter, which makes an easy and fun job out of it. Cut each olive in half lengthwise, then give them a rough chop. Mix into the vinaigrette.<br> Gently toss the greens into the vinaigrette. Spoon a few dollops of labne onto a plate or platter; top with the kohlrabi, a spoonful or two of the preserved lemon vinaigrette, a scattering of greens and olives, a few cracks of black pepper, and a pinch of sea salt.

Transfer the cookies to a food processor and pulse until finely ground, about 20 times. Pulse in the cream cheese, scraping down the sides to evenly mix as needed, until a dough forms, about 15 times. Add 1 tablespoon of the milk if the mixture is too thick (it should be the consistency of a soft sugar cookie dough). Transfer the dough to a large sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface. Cover with another large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out with a rolling pin to a 9-by-12-inch rectangle. Set aside. Combine the butter with the reserved creme filling in the same food processor and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add 1 cup of the confectioners\u2019 sugar and process until smooth. Add the remaining 1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar and a pinch of salt and process until smooth. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon milk and process until the buttercream is light and fluffy, about 30 seconds. Position the rectangle of dough with a shorter side facing you. Remove the plastic wrap on top and evenly spread the buttercream all the way to the edges on three sides of the rectangle, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the short side opposite you. Roll the dough away from you into a log using the plastic wrap to help and place it seam-side down. Tightly wrap with the excess plastic wrap and tie the two ends to tighten the roll.

(If it does not fit, cut the fillet of beef in half.) Add the meat and cover the pot so that the water returns quickly to the boil. When the water is back at a boil, uncover the pot and boil the beef anywhere from 14 to 17 minutes depending upon how rare you like it. While the beef is boiling, in another saucepan cook the potatoes in salted water for 20 minutes or until just tender. In a third shallow saucepan or in a Chinese style bamboo steamer, cook the carrots and leeks, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes or until just tender. To serve, remove the beef from the water and let it rest for 10 minutes. Remove the strings, slice, and serve half of it (reserve half for another dinner) with horseradish garlic mayonnaise and surrounded by half of vegetables (saving half for second time around soup, see below.) &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 73019,&quot;Chorizo Empanadas 6 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 12 ounces (3 sticks) butter, melted 2 teaspoons salt 2 eggs 3 cups cooked pork chorizo 1 1/2 cup mashed potatoes (leftovers are great for this) 1 cup shredded melting cheese, such as Oaxaca or mozzarella 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro Canola oil, for frying Instructions: For the empanada dough: Add the flour, butter, salt, eggs and 1 cup water to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on medium speed until a dough is formed. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and hold at room temperature for 30 minutes. For the chorizo filling: Mix together the chorizo, potatoes, cheese and cilantro in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix until combined, then set aside. Lightly flour a work surface and roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cookie cutter, punch out the rounds. Wet the dough rounds slightly with water. Place 1 to 1 1/2 ounces of filling on a round. Fold over and crimp with a fork. Repeat until all rounds are filled. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or Dutch oven fitted with a deep-fry thermometer to 350 degrees F.

Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick frying pan until hot. Lightly dust fish pieces with flour and add to the oil. Cook until fish is lightly browned, about 1 minute, turning once. Do not fully cook fish. Remove fish to the plate. To the same pan add onions, garlic, red pepper, mustard, and curry leaves; cook until the onions are soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in the water, tomatoes, and tamarind and bring to a boil. Simmer until the sauce is reduced and thickened, about 8 minutes. Gently slip in the fish and the accumulated juices. Cook until the fish is heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve garnished with herbs. Combine coriander, fenugreek, mustard, cumin, black pepper, fennel, cinnamon, cloves, and grind to a fine powder using an electric grinder. Stir in the turmeric and red pepper and transfer into a jar. Cover tightly and keep in a cool dry place. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 73021,&quot;Sweet Potato and Bacon Tots with Creamy Mustard Dipping Sauce Salt 2 large sweet potatoes, unpeeled 2 strips bacon 3 cups vegetable oil 3 heaping tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the sweet potato and bacon tots: Boil a pot of salted water. Add the potatoes and partially cook, about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set aside. Meanwhile, add the bacon to a small skillet over medium heat and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Finely chop the bacon when cooled. Heat the oil to 300 degrees F in a straight-sided skillet. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, shred the potatoes using either a box grater or shredding attachment on a food processor. Place 4 sheets of paper towels on a countertop. Dump the potatoes on top of the paper towels and fold the towels over the potatoes. Squeeze as much moisture out of the potatoes as possible. (This is the trick to make perfect tater tots; too much moisture will result in little pieces of potato all around your skillet when frying.) Combine the potatoes with the bacon, flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix well to combine. Form the potato mixture into small logs using a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon. Working in batches, fry the tots in the skillet until golden brown, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the heat, as needed, to keep the oil at 300 degrees F. Transfer the tots to a paper-towel-lined plate to strain excess fat. Sprinkle the tots with salt while still warm. For the creamy mustard dipping sauce: Combine the mayo, honey and mustard in a small bowl. Sprinkle the sauce with salt and pepper. Serve the sweet potato and bacon tots hot with the creamy mustard dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 73022,&quot;Slow-Cooker Irish Oats 4 cups frozen peach slices 2 cups steel-cut oats<br> 2/3 cup packed brown sugar 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup sliced almonds<br> 1 cup flaked coconut<br> 2 cups golden raisins 1 cup whole milk<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1 cup fresh blueberries<br> Honey, for drizzling<br> Instructions: Place the frozen peaches, oats, brown sugar, vanilla, salt and 8 cups water in the bowl of a slow cooker.

There are two options for making a chocolate canvas. The first one requires a plastic deli tray, on which you pour a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate (remember, the chocolate canvas will assume any pattern that exists on the tray). Allow it to set, and when it hardens, the chocolate will retract from the sides of the tray. To unmold the canvas, simply overturn the tray, being careful to support the chocolate. The second way is to use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate onto a sheet of parchment paper, being sure to spread it all the way to the edges. Lift the chocolate-covered paper by its corners and move it to a clean space on your work surface. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate will be firm enough to cut but it will not be hard. Use the tip of a sharp paring knife or X-Acto knife to cut a square or rectangular \canvas. Paints: Mix cocoa butter with food coloring until it has the viscosity of cooking oil. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 73029,&quot;Smoked Oysters on Crackers with Hot Sauce One 3.75-ounce can smoked oysters, drained 16 to 20 medium crackers 3 scallions, finely sliced 1 Fresno cl, diced Hot sauce Instructions: Place each of the oysters onto a cracker, and then sprinkle each with the scallions and chiles.

Combine the brown sugar, chili powder, smoked paprika, granulated garlic and 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Insert a butter knife between the membrane and bone on the back of the rack of ribs. Grab the membrane with a paper towel to grip it and pull off and discard the membrane. Sprinkle the spice mixture on both sides of the ribs and rub it in. Wrap the ribs tightly in aluminum foil and set on the indirect side of the grill. Cook, turning the package once, until the meat is tender and pulling from the bone but not totally falling apart, 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. For the BBQ sauce: Meanwhile, combine the ketchup, vinegar, light brown sugar, honey mustard, hot sauce, chili powder, smoked paprika, granulated garlic, liquid smoke if using and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. When the ribs are tender, remove them from the grill and unwrap them (leave the grill on). Let cool until you can touch the ribs without burning your fingers. With a knife, slit the skin on the back of the ribs and carefully pull out the bones, keeping the slab in one piece. Increase the grill temperature to high for cooking over direct heat. Add the boneless slab to the grill, rounded-side up, and brush with some of the BBQ sauce. Grill until the underside begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the slab and brush the underside of the ribs with more sauce. Continue to grill the ribs until they&#39;re glossy and caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes more. Place the ribs on the hero roll, brush with more sauce and top with onions and pickles. Cut into 4 pieces. Serve with the extra sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 73031,&quot;Sweet Potato Fries with Basil Salt and Garlic Mayonnaise 5 sweet potatoes, cut into about 1 by 5-inch \fries<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup mayonnaise 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium-low (you want the temperature to be 350 degrees F). For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ash-over briquettes to one side of the grill. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Open a 12.5-inch-by-8.5-inch flat fold-over grill basket (or two 19.4-by-1.5-inch kabob baskets) and place 8 of the graham cracker squares flat on the surface (dividing them between the kabob baskets if using). Top each graham cracker with 1 of the milk chocolate pieces. Place 2 marshmallow halves side by side on top of the chocolate with the cut-sides facing up (this will help the top graham cracker stay in place.) Place 1 of the remaining 8 graham cracker squares on top of each of the assembled stacks. Carefully close and clasp the grill basket(s) according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions, taking care not to crack any of the graham crackers. Place the grill basket onto the indirect section of the grill, cover the grill and cook until the chocolate just begins to melt and the graham crackers and marshmallows are beginning to toast, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the grill basket(s) and continue to grill with the lid open until the other graham crackers just begin to toast and the marshmallows are melting and toasted, about 1 minute more. Unclasp the grill basket and transfer the s\u2019mores to a serving platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 73034,&quot;20-Minute Sausage and Pepper Ravioli Skillet Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium green bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 medium red bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, minced One 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes One 10-ounce package Italian sausage ravioli 3 slices provolone (about 3 ounces) Fresh basil leaves, for serving Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Reserve 2 tablespoons of the spice mixture for the BBQ Sauce. Rinse and the dry ribs, then put on a clean cutting board and pull off the thin fatty skin that lines the underside of the ribs. Trim the ribs of excess fat and meat. Liberally season both sides of the ribs with the spice rub. Wrap the ribs with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate for at least 2 hours so flavors can develop and permeate the meat. Soak the wood chips in water for 1 hour before grilling. Preheat the grill to 250 degrees F. Using the hickory and charcoal, set up the grill for indirect heat. Arrange the ribs, meatier side down, on the far side of the grill away from the coals. Close the cover of the grill and cook the ribs for 3 hours. Turn and cook until the ribs bend, about 1 more hour. You will need to check on the charcoal and chips during the smoking process and replenish as needed. You will also need to maintain a temperature of 250 degrees F. Remove ribs from grill to a cutting board and sprinkle with more spice rub. Cut each slab into individual ribs and transfer to a serving platter. Serve the ribs with Southwest Barbecue Sauce. For dry ribs: Sprinkle Neely&#39;s BBQ seasoning over the ribs, cut between the bones and serve. Heat the canola oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Combine the butter, almonds, sugar, cocoa powder, egg yolks, cinnamon, flour and cayenne in a food processor and pulse to make a paste. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread the cocoa mixture over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on one of the long sides. Brush the clean border with water. Tightly roll the dough into an 18-inch log, rolling toward the clean border; pinch the seam to seal. Place seam-side down on the baking sheet; refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes. Slide the parchment off the baking sheet and cut the log in half lengthwise with a chef&#39;s knife. Slide back onto the baking sheet and pinch one end together with the cut sides facing in. Twist the two halves together, crossing one over the other a few times. Pinch the end together, then tuck both pinched ends under the loaf slightly. Cover the loaf loosely with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until plump, 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Uncover the loaf and bake, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until golden brown (a thermometer inserted into the middle should register 170 degrees F to 175 degrees F), 30 to 35 minutes. Make the topping: Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Brush the warm loaf with the melted butter and sprinkle with some of the cinnamon sugar. Let cool, then sprinkle with more cinnamon sugar. Warm 1/2 cup water and the milk in a saucepan over low heat until a thermometer registers 100 degrees F to 110 degrees F. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast on top, then sprinkle with a pinch of the sugar; set aside, undisturbed, until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla into the yeast mixture until combined. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, the remaining sugar, the salt and nutmeg. Make a well in the center, then add the yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon to make a thick and slightly sticky dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape into a ball. Brush a large bowl with butter. Add the dough, turning to coat lightly with the butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough is doubled in size, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and knead briefly to release excess air; re-form into a ball and return to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap and lay it directly on the surface of the dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 73056,&quot;Italian Egg Bread Bowl 1 round loaf good-quality Italian bread Olive oil, for drizzling, plus 2 tablespoons Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces loose sweet Italian sausage 1 small Spanish onion, halved and thinly sliced 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced 2 jarred Calabrian chiles, thinly sliced 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons torn fresh basil 10 large eggs, whisked until frothy 6 ounces grated provolone 1/4 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
