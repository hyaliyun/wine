lemon zest 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup marinara sauce Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a small baking dish with foil. Scoop out the seeds from the zucchini, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Combine the ricotta, 1/4 cup Italian cheese blend, the parsley, capicola and lemon zest and juice in a medium bowl. Season the zucchini with salt and pepper, then fill with the ricotta mixture. Drizzle each zucchini half with about 1 tablespoon marinara sauce, then sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup Italian cheese blend. Transfer to the baking dish and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 10578,&quot;Swirled Almond-Apricot Bark 1/2 pound bittersweet chocolate 1/2 pound white chocolate 1/2 cup slivered almonds 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots Toasted fennel seeds, for sprinkling Instructions: Line a baking sheet with foil, shiny-side up; smooth out the creases. Make sure all your tools are dry. Chop the bittersweet and white chocolate into 1/2-inch pieces with a large knife. Place all but 1/2 cup of the bittersweet chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave 15 seconds, then stir with a rubber spatula. Continue microwaving and stirring at 15-second intervals until melted, about 3 minutes total. Immediately add the reserved chopped bittersweet chocolate to the bowl; stir vigorously until melted and shiny. Repeat with the white chocolate in a separate bowl. Don&#39;t worry if there are a few small unmelted pieces. Pour the 2 chocolates side by side onto the prepared baking sheet; use the rubber spatula to swirl them together and spread into a 10-to-12-inch circle, about 1/4 inch thick. Press the almonds and apricots into the chocolate, arranging them so each bite has a mix of flavors and textures. Sprinkle with fennel seeds. Let the bark harden completely at room temperature, about 1 hour. (If the room is warm, you may need to freeze the bark for a few minutes.) Break into pieces and store in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 10579,&quot;Cheddar Beer Soup 1/4 cup garlic infused olive oil 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour 4 cups chicken stock 2 cups grated extra-sharp Cheddar 1 cup dark beer Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook until the mixture starts to bubble, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the stock and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Slowly incorporate the cheese stirring until fully melted and smooth. Add the beer and cook until heated through. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 10580,&quot;Winter Minestrone 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 onion, chopped 2 carrots, peeled and chopped 2 celery stalks, chopped 3 ounces thinly sliced pancetta, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 pound Swiss chard, stems trimmed, leaves coarsely chopped 1 russet potato, peeled and cubed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice 2 fresh rosemary sprigs 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed, divided 2 (14-ounce) cans low-sodium beef broth, divided 1 (1-ounce) Parmesan rind 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: In a large, heavy stockpot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, pancetta, and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the Swiss chard and potato. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and rosemary sprigs. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the chard is wilted and the tomatoes are very soft, about 10 minutes. In a food processor or blender, combine 3/4 of the beans with 1/2 cup of broth. Blend until almost smooth. Add the pureed bean mixture, remaining broth, and Parmesan rind to the vegetable mixture. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potato pieces are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the remaining beans and the parsley. Simmer until the beans are heated through and the soup is thick, about 2 minutes. Discard the rosemary stems (the leaves will have fallen off) and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 10581,&quot;Kalbigui (Barbecued Short Ribs) 2 pounds beef short ribs, cut into 2 inch lengths and butterflied 1 head romaine lettuce, separated into leaves, washed and dried 1/4 cup Asian (dark) sesame oil Kosher salt to taste Instructions: Place the butterflied short ribs in a large nonreactive baking dish. In a large bowl mix the marinade ingredients together and pour the marinade over the ribs. Cover the dish, refrigerate and marinate for 3 to 4 hours. Preheat grill. Remove short ribs from marinade. Oil the grill. Over high heat grill the short ribs until the fat is crisp and charred about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Alternately, meat may be cooked under the broiler. Wrap 1 or 2 pieces of the short ribs in romaine leaf. Serve at once with dipping sauce as an accompaniment.; same as above . &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 10582,&quot;Spaghetti and Meatballs 1 pound spaghetti Salt, for pasta water 1 1/4 pounds ground sirloin 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, eyeball it 1 egg, beaten 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs, a couple of handfuls 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano cheese 2 cloves garlic, chopped Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 4 cloves garlic, crushed or chopped 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 cup beef stock, available on soup aisle in market in small paper boxes 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes A handful chopped flat-leaf parsley 10 leaves fresh basil leaves, torn or thinly sliced Grated cheese, such as Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano, for passing at table Crusty bread or garlic bread, for passing at the table Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place a large pot of water on to boil for spaghetti. When it boils, add salt and pasta and cook to al dente. Mix beef and Worcestershire, egg, bread crumbs, cheese, garlic, salt and pepper. Roll meat into 1 1/2 inch medium-sized meatballs and place on nonstick cookie sheet or a cookie sheet greased with extra-virgin olive oil. Bake balls 10 to 12 minutes, until no longer pink. Heat a deep skillet or medium pot over moderate heat. Add oil, crushed pepper, garlic and finely chopped onion. Saute 5 to 7 minutes, until onion bits are soft. Add beef stock, crushed tomatoes, and herbs. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. Toss hot, drained pasta with a few ladles of the sauce and grated cheese. Turn meatballs in remaining sauce. Place pasta on dinner plates and top with meatballs and sauce and extra grated cheese. Serve with bread or garlic bread (and some good chianti!) &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barolo, Dolcetto, Montepulciano]&quot; 10583,&quot;Brined Rosemary Crusted Turkey with Pan Gravy 3/4 cup kosher salt 1/3 cup sugar 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons fennel seeds 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 4 cloves garlic, smashed 3 bay leaves 2 carrots, peeled and diced 2 ribs celery, diced 1 onion, diced One 12 to 14-pound turkey (free-range organic is great!) 3 sticks butter, at room temperature 1 bunch fresh rosemary, finely chopped Kosher salt 4 cloves garlic, smashed 2 ribs celery, cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 large onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 large celery root, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 bulb fennel, cut into 1/2-inch dice 5 bay leaves 4 sprigs fresh sage, tied in a bundle 1 bundle fresh thyme Kosher salt 1 quart chicken stock, plus more if needed 1/2 bottle dry white wine Instructions: For the brine: Combine 8 quarts cold water, the salt, sugar, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, garlic, bay leaves, carrots, celery and onions in a large container. Immerse the turkey in the brine and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days. To prepare the turkey for cooking: Remove the turkey from the brine the night before roasting and pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels. Combine the butter, rosemary and some salt in a small bowl. Taste it to make sure it tastes good. Work the butter under the skin of the turkey and massage it into the breasts and the legs. Massage the butter on the outside of the skin as well. Tie the legs together and over the breast so they will protect it during cooking to help keep it moist and juicy. Place the turkey on a sheet tray and refrigerate overnight UNCOVERED! Yes, that&#39;s right, uncovered. This will help the skin dry out and become really brown and crispy. Pay close attention not to have any food that will not be cooked near the turkey in the fridge. Thanksgiving Day: Take the turkey out of the fridge 1 hour before placing in the oven. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. For the gravy: Place the garlic, celery, onions, celery root, fennel, bay leaves, sage and thyme in a roasting pan and season with salt. Put the chicken stock and wine in the bottom of the roasting pan and place the turkey on top. Put the turkey in the oven until the skin of the turkey gets really nice and brown, about 40 minutes. Lower the heat of the oven to 350 degrees F for the remainder of the cooking time. Baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so and add more stock to the roasting pan if needed. Think about 17 minutes per pound for the turkey. Tent the turkey with aluminum foil when it gets to the proper color to prevent it from getting too dark. Remove the turkey from the oven when a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the turkey reads 160 degrees F. Be sure the thermometer is not touching a bone when doing the reading. When the turkey has reached the proper temperature, remove it from the roasting pan and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil. To finish the gravy: Remove the bay leaves, sage and thyme and from the roasting pan. Using an immersion blender, blend the veggies together until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed (it will). Carve the turkey, and don&#39;t fight over the drumsticks.

Set aside to proof. After 10 minutes, stir in the all-purpose flour, cover with plastic, set aside in a warm place and let it double in size. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the eggs, with the mixer on low speed, one by one. When the mix is smooth, add the vanilla and salt. Stir to blend. Add the bread flour and mix on low speed until fully incorporated. Change the electric mixer attachment to a dough hook. Continue mixing the dough until it becomes a ball. Then, stir in the yeast mixture until thoroughly incorporated. Put the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic and allow to proof, 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. Lightly flour a cool surface and roll the dough out to about 1 1/2-inch thickness. Cut rounds of dough with a cutter and turn them onto a floured baking sheet to rest, 20 to 30 minutes, before frying. Heat the oil in a large pot to 365 to 370 degrees F. Drop the beignets in the hot fat and cook until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon. Poke the pastry tip into the side of each beignet to inject some of the raspberry jam into the center of each and roll in the granulated sugar. Serve immediately with Vanilla Dipping Sauce. In a medium saucepan, bring the cream and milk to a simmer and add the vanilla beans. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until they become a pale yellow color, 3 to 5 minutes. When the milk/cream simmers, pour it gently over the egg yolks and whisk to blend. Pour the entire mixture back into the pot and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens slightly, 5 to 8 minutes. The sauce should register about 170 degrees F on a thermometer and still be smooth. Strain into a bowl, stir in the vanilla and allow to cool slightly before refrigerating. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 10585,&quot;Cubano Lettuce Wrap 8 slices boiled no-sugar-added ham (about 1/4 pound) 8 slices Swiss cheese (about 1/4 pound) 8 slices Mojo Pork Roast, recipe follows 1 kosher dill pickle, thinly sliced lengthwise 2 teaspoons yellow mustard 4 outer leaves Boston lettuce 1 (5-pound) bone-in fresh pork shoulder half (preferably arm picnic) 1 (16-ounce) bottle no-sugar-added Italian dressing (recommended: Paul Newmans Olive oil and Vinegar) 2 limes, juiced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 bay leaves Instructions: On a microwave proof plate, layer 2 slices ham, 1 slice cheese, 2 slices roast pork, 1 pickle slice and 1 more slice of cheese.

Tap the mold on the counter to encourage the air bubbles to depart. When the mold is full, set it aside and let it harden. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat with as many molds as you would like.<br> For the homemade transfer sheets: Place the powdered food colors in small bowls. I used orange, green and blue. Add a few tablespoons of cocoa butter to the food color and stir until well combined. Pour a little of the colored cocoa butter onto a clean dishtowel. This will serve as a blotter or ink pad for the color. Place the sheet of acetate on the work surface. Press the rubber stamp into the blotter and then press onto the acetate sheet. Continue using this same process to create as many colors and stamps as you like. Be sure to clean the rubber stamp between colors. If you need to reheat the cocoa butter, use a hair dryer or heat gun.<br> When the stamped transfer sheet has set, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch thick layer of white chocolate over the acetate sheet. Break the cooled colored chocolate into interesting free-form shapes.<br> Fill a cornet with bittersweet chocolate and use it to write names onto the transfer sheet shapes. This will be the place card for the candle.<br> To stick the candle halves together: Invert a flat baking sheet over a pan of hot water. Press one half of the candle against the warm surface. When the chocolate begins to melt, press the other half of the candle into place. Press the candle bottom onto the warm pan. Center the melted candle bottom on the base. Allow it to set until hardened.<br> Make the flame of the candle: Use an offset spatula to spread some white chocolate candle flames onto a sheet to acetate. The chocolate should be tapered at one end to resemble the flame. Allow it to set, then remove from the acetate. Press the bottom of the flame onto the warm baking sheet. Then adhere it to the top of the candle.<br> Place some powdered red food color in a small bowl. Add a few tablespoons of cocoa butter to the food color and stir until well combined. Use a paintbrush to paint the flame with the color.<br> Place a small amount of white chocolate in a cornet. Pipe white chocolate at the top of the candle until it runs down the side. This resembles the melted wax of a real candle. Place a small amount of bittersweet chocolate in a coronet and use it to make small dots for the candles&#39; eyes.<br> Use more tempered white chocolate to glue the nameplate to the base of the candle. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 10592,&quot;Green Enchilada Skillet Casserole 8 corn tortillas 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound ground turkey 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons chili powder 1 cup frozen riced mixed broccoli and cauliflower 1 4-ounce can diced green chiles 2 10-ounce cans green enchilada sauce (about 2 1/4 cups) 4 ounces pepper Jack or Monterey Jack cheese, diced 1/2 cup packed fresh cilantro, roughly chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450?

Transfer the almonds to a blender and add 2 cups fresh cold water. Blend on high until very smooth, about 2 minutes. It&#39;s okay if the mixture looks slightly grainy. Line the reserved sieve with a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth and place over a medium bowl. Working in batches, pour the blended almond mixture through the cloth in the sieve, separating the almond milk from any grainy bits. Gather the edges of the towel together and use your hands to squeeze out any remaining milk. Whisk in 1 teaspoon vanilla and/or 1 to 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup if using to flavor and sweeten the almond milk. Serve immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10607,&quot;Steak Pinwheels with Sun-Dried Tomato Stuffing and Rosemary Mashed Potatoes 1 2/3 cups canned beef broth 3/4 cup ready-to-use sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) 1/4 cup butter 1 (6.6-ounce) package stuffing mix 1 (1 1/4-pound) skirt steak Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Rosemary Mashed Potatoes, recipe follows 1 (11-ounce) package refrigerated prepared mashed potatoes 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter 1/4 cup whole milk 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Add broth, sun-dried tomatoes, and butter to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in contents of stuffing mix pouch. Cover saucepan and remove from heat. Let stand 5 minutes. Fluff stuffing with fork. Let stuffing cool completely. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lay steak flat on clean work surface and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover steak evenly with stuffing. Roll up steak lengthwise to create a pinwheel effect, enclosing stuffing completely. Skewer seam with toothpicks. Place the steak roll, seam side down, on a foil-covered cookie sheet. Sprinkle roll with salt and pepper.

Salt it and blanch the beet greens for 1 minute. Remove the leaves and immediately rinse under ice-cold water to set their color. Gently lay flat on tea towels, and pat dry with another tea towel. They should be completely dry. Line a buttered terrine mold with a piece of parchment. Neatly lay in the beet leaves to cover the bottom and sides completely. They should dangle over the sides a bit so that they can be folded over the completed terrine later. Cook the cauliflower, carrots and peas one at a time in the same pot of boiling salted water, until very tender. Remove them and immediately rinse in ice-cold water to preserve their color. Drain well. Roast the pepper until very soft. Peel, seed and cut into pieces. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. This terrine has five layers, so work one vegetable at a time. First put the cauliflower in the blender with 1/4 cup/60 ml cream and 1 egg. Pulse to a smooth puree. Pour into a small bowl and set aside. Rinse the blender and proceed with the remaining vegetables in the same manner, pouring their purees off into bowls and setting aside. Put the final egg and 1/4 cup/60 ml cream in the blender with the Parmesan cheese and puree to blend. Season each mixture with salt and pepper. If you pour one mixture on top of the other into the terrine, they will run together, so spoon them in instead. Start with the carrot, spooning it into the terrine and smoothing it out to the edges. Next, spoon over the cauliflower, followed by the peas. Spoon the Parmesan mixture over evenly, and end with the red pepper. If one leaks through to another layer, fear not: some think it is even more beautiful that way and in any case it will taste delicious. Fold the overhanging beet leaves over top to cover. Bake in a water bath until set, a good hour. Remove the terrine from the bath. Let it cool completely on a wire rack, and, if possible, chill in the refrigerator overnight so it sets well. At least half an hour before serving, turn the terrine out onto a cutting board or platter for serving in slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 10609,&quot;Asian-Style Baked Mahi Mahi 1 cup coconut milk 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken stock 1 teaspoon fish sauce 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 (2-inch) piece ginger, sliced into coins 1 serrano pepper, seeds removed and minced 1 tablespoon roughly chopped garlic 3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish 1/2 cup fresh Thai basil, chiffonade 4 (6-ounce) portions mahi mahi 1 leek, white part only, cleaned and julienned 1 red bell pepper, julienned 2 large carrots, peeled and julienned 1 lime, sliced into rings, plus 1 lime, cut into wedges, for garnish 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish Instructions: In an ovenproof non-glass baking dish (11 by 8-inch), combine the coconut milk, stock, fish sauce, lime juice, ginger, serrano, garlic, cilantro, and Thai basil.

Cut 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) cold butter into small cubes. Sift together the flour, baking powder and baking soda in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment. Turn the machine on low and pour in the sugar, salt and yeast. Mix the dry ingredients together thoroughly. With the machine running, gradually add the cubed butter piece by piece. Allow the mixer to slowly cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles cornmeal with some pea-sized clumps, about 5 minutes. Add the fresh thyme leaves and mix for 30 seconds more to combine. With the machine still running on low speed, pour in the buttermilk and sour cream. This will pull the mixture together into a sticky dough. Turn the machine off and add the Cheddar. Fold the cheese into the dough on low speed, for about 30 seconds. Scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Pull the dough together into a smooth disc. Using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out until it is 1 inch thick. Use a floured 2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut out biscuits. Place the biscuits on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Collect the dough scraps and roll out and cut again just once more, then discard scraps. Melt the remaining 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter in the microwave. Brush the tops of the raw biscuits with half of the melted butter. Bake the biscuits until evenly golden brown, 22 to 25 minutes. Brush the biscuits with the remaining melted butter.

Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the sugar is just dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Set a strainer over a 2-cup liquid measure. Cut off the top quarter of 8 lemons, then cut a very thin slice from the bottom to make a flat base. Squeeze the juice from the lemon tops into the liquid measure; discard the tops and bottoms. Stand up a cut lemon and, using a paring knife, cut around the inner edge of the peel, so you cut the flesh away from the peel. Switch to a spoon and use the incision as a guide to scoop out all the flesh from the inside of the lemon, leaving behind a lemon \cup.\ Place the flesh in the strainer over the liquid measure and squeeze out all the juice. Repeat with the other 7 lemons. Freeze the lemon cups until ready to serve. Zest and juice the remaining 4 lemons; reserve 1 tablespoon zest for the topping. You&#39;ll need 2 cups of fresh lemon juice in all; if you have any excess, store it in the fridge or freezer for future use. Mix together the cooled simple syrup and the 2 cups lemon juice. Pour the mixture into an ice cream machine and freeze following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Remove the sorbet to an airtight container and hold in the freezer for at least 2 hours before serving. On a small plate, mix together the reserved lemon zest and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Spread the mixture in an even layer and set aside for at least 30 minutes to dry out slightly. When ready to serve, scoop the sorbet into the frozen lemon cups and top with sugared lemon zest. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 10630,&quot;Microwave Chocolate Pudding Cake Nonstick cooking spray 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process) 1/2 teaspoon baking soda Kosher salt 2/3 cup buttermilk 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Spray the inside of a microwave-safe 2-quart 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, 1/4 cup of the cocoa powder, baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Break up some of the larger brown sugar clumps with your fingers. Make a well in the center, add the buttermilk and oil and stir until everything is just combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish with a rubber spatula. Smooth the top. Put 1 cup water in a microwave-safe 2-cup or larger measuring cup. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) until steaming hot, 2 minutes in an 1,100-watt oven or 3 minutes in a 700-watt oven. Add the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup cocoa powder, the vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and whisk to dissolve the sugar. Pour over the batter in the baking dish. Do not stir in. Microwave the cake on high (at 100 percent power) until the top is mostly set and dry to the touch, 8 minutes in an 1,100- or a 700-watt oven. (If the cake is slightly wet in the center, that&#39;s OK; it will continue cooking as it sits.) Let cool for at least 30 minutes. When you cut into the cake, you will notice a gooey chocolate pudding layer at the bottom; be sure to scoop some with each serving. Serve the cake warm or at room temperature with ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]</li></ol><p>&quot; 10631,&quot;Cajun Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya 2 pounds mild smoked pork sausage, or any lean high-quality smoked pork sausage, sliced 1/4-inch thick 2 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thigh meat 1 1/2 pounds onions, diced 2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic 1 pound tasso, cubed 3/4 tablespoon whole fresh thyme leaves 3/4 tablespoon chopped fresh sweet basil leaves 1/2 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper 1/2 tablespoon white pepper 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes 1/3 gallon chicken stock 1 1/4 pounds long-grain rice 1 tablespoon freshly chopped curly parsley leaves Instructions: The most important thing is to use the right equipment and I would suggest the following: a 2-gallon cast iron Dutch oven, a high BTU gas stove, and a large stainless steel chef&#39;s spoon. Use high heat to preheat the Dutch oven and add the sausage. Using a chef&#39;s spoon or large spoon, constantly move the sausage from the bottom of the pot. Be careful not to burn the meat. (Normally I use Manda&#39;s sausage because it has little fat, however at this point you may want to drain off all of the excess grease to reduce the fat content from the dish.) Add the thigh meat and brown the chicken on all sides. Again use the spoon to scrape the meat from sticking and burning to the bottom of the pot. Browning the sausage and chicken meats should take 20 minutes. Be careful not to over cook the thigh meat to the point that it shreds. Lower the heat to medium and add the onions and garlic; saute for about 15 minutes or until the onions are very limp and \clear. Scrape the bottom of the pot to remove all the \graton. This is where the jambalaya gets its distinct brown color and taste. Add the tasso, thyme, basil and black and white pepper. Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. This will give the seasonings time to release their oils and flavors. At this point the jambalaya concentrate can be transferred to smaller containers, cooled to room temperature, covered and refrigerated for future use. (This is what we do commercially; it allows the seasonings to marry.) When you are ready to cook the jambalaya, add the stock to the concentrate and bring to a rolling boil. Add the rice, reduce the heat to medium and gently break up the rice. Using the stainless steel paddle, continue to insure that the rice is not sticking to the bottom of the pot; this is very important! After about 5 minutes, fold in the parsley. Continue to scrape the pot to insure that no rice sticks to the bottom. When the jambalaya returns to a boil, reduce heat to the lowest possible setting and simmer, covered, for at least 25 minutes. Do not remove the cover while the rice is steaming. If Manda&#39;s brand sausage is not available, any lean smoked sausage can be substituted. You may have to remove any excess grease from the pot after frying down an unknown sausage. For a richer jambalaya substitute turkey stock for the chicken stock called for above. If no stocks are available, then chicken soup base can be used. Be careful with your seasoning, as bases are usually full of salt. Alternate Method: The jambalaya is best when served directly out of the cast iron pot. While the rice is steaming, the sausage and meat will have a tendency to float to the surface of the jambalaya. Therefore, after the rice has steamed for 25 minutes, use the paddle to gently fold in the meat and seasonings into the cooked rice. This should only be done once or twice, the rice will loose a lot of heat and the rice will break apart. Also note, I do not add salt to my jambalaya. This is because I like to use herbs, tasso and seasonings to satisfy the need for salt. I would suggest having the table set with salt shakers and a selection of hot pepper sauces.

Line a half-sheet tray with parchment paper. In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the pistachios and 1/4 cup flour until the nuts are finely ground. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter and granulated sugar until very light. Beat in the pistachio paste and lemon zest and juice, then add the eggs one at a time. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and beat in the pistachio and vanilla extracts. In a small bowl, mix together the nut and flour mixture, salt, baking powder and remaining cup flour. Beat the dry ingredients into the batter. Spread the batter evenly in the lined half-sheet tray. Bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the tray and continue to bake until the cake springs back lightly when touched and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, another 10 minutes. Allow the cake to cool in the tray for 10 minutes, then gently remove from the tray. For the lemon curd: Combine the lemon zest, juice, granulated sugar, eggs and salt in a medium saucepan and whisk to a homogeneous consistency. Place over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, 2 pats at a time, until it&#39;s incorporated and has a silky consistency. Transfer to a bowl. Place a piece of plastic wrap over the top, pressing down on the surface of the curd to prevent a film from forming. Put in the fridge to chill for 1 hour. For the lemon mascarpone mousse: In a large, chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks. In another large bowl, whip the mascarpone and granulated sugar together until fluffy. Whip in half of the lemon curd. Fold in the whipped cream and use a rubber spatula to fluff the mousse. Transfer the mousse to a piping bag fitted with a star tip. To assemble the cake: Cut the cake into individual cakes with a 3-inch ring cutter. Spread a dollop of lemon curd on the bottom of a plate. Place 2 cake rounds on top. Pipe a round of mousse onto each cake. Garnish each cake with chopped pistachios, a dusting of powdered sugar and the chopped rosemary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10633,&quot;Moscow Turkey Dried cranberries, for garnish 1/2 ounce Simple Syrup, recipe follows, plus more for soaking the cranberries 1 1/2 ounces vodka<br> 1 ounce orange juice<br> 1 ounce unfiltered cranberry juice<br> 1 ounce ginger beer<br> 1 cup sugar Instructions: Put a handful of cranberries in a small bowl and cover with some Simple Syrup.

Add apple juice, orange juice and rice wine vinegar, cover and allow the apples to cook until very soft. Then uncover and allow liquid to reduce to about 1/3 of what you started with. Puree in a blender or food processor. Create a slurry by gradually whisking cornstarch into about 1/4 cup water and blend the slurry into the sauce. Return the sauce to the pot and allow to cook for a few minutes to thicken. Season with salt, if needed. Begin the creamed leeks while the apples are cooking. Heat the olive oil and butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat and saute onion until translucent. Deglaze the pan with wine and reduce until the liquid is almost all gone. (While you are waiting for the wine to reduce, start cooking the leeks.) Cook the leeks in simmering water until tender. Drain and set aside. When the wine has mostly evaporated, stir in the cream, season with salt and pepper, and lower heat to a simmer to allow to reduce and thicken. Strain this sauce and pour over the leeks and set aside briefly in a warm place. For the fish: Season the salmon fillets with coarse sea salt and both peppers. Place a little oil into the saute pan and bring to smoking point (you need a hot pan in order to get a crispy outside). Cook the salmon, skin side down leaving undisturbed (no peeking) for about 5 minutes, or until the skin begins to get crispy, then turn and begin cooking for 4 minutes more. This allows the surface of the fish to \caramelize.\ (You may need more time on the salmon depending on the thickness). You can, if you wish, finish the salmon in a preheated 350 degree F oven. However, DO NOT OVERCOOK THE SALMON. Once you touch the flesh and it springs back up, it&#39;s cooked. Remember, because of carryover cooking, the fish will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven. Reheat the apple butter sauce if necessary. Place 4 lengths of the creamed leeks on one side the serving plate, with a salmon fillet on the other. Spoon apple butter sauce on the fish and garnish with lemon thyme.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat together the butter, brown sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the vanilla and egg until just combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again, reduce the speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated, about 1 minute. The dough will hold together and be loose and sticky. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions, about 1 heaping tablespoon each. Using your hands, roll each portion into a ball about the size of a golf ball. Roll the dough balls in the cinnamon-sugar mixture and place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart. Bake until the cookies are set and the edges are slightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, divide the softened ice cream between 2 pint-size paper soup-to-go containers (which should be about the same diameter as the cookies), then freeze. When ready to assemble the ice cream sandwiches, place the pecans on a small, flat dish. Using a serrated knife, cut 1-inch rounds of ice cream--straight through the containers--to make big beautiful circles of ice cream to fill the sandwiches. Add an ice cream round to the bottom of one of the cookies and then cover with a right-side up cookie, pressing down to form a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ice cream rounds. Roll the sandwiches on end in the pecans, using your hands if necessary to help the nuts adhere to the exposed ice cream edge. Serve immediately or freeze, covered, for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10673,&quot;Achiote Marinated Baby Chickens Stuffed with Chorizo and Mustard Greens 1 package achiote paste 1/2 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon toasted cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano 2 poussins or baby chickens 4 large links of hard dried Spanish chorizo 1 Spanish onion, diced 5 tablespoons garlic, chopped 1 bunch mustard greens, cleaned, trimmed and roughly chopped 1/2 cup chicken stock 1 baking potato, like russet, peeled, diced and blanched 2 tablespoons sliced green olives Salt and pepper Instructions: Combine in a food processor achiote paste, olive oil, cumin, coriander, oregano, and the 1-tablespoon of garlic.

If you can&#39;t see the difference between the \thick\ white and the \thin\ white, the yolks will probably break in the pan. Always deliver the eggs to the pan with a custard cup or large spoon. Avoid cracking directly into the pan. When using a non-stick skillet cook in no more than an inch of water. If you don&#39;t have a non-stick pan, poach in a deep saucepan containing at least 3 inches of water. Always acidulate the poaching liquid with either vinegar or lemon juice (1 tsp per each cup of water). Bring liquid to a boil, add eggs, then remove from heat and cover. How long you ask? It depends on how many eggs. I like my yolks barely runny so I&#39;ll cook 4 eggs for 7 to 8 minutes depending on their size. Since more eggs will absorb more heat from the water, they will take longer to cook, so for large batches always include an extra \test\ egg. Always remove eggs with a slotted spoon. Poached eggs can be refrigerated in ice water for up to 8 hours, then reheated in hot water. Do not re-boil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10700,&quot;Orange Cream Mimosa 2 1/2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice (5 to 6 oranges) 1 orange, zested 1 cup half-and-half 1 cup superfine sugar 1 bottle sparkling wine or Champagne* Strawberries, for garnish *Non-alcoholic sparkling wine, sparkling cider, or ginger ale can be substituted.

Pour this mixture into a shallow pan and freeze until hard, 4 hours or overnight. Remove the frozen orange mixture from the freezer and let it sit to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. With a scoop or tablespoon, scrape out a small scoop and put it into a Champagne glass. Slowly fill the glass with Champagne and serve garnished with strawberries. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Prosecco, Cava]&quot; 10701,&quot;Chicken Pot Pie Popovers Baking spray with flour, for the muffin pan 1 cup whole milk 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1/3 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup shredded Cheddar 1 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed 1/2 cup frozen cut green beans, thawed 1/2 rotisserie chicken, skin discarded, white and dark meat shredded (about 3 cups) 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped, for garnish, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup muffin pan generously with the baking spray. Whisk the milk, flour, vanilla, eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until combined. Drizzle in the melted butter while whisking until combined; let the batter stand for 5 minutes. Add the baking powder, whisking to combine, and divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups (about a scant 1/4 cup batter per muffin cup). Bake the popovers until puffed and browned around the edges, rotating the pan about halfway through, 20 to 25 minutes. While the popovers are baking, whisk together the broth and flour in a medium saucepan until the flour is dissolved. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking continuously, until the mixture comes to a boil; continue to cook, whisking, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and half of the Cheddar. Stir in the peas and carrots, green beans and then the chicken; cover to keep warm. When the popovers are done, turn them out of the pan, using a small spatula if necessary. Arrange 2 popovers on each of 6 plates or bowls and top with the chicken filling, dividing evenly among the popovers. Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar over the warm filling. Garnish with chopped parsley if using. Serve with the iced tea. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 10702,&quot;Praline Semi-Freddo 1 vanilla bean 1/4 cup sugar 4 large fresh eggs, separated 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream Salt 1 recipe Praline (see below) 11 ounces peeled hazelnuts 7 ounces sugar 4 tablespoons water Instructions: Remove the seeds from the vanilla bean by scoring down the length and scraping the seeds out of each half. Whisk the vanilla seeds and sugar with the egg yolks in a large bowl until pale. In a second bowl whisk the cream until soft peaks form. (Important! Please don&#39;t overwhip it.) Then in the third bowl whisk or beat the egg whites with an electric mixer with a pinch of salt until they form very firm peaks (this is when you can pull the egg whites in any direction and they will stay like it). At this point add the praline, the cream and egg whites, to the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold in. Immediately scoop the contents into your chosen container. Cover wtih plastic wrap and freeze until you&#39;re ready to eat it. Roast the hazelnuts in the oven at 225C/425F/Gas 7 until golden (about 4 minutes). Really watch them, because if you over-roast them they go bitter and you can&#39;t use them. Put the sugar and water in a thick-bottomed pan and place on a medium to high heat. The mixture will start to bubble and then turn into a clear syrup. To begin with, it will gradually start to color in parts or from the sides. Gently and carefully shake the pan, just moving it to mix the patches of color. When it&#39;s all golden brown, carefully tip it away from you and gently add the nuts. Turn the heat down to a simmer and gently stir to coat the nuts in caramel. When the caramel is dark golden brown, turn it out on to a clean, lightly oiled tray, or on to greaseproof paper on a surface that won&#39;t burn. It will cool to a flattish solid sheet. When completely cooled (which takes about 20 minutes), smash it up roughly and pulse it in a food processor until the pieces are still quite chunky (very approximate size about 1/2 cm/ 1/4-inch). Remove about half the praline, then pulse the rest to a powder (or put it in a tea-towel and bash with a rolling-pin), and add both lots of praline to the semi-freddo mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10703,&quot;Classic Deviled Eggs 6 eggs 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 teaspoon white vinegar 1 teaspoon yellow mustard 1/8 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper Smoked Spanish paprika, for garnish Instructions: Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover with enough water that there&#39;s 1 1/2 inches of water above the eggs. Heat on high until water begins to boil, then cover, turn the heat to low, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and leave covered for 14 minutes, then rinse under cold water continuously for 1 minute. Crack egg shells and carefully peel under cool running water. Gently dry with paper towels. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise, removing yolks to a medium bowl, and placing the whites on a serving platter. Mash the yolks into a fine crumble using a fork. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper, and mix well. Evenly disperse heaping teaspoons of the yolk mixture into the egg whites.

Place the ahi steaks in the bowl, and carefully roll and flip the steaks to ensure they are completely coated. Remove the steaks to a plate and refrigerate until ready to cook. For the vinaigrette: Mix together the honey, vinegar, pepper and mustard in a small bowl, then stream in the oil, whisking constantly. For the salad: Slice, dice, chop and mix the spring mix, capers, carrots, tomatoes, cabbage, cucumber, romaine and onion, to your liking, then toss with some vinaigrette and plate four salads. Place one lemon wedge on the side of each plate and quarter the avocados. Slice each quartered avocado 3 to 6 times, creating an avocado fan out of each quarter. Set aside. Before heating your grill, you will need to scrape, clean and then oil it. Once clean, preheat to medium-high and close until ripping hot, about 10 minutes. Fold a clean dish towel into a squarish 4-by-6-inch block. Pour 2 cups vegetable oil into a bowl and dip one side of your dish towel block in the oil. Open the grill and begin coating grill grates with the oiled towel block. Repeat until grill grates are slick and clean. Pour the sesame oil on a small plate. Place each steak in the sesame oil on both sides, then on the grill. Cook for 1 minute on each side. Then pull immediately from grill, slice 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick with a heavy sharp blade and place directly on your plated salads. Top each salad with an avocado fan. Lastly, pair your dish with a nice Chardonnay or a local IPA.

Rehydrate the apricots by covering them with boiling water and steeping them for 10 minutes before draining and slicing into quarters. Pit and roughly chop the dates, mix them with the apricots, and set aside. Combine the sugar with all of the liquid ingredients. Bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes, then set aside. Season the Cornish Hens, inside and out, with salt and pepper. Place 1 bay leaf and 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme inside each bird and close the body cavity by tieing with twine or with a skewer or toothpicks so that the bird holds its shape. Brush the hens with olive oil, place them breast side down in a roasting pan, and roast for 20 minutes. At the end of 20 minutes, pour off any excess fat from the pan turn the birds breast side up and roast 20 minutes more. At the end of this 20 minute roasting period, add the apricots, dates, and the liquid to the roasting pan, and braise the contents of the pan together for another 25 minutes. Check the oven every so often to see that the liquid has not all evaporated. If it has, add enough water to keep the bottom third of the hens moist. At the end of the cooking time, allow the hens to rest 10 minutes before serving. Place one hen on each dish and pour some of the apricot and date sauce over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 10717,&quot;Biscuits de Chocolat Small Chocolate Cakes Two 1-ounce squares semisweet chocolate, grated 1 cup sugar 4 egg yolks 8 egg whites, beaten stiff 1/2 cup cake flour 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Put the swordfish in a large bowl. Put the peppers, onions, zucchini and tomatoes in another large bowl. Evenly divide the olive oil mixture between the two bowls and toss to coat. Cover and let marinate for about 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature. For the garlic aioli: Meanwhile, whisk together the lemon juice, mayonnaise, cilantro, parsley, garlic, mustard, vinegar and hot sauce in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. When the fish and vegetables are ready, preheat a grill over medium-high heat. (If using wooden skewers, soak in water for at least 30 minutes before grilling.) Meanwhile, thread the swordfish onto six 12-inch skewers. Thread the peppers, onions, zucchini and tomatoes onto individual skewers. Brush the grill grates with oil. Place the kebabs on the grill, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill until lightly charred and grill-marked and the swordfish is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes per side. To serve, spread 1 to 2 teaspoons of garlic aioli on top of each pita. Place the swordfish and vegetables on top, drizzle with more garlic aioli, and sprinkle with cilantro and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 10719,&quot;Homemade Yogurt With Apple Compote 4 cups whole milk 1/4 cup nonfat dry milk 1/4 cup maple syrup (optional) 1/4 cup plain yogurt with active cultures 6 cups diced peeled Granny Smith apples 1/4 cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon a pinch of salt 1/4 cup water a pinch of salt Instructions: Heat the milk in a large saucepan over medium-low heat until a thermometer registers 185 degrees F. (The milk should be steaming but not boiling.) Turn off the heat and slowly whisk in the dry milk. Whisk in the maple syrup, if using. Let the milk mixture cool to 110 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. Whisk in the plain yogurt. Pour the milk mixture into a large jar or glass bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap vented with a few holes. Set aside in a warm place (90 degrees F to 105 degrees F), such as near a heater or in a cooler with a thermos filled with hot water, 12 to 18 hours. (The longer it sits, the thicker and tangier the yogurt will be.) Transfer the yogurt to the refrigerator; chill at least 8 hours. Stir before serving. Combine 6 cups diced peeled Granny Smith apples, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, a pinch of salt and 1/4 cup water in a skillet over medium heat. Simmer until soft, stirring, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 10720,&quot;California Avocado Toast with Fried Egg 1 slice True Goodness? by Meijer?

Coat three 6-by-3-inch heart-shaped cake pans with flour-based baking spray; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, combine the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla extract and vegetable oil. Beat on medium-low speed until combined. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture a little at a time. Scrape down the bowl and mix again briefly. In a small bowl, combine the boiling water, bittersweet chocolate and espresso powder. Mix until the chocolate is melted and the espresso is dissolved. With the mixer running on low speed, add the chocolate mixture to the batter. Mix until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix again until a thin batter forms. Divide the batter among the prepared pans, filling each no more than two-thirds full. Bake until the cakes are well puffed and the centers are set, about 30 minutes; a toothpick tester should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it when the cake is properly baked. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out to wire racks to cool completely. When the cakes are cool, level the tops using a serrated knife or cake leveler. For the pink vanilla buttercream: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, combine the butter and confectioners\u2019 sugar. Mix until crumbly, about 1 minute. Add the vanilla extract and beat again on medium-high speed. Lower the speed and add the milk or cream 1 tablespoon at a time to thin the mixture. Beat on high speed until the frosting is thick, white and fluffy. Add the pastel pink gel food color a little at a time until a soft but consistent pastel hue is achieved. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag with a hole snipped in the end. Place a cake layer on a serving plate or cake board. Top the cake so that it has a 1/4-inch layer of buttercream; smooth with an offset spatula. Repeat with a second cake layer and more buttercream. Top with the remaining cake layer. Pipe the buttercream all around the edges and top of the cake. Smooth the surface using an offset spatula. Refrigerate the cake until set, about 30 minutes. For the marshmallow fondant: Place the marshmallows and 1 1/2 teaspoons water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring well between each, until the mixture can be stirred smooth. This will take about 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar and stir to combine. When the mixture is too stiff to stir, knead with gloved hands until smooth and pliable. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if the mixture is sticky or too lax to hold its shape when you roll it into a ball. On a confectioners\u2019 sugar-dusted work surface, cut the fondant into 6 portions. Tint each portion with one color of each food coloring so that you have a ball of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. Roll each color of fondant except the red to 1/8 inch thickness. Using a 2.5-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out 2 hearts from each piece (you may not use all of the hearts on the cake, but have extra for practice when penning messages). Transfer them to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and let them dry for 20 minutes, or until the surfaces are dry and firm to the touch. Using a red food color marker, pen unromantic messages on each heart, such as NO THX, NOPE, NEXT, BYE, PASS and CYA. Let stand until dry, about 5 minutes. Apply dots of leftover buttercream to the backs of the hearts to apply them to the outside of the cake. Press gently because the dry surfaces of the hearts will crack with too much pressure. Roll out the red fondant to 1/8 inch thickness. Use 1.5-inch letter fondant cutters to cut out \u2018ITS OVER\u2019. Use a small paring knife or kitchen-dedicated X-Acto knife to freehand cut a small apostrophe from the fondant. Apply the message to the top center of the cake. Use leftover frosting on the backsides of each letter if they don\u2019t stick naturally. Refrigerate the cake to set the decors, about 10 minutes. Bring the cake to room temperature before serving for best flavor and texture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10722,&quot;Herb Grilled Vegetables 1/2 cup Swanson? Chicken Broth (Regular, Natural Goodness? or Certified Organic) 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves, crushed 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 large red onion, thickly sliced (about 1 cup) 1 large red or green pepper, cut into wide strips (about 2 cups) 1 medium zucchini or yellow squash, thickly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups) 2 cups large mushrooms Instructions: Stir the broth, thyme and black pepper in a small bowl. Brush the vegetables with the broth mixture. Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium. Grill the vegetables for 10 minutes or until they&#39;re tender-crisp, turning over once during cooking and brushing often with the broth mixture. Tip: A grilling basket is handy for grilling smaller foods like these veggies. Just place the vegetables in a single layer in the basket, close and place on the grill. You can baste the vegetables right in the basket, and flip the basket to grill the other side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 10723,&quot;Orange-Pistachio Phyllo Diamonds 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus more for the pan 1 7-ounce log almond paste, broken into small pieces 2 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons orange blossom water 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 8 ounces frozen phyllo sheets, thawed and torn into pieces 3/4 cup fresh orange juice 1/4 cup honey 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup unsalted pistachios, finely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking dish. Combine the almond paste, whole eggs, egg yolks, melted butter and 1/4 cup sugar in a food processor. Pulse until combined with a few small lumps of almond paste. Add 1 tablespoon orange blossom water, the baking powder, salt and vanilla; pulse to combine. Add the phyllo pieces and pulse until finely chopped. Spread the mixture evenly in the prepared pan. Bake until golden brown and firm on top, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the syrup: Heat the orange juice, honey, lemon juice, the remaining 3/4 cup sugar and the remaining 1 tablespoon orange blossom water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Remove the baking dish from the oven and immediately pour half of the syrup over the cake; let soak in, 15 minutes. Add the pistachios to the remaining syrup and pour over the cake, spreading the pistachios with a rubber spatula. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely in the pan, about 3 hours, tipping the pan occasionally to distribute the syrup.

Drain, let cool then cut each potato into rounds and wedges. Potatoes can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated and cut just before grilling. While the potatoes are cooking, combine the zest, juice, garlic, mustard, rosemary and salt and pepper in a blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the extra-virgin olive oil and blend until emulsified. Can be made 1 day in advance and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before using. Heat the grill to high. Brush the potatoes on both sides with the canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the potatoes on the grill, cut side down and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the potatoes over, and continue grilling until just cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Remove the potatoes and cut each half in half lengthwise and then crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Transfer to a platter and immediately drizzle with the vinaigrette and toss to combine.

Let cool. Sift the flour, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, salt and clove into a large bowl. Mix the melted butter into the flour mixture with an electric mixer on medium-low until sandy. Add the corn syrup and vanilla, and mix until evenly incorporated, but still crumbly in texture. Press the dough together by hand and divide into 4 equal portions. Press into disks about 1/2-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Dust the dough and a work surface with flour. Roll 1 piece of the dough out about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into desired shapes. Transfer cut-outs to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets leaving about 2-inches in between each. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Gather up the scraps, re-roll and cut out. Position oven racks to the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the gingerbread until a rich tawny brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes and then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Decorate as desired with the Royal Icing. Store at room temperature in an air-tight container for up to 5 days. Repeat with the remaining dough. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and 3/4 cup water in a large bowl. Mix slowly with an electric mixer on medium-low until stiff enough to form peaks. The icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is over beaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, and then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting. Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. (Adding too much color reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days.) Store the icing, covered, with plastic wrap on the surface. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 10730,&quot;Slow Cooker Red Beans and Rice 1 pound dried red beans 1/2 pound andouille sausage, chopped<br> 3 ribs celery, chopped<br> 1 smoked ham shank<br> 1 medium onion, chopped<br> 1 large green bell pepper, chopped<br> 1 tablespoon chili powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne<br> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar<br> Kosher salt<br> 4 cups chicken stock<br> 8 cups cooked long-grain white rice, for serving<br> 4 scallions, chopped<br> Instructions: In a slow cooker, combine the beans, andouille, celery, ham shank, onions, bell peppers, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne, onion powder, paprika, brown sugar and 2 teaspoons salt.

Set aside. Combine the egg whites and salt in the bowl of a very clean and dry mixing bowl. Whisk with an electric mixer until the egg whites become foamy. Slowly add the superfine granulated sugar and beat on high until you get stiff, white peaks (this can take a few minutes). Set aside about one-quarter of the meringue mixture (just eyeball it). Fold the remaining meringue into the ground nut mixture until you&#39;ve created a thick paste. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Sift a generous layer of confectioners&#39; sugar onto a piece of parchment. Flatten the paste onto the parchment with your hands (spray your hands with nonstick cooking spray to keep the paste from sticking to your hands). Sift a generous layer of confectioners&#39; sugar on top of the paste and top with another piece of parchment. Roll to about 1/4 inch thick. Using a 2-inch star-shaped cookie cutter (dipped in confectioners&#39; sugar to keep the cutter from sticking), stamp out the stars and place on a parchment-lined cookie sheet an inch or so apart (the cookies don&#39;t spread, so there&#39;s not much worry). Using a small offset spatula, smear the tops of each star with a light layer of the reserved meringue. Continue with the rest of the cookies and a second parchment-lined cookie sheet.

Line a large plate or baking sheet with paper towels; set aside. Sift together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt into a large bowl. Add the egg, 1 3/4 cups buttermilk, the vegetable oil and honey and stir to combine. The batter should be a little thicker than pancake batter?it should fall off a spoon but not run off it. Dry the hot dogs thoroughly with a paper towel. Insert a long wooden skewer into each hot dog, pushing it almost all the way through to the end. Sprinkle the cornstarch on a small plate and roll the hot dogs in the cornstarch until lightly dusted. Gently tap the hot dogs to remove the extra cornstarch. Pour the batter into a tall drinking glass. Holding a hot dog by the skewer, dunk the hot dog straight down into the glass of batter so that it is fully immersed. Slowly pull the hot dog back out, ensuring that it is fully coated on all sides and allowing some of the excess batter to drip back into the glass. (If the batter is not adhering to the hot dog, it is too thick. Add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, and redip the hot dog.) Once coated, immediately place the battered hot dog into the oil while still holding the stick. Cook until deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, turning the stick as necessary to ensure even browning. Place the cooked corn dog on the paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining hot dogs and batter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10759,&quot;Yu Sang 2 ounces Ahi tuna #1 grade (thinly sliced) 2 ounces spring mix salad greens 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, julienned 1 teaspoon ground peanuts Taro chips 4 ounces plum sauce 2 ounces lemon juice 2 ounces sesame oil Instructions: Make dressing by emulsifying all ingredients together.

Add 2/3 cup sugar, the lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla; beat well. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Tint the batter orange with yellow and red food coloring. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray. Pour in the batter; bake at 350 degrees F until puffed and almost set, 25 to 30 minutes. Mix the sour cream and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar; spread over the hot cheesecake and bake 5 more minutes. Let cool, then chill 2 hours. Make the chips: Unroll the pie dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it out to flatten slightly. Brush the dough with the milk and sprinkle with the sugar. Cut the dough into 2 1/2-inch-wide strips. Cut each strip into as many 2 1/2-inch triangles as possible. Place the triangles about 1 inch apart on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake in batches at 450 degrees F until lightly golden, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely. Make the salsa and garnishes: Cut the Swedish Fish into 1/2-inch pieces and toss with 2 tablespoons strawberry jam. For the chiles, cut the green licorice on the diagonal into 1/8-inch-thick slices. For the olives, cut the black licorice dots into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Use a straw or pastry tip to remove a circle from the center of each round. Tint the sour cream orange with yellow and red food coloring to look like melted cheese. Spoon the orange sour cream into a resealable plastic bag. Press out the excess air and seal. Press the pie chips into the cheesecake. Add the black licorice, chocolate-covered raisins and some green licorice and jam-coated Swedish Fish. Snip a small corner from the bag of orange sour cream and pipe a few dots on the cheesecake for the melted cheese.

Spray a 9-inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the brown sugar, butter, rosemary and the finely grated zest of 1 blood orange (about 1 teaspoon) in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the butter is melted, the sugar has dissolved and the mixture comes to a full boil, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and use an offset spatula to spread evenly (it&#39;s OK if the caramel looks grainy).<br> Finely grate the zest of 1 blood orange into a large bowl and set aside. Cut the ends off 3 of the blood oranges, then remove the skin in strips working to expose the flesh all the way around the fruit. Slice the oranges into 1/8-inch-thick rounds and remove any seeds. Arrange the slices over the brown sugar in the pan, overlapping them slightly as needed so that no sugar can be seen. Set aside.<br> Add 1 cup of the granulated sugar and the olive oil to the bowl with the orange zest and whisk to combine. Add the eggs and vanilla and whisk until lightened, about 4 minutes. Add the flour, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Slowly pour in the milk and continue whisking until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything is incorporated.<br> Carefully pour the batter over the orange slices in the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool slightly, about 30 minutes. Run a small knife or offset spatula around the edge of the cake to loosen. Invert a large plate or serving platter on top of the pan and flip to unmold.

Place a 2-quart bombe mold or metal mixing bowl on top of the brownie and using a knife, cut out the shape of the mold. Crumble the trimmings into a bowl to use as garnish on the final bombe. Wrap and set aside the large brownie for final assembly. Lightly coat the bombe mold or metal mixing bowl with vegetable oil. Chill in the freezer for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, soften the Coffee Ice Cream in the refrigerator (but do not let melt). Remove the mold from the freezer. Using a rubber spatula, quickly spread an even, thick layer of the softened Coffee Ice Cream over the mold to within about 1 1/2 inches of the top. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing to seal the ice cream against the mold and remove any air pockets. Return to the freezer to harden. Meanwhile, soften the Hazelnut Ice Cream in the refrigerator (but do not allow to melt). Remove the mold from the freezer. With a spatula, fill the center of the mold with the softened Hazelnut Ice Cream, leaving a 1 1/2-inch space along the top to place the brownie cake. Wrap in plastic wrap and return to the freezer to harden slightly. Remove the mold from the freezer and while the Hazelnut Ice Cream is still slightly soft, press the brownie onto the ice cream to form a base. Wrap in plastic and return to the freezer to harden completely, at least 4 hours. To make the sweetened whipped cream, in a bowl, beat 1 1/2 cups of the cream with an electric mixer at medium speed until it thickens and starts to hold soft peaks. Add the sugar and vanilla and continue beating until the cream holds peaks, being careful not to overbeat. Refrigerate while assembling the other ingredients. To make the Hazelnut Chocolate Sauce, in a medium saucepan, bring the remaining 1 cup of cream and Frangelico to a gentle boil. Remove from the heat. Place the chocolate in a medium bowl and pour the warm cream mixture over it. Let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until melted and well blended. Whisk in the hazelnuts. Remove the bombe from the freezer. To unmold, dip in a pan or sink of warm water. Invert onto a platter or cake plate and carefully remove the mold. (If the ice cream has softened a great deal, return to the freezer to harden.) To serve the bombe, spread an even layer of sweetened whipped cream over the bombe and drizzle with the chocolate sauce. Crumble the reserved brownie crumbs over the top and present tableside. To serve, cut with a sharp knife that has been dipped in hot water and wiped with a clean cloth before slicing each piece. Serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch round baking pan. Line with parchment paper and lightly grease and flour the paper and sides of the pan, shaking to remove any excess. Set aside. In a saucepan over low heat, melt together the butter and chocolate, stirring occasionally. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve and until smooth. Remove from the heat and pour into a medium bowl. Add the flour and eggs in 2 additions, alternating, and whisking well after each to combine. Add the vanilla and mix well. Pour into the prepared pan and rap the bottom of the pan lightly against the countertop. Bake until the brownies are set and have risen, and a cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the skins are cracked and the nuts (under the skins) are deeply golden brown. Place the nuts in a towel and rub them to remove most of the skins. Cool completely. Combine the cream and 1 cup of the milk in a large heavy saucepan. Scrape the vanilla seeds into the cream mixture and add the bean and the hazelnuts. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Whisk the yolks and sugar in a medium bowl. In a slow, steady stream, whisk 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture. Gradually whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan. Stir constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof medium bowl. Discard the vanilla bean, remove the nuts and rinse in a strainer under cold running water; pat dry on paper towels. On a work surface, crush the nuts with a meat mallet or rolling pin, and stir into the custard. Stir in the remaining 1 cup milk and the liqueur. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours. Pour the chilled custard into the bowl of an ice cream machine and process according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Place in a plastic container, cover tightly, and freeze until ready to use. In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, cream, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and coffee. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat. In a medium bowl, beat the yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar until the yolks are thick and light yellow in color, about 3 minutes. Temper the eggs by adding about 1 cup of the warm milk mixture to the eggs, whisking to combine. Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream, to the remaining hot milk. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours. Pour the custard into the bowl of an ice cream machine and process according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions.

Cover the dried mushrooms with about 2 cups water in a small pot. Bring to boil, then reduce the heat and simmer to reconstitute them. Meanwhile, heat the EVOO in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the portobello and mixed fresh mushrooms and cook until darkened and tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, carrots and onions, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir 1 minute. Add the Marsala and deglaze the pan, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. Add the soaked dried mushrooms and most of the cooking broth, leaving behind the last few spoonfuls as grit may settle there. Transfer the stew to a 10 to 12-inch casserole dish. Heat the milk and 1 1/2 cups water to a simmer in a large saucepan. Whisk in the polenta and cook, whisking, until thickened. Remove from the heat while the polenta is still pourable and stir in the butter, Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste. Pour the polenta over the mushrooms in the casserole dish. Top with the smoked cheese and sprinkle with parsley. Cover the casserole with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake until golden and bubbly on top, 15 to 20 more minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: If you are not serving the casserole immediately, assemble it but do not bake. Cool, then store in the refrigerator.

For the dough: In a small bowl, mix yeast, sugar, salt and 1/4 cup warm water. Let stand 5 minutes until foamy. In a mixer with a dough hook, mix flour and five spice powder. While mixer is running, slowly pour in yeast mixture, oils and the rest of the water; knead on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. Stop mixer when the dough forms a smooth and firm ball. Divide dough into 6 balls and place on sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Cover with a cloth and place in a warm part of the kitchen; let balls double in size, about 2 hours. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, take one ball and spread out with your fingers to about 5 inches in diameter. Take a floured rolling pin and roll out to a little less than a 1/4-inch thick. The final diameter will be 8 to 10 inches. On a low grill, brush on a little canola oil and mark one side. Brush oil on the raw side and flip. Immediately place toppings and cover with a lid to help retain the heat and assist the cheese melting process. Carefully watch the pizza. If the grill is too hot, the bottom will burn before the pizza is ready. If this occurs, you can place the pizza on a tray and use the broiler of an oven to finish the melting. For the pizza: In a hot wok coated with oil, stir-fry garlic, ginger and onions. Season with salt and pepper and cook until onions are caramelized. Add mushrooms and zucchini and stir-fry until soft. Check for seasoning. Place filling on top of a grilled pizza dough. Cover with tomato slices and basil. Cover with cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 10810,&quot;Frozen Strawberry Cheesecake Croquettes 1 pound cream cheese, at room temperature 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2/3 cup sugar 1/4 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon powdered gelatin 2 tablespoons water 3/4 cup heavy cream, whipped 12 strawberries, green tops removed 1 cup crushed vanilla wafers or graham cracker crumbs 1 cup ground walnuts Instructions: Beat the cream cheese, lemon zest and juice, vanilla, and sugar together until very smooth. Mix in the sour cream. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water in a small bowl and set aside for 5 minutes. Warm in the microwave for 30 seconds (or in a saucepan over medium heat) and stir to dissolve. Quickly mix into the cream cheese mixture. Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.<br> Pour 1/2-inch of this filling into each of 24 ice-cube compartments. Freeze 15 minutes to firm up. Meanwhile, cut the strawberries in half. Place a strawberry half in each compartment. Pour the filling over the berries to cover and fill each compartment to the top. Freeze at least 3 to 4 hours. (The recipe can be made up to this point, wrapped, and kept frozen up to 3 days in advance.)<br> Stir together the crushed wafers and walnuts on a plate. When ready to serve, pop out the croquettes and roll in the crumb coating. Place in frilled paper cups or stick each one with a toothpick, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10811,&quot;Savory Herb and Parmesan Rolls 1/2 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon active dry yeast (1/2 packet)<br> 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the bowl 1 large egg yolk<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup finely grated Parmesan 1/2 cup finely sliced scallions 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 1 clove garlic, grated 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Hot honey and flakey sea salt, for serving Instructions: Set up your grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. For the dough: Heat the milk in a small saucepot over the indirect-heat side of the grill to take the chill off. The milk should be between 110 and 115 degrees F. To the bowl of a mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the warmed milk and yeast. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the sugar on top, then let stand for 10 minutes, allowing the yeast to foam. While you\u2019re waiting, melt the butter in a small saucepot over the indirect-heat side of the grill. When the butter has fully melted, continue to cook until browned, nutty and fragrant. Set aside to cool slightly. When the yeast mixture looks very foamy, add the browned butter and egg yolk and mix. In a separate mixing bowl, mix together the flour, salt and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, then add to the yeast mixture. Mix until the dough begins to climb the hook and pull away from the bowl. Continue to mix until the dough is shiny and elastic, about 5 minutes. Turn out into a greased bowl, flipping once so the top is coated as well. Cover and let rise in a draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the filling: In the meantime, make the filling and prepare your pan. Combine the Parmesan, scallions, parsley, garlic and 4 tablespoons of the butter in a bowl and season liberally with salt and pepper. Place a 10-inch cast-iron pan over indirect heat and melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. Set aside. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a 5-by-15-inch rectangle. Spread the filling mixture over the entire surface, leaving a 1/2-inch clean edge on the side furthest away from you. Begin to tightly roll up into a log, pinching at the seam. Using non-flavored dental floss, slice the log into 6 pieces by first cutting in half and then cutting each half into thirds. This will ensure even sizing. Place the 6 rolls into the prepared pan, leaving some spacing in between. Cover and put in a draft-free place until almost doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Place the pan on the indirect-heat side of the grill and cover the grill with a lid. Bake until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from the grill and invert onto a plate. Drizzle with hot honey and sprinkle with flakey sea salt. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 10812,&quot;Homemade Chicken and Vegetable Soup 2 tablespoons olive oil Pinch crushed red pepper 1 chicken (3 pounds) boned, skinned, and visible fat removed, diced, (save the bones and carcass) 3 quarts chicken stock<br> 1 pound assorted small dried pasta shapes, such as stars, tubes, shells, etc. 12 small thermoses<br> Creole seasoning, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups chopped onions 1 cup chopped celery 1 cup diced carrots 1/2 cup chopped green onions 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil 4 bay leaves 2 cups assorted chopped fresh vegetables, such has beans, zucchini, yellow squash, or cabbage, small dice 1 1/2 cups torn spinach leaves, cleaned and stemmed 1 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves 12 small resealable plastic snack bags 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons salt 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: In a large sauce pot, heat the olive oil.

Lightly butter the bottom of two 9-inch round cake pans. Line the bottom with parchment paper, then butter and flour the parchment and the sides of the pans. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder, and baking soda, mixing on low speed. Mix in the eggs, oil, and milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the water. The batter will be soupy. Divide the batter evenly between the cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool on a cooling rack for 5 minutes, then turn the layers out onto the rack and cool completely. When the cakes have cooled, check the frosting. It should have the consistency of mayonnaise. If it is still too thin, allow it to cool longer. To make the frosting: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and cream and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat and simmer for 6 minutes. Add the chocolate and butter and stir until melted. Pour into a bowl and stir in the vanilla. To frost the cake: Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread the frosting with a hot palette knife or icing spatula to give the frosting a beautiful shine. Run the knife under hot tap water and dry with a towel. Spread about 3/4 cup of the frosting over the top of the first layer. Top with the second layer. Spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake, heating the knife again as necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Zinfandel]&quot; 10816,&quot;Potato Carrot Pancake 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 russet potatoes, grated 1 carrot, peeled and grated 1 tablespoon chopped parsley Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat oil in small non-stick skillet over medium high heat.

Place 1 cup of sugar in a heavy saucepan over high heat and cook until a bronze color. Swirl the pan as it begins to color to mix the sugar and caramel. Once the caramel has reached its color, very carefully pour a little of the caramel, just enough to cover the bottom, into 6 (2-ounce) timbales or ramekins.<br> Using the remaining caramel, add the orange juice, rum, and vanilla extract to the pan. Return to the stove to dissolve the caramel. When all is melted, pour the caramel mixture over the pineapple slices and combine all of the ingredients for the pineapple marinade. Allow the mixture to cool for approximately 3 to 4 hours and refrigerate.<br> To make the creme caramel, combine the warm milk and vanilla. In a separate bowl, combine the egg yolks, eggs, and remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar and beat well. Mix the warm milk and the egg mixture well to make a thin custard.

Fold in the flour and chives. Roll the gnudi dough into 1-inch balls and place on a baking sheet. Cover completely with the semolina flour and refrigerate overnight. For the ragout: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Saute the oxtails on all sides in a braising pan until rendered crispy, and then remove from the pan. Add the peppercorns, bay leaves, carrots, celery, onions and thyme and saute for 5 minutes, and then return the oxtails to the pan. Pour in the port and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the veal stock and return to a simmer. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook, uncovered, until tender and the meat easily pulls off the bone, turning the oxtails every 30 minutes, about 2 hours total. Remove the oxtails from the liquid and cool to room temperature. Pick the meat from the bones. Meanwhile, simmer the braising liquid over high heat until it becomes a think sauce consistency, and then strain through a fine mesh sieve. Add the oxtail to the sauce and keep warm. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Poach the gnudi until they float to the top, about 5 minutes. Drain and serve on top of the oxtail ragout. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 10830,&quot;Goi Ga One 5-pound whole chicken One 2-inch piece fresh ginger 2 medium red onions Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 large head of white cabbage (from about a 3-pound head) 1/2 small head purple cabbage (from about a 2-pound head) 3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 cup sugar 6 cloves garlic 6 limes 2 red Thai bird chiles 1/3 cup Asian fish sauce 1 cup fresh mint leaves 1 cup fresh Thai basil leaves 1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts 1/2 cup store-bought fried shallots or onions Fried shrimp chips, for serving Instructions: Place the chicken breast-side up in a high-sided pot that fits the chicken snugly. Fill the pot with cold water to about 1 inch above the chicken and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. While waiting for the water to boil, cut the ginger into very thin rounds, peel and quarter 1 of the onions and add them and 1 tablespoon salt to the pot. Once the water reaches a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, skimming and discarding any scum that floats to the surface of the poaching liquid, until an instant-read thermometer inserted between the breast and thigh of the chicken reads 165 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes. (To take the temperature, use a pair of sturdy tongs to carefully lift the chicken out of the hot poaching liquid and insert the thermometer between the breast and thigh.) While the chicken is cooking, core the white and purple cabbages, very thinly slice them into ribbonlike strands and place the sliced cabbage in a large bowl; set aside. Fill a second large bowl a little more than halfway with equal parts ice and water, and use the tongs to add the cooked chicken to it; reserve the pot and poaching liquid. Leave the chicken in the ice water to cool completely, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, peel, halve and very thinly slice the remaining onion, and place it in a small bowl. Add the vinegar, oil, 1 teaspoon of the sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Use your hands to gently massage the vinegar mixture into the onions until they begin to wilt slightly. Let the marinated onions sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes and up to overnight. Discard the ice water, but keep the chicken in the bowl. Remove and discard the skin. Shred the chicken into large bite-size pieces; set aside. Add the chicken carcass to the poaching liquid, and return it to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, skimming off any fat and/or scum that floats to the surface. Strain the poaching liquid over a large bowl; discard the solids. Let this flavorful broth cool completely, and reserve it for another purpose. (It can be frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months.) While the broth is cooking, make the dressing: Cook the remaining sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove to a small bowl and let cool slightly. While the sugar mixture is cooling, finely grate the garlic, halve and juice the limes (about 1/2 cup of juice total) and slice the chiles into thin rounds. Whisk the fish sauce into the cooled sugar mixture; add the garlic, lime juice and chiles. To assemble the salad, add the chicken, marinated onions (and any residual liquid) and lime dressing to the cabbage bowl. Tear the mint and basil leaves into the bowl, and gently toss to combine. Season with additional fish sauce if needed. Let the salad sit for 15 minutes so the flavors can marry, then transfer to a large platter. Place the peanuts and fried shallots in separate piles beside the salad. Just before serving, gently toss together the salad, peanuts and fried shallots and any liquid that has accumulated at the bottom of the platter (the liquid has a lot of great flavor). Serve with the fried shrimp chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 10831,&quot;Posole Verde 3 tablespoons canola oil 1 white onion, chopped 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 tablespoon toasted cumin seeds, ground 1/2 teaspoon toasted anise seeds, ground 9 cups chicken stock 5 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves 4 Yukon gold potatoes, diced 3 (15-ounce) cans white hominy 2 roasted, peeled and seeded poblano peppers 1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped 5 chiles de arbol, seeded 3/4 pound tomatillos, husked and quartered 1/2 bunch chopped cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish 4 leaves romaine lettuce 1/2 tablespoon Mexican dried oregano 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic Salt and freshly ground black pepper Sliced avocado, for garnish Sliced radishes, for garnish Queso fresco, for garnish Instructions: Heat the canola oil in a heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium-high heat.<br> Add the onions and garlic and cook until translucent.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Make the twists: On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread the poppy seed filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on one of the long sides. Brush the clean border with water. Tightly roll the dough into an 18-inch log, rolling toward the clean border. Using a chef&#39;s knife, cut the log crosswise into 12 rounds, 1 1/2 inches wide each. Dampen your hands, then stretch and pat each round into an oval shape. Twist each oval in the middle to form a figure-eight shape. Place on the prepared baking sheets. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until plump, 20 minutes. Uncover the dough and retwist, if necessary. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes, switching the position of the baking sheets halfway through. Transfer to racks and let cool slightly on the baking sheets. Make the glaze: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter, lemon juice and zest, milk, vanilla and salt in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave 45 seconds; stir until smooth. Brush on the twists. Warm 1/2 cup water and the milk in a saucepan over low heat until a thermometer registers 100 degrees F to 110 degrees F. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast on top, then sprinkle with a pinch of the sugar; set aside, undisturbed, until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla into the yeast mixture until combined. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, the remaining sugar, the salt and nutmeg. Make a well in the center, then add the yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon to make a thick and slightly sticky dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape into a ball. Brush a large bowl with butter. Add the dough, turning to coat lightly with the butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough is doubled in size, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and knead briefly to release excess air; re-form into a ball and return to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap and lay it directly on the surface of the dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10833,&quot;Exotic Lamb Burgers 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup soft fresh goat&#39;s cheese (or cream cheese for kids) 2 tablespoons chopped chives Roughly chopped fresh mint or cilantro for garnish Fine mince of hot jalapeno pepper if you wish Instructions: In a mixing bowl combine the ground lamb with the cinnamon and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Liberally rub the entire brisket with the spices, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove the brisket from the refrigerator 1 hour before beginning the smoking process to take the chill off, and remove the plastic wrap.<br> Get your smoker running at 225 degrees F with hardwood charcoal and a few handfuls of soaked wood chips. This temperature should be maintained throughout the entire smoke. (If you are using a grill: Set up the grill for indirect heat, banking the coals on one side of the grill and scattering the wood chips on top. Maintain the temperature at 225 degrees throughout the smoking process, adding chips as necessary, until you wrap the brisket in foil.)<br> Place the brisket fat-side up on your smoker grate and close it up for the long smoke.<br> Open your barbecue smoker every hour or 2 and spray the brisket liberally with apple juice to help keep the meat from drying out. Also keep apple juice in the water pan if you are using a water smoker.<br> When the internal temperature reaches 165 to 170 degrees, after about 4 hours, wrap the brisket in aluminum foil and continue to cook for another 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours. This little trick is a big help in getting the meat tender, especially for beginners. Figure that a brisket smoked at around 200 degrees will take about 1 1/2 hours per pound. The brisket is done when the internal temperature reaches 185 degrees F. Remove and let rest 20 minutes before slicing. Remove the foil from the brisket over a large pan or disposable pan and reserve the liquid. Cut off the brisket points and reserve for another use (such as Honey-Rum Pinto Beans with Burnt Ends). After the points are removed, look to see which way the grain runs and slice thinly across the grain. Smear some barbecue sauce on Grilled Texas Toast, top with brisket and Pickled Red Onions.

Keep the claws as intact as possible for the best presentation. In a large bowl, use a spatula to mix the lobster meat with the mayonnaise, coating evenly. The more chilled the mayonnaise, the better it will coat. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Using a pastry brush, liberally brush the melted butter on both sides of the hot dog rolls and place in the skillet. Toast each side to a golden brown color, using more butter as needed. Fill each roll with about 4 ounces of the lobster mixture. Sprinkle the tops with chives. Serve with a lemon wedge, which can also be squeezed on top. Serve immediately--the goal is to serve when you still have a warm, buttery roll with the cool creamy lobster meat.

Lightly coat a 6-cup loaf pan with nonstick vegetable spray. Line the bottom with a rectangle of waxed paper. Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl; repeat 2 times. In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed for 15 seconds, to combine. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating until each is incorporated. Continue beating until light and fluffy, about 6 more minutes. In a bowl, mash the bananas until pasty. Stir in the sour cream and vanilla. With the mixer on its lowest setting, beat in 1/3 of the flour mixture. Beat in half of the banana mixture, then another 1/3 of the flour. Beat in the remaining banana mixture and the remaining flour. Spread the batter in the prepared pan and bake for 40 minutes or until the center springs back wen lightly pressed and a cake tester comes out clean. Set the pan on a rack to cool. Turn the cooled cake out of the pan. With a serrated knife, trim off the end crusts and cut the loaf into 1/2-inch slices. Peel the bananas and cut them into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Spread half the cake slices with the buttercream and layer on the banana slices. Place the remaining cake slices on top to form sandwiches. Cut the sandwiches in half and serve with ice cream and chocolate fudge sauce. Peanut Butter Buttercream: On medium speed, beat the butter and peanut butter in a mixing bowl until blended. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Increase the speed to high and beat for 3 to 5 minutes, until smooth and fluffy. Chocolate Fudge Sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the coffee, sugar and cocoa. Whisk in the corn syrup until all the sugar crystals are dissolved and the mixture is completely smooth. Place the chocolate and butter in a large, dry bowl or in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water. When the chocolate has melted, whisk in the coffee-cocoa mixture until smooth and blended. The sauce is best if left to ripen for a full day before serving. Store in a sealed container. This sauce will keep for 3 weeks in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 10872,&quot;Zippy Italian Popcorn 1 sack reduced fat natural flavor microwave popcorn, cooked to package directions 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon garlic powder or granulated garlic 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/3 cup grated Parmigiano, eyeball it Instructions: Pop the corn and place in a bowl.

In a large bowl, spread the pork out and sprinkle evenly all over with the brown sugar, fennel seeds, rosemary, sage, thyme, pepper flakes, nutmeg, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few good turns of pepper. Mix with your hands to combine, being careful not to over mix. Divide into 4 parts and roll into balls. Create a large divot in the center of each ball and fill each with 1 slice of the cheese that\u2019s been folded into 4 quarters. Seal in the cheese by pressing the edges of the divot together and then press the ball into patties. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a lightly oiled nonstick pan over medium-high heat and cook until the patties have an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove to a plate and set aside. Add a drizzle of oil to the pan. Crack in the eggs, cover and cook to the desired doneness. (I like a firm yolk with these since the cheese will lend enough ooze!) Season with salt and pepper. Butter the English muffins and place on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray. Place in the oven and toast until lightly golden, about 3 to 5 minutes. Top each English muffin with a patty, an egg and sriracha or hot sauce, if desired. Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10878,&quot;Dijon-Style Mustard 1 c. yellow or brown mustard seeds, or a blend of the two 1 1/2 c. dry white wine 1 c. water 1/2 c. white wine vinegar 1/4 c. dry mustard 1 Tbsp onion powder 1 tsp salt Instructions: Soak the mustard seeds: Combine all ingredients in a quart jar or other sealable nonreactive container. Seal and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours, shaking occasionally to distribute.<br> Prepare the jars and lids: Wash all jars and lids thoroughly with soap and water and rinse well. Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil.<br> Blend the mustard: Use an immersion blender directly in the jar, or transfer the mix to a blender. Blend until desired level of smoothness.<br> Cook down the mustard: Transfer the blended mustard to a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until reduced by about a third, thick but still thin enough to pour easily. If the mustard becomes too thick, add water or wine a tablespoon at a time until thin enough to pour.<br> Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the mustard in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the mustard into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight.<br> Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch of water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 10 minutes.<br> Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately.<br> Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 10879,&quot;Crostata with Raspberry Jam 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel 10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons ice water Flour for dusting, as needed 1 jar (3/4 cup) raspberry preserves 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon sliced almonds, toasted Powdered sugar, for dusting, optional Instructions: Mix the flour, sugar, and lemon peel, in a food processor. Add the butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add salt. Pulse in the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until moist clumps form. Gather the dough into a ball; flatten into a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to an 11-inch round. Transfer the dough onto a heavy baking sheet that has been lined with a silpat or parchment paper. Stir the lemon juice into the preserve and spread the preserves on top of dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks in the dough. Bake the crostata until the crust is golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool. Sprinkle with the almonds and dust with the powdered sugar, if you wish. Slide a metal spatula under the crust to free the crostata from the baking sheet and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 10880,&quot;Rhubarb Walnut Muffins 1 1/2 cups flour 3/4 cups brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup vegetable oil 1 egg 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup chopped rhubarb 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup chopped walnuts 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon Instructions: Preheat oven 325 degrees F.

Alternately, heat 3-inches of oil in a deep pot. Peel the potatoes and cut them into chips, about the size of your index finger. Put the potatoes in the oil. Fry the chips for 2 to 3 minutes; they should not be crisp or fully cooked at this point. Remove the chips with a spider strainer or slotted spoon, to a paper towel-lined platter to drain. Crank the oil temperature up to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and egg. Pour in the soda water and whisk to a smooth batter. Spread the rice flour on a plate. Dredge the fish pieces in the rice flour and then dip them into the batter, letting the excess drip off. Put the chips in the bottom of the fryer basket and carefully submerge in the hot oil. Carefully wave the battered fish into the bubbling oil before dropping them in on top of the chips. Fry the fish and chips for 4 to 5 minutes until crispy and brown. Remove the basket and drain the fish and chips on paper towels; season lightly with salt.

Stir together 2 cups olive oil, the chopped rosemary and oregano, the garlic and 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper (or 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes) in a large bowl. Add the lamb chops, bones up, and rub the mixture evenly over the meat. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 400?. Remove the lamb from the refrigerator and wipe off any excess marinade with a paper towel. Season generously with kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper. Heat an extra-large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add the lamb, rounded fat\u2013side down. Cook until well browned, about 4 minutes. Turn the chops on their sides in the skillet and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Turn the chops so the fat side is facing up and cook 2 to 3 more minutes. (It\u2019s OK if some of the bones are sticking out of the skillet to make space.) Carefully pour off the fat from the skillet and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the center of the lamb registers 125? for medium-rare to medium doneness, 5 to 7 minutes.

Put the butter and sage in a mixing bowl and mash with a fork or spoon until the sage is well incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Rinse the bird thoroughly inside and out with cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the cavity and skin liberally with salt and pepper. Using your fingers, gently lift the skin from the turkey breast and slip the remaining seasoned butter under, massaging the breast meat as you go. Truss the bird by crossing the legs over one another and tying with a piece of kitchen twine. Shingle the bacon strips over the breast so it&#39;s totally covered. Put the turkey on a rack in a large roasting pan, cover the turkey with aluminum foil, and place in the oven. In a small bowl, stir the maple syrup with 2 tablespoons of hot water to thin. Roast the turkey for 2 hours, basting with the maple glaze every 30 minutes. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meaty part of the thigh registers 170 degrees F. The thigh juices will run clear when pricked with a knife, about 3 hours total (15 minutes per pound). About 1/2 hour before you think the turkey is done, remove the foil so that it can brown. When done take the turkey out of the oven and put the roasting pan on the stovetop. Transfer the turkey to a serving tray to rest at least 20 minutes before carving.

Top with the olive oil and a splash of water, close up the foil and roast until a knife or skewer comes out with ease when inserted into the beets, 25 to 30 minutes. Set aside to cool just enough to handle. Peel the beets, transfer to a blender with any remaining juices and pure, adding up to 1/4 cup water if needed to get it to puree.<br> For the red velvet cake: Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Mix on low for 30 seconds with the paddle attachment.<br> In a separate bowl, whisk to combine 1/2 cup of the roasted beet pure, the buttermilk, oil, food coloring, vinegar, vanilla and eggs. In 2 parts, pour into the mixer. Mix on medium speed until combined. Do not overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared pans.<br> Bake on the center rack until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, then turn out on a wire rack. Let the cakes cool completely before frosting.<br> For the cream cheese frosting: Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until combined. Add the chocolate and vanilla extract, then continue to mix until incorporated. Next, slowly add the powdered sugar, beating until the frosting is light and fluffy. Transfer to a piping bag or ziptop bag and snip off the end.<br> Pipe a tablespoon of frosting onto a rotating cake stand and place an 8-inch cake round on top, pressing gently to adhere. Place the first cake on the cake round and trim the dome to make flat if needed. Cut the cake in half horizontally to make 2 layers. Frost the top of the first layer, then place the second half on top and frost. Repeat with the remaining cake, cutting in half and stacking between layers of frosting. There should be 4 layers. Finally, frost the sides, finishing with the top.<br> For the bloody good tsunami topping: Whisk the milk, heavy cream, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan until smooth. Heat over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture just begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the condensed milk and red food coloring (as many drops to get the color you prefer). Place a layer of plastic wrap over the top of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming, then allow to cool completely before using.<br> To assemble the bloody good tsunami cake: Cut a sheet of clear acetate that can wrap completely around the base of the cake, adding an extra 2 inches so that it can be secured with tape on the side and also making sure that the acetate is taller than the top of the cake by at least 5 inches. Wrap the acetate around the cake and tape it to form a long tube--it should not be so tight as to squeeze against the outer layer of the cake, but still have no gaps at the top of the cake so that the topping will not seep over the edges. Gently spoon the bloody good tsunami topping over the top of the cake, then spoon an even layer of red sprinkles and sparkling sugar, about 1/4 inch thick, over the topping. Plunge a plastic toy hatchet, meat cleaver or dagger into the center of the top of the cake--it should be very decorative and realistic-looking for the best effect!<br> To reveal the tsunami, grasp the top of the acetate and gently pull up to loosen from the base of the cake, then continue pulling up over the top of the cake in one single motion to allow the topping to cascade over the side of the cake.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10918,&quot;Spaghetti with Sausage-Mushroom Sauce Kosher salt 12 ounces spaghetti 3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 3/4 pound sweet or spicy Italian sausage, casings removed 1 8-ounce package sliced mixed mushrooms Freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary 1/4 cup heavy cream Shredded Parmesan cheese, for topping (optional) Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.

Place the fish carcasses in a roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes. Add the roughly chopped carrot, celery and onion to a blender. Add the tomatoes, bell pepper, garlic, anchovy paste and Calabrian cl paste and process until pureed. Pour the vegetable puree into a large pot with 2 cups of water and bring to a simmer. Add the roasted fish carcasses and reserved shrimp shells to the pot and simmer for 40 minutes. Strain the puree and set aside. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Bring 1 quart of water to a boil in a medium pot. Add the pasta, saffron and some salt and pepper and cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Place the fish filets skin-side down in the skillet and press down for 10 seconds. Place the skillet in the oven and bake until the center is just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, flip the fish and allow to rest for 1 minute in the skillet. Gently cook the diced carrot, onion, celery and fennel in a large saucepan over medium heat until translucent. Add the shrimp, clams and mussels. Add the red wine and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release any brown bits. Add the reserved vegetable puree, cover and continue to cook until the clams and mussels open. Immediately remove from the heat and discard any clams or mussels that haven&#39;t opened up. Add the parsley, basil, chives and pasta. For the uni toast: Combine the egg yolks, lemon juice and sea salt in a medium bowl. With an immersion blender running, slowly add the grapeseed oil to make an emulsion. Lightly toast the slices of sourdough bread, top with uni and drizzle with some of the lemon emulsion. To serve: Divide the bouillabaisse among bowls. Place a sea bass filet in the middle of each and garnish with 1 uni toast, some petite carrot fern, petite sea grass and black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 10926,&quot;cl Toasted Coconut Strips 1 fresh coconut 1 to 2 tablespoons cl powder 1 to 2 teaspoons coarse salt, or to taste Juice of 1 lime Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Poke holes in the three soft areas at the top of the coconut shell with an ice pick or nail. Drain the milk and save for another use. Place the coconut on a sheet pan and bake 10 minutes, until shell and flesh separate. Reduce oven to 300 degrees. Crack the shell open with a hammer. Remove and discard shell, leaving the brown skin on. Cut the coconut meat into thin strips using a vegetable peeler or slicing side of the grater. Toss in a bowl with remaining ingredients. Arrange the seasoned coconut strips in a single layer on a baking sheet. Toast oven, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Cool and store in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Viognier, Gewrztraminer, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 10927,&quot;Rolled Tuille Cookies 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 egg whites 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. After it melts, continue to cook the butter, watching carefully. It will foam and subside, and then separate into golden butterfat and cloudy white milk solids. The milk solids will begin to brown. When they are lightly browned and the butter smells nutty and toasted, remove from the heat and set aside to cool. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg whites and sugar until stiff and glossy. Add the flour, vanilla, and brown butter and mix at low speed until blended. The batter will become thicker as the egg whites lose volume. Using an offset spatula, an icing spatula, or the back of a spoon, spread the batter in circles to form thin disks on silicone baking mat-lined baking sheets. (You may only fit 6 or 8 per pan.) The batter should be so thin that you can see the pan through it. Bake until light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. When the cookies come out of the oven, immediately lift them off the sheet pan with your fingers or a spatula and roll them up on a wooden spoon handle; then slide them off. Repeat with the remaining batter. The batter will probably start to stiffen up as the butter cools; you can reheat it in the microwave, or set the bowl over hot water to keep the batter warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10928,&quot;Hummus 2 cloves garlic, peeled 1 15-ounce can chickpeas Water, as needed 1/4 cup tahini Juice of a lemon 1 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon cayenne Salt and pepper 1 scallion, thinly sliced for garnish Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a blender and process until smooth.

Place the tomato slices on a tray or large plate. Sprinkle with fleur de sel and black pepper. Drizzle the vinegar and oil over the tomatoes. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Lay the bacon on a baking sheet, and season with a generous amount of black pepper. Brush some of the juices from the seasoned tomatoes onto the bacon and top with the red onions. Roast the bacon until it is golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 20 minutes. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons mayonnaise on each slice of country toast. Top each with 3 slices of bacon and the onions. Reserve the bacon drippings. Season the avocado with salt and pepper, and place on top of the bacon. Follow with 2 marinated tomato slices on each sandwich. In a separate bowl, lightly toss the lettuce and tarragon with a small amount of the drippings from the bacon and season as needed with salt and pepper. Top the sandwiches with the salad and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 10930,&quot;Arty Holiday Bread 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound frozen white bread dough, thawed<br> 1/2 cup red and yellow cherry tomatoes, halved<br> 1/2 cup olives, pitted<br> 2 tablespoons fresh sage leaves<br> 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves<br> 2 teaspoons flaky sea salt<br> 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan Instructions: Oil a quarter sheet pan with 1 tablespoon of the oil and stretch out the bread dough to the edges. Allow the dough to rest and rise for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Brush the surface of the bread with another tablespoon of the olive oil. Decorate the bread with the tomatoes, olives, sage and rosemary, pressing them into the bread. Brush on the remaining olive oil; this will make it shiny and stop the vegetables burning. Sprinkle on the salt and Parmesan. Bake until it is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 10931,&quot;Ruffled Milk Pie 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar Twelve 9-by-14-inch sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed 1 cup whole milk 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Pinch kosher salt 3 large eggs 1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted (optional) Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting Instructions: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven, place a baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 350 degrees F. Brush a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plate (preferably with ruffled edges) with some of the melted butter. Stir together the cinnamon and 2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons of the sugar in a small bowl. Set aside. Place the sheets of phyllo on a baking sheet and cover with a barely damp kitchen towel or several paper towels to keep from drying out. Place 1 sheet of phyllo dough with a long side closest to you on a work surface. Brush the phyllo sheet with some of the melted butter until completely coated, then sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon-sugar. Using your hands, gently bring the long sides toward one another, scrunching the phyllo as you go to create a ruffled effect. Gently coil the phyllo into a rose shape about 3 1/2-inches in diameter. Place the phyllo rose in one corner of the pie plate. Repeat to make 3 more phyllo roses. Arrange them so they fill the bottom of the pie plate in a single layer. If the phyllo dough tears or breaks, it is okay since it will just add to the ruffled effect of the final pie. If there are any spaces between the phyllo roses, gently spread them with your hands until the roses cover the entire bottom of the pie plate. Brush the 8 remaining phyllo sheets with melted butter, sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar and shape into a slightly smaller rose (2 1/2 to 3-inches). Place 1 rose in the center of the pie plate on top of the first layer, then surround it with the remaining 7 roses. If there is any remaining melted butter, drizzle it on top of the roses. Bake on the preheated baking sheet until deep golden brown and crispy, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet once after 15 minutes. Allow to cool slightly on the baking sheet while you prepare the custard. Place the milk and cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until it just starts to steam, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Whisk together the vanilla, salt, eggs and remaining 1/3 cup sugar in a large bowl. While whisking constantly, gradually add the milk and cream mixture a little bit at a time until smooth and combined. Pour or spoon the custard between the crispy phyllo layers; this will ensure that the phyllo on top stays nice and crispy. Bake until the filling is just set, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheet after 10 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with the almonds if using and dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar. Cut into 8 wedges and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 10932,&quot;Tall and Tangy Tofu Thangy 1 (8 1/4-ounce) can fruit cocktail in light syrup, frozen 1 teaspoon instant lemonade mix 6 ounces cranberry juice 1 block silken tofu Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 10933,&quot;Mint Chocolate-Chip Meringues 1/2 cup egg whites (from about 4 eggs) 2/3 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon mint extract or mint flavoring (not mint oil) 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped or grated 2 ounces semisweet chocolate Additional equipment: A pastry bag fitted with a large plain or star tip, 2 cookie sheets, well greased, or lined with parchment paper, or lined with nonstick baking mats, or 2 nonstick cookies sheets. Instructions: Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Heat the egg whites and sugar in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water until warm to the touch (this will help you get more air into the whites when you whip them). Transfer to a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip until soft peaks form. Add the mint extract and continue whipping just until stiff and glossy. Fold in the chopped unsweetened chocolate. Scrape the mixture into a pastry bag. Pipe bite-size kisses onto the cookie sheets and bake until the meringues are the color of milky coffee, 25 to 30 minutes. To test, remove one meringue from the oven, let cool one minute, then taste. It should be dry and crisp all the way through. Let cool on the pans. Melt the semisweet chocolate. Dipping the tines of a fork into the chocolate, drizzle the meringues with melted chocolate. Let sit until chocolate is set, 30 minutes to an hour (or let set in the refrigerator for 15 minutes).

For the stuffing: Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Preheat grill to high. Remove the pork chops from the brine, rinse and pat dry with paper towels. Stuff the cavity with the apples and grill for about 10 minutes on each side. Remove from grill to a serving platter and let rest for about 10 minutes. Brush with the cider reduction, sprinkle with the chopped caramelized pecans and enjoy! In a heavy-bottomed pot, cook the sugar and water until the temperature reaches 275 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Add the pecans and stir to coat with the sugar. Once the sugar begins to caramelize add the vanilla extract and stir gently but constantly until fully caramelized.

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until the juices are simmering. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring, until the firmer apples soften but still hold their shape, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour, cinnamon and salt and toss to thicken the juices, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool. (The filling can be made up to 2 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Make the crust: Pulse the flour, baking powder, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor. Add the shortening and 4 tablespoons butter; pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add 6 more tablespoons butter and pulse until pea-size pieces form. Add 3 tablespoons ice water and pulse a few times. If the dough doesn\u2019t hold together when squeezed, add more ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time. Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pat each into a disk. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours or up to overnight. Roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface (or between 2 sheets of floured parchment) into a 12-inch round. (If the dough gets too warm, refrigerate until firm.) Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the filling, mounding it slightly in the center, and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Transfer the pie to the refrigerator.<br> Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch round. Lay the dough over the filling and press the 2 crusts together around the edges. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp as desired. Brush the beaten egg over the top crust and edge; sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Pierce the top crust with a knife a few times to let steam escape. Refrigerate 1 hour. Put a rimmed baking sheet on the bottom oven rack and preheat to 425? F for 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot pan and reduce the oven temperature to 375? F.

Place the beets in a small roasting pan and pour in enough cold water to reach about 1/4 of the way up the sides of the beets. Cover the pan with foil, and roast the beets until they are tender, 2 hours to 2 hours and 15 minutes. To check for doneness, gently insert a bamboo skewer into a beet. The skewer should slide through easily. Remove the beets from the pan, allow to cool, and then peel.<br> Cut each beet into 1/4-inch-thick round slices. Cut each slice with a 3-inch round cookie cutter. (You will need 10 rounds). Cut trimmings into 1/4-inch dice and reserve 1/2 cup for garnish.<br> In a saute pan, bring vinegar and sugar to a boil. Lower to a simmer and poach beets 1 minute on each side. With a slotted spatula, remove and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Cover and refrigerate until needed.<br> When ready to assemble, heat the olive oil in a small saute pan. Arrange the slices of Herbed Goat Cheese in the pan and warm slightly, turning them with a small spatula just to warm both sides. This has to be done quickly, or the cheese will melt.<br> To assemble the napoleons, place 1 of the beet rounds on a firm, flat surface and begin to layer. Top with a slice of goat cheese, then another beet round, a second slice of cheese, another beet round, a third slice of cheese, and a beet round. (Continue until you have 5 layers of beets and 4 layers of cheese.) Carefully cut through layers, dividing into 3 wedges. Repeat with the remaining beets and cheese.<br> To serve, arrange 3 of the wedges, pointed ends facing out, in a circle in the center of each plate.

While the dough is rising, prepare the remaining ingredients for the cinnamon knots and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Mix the butter with sugar and cinnamon. Turn the risen dough out onto a floured surface. Stretch the dough into a rectangle. Spread half of the butter mixture on half of the dough. Then fold the dough in half, covering the butter with the dough. Using a pizza wheel, divide the dough into 18 strips. First cut through the middle, then you can cut each half into 9 pieces. Stretch each strip and tie into a knot and tuck the ends underneath the center of the knot. Place the knots onto a baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over low heat, melt the remaining butter. Once the knots come out of the oven, baste them with the melted butter. Serve warm and enjoy! In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you&#39;d like! Cook&#39;s Notes: This dough is wet dough, keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef, if the dough is to wet, add more flour, if it is too stiff, add a little water. Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don&#39;t need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature; it should just feel warm to the touch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10982,&quot;Garam Masala Chicken Pot Pie 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing 4 boneless and skinless chicken thighs Salt and freshly ground black pepper, plus 2 teaspoons salt 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 shallots, chopped 1 carrot, peeled and sliced 2 tablespoons salted butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting puff pastry 3 cups chicken stock 1 russet potato, peeled and cubed 1/2 cup frozen peas, defrosted 1 1/2 tablespoons garam masala, plus more for sprinkling 2 sheets (1 pound package) frozen puff pastry, defrosted slightly 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a medium-size pot over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and brown on both sides until golden, about 5 minutes on each side. Remove the chicken from the pan to a cutting board and reserve. To the same pot add the garlic, shallots, and carrots and saute until golden. Remove the vegetables to a bowl and reserve. Turn the heat down to medium. Melt the butter in the pot, whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the chicken stock, and potatoes and cook until potatoes are mostly cooked but still firm, about 8 to 10 minutes. The chicken stock will have thickened to a sauce consistency. Turn off the heat.Chop the chicken into chunks and add the chicken and veggies back to the pot. Stir in the peas, and then the 1 1/2 tablespoons garam masala and 2 teaspoons salt. Ladle the mixture into 4 (10-ounce) oven safe bowls. On a flat work suface, dust the puff pastry with flour and roll it out just a little thinner than it comes. Cut the puff pastry in squares large enough to hang over the sides of each bowl. Cover the bowls with the puff pastry pressing down around the sides. Brush with a touch of olive oil and sprinkle with some more garam masala. Cut a slit in the top of the pastry to allow steam to escape. Transfer to the oven and bake until the tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 10983,&quot;Piquillo Peppers Stuffed with Chorizo and Manchego 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 8 ounces fresh Mexican chorizo, casing removed<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 medium carrot, minced<br> 1 stalk celery, minced<br> 1 medium shallot, minced<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 4 to 5 turns freshly ground black pepper<br> Pinch cl flakes<br> 1 cup grated Manchego cheese 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> 1/4 cup whipped cream cheese<br> 8 to 10 jarred piquillo peppers, drained and patted dry<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Turn the bird around and cut back down the other side of the spine, being careful not to cut into the thigh. Press down on the bird to flatten and make a shallow cut through the breastbone to further flatten the duck. Remove the neck flap and any extra pockets of fat. Turn the duck over, breast side up, and make a long slash in the skin and fat of each breast, making sure not to puncture the meat. Sprinkle both sides of the duck with the kosher salt and lay the duck, breast side up, on top of a broiler pan. Line the bottom of the pan with paper towels. Put the duck, uncovered, on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or until the skin is dry and reaches a near parchment consistency. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. If there is still salt visible, brush it off. Remove the paper towels from the bottom of the pan. Put the pan in the middle of the oven and roast for 30 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue to cook until the thigh reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 more minutes. Remove the duck from the oven and increase the heat to 450 degrees F. Once the oven has come to temperature, return the duck to the oven and roast until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove the top of the broiler pan, with the duck still on it, and put it on a sheet pan to rest. Pour off the duck fat from the bottom of the pan, measure 1/4 cup, and reserve the rest for another use. Decrease the oven heat to 350 degrees F. Put the broiler pan on the stove over medium heat and add the 1/4 cup of the fat. Add the onions, celery, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions and celery are translucent, approximately 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the cornbread, oyster crackers, thyme, sage, eggs, oysters and their liquor in a large mixing bowl and use your hands to mix well, breaking up the oysters as you go. Add the onion and celery mixture to the bowl and stir to combine. Transfer the dressing back into the broiler pan and spread evenly. Put the dressing on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden brown and crisp around the edges, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Cut the Cornish hen in half. Put it into a small roasting pan; you can toss in the spine to give extra flavor for the dressing later.<br> Drizzle the hen with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, sprinkle with paprika and thyme sprigs, and throw in the unpeeled garlic cloves. Roast until the Cornish hen is reddish-gold on top, and cooked through, about 30 to 40 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, put the golden raisins into a small saucepan with the vermouth or white wine. Bring to a bubble over low heat on the stove top. Remove the pan from the heat, and leave for about 10 minutes or, better still, leave it to cool while the Cornish hen is roasting.<br> Toast the pine nuts in a hot, dry frying pan over low heat until golden.

Add this to the soaking chickpeas. Leave for 24 hours. Drain and thoroughly rinse the chickpeas in a colander under cold running water in the sink. Tip them into a large saucepan, cover abundantly with cold water and add the halved onion, sprigs of thyme and olive oil. Do not salt: at this stage it would make the skins tough. Put on a lid, bring to the boil and let bubble away for an hour and a half. At this stage only make you take off the lid to see how cooked the chickpeas are; you may also now add salt. If they&#39;re cooked, you should lower in a measuring cup to remove about 2 1/4 cups of the cooking water; otherwise keep going until they&#39;re ready. Once you&#39;ve reserved your chickpea cooking liquid, drain the chickpeas and remove - with tongs for ease - the bits of onion and thyme. This doesn&#39;t have to be ruthlessly carried out, but just get rid of any obvious bits. Once cold you can place the chickpeas in a storage bin, tossing them first in olive oil to prevent drying, until you need them; or else cook them through to the final stage, let them cool and refrigerate them in a covered container or bowl covered with plastic wrap. Roughly seed and chop the red cl pepper, peel and chunk the onion, press on the garlic cloves to loosen, then remove the skins, add everything, along with the thyme leaves, into the processor and blitz to a pulp. In a large, deep frying pan or casserole - whatever suits - pour the olive oil, and when warm, tip in the pulp from the processor. Sprinkle with salt and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for about 5 to 10 minutes or until soft. Add the chickpeas and turn to coat, then pour in about half the chickpea cooking liquid and bring to a boil. Put on a lid and let cook gently until the chickpeas are hot and soft; you will probably need to remove the lid at the end of cooking to let excess water evaporate. If, however, you run out of liquid before the chickpeas are tender and soused enough, simply add more of the reserved water. When the chickpeas are ready, turn into a large bowl, or keep in the pan in which you&#39;ve cooked them. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and stir until the chickpeas are glossy but not too thickly slicked. Sprinkle over sea salt and some thyme leaves if you feel like it (and happen to have some scattered anyway over the work surface - you might well at this stage) or leave them simply oiled and salted. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 10999,&quot;Lace Cookies with Gooey Center 4 cups cream 16 ounces semisweet chocolate 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 cup fresh decaffeinated espresso beans, crushed in a mortar or coarse-ground in a grinder 1/2 cup chopped pecans 1/2 pint raspberries Powdered sugar Instructions: The day before, make the ganache center: In a saucepan, heat the cream until boiling and pour over the chopped chocolate. Whisk to combine and then strain. Chill overnight. The next day, whip the ganache in a mixer with a whisk attachment until almost stiff, but still a little gooey. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixer with a whisk attachment, combine the salt, brown sugar, and corn syrup. Add the flour, butter, and vanilla extract, and mix well. Add the espresso and pecans and mix just to combine. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dollop large tablespoonfuls of batter onto the parchment paper, leaving plenty of room between them as the lace cookie tuiles will spread out as they bake to about 5-inches in diameter. Bake until the edges are browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. When done, the tuiles will be bubbly and flat. Once the tuiles are baked, and while still hot but cool enough to hold together, individually peel the tuiles off the parchment paper, and drape them over a short, 3 to 4-ounce rocks or lowball drinking glass and leave them to cool. Repeat until all the tuile batter is used up. When cool, store carefully in an airtight container. When ready to serve, fill lacey tuile-cookie cups with the ganache, and dot with raspberries then give them a dusting of powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11000,&quot;Fish Roll with Compound Butter 2 thin salmon fillets 3 flounder fillets 8 sea scallops 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley Salt and pepper, for seasoning Canola oil, for brushing 4 ounces butter (1 stick), at room temperature 1 teaspoon dry parsley flakes 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper Instructions: On your counter top lay out a sheet of parchment paper and top it with a layer of plastic wrap. Lay out your fillets of salmon, tails away from you. Overlap the fillets of flounder about 1-inch over the tails of the salmon. Then place the scallops on a metal skewer and set at the end of the flounder furthest from you. Sprinkle the herbs over the fish and season with salt and pepper. Using the plastic wrap pull the fish towards you so that the plastic begins to pull the flounder over the scallops. Be sure not to roll the plastic into the fish roll. Use a sheet pan to push the roll tightly as you pull the plastic toward you. The roll should be tight and you should be able to remove the sheet of plastic. Then roll the fish in the parchment away from you so it is covered and can be place into the refrigerator. Refrigerate for 1 hour. For Compound Butter: In a large bowl using a wooden spoon mix all ingredients. Place the mixture on a piece of parchment and fold the parchment over itself. Pull to form a roll and twist the ends. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes to set up. Slice into 1/4-inch rounds and remove the parchment. Preheat your broiler and place the oven rack 6-inches from the heating element. Remove the metal skewer and slice the roulade into 3/4 to 1-inch rounds. Place onto a broiler pan and brush each round with canola oil. Put under the broiler for 3 to 6 minutes depending on how well done you like your fish. Serve with 1 slice of compound butter on each fish roll. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 11001,&quot;Tortilla Soup 1/2 cup each 1/2-inch diced vegetables: yellow onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and tomato 1/2 cup roasted green cl, cut into a small dice 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying 4 cups chicken broth 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 1/4 teaspoon ground comino (cumin) 2 cups Enchilada Chicken, recipe follows 6 each white corn tortillas, cut into 1/4-inch wide strips 6 each blue corn tortillas, cut into 1/4-inch wide strips 3 tablespoons cornstarch Chopped cilantro leaves, as needed 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice Salt, as needed 1 cup crushed corn tortilla chips Instructions: Begin with a large pot. Saute the vegetables and cl briefly in about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes. When the vegetables are limp, add the broth and add the garlic and cumin and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, add chicken, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile (or beforehand), fry the corn tortilla strips in 350 degree F oil for 2 minutes until crispy. Drain well on paper towels. At the Blue Corn Cafe, we always have tons of chips around so we used crushed ones for garnish on the bottom of the soup bowl...the strips are added at the top. We, of course, use white and blue corn tortillas. If for some reason the blue variety are not available where you live, I suggest you immediately draft a letter to your Congressman! Yes, you can use all white or yellow tortillas. To finish the soup, you&#39;ve got to make some slurry. Yep...this will add just a little body to the soup. With the cornstarch in a cup-sized container, mix as little cold water as possible to form a thin paste. This stuff feels and looks like...well, slurry. Bring the soup back up to a boil; stir with 1 hand and pour the slurry in slowly with the other. Continue to cook on high heat for a minute, then reduce to low. The soup will look cloudy at first but will clear up and thicken slightly. Remove from heat. Add cilantro and lime juice. Fill 8 to 12 cups or bowls about 1/4 full of crushed tortilla chips. Ladle soup on top. Place a handful of strips on top of each and serve. This soup (without the tortillas) keeps well for 3 to 4 days refrigerated. Tortillas will also keep well for a few days if sealed well and stored at room temperature. In moist climates they may require re-crisping in a 350 degree F oven for a few minutes. 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken (breast, leg, or thigh) 1/2 cup diced yellow onion 1/2 cup medium-dice green bell peppers 1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves 2 teaspoons oregano leaves 3 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons white pepper 4 cups (1 quart) water This \machaca\ style cooked meat is very versatile: use in tacos, enchiladas, soup, nachos, burritos, etc. Basically a process of braising, the meat and all ingredients are put together in a large pot and brought slowly to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. If you desire, you can bake all of this in a covered dish in a 350 degree F. oven for about 3 hours for the same results. The meat should be tender to the point where it begins to shred...some of it may require quick chopping. You may want to reserve the liquid for use in soups, etc. Use the cooked meat in your dish right away or refrigerate for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Noir, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 11002,&quot;Pork Tenderloin with Roasted Grapes and Mashed Sweet Potatoes 4 strips bacon, cut into lardons 3 tablespoons fennel seeds<br> 2 small pork filet mignon, about 10 ounces each<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 shallot, minced<br> 1/2 cup port wine<br> 2 cups seedless red grapes<br> 1 1/2 cups chicken stock<br> 3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, for garnish<br> 4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into large dice 2 tablespoons heavy cream, warmed<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed<br> Pinch of cayenne pepper<br> Pinch of ground cumin<br> 1 tablespoon light-brown sugar<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: For the Pork Tenderloin with Roasted Grapes: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

For the crust: Here&#39;s a super-easy no-fuss way to make this crust. Break the graham crackers into a food processor with the sugar. Pulse until the crumbs resemble fine meal. Pour the crumbs into a 9-inch springform pan. Pour the melted butter over the mixture, bring together with your fingers and press into the bottom of the pan. Cook&#39;s Note: Feel free to experiment with other graham crackers or cookies. Swap cinnamon or chocolate graham crackers for the original graham crackers for a tasty twist. For the cheesecake: In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until fluffy. Reduce the speed and, with the mixer running, add the eggs. Increase the speed to incorporate the eggs. Add in the pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk and maple syrup. Next, add in the cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Beat the mixture for awhile; this will make the cheesecake light and fluffy. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the prepared crust. Tap the pan lightly on the work surface to remove any air pockets. Bake until the center appears nearly set, but jiggles a little when shaken, 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool for 1 hour. Cover and chill at least 4 hours, or overnight. For the glaze: In a medium saucepan, combine the cream and maple syrup and bring to a boil. Boil until slightly thickened, 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the pecan pieces. Cover and chill. Stir together before serving. To serve: Spoon the maple pecan glaze over the cheesecake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 11034,&quot;Cod and Gnocchi with Tomato Confit 1 cup mixed cherry tomatoes, halved 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 2 teaspoons fresh thyme, chopped 1 teaspoon Calabrian cl paste 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted Small fresh basil leaves, preferably Greek, for topping Two 4- to 6-ounce fillets Alaskan cod Kosher salt 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic, minced Grated zest of 1 lemon 6 ounces frozen gnocchi Flaky sea salt, for finishing Instructions: For the tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Combine the milk, water, butter and salt in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until the liquid is shimmering and the butter is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour and stir to form a dough. Cook, stirring, until the dough releases from the sides of the pan and the flour smells slightly nutty but doesn\u2019t brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a large bowl, add 1 egg and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until fully combined. Beat in the remaining 3 eggs, one at a time, to make a sticky, glossy dough. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2- or 3/4-inch round tip. Pipe mounds of dough on the baking sheet, 1 to 1 1/2 inches wide and about 1 inch high, spacing them 1 inch apart; press down the pointy tops with a wet finger. Bake until deep golden and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let the pastry puffs cool completely on the pan. Make the chocolate sauce: Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring the heavy cream and corn syrup to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Immediately pour over the chocolate and cover the bowl; let sit 5 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Assemble the profiteroles: Cut the pastry puffs in half horizontally. Fill the bottoms with medium-size scoops of ice cream (about 3 tablespoons each).

Rinse and scrub the outsides of the beets. Carefully slice the beets into 1/16-inch-thick rounds using a mandolin slicer. Place in a large bowl and drizzle the olive oil over, turning to coat evenly. Lay out a single layer of beet slices on 2 baking sheets and sprinkle with freshly cracked pepper (don&#39;t add the salt at this point, as it will make the chips less crisp). Bake for 30 to 45 minutes for a regular oven, rotating the sheets from top to bottom halfway through. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes for a convection oven, rotating halfway through. The beets will be darkened around the edges and be mostly crisp; they will firm up a little bit more once cooled. Let the chips cool, and then transfer to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining beet slices. When they are all cooked, toss with salt to taste. For the guacamole: Mash the avocados with a fork or potato masher in a large bowl until slightly chunky. Stir in the cilantro, lime juice, tomatoes and onions. Season the guacamole with salt and pepper and garnish with olive oil. Serve a mound of guacamole in a bowl.

Butter a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Heat the butter over medium-low heat in a small saucepan until the milk solids are deep golden brown and the butter smells toasted, 15 to 20 minutes. Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Stir the brown butter so that any milk solids that have fallen to the bottom are distributed equally throughout the butter. Reserve 4 tablespoons of the brown butter for the glaze. Whisk together the remaining brown butter, brown sugar, eggs and vanilla in a medium bowl, then fold in the mashed bananas. Fold the banana mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (it&#39;s OK if there are some lumps). Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan, and bake until the bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edges, and let cool completely in the pan on a rack. Once the bread has cooled, heat the reserved brown butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until melted, then whisk in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Let the glaze sit at room temperature until it stiffens up a little but is still pourable, about 5 minutes. Pour and spread the brown butter over the bread. Let set. The bread can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11057,&quot;Chicken in Red Wine with Onions, Mushrooms and Bacon: Coq Au Vin 3 to 4-ounce chunk lean bacon 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 1/2 to 3 pounds frying chicken, cut into pieces 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus additional for seasoning 1/8 teaspoon pepper, plus additional for seasoning 1/4 cup cognac 3 cups young, full-bodied red wine, such as Burgundy, Beaujolais, Cotes du Rhone, or Chianti 1 to 2 cups brown chicken stock, brown stock or canned beef bouillon 1/2 tablespoon tomato paste 2 cloves mashed garlic 1/4 teaspoon thyme leaves 1 bay leaf 12 to 24 Brown-Braised Onions, recipe follows 1/2 pound Sauteed Mushrooms, recipe follows 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons softened butter Fresh parsley leaves 1 1/2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 tablespoons oil 18 to 24 peeled white onions, about 1-inch in diameter 1/2 cup brown stock, canned beef bouillon, dry white wine, red wine, or water Salt and pepper Medium herb bouquet: 4 parsley sprigs, 1/2 bay leaf and 1/4 teaspoon thyme tied in cheesecloth 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon oil 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, washed, well dried, left whole if small, sliced or quartered if large 1 to 2 tablespoons minced shallots or green onions, optional Salt and pepper Instructions: Remove the rind and cut the bacon into lardons (rectangles 1/4-inch across and 1-inch long). Simmer for 10 minutes in 2 quarts of water. Rinse in cold water. Dry. In a heavy large heavy bottomed casserole or Dutch oven, saute the bacon slowly in hot butter until it is very lightly browned (temperature of 260 degrees F for an electric skillet). Remove to a side dish. Dry the chicken thoroughly. Brown it in the hot fat in the casserole. (360 degrees F for the electric skillet.) Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Return the bacon to the casserole with the chicken. Cover and cook slowly (300 degrees F) for 10 minutes, turning the chicken once. Uncover, and pour in the cognac. Averting your face, ignite the cognac with a lighted match. Shake the casserole back and forth for several seconds until the flames subside. Pour the wine into the casserole. Add just enough stock or bouillon to cover the chicken. Stir in the tomato paste, garlic and herbs. Bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer slowly for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and its juices run a clear yellow when the meat is pricked with a fork. Remove the chicken to a side dish. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the onions and mushrooms. Simmer the chicken cooking liquid in the casserole for 1 to 2 minutes, skimming off fat. Then raise the heat and boil rapidly, reducing the liquid to about 2 1/4 cups. Correct seasoning. Remove from heat, and discard bay leaf. Blend the butter and flour together into a smooth paste (beurre manie). Beat the paste into the hot liquid with a wire whip. Bring to the simmer, stirring and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon lightly. Arrange the chicken in a casserole, place the mushrooms and onions around it and baste with the sauce. If the dish is not to be served immediately, film the top of the sauce with stock or dot with small pieces of butter. Set aside uncovered for no longer than 1 hour or cool, cover and refrigerate until needed. Shortly before serving, bring the casserole to a simmer, basting the chicken with the sauce. Cover and simmer slowly for 4 to 5 minutes, until the chicken is heated through. Serve from the casserole, or arrange on a hot platter. Decorate with sprigs of parsley. When the butter and oil are bubbling in the skillet, add the onions and saute over moderate heat for 10 minutes, rolling the onions about so they will brown as evenly as possible. Be careful not to break their skins. You cannot expect to brown them uniformly. Braise them as follows: Pour in the stock, season to taste, and add the herb bouquet. Cover and simmer slowly for 15 to 20 minutes until the onions are perfectly tender but retain their shape, and the liquid has evaporated. Remove herb bouquet. Serve them as they are. Bake them as follows: Transfer the onions and their sauteing fat to a shallow baking dish or casserole just large enough to hold them in 1 layer. Set uncovered in upper third of a preheated 350 degree F oven for 40 to 50 minutes, turning them over once or twice. They should be very tender, retain their shape and be a nice golden brown. Remove herb bouquet. Serve them as they are. Place the skillet over high heat with the butter and oil. As soon as you see that the butter foam has begun to subside, indicating it is hot enough, add the mushrooms. Toss and shake the pan for 4 to 5 minutes. During their saute the mushrooms will at first absorb the fat. In 2 to 3 minutes the fat will reappear on their surface, and the mushrooms will begin to brown. As soon as they have browned lightly, remove from heat. Toss the shallots or green onions, if using, with the mushrooms. Saute over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Sauteed mushrooms may be cooked in advance, set aside, then reheated when needed. Season to taste just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz]&quot; 11058,&quot;Crazy Coconut Lemonade 6 to 8 mint leaves, plus more for garnish 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup mixed lemon and lime juice Rum, optional 1/2 gallon water, or to taste Lemon and lime slices Sweetened shredded coconut Instructions: Muddle the mint leaves with a pestle in the bottom of a large pitcher.

Meanwhile, finely dice your cheddar and brie into 1/4-inch cubes. Combine the cheeses with the white wine and ricotta in the top of a double boiler or in a microwave proof container that is large enough to accommodate the cooked pasta. If you are using a double boiler, melt the cheese while the pasta is cooking, if you are using a microwave you can wait until the pasta is done. When the pasta is done, drain, pat dry, and toss it with the melted cheese. Or is you are using a microwave oven, heat the cheese for 1 minute. Whisk it vigorously and return it to the microwave for 20 seconds. Add the drained pasta to the melted cheese, right in the microwave dish, and toss.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Ease the dough into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate and crimp as desired. Pierce all over with a fork. Line the dough with foil, then fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the edges are golden, about 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and continue baking until lightly golden all over, about 10 more minutes. Let cool completely on a rack. Make the filling: Beat the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or use a hand mixer) on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add the egg yolks and beat until pale and thick, about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer speed to medium low; add the flour, lemon juice, lemon zest, nutmeg and salt and beat until just incorporated. Increase the speed to medium high and slowly pour in the buttermilk. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and continue beating until combined. Transfer to a large bowl. Clean the mixer and whisk attachment. Add the egg whites and beat on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. Fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture in three additions until no white streaks remain. Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until golden and set around the edges (the center will still jiggle), 45 to 50 minutes, rotating the pie halfway through. Let cool on a rack.

Dredge each crawfish in the cornstarch, and then shake off any excess. Fry crawfish in a hot, greased skillet for only 45 seconds, so as to not overcook it.<br> For each taquito, lightly butter and warm the tortilla. Drizzle 2 teaspoons hoisin sauce over the entire toasted tortilla, and then sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sesame seeds. In the center of the tortilla, layer the 2 tablespoons romaine, 1/2 tablespoon red cabbage, and top with 1 teaspoon Habanero Onion Puree. Next, drizzle with 2 teaspoons Jalapeno Mayo and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon fried rice sticks. Place a slice of avocado and a crawfish on top of the mixture.

Massage each beet with about a teaspoon of oil and season with salt and pepper. Individually wrap each beet in aluminum foil. Place the beets on a baking sheet and bake for about an hour, or until you can easily pierce them with a knife. When the beets have cooled enough to handle but are still warm, unwrap them and rub them with a dry kitchen towel or paper towels to remove their skin. Cut the beets into quarters and allow to cool completely. Fill a high-sided saute pan with 1/4 cup of water, the honey and butter and place over medium-high heat; stir gently. Once the mixture begins to thicken and form a glaze, turn off the heat, add the cooked beets and toss to coat them in the glaze. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the pistachios, toast them in a small saute pan over medium heat just until they&#39;re warm and you can smell their \pistachio-ness.\ Cool and chop or crush them slightly; they should remain chunky to give good crunch to the dish. For the creme fraiche, place it in a bowl and mix with the lemon zest and about half the chopped mint. Refrigerate until you&#39;re ready to assemble the dish. To serve, spoon the creme fraiche mixture over the bottom of a medium serving dish. Place the warm beets (reheat them if necessary) on top of the creme fraiche in a single layer. (Resist the urge to pile these beauties high; you&#39;ll want to be getting creme fraiche and beet in every bite.) If there&#39;s any glaze leftover in the pan, pour it over the beets. Sprinkle the pistachios over the beets. Tear the parsley leaves with your fingertips and let them fall naturally over the beets. Sprinkle on the rest of the mint, add a few grinds of fresh black pepper and you&#39;re good to go. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 11063,&quot;Bittersweet Chocolate Petit Pots (French Inspired Chocolate Pudding) 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/4 cup water 5 cups milk 9 ounces unsweetened chocolate, preferably Valrhona, coarsely chopped 15 large egg yolks 1 shot of espresso Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water and cook over medium heat until the mixture registers 220 degrees F on a candy thermometer. In another saucepan, heat the milk until it is very hot and small bubbles form around the edge of the pan. Do not let the milk boil. Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and pour the hot milk over it. Stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Return the chocolate mixture to the saucepan and carefully add the hot sugar syrup, using thick oven mitts or potholders. Heat the mixture gently over medium heat, stirring until smooth. Remove the pan from heat. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Slowly drizzle about 1 cup of the hot chocolate mixture into the eggs, whisking well to temper. Pour the tempered yolks into the chocolate mixture and whisk. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Stir in the espresso and set aside to cool slightly. Pour the chocolate mixture into eight 5-ounce ramekins or custard cups. Set the cups in a large shallow roasting pan and set the pan on the center rack of the oven.

Grill the corn, turning every couple of minutes, until nice and charred, 10 to 12 minutes depending on the grill (just keep cooking until they are the level of charred you prefer; be careful, they will pop). Remove from the grill and keep warm. Thinly slice the reserved scallions and set aside. Combine the cream cheese, sour cream and lemon juice in a mixing bowl and whisk until smooth. When the grilled scallions are cool enough to handle, chop them finely and add them to the cream cheese mixture with the everything bagel seasoning. Stir to combine, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. (You will probably need to add salt if your everything seasoning does not have salt.) Schmear the cream cheese mixture on the corn and serve topped with the sliced fresh scallions and additional everything seasoning. Alternatively, this can be made into a dip: cut the corn off the cob, mix with the cream cheese mixture and fresh scallions, pour into a baking dish, top with any good melting cheese and bake until bubbly. Serve with pretzels or chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 11068,&quot;Candied Apple Pie 4-5 cups granny smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced no thinner than 1/4-inch 1 cup sugar 9 oz package Cinnamon Imperials (red hots) 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 2 tablespoon butter 1/2 cup water 2 teaspoons tapioca 1 cup flour 1/2 cup roasted pecans 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 sticks butter, cold and cut into squares 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 3-4 tablespoons ice cold water Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Place cupcake on a rack over paper towels to catch any drips. Top with a small mound coconut grass. Place malted milk eggs on top. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup cupcake tins with paper liners. (To avoid cupcakes sticking if they overflow slightly, lightly spray the tops of the pans.) Put tins on a baking sheet. Set aside. Process sugar and butter in a food processor until very creamy, scraping sides as needed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, pulsing after each addition. Add the milk, water, and vanilla and process to blend. Whisk both flours, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dry ingredients, in 3 batches to the wet, pulsing, and then scraping batter off the sides of the processor as needed after each addition. Process until the batter is very smooth and pourable like pancake batter, about 2 minutes. Evenly pour the batter into the prepared cups, filling them 3/4 of the way full. Bake until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and the tops are golden, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly in tin, and turn out of tin when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a rack before frosting. Put the sugar in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on the lowest speed, slowly add the water, the corn syrup and vanilla extract. When the sugar is sufficiently moistened (it won&#39;t fly out of the mixer), raise the speed to high, and beat for 2 minutes until completely smooth and glossy. Divide and color, as desired. Store at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the icing, to prevent forming a skin. For cupcakes: Dip the surface of the cupcake into the icing, allowing excess to drip into bowl. Clean any excess from the sides. Alternately, use a knife or a spreader to apply. Whisk as needed to keep icing glossy and smooth while using. For Light Blue Icing: Combine 2 to 3 drops of blue food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing.

Mix the eggs and vanilla with a fork in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed until the butter has picked up the sugars, about 30 seconds. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 2 minutes.) Increase the speed to medium, and beat until slightly creamy, about 1 minute (about 3 minutes with a hand mixer), stopping halfway through to scrape the bowl. Reduce the speed to low, slowly add in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture a heaping cup at a time, in 3 additions, stopping a few times to scrape the bowl and beaters (if using a hand mixer, increase the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning). Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium (higher with a hand mixer), and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 2 minutes (about 5 minutes with a hand mixer). Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide the dough into 3 even pieces, each about 13 ounces. Shape each piece into a 6-inch square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight. While the dough chills, cut templates for the house from paper: 1 base, 8 by 8 inches 1 roof, 5 3/4 by 6 1/2 inches 2 slanted side walls, both 5 inches wide, one 4 inches high on the left and 3 inches high on the right, the other 3 inches high on the left and 4 inches high on the right, with optional windows cut out 1 front wall, 5 inches wide by 4 inches high, with a door cut out 1 back wall, 5 by 3 inches To roll, cut and bake the cookies and house: Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (have extra parchment on hand). Take 2 of the dough pieces out of the refrigerator, and let them soften until just pliable but still cool and firm, about 15 minutes. Dust a piece of parchment with flour. Dust one square of dough with flour, and roll it out to about 1/4-inch thick (no thicker) and 9 to 10 inches square. Lift the dough occasionally to make sure it isn&#39;t sticking to the parchment. Cut out cookies with cutters; transfer to a prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Freeze while you cut the rest of the dough. Reserve the scraps for the house pieces. Take the last piece of dough from the refrigerator to soften. Dust the parchment and the second piece of dough with flour. Roll the dough about 1/4-inch thick and 9 to 10 inches square. Lay the base template on top, and use a pizza cutter or a very sharp knife to cut out the base. Peel off the scraps from the sides and reserve. Pick up the parchment with the base on it, put it on an unlined baking sheet and freeze while you finish cutting the other house pieces. Dust a third piece of parchment and the third piece of softened dough with flour. Roll the dough to about 1/4-inch thick and 11 by 7 inches. Put the roof and the front wall templates on top, and use the pizza cutter to cut the pieces. Transfer the pieces to the last prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Cut out a door from the front wall. Combine the scrap pieces with the reserved scraps, and gently knead together on the parchment; flour, roll to 1/4 inch thick and about 8 by 9 inches and cut out the remaining walls. Transfer the pieces to the baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Cut out windows from the walls. Freeze for 10 minutes before baking. Bake the house pieces until golden brown around the edges, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans front to back and bottom to top halfway through the baking time. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes. While the house pieces cool, dust the cookies with sanding sugar if using, and bake until very light golden brown, about 16 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack to completely, about 30 minutes. To assemble the house: Put 1/3 cup royal icing in a pastry bag fitted with the larger pastry tip. Place the roof browned-side up on a work surface with one of the short sides facing you. Pipe a thick 5-inch line of frosting along the short side 1 inch in from the edge. Let the icing harden while you build the rest of the house. (This will prevent the roof of the house from sliding off.) Put the base on a large platter or board on which it will be displayed. Next, assemble the house using the royal icing as glue and making sure to turn the walls lighter-sides out: Hold up one of the side walls and pipe a line of icing along the bottom and up both sides. Set it down while you hold up the back wall and pipe a line of icing along its bottom edge. Stick these two pieces together on the base with the icing, pressing them gently together so they adhere. Hold the pieces for a few seconds, until they can stand on their own. Repeat with the other side wall and the front wall, pressing all four walls together. Reserve the royal icing in the pastry bag. Whisk water about 1 teaspoon at a time into the rest of the icing to thin it slightly to the consistency of molasses. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with the smaller pastry tip. To decorate the house: Decorate the walls as desired: Use the thin icing for piping lines and decorations and for decorating the cookies. Use the thick icing to glue heavy pieces of candy to the sides and roof of the house. To make a grassy yard, spread a thin layer of icing with a butter knife around the base of the house. Press some of the coconut grass into the icing. Put some coconut grass inside the house (you don&#39;t need to ice inside). Decorate the yard as desired. Fill the house with candy and cookies (make sure the icing has set). Set the roof on top, lighter-side up (don&#39;t attach it), and decorate as desired. Combine 2 cups of the confectioners&#39; sugar and the meringue powder with a fork in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. (Alternatively, use a hand mixer and medium bowl.) Add 3 tablespoons of water, and mix on low speed until smooth and thick, with a consistency like caulk. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 3 minutes.) If the icing seems a bit loose, mix in a tablespoon of confectioners&#39; sugar at a time until thickened. Transfer to a clean bowl, and lay a damp piece of paper towel on top. Cover tightly until ready to use. Toss half the coconut and 3 drops food coloring with a fork in a medium bowl until the coconut is uniformly green. Add the remaining coconut, and toss gently to combine. Cover tightly and set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 11082,&quot;Sichuan-Style Crispy Shrimp with Garden Salad 2 eggs 3 heaping tablespoons cornstarch Peanut oil, for frying 1 pound large shrimp (16/20), peeled and deveined 1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns, toasted and ground Sea salt Crushed red dried cl flakes 2 jalapenos, sliced 1/4-inch thick 4 sprigs fresh basil, leaves separated 2 lemons, sliced into wedges, for garnish Garden Salad with Lemon Ginger Vinaigrette, recipe follows 1 heaping tablespoon store-bought fried garlic pieces, optional 1 heaping tablespoon store-bought fried shallot pieces, optional 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 1 lemon) 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 1 teaspoon rice vinegar 1/2 teaspoon peeled and freshly grated ginger 1/2 clove garlic, peeled and finely grated Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cups baby arugula leaves 1 cup shredded Napa cabbage 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced into half-moons 1 large handful fresh basil leaves, finely chopped 2 medium heirloom tomatoes, each cut into 4 slices Instructions: In a large bowl, mix the eggs and cornstarch to make a batter. Set aside. Heat a wok over high heat and add enough peanut oil to fill a third of the way up the sides of the wok. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F, or until a cube of bread turns golden brown in 15 seconds and floats to the surface. Dip the shrimp in the batter and fry in batches until they turn golden brown and are cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle the shrimp liberally with the ground Sichuan peppercorns, sea salt and chili flakes. Dip the jalapeno slices in the batter and fry until golden. Drain on paper towels. Fry the basil leaves until crispy, about 15 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Be careful, as the basil leaves may spatter slightly while frying. For serving, divide the Garden Salad with Lemon Ginger Vinaigrette among four plates. Top the salad with the shrimp and garnish with the lemon wedges, fried jalapeno slices and fried basil leaves. Sprinkle with the fried garlic and shallot pieces, if using. In a large bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and garlic. Season with salt and pepper.

Put the cake flat-side down on a small cardboard circle. Trim 2 opposite sides with a serrated knife to make an oval shape. Cover the sides of the cake with a thick layer of frosting; cover the top with a thin layer (this will be the bottom of the cake). Reserve about 1/2 cup frosting for the inside of the cake. Freeze until the frosting is firm, at least 20 minutes. Gently pat the sides of the cake with a smooth paper towel to even out any bumps in the frosting. Mix 1/2 teaspoon yellow food coloring with a drop of green food coloring and a splash of lemon juice in a small bowl. Paint the yellow-green food coloring all over the side of the cake with a pastry brush. Mix 1/2 teaspoon green food coloring with a splash of lemon juice in another bowl. Paint green stripes on the cake, then blend the edges of the stripes with the tip of the pastry brush. Put another small cardboard circle on the cake and flip it over.

Add the olive oil and tomatoes. Cook the tomatoes, stirring occasionally, until they start to blister and release some of their juices, 8 to 10 minutes. Toss in the garlic and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook another 1 minute, then remove from the heat. In a saucepan over low heat, stir the Parmesan and butter into the Cooked Polenta, thinning with milk as desired. Turn off the heat, stir in the lemon zest, taste for seasoning and add salt if necessary. Transfer the polenta to a serving bowl. Use a spoon to create a shallow well and top with the tomatoes, torn basil, some black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Bring 6 cups of water to a rolling boil in a heavy-bottomed 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting, add the baking soda and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and pour the cornmeal into the water in a very slow stream from a measuring cup, all the while whisking in a circular motion to prevent lumps. Cook, vigorously stirring the polenta with a wooden spoon for about 10 seconds once every 5 minutes and making sure to scrape clean the bottom and corners of the pot, until the polenta has lost its raw cornmeal taste and becomes soft and smooth, about 30 minutes. If the polenta looks like it&#39;s drying out too quickly, continue cooking with the lid on.

Add the lemon juice. Remove from the heat and strain with a fine sieve. Return to saucepan, and reduce until the mixture bubbles and has a syrup-like consistency. You should have about 1/4 cup. Remove from the heat and strain again. Let cool to room temperature. Add the olive oil and salt. Refrigerate for up to 1 1/2 weeks. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place beets in a baking pan, drizzle with the oil, and season with salt. Cover with foil. Bake for about 1 hour, or until tender when pierced with a knife. When cool enough to handle, peel them, slice thinly into round, and place in a dish. Remove wedge of blue cheese from the freezer. Using a microplane grater, grate the desired amount over the top of the beets. Garnish with almonds as desired. Blanch 1 cup almonds in boiling water, until the skins peel off. In an oven-proof skillet, heat 2 tablespoons butter, and add the peeled almonds. Sprinkle with Napa-style spice rub, and toss to coat. Place skillet in the oven and bake for about 6 to 7 minutes, or until light brown. Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and cl flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Chef&#39;s Note: Toasting freshens spices, releases their oils, and makes them more fragrant, as well as adding a new dimension of flavor. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. Taste your chili powder and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chiles are almost sweet, not hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 11115,&quot;Matt&#39;s Sriracha Pimento Cheese Dip 1 lb cheddar cheese, mild to aged, grated 1 jar (4 oz) pimentos, drained 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons sriracha Instructions: Add all ingredients to a food processor.

Cut the racks in half (leaving you with 4 (4-bone) servings). Heat a large skillet over high heat, season the racks with salt and pepper and sear fat side down in the hot skillet until well browned. Turn the racks, fat side up and place in a 350 degree F oven for about 30 minutes. You can use a probe thermometer to check the temperature. (At Siro&#39;s we roast the racks in a 325 degrees F convection, 20 to 25 minutes to get to medium). When the racks are at the desired temperature, remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. While the lamb is roasting, heat a saucepan over medium-high heat and saute the shallots and garlic until soft. Add the Merlot, turn the heat down to medium, and reduce by half. Heat the demi glace and rosemary in another saucepan and let simmer slowly for twenty minutes. Stir in the reduced Merlot mixture a little at a time into the simmering demi-glace until you can just begin to taste the wine in the sauce. At this time we combine a little arrow root with cold water and stir it into the sauce to give the sauce a little bit of a shine and some thickening. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, ladle the sauce onto 4warm plates, cut the lamb in half and serve with Roasted Garlic Bread Pudding, Sauteed wild mushrooms, and a seasonal green vegetable. Set a skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons oil. When hot add the onion, celery, carrot, bell pepper, scallion, and minced garlic. Cook until the vegetables begin to soften, mince the rosemary and briefly rub in your hand before adding to the vegetables. Cook for 2 more minutes, season with salt and pepper and let cool. Combine the whole eggs with the egg yolks and beat well. Stir in the heavy cream and the roasted garlic puree until well blended. Combine the cream mixture with the vegetables and the dried bread cubes and mix well. Allow the mixture to stand overnight, covered in the refrigerator. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold into the bread pudding one third at a time and mound in a greased large muffin tin (you should get 4 to 6). Bake in a 350 degree F oven 45 to 60 minutes until golden brown. 3/4 cup olive oil To roast garlic, cut the tops off the garlic heads and simmer in 1 cup of milk for 10 minutes. Drain, season with salt and pepper, and combine garlic with 3/4 cup oil. Place in a tightly covered pan and roast for 2 hours in a 275 degree F oven. Uncover and let cool. Strain the oil to remove unwanted garlic skin. Squeeze the garlic from the heads and place in a small blender and puree, adding the strained oil in a slow, steady stream to emulsify the oil into the puree. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 11131,&quot;Portobello Mushroom \Fries<br> 4 large portobello mushroom caps Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling, plus 1/4 cup Steak seasoning blend, such as Montreal Steak Seasoning, or coarse salt and black pepper 2 eggs, beaten 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped 1 cup Italian bread crumbs 1/2 cup shredded or grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat a grill pan over medium high to high heat.

Add the chicken, water, and stock, making sure liquid covers meat. Tie the thyme sprigs, parsley stems, and sage sprigs together and add to the pot along with the peppercorns, and celery. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the chicken until it is \fall of the bone\ tender, about 30 minutes, skimming off scum as it simmers. Remove the chicken from the pot to a cutting board and let cool. Remove the herb bundle and the celery and discard. Reserve the stock. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pull it from bones and cut into bite-sized pieces.<br> In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups of flour with the remaining chopped herbs and the tablespoon of salt. Make a well in the middle and pour 1 cup of the reserved chicken stock, including fat, into the well. Using a fork, slowly stir the stock into the flour. Repeat, adding more flour and/or stock until a soft, doughy consistency is reached. Add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if it gets too sticky. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 to 1/4-inch thickness. Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to slice the dough into 2-inch squares, then cut the squares in half on the diagonal into triangles.<br> Return the stock to a simmer and slowly add the dumplings, allowing some excess flour to remain on the dumplings to increase the body of the broth. Be careful not to let the dumplings touch as they are added to the pot. Cook until the dumplings rise to the surface. If the broth does not thicken to your liking, mix together 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon flour in a small bowl with a fork. Slowly add the mixture into the broth to help thicken the soup. Stir in the reserved chicken and ladle into serving bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11133,&quot;Chili Rice 3 tablespoons canola oil 1 red onion, minced 1 jalapeno, seeded, minced 1 green bell pepper, minced 1 red bell pepper, minced 2 tablespoons garlic, minced 1 cup Roma tomatoes, diced 3/4 pound ground beef or turkey 2 cups long-grain rice 8 ounces kidney beans 2 cups chicken stock 1 1/2 cups water 1 teaspoon paprika 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons green onion, sliced, for garnish Instructions: In medium stock pot over medium heat, add oil, onions and peppers and saute until translucent.

Carefully oil the grill or grill pan with a cloth dipped in a little olive oil. If using a grill, have the grilling surface 8 to 10 inches above the embers. Regulate the amount of coals under the grill so that it maintains a consistent medium-hot heat (the oil on the grill will begin to smoke). Prepare the chicken. Coat each chicken breast with the extra-virgin olive oil. Season each side evenly with a little salt and pepper. Place the chicken on the grill, skin side first, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Turn over and continue to cook in the same manner another 4 or 5 minutes until the meat is slightly firm to the touch. Season 1 side evenly with the roasted garlic rub. Remove from the heat and reserve until cool. Cut the chicken with the grain into bite-size pieces. Reserve. Divide the dough into 6 balls. Working on a surface free of flour, roll each ball under your palm. As it rolls, it will stick slightly to the surface, creating tension that helps form a tight, round ball. Dust the work surface with flour, pat each ball down lightly, dust the tops with flour, cover with a towel, and let rise for about 15 minutes. With a rolling pin, roll each ball into a circle 8 or 9-inches in diameter and about 1/8-inch thick and place on a cookie sheet that has been sprinkled with cornmeal (to keep the dough from sticking). On a clean grill surface (use a wire brush then oil again as before) gently lay the piadine on the grill and cook until the bottom has set and is cooked, but not so well done that it is not pliable, about 4 minutes. Turn the crust and cook on the second side. The cooking time will vary with the heat of the grill. Remove crusts. Meanwhile, toss together the spinach, mozzarella, tomato wedges, red onion, Parmesan and chicken. Toss with vinaigrette to coat the greens and taste for seasoning with salt and pepper. Place the crusts on plates and divide the salad among them.

Remove from the heat and serve with steamed rice. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 11153,&quot;Clementine Sprinkle Cake 1/2 cup vegetable oil, plus more for greasing the pans One 15.25-ounce box confetti vanilla cake mix<br> 3 large eggs<br> 5 clementines, 4 zested and juiced (about 1 tablespoon zest and 1/4 cup juice), 1 thinly sliced<br> 3 sticks salted butter, at room temperature<br> 6 cups powdered sugar<br> Orange food coloring<br> Multi-colored sprinkles, for decorating<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Oil the bottom and sides of two 8-inch cake pans. Combine the cake mix, eggs, vegetable oil and 1 cup of water in a large bowl. Stir in half of the clementine zest and juice. Pour into the prepared pans. Bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 5 minutes, then invert onto a rack and cool completely. While the cakes cool, make the frosting. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add half of the powdered sugar and carefully mix until thoroughly incorporated. Add the remaining powdered sugar and mix again until fully combined. Add the remaining clementine juice and zest, then beat until light and fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Add the food coloring to achieve your desired color, starting with a few drops and adding until you get the color you like. Place 1 cooled cake layer on a cake stand or plate. Top with about 1/2 cup frosting and spread evenly. Top with the remaining cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides of the cake. Sprinkle the top and sides of the cake with sprinkles. Take the thin slices of clementine and make a slit halfway through. Twist the slices and place on the top of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 11154,&quot;Pineapple Upside Down Cornbread Muffins Nonstick cooking spray, for the muffin pan 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 2 cups fresh pineapple, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 1/2 cup boiling water 1/2 cup fine yellow cornmeal<br> 3/4 cup buttermilk<br> 1 large egg, lightly beaten<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> Flaky sea salt, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the pineapple: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray. Combine the brown sugar, butter, allspice, kosher salt and cinnamon in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook until bubbling. Add the pineapple, stir to coat and cook until the liquid has nearly evaporated and the caramel has deepened in color, about 7 minutes. For the muffins: Meanwhile, working quickly, whisk the boiling water into the cornmeal in a large bowl until you get a stiff mash. Whisk in the buttermilk, stirring until smooth. Stir in the egg, then add the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, kosher salt and baking soda and mix until just incorporated. Add 2 to 3 pieces of the pineapple to the bottom of each muffin cup. Evenly divide the cornbread mixture among the muffin cups, filling each three-quarters of the way full. Bake for 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Use a paring knife to remove each muffin, flipping it to reveal the caramelized pineapple before placing on a plate.

Add the onion and fennel and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are golden, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, pepper, and saffron and cook another minute. Stir in the vermouth and simmer until reduced by about half. Lightly crush the tomatoes through your fingers into the pot; stir in their juices, add the water, orange zest, bay leaf, cover, and simmer until the flavors come together, about 20 minutes. Adjust the heat so that the broth simmers briskly. Stir in the clams, cover the pot, and cook until they just begin to open, 6 to 8 minutes. (To keep the clams from overcooking, transfer any fully opened ones to a bowl.) Add the scallops and shrimp and cook, uncovered, until they are just cooked through and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir in the vinegar, parsley, and return any of the cooked clams along with their juices. Season with salt, if needed. Divide stew and shellfish among 4 warm bowls.

Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to the bottom of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Sprinkle the minimum amount of water over the butter and flour mixture and stir gently with a fork -- the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough holds together easily. To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1-second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible -- about 15 pulses in all. Scatter the minimum amount of water on the butter and flour mixture and pulse 5 or 6 times -- the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough holds together easily. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form it into a disk. Wrap and refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour, or up to several days &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 11157,&quot;Carne Seca Rosti 5 pounds top sirloin roast 1 pound kosher salt, plus 2 tablespoons Vegetable oil 2 cups diced onions 1 cup minced garlic 2 cups diced tomatoes 2 cups chopped fresh cilantro 10 pounds shredded potatoes 2 teaspoons black pepper 2 1/2 pounds Catupiry cheese, in a pastry bag 20 jarred Sweety Drop peppers, for serving 10 teaspoons dried parsley, for serving Instructions: Cut the top sirloin into 2-inch cutlets. Thoroughly salt the cutlets on all sides and refrigerate, covered, in a large container, adding more salt every 24 hours, until the meat is dehydrated, 3 to 5 days. Rinse the salt from the cutlets and place into a clean container. Cover with water and return to the refrigerator for 24 hours, changing the water every 4 to 6 hours. Cut the cutlets into big chunks and put into a pressure cooker. Fill with enough water to just cover. Cook for 40 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure cooker to release all the pressure before opening. Transfer the meat to a bowl and pull into strips with a fork while still hot. Reserve. Pour 1 cup vegetable oil into a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Transfer this mixture to the bowl with the meat. Add the cilantro and mix everything together well. Set the carne seca filling aside. In a separate bowl, combine the shredded potatoes, black pepper and 2 tablespoons salt. Mix well and set aside. In a 7-inch nonstick skillet, scoop 8 ounces of the shredded potatoes to form the base of the rosti. Layer with about 2/3 cup of the carne seca filling and top with another 8 ounces of the shredded potatoes. Place the skillet over high heat. Drizzle vegetable oil around the rosti (enough so that you can see it sizzling on the sides). Fry until golden brown, about 7 minutes, draining the oil halfway through (see Cook&#39;s Note). Flip the rosti and repeat this process. When both sides are golden brown, transfer the rosti to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with the remaining shredded potato and carne seca filling. To serve, top each rosti with about 4 ounces of the Catupiry, piped in a crisscross pattern.

Liberally butter the bottom and sides of 2 cake pans. Put a round of parchment paper into the bottom of each pan and coat them with butter. Put the pans on a baking sheet. Melt the 10 tablespoons of butter in a small pot over low heat. Remove the pot from the stove and allow it to cool slightly. Reserve. In a medium bowl, sift together the baking soda, salt, baking powder and flour. In a large bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and sour cream together until smooth. Add the flour mixture in small batches to the wet ingredients, whisking as you go to avoid the formation of lumps. Make a well in the center of the batter and pour in the melted butter. Whisk until smooth. Fold in the chopped chocolate Divide the batter between the cake pans and spread out to level the top. Gently tap the sides of the pan so the batter distributes evenly. Slide the baking sheet into the center of the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven and allow the cakes to cool briefly. Invert the cakes from the pans onto a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack and peel off the parchment paper. Allow them to cool for at least 45 minutes before frosting. Frosting: Pour some water, about 2 inches deep, into a saucepan to create a makeshift double boiler. Put the pan on the stove and bring the water to a gentle simmer. Dip the instant-read thermometer into the simmering water to clean any impurities off the end and to test that the thermometer works. In a clean, large mixing bowl, combine the 5 tablespoons of cool water, cream of tartar, sugar, egg whites and corn syrup. Gently lower the bowl over the simmering water. Turn off the heat under the pot. Use an electric hand beater to whip the whites over the water. Do not leave the egg white mixture unattended or stop beating any time during this process. After about 3 minutes, remove the bowl from the heat, set the beater down and quickly take the temperature of the egg whites. You want them to reach 140 degrees F. If you measure the temperature before they reach that point, immediately put the bowl of whites back over the water and resume beating until they are finished, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the water and fold in the vanilla extract. It should look like marshmallow fluffiness. Set the frosting aside to allow the mixture to cool. Frost the cake by, as my father used to say, \glopping\ the frosting all over the top and the sides. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 11165,&quot;Indian Carrot Salad 1 1/4 pounds good-quality coarsely ground lamb 2 teaspoons garam masala Sea salt 1 pound carrots (mixed colors if possible), peeled 1 tablespoon sesame seeds A small bunch fresh cilantro, leaves picked A small bunch fresh mint, leaves picked 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 3 shallots or 1 small red onion, peeled 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 heaped teaspoon freshly grated ginger Extra-virgin olive oil Naan bread Yogurt Lemon halves Instructions: This is a beautiful fresh Indian-style salad with a zingy crispness that goes wonderfully with spicy lamb. The dressed carrots can be served on their own with some added apple or celery for extra sweetness and crunch. Heat a large frying pan and fry your ground lamb until all the fat comes out of it. Add the garam masala and a good pinch of salt and give it a stir. Keep frying until the meat is lovely and crispy. Shave the carrots into long thin strips with a peeler or a mandoline slicer and set them aside. Heat a small frying pan over a moderate heat and toast the cumin seeds for 30 seconds - they will start to smell nutty and gorgeous. You&#39;re not trying to cook the seeds here, you&#39;re just waking their flavors up a bit. Put them into a pestle and mortar and grind them up. Put the pan back on the heat and toast the sesame seeds until golden. Transfer them to a plate. Slice your peeled shallots or onion wafer thin. As with all salads that contain onion, you don&#39;t want to be coming across great big chunks! If you don&#39;t feel confident about your knife skills, use the coarse side of a box grater instead. This will almost mush your onions to a puree, but at least you won&#39;t come across any big bits. To make your dressing, put the lemon zest and juice into a bowl and add the shallots or onion, grated ginger, ground cumin and a pinch of salt. Whisk everything together with about 5 tablespoons of extra- virgin olive oil. Pour the dressing over the carrots, add the cilantro and mint leaves, and mix it all together using your fingers. It&#39;s important that you have a little taste to check whether the dressing needs more lemon juice, oil or seasoning. Divide the crispy lamb between 4 plates and put the dressed salad on top. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds. Served with naan bread, some yogurt and lemon halves, this makes a great snack! \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Whisk in 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of the melted butter. Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Once the dough is shaggy, but mostly holding together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your hands with flour and knead the dough for about 3 minutes, adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Form the dough into a ball and place back inside the mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and leave in a warm, dry place to rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down once to release some of the air bubbles. Turn the dough out onto a very lightly floured surface and divide the dough into 8 equal pieces with a pizza cutter or a sharp knife. Form each piece into a ball, and place seam side down. Let rise, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bring 12 cups of water and the baking soda to a light simmer in a large pot. Submerge 2 to 3 dough balls at a time into the simmering water using a slotted spoon. Let them sit in the water for 10 seconds per side. Carefully remove each roll, making sure to drain off as much liquid as possible and place on the prepared baking sheet. Using a sharp knife, make an X on the top of each roll. Brush the remaining melted butter on the rolls and sprinkle with a generous pinch of sea salt. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. To assemble the sandwiches: Slice each roll in half. Spread softened butter on each of the cut sides of the roll, using about 1 tablespoon of butter per roll. Delicately fold and layer ham on the bottom half of each roll. Top with brie and place about a 1/4 cup of arugula on top of the ham.

Roughly chop the raisins, then add them to the pestle and mortar with a splash or 2 of sherry and a splash of extra-virgin olive oil. Muddle everything together to make a paste, then put to one side for a minute. Lay each pork chop in front of you so the side with the fat is farthest away. Carefully insert a knife into the side nearest you and move it around to make a pocket inside. Use your fingers to fill each pocket with the raisin paste. Cook&#39;s Note: To see what I mean, go to www.jamieoliver.com/how-to. To make the beans: Fry the strips of fat from your pata negra or bacon in a medium pan on a high heat for a few minutes, then add the offcuts (or bacon) and a drizzle of olive oil. Stir in the chopped onion and pepper, then turn the heat down and cook for about 5 more minutes, or until the vegetables have softened. Roughly chop your rosemary leaves and add those to the pan along with your bay leaves. Add the beans to the pan with 1 1/2 cups/350 ml water. Stir, then leave to tick away for about 20 minutes. Keep an eye on the beans and add a splash more water if they look dry. Get a barbecue or griddle pan really hot. Rub some olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper all over the pork chops. Put them on the very hot side of your barbecue and sear them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side to get some good colour going, then move them to the gentler side of the barbecue so they can cook slowly. If you&#39;re using a griddle pan, turn the heat down to medium-low and cook for a further 10 minutes, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, finely chop the stalks of the Swiss chard and add them to the pan with the beans. Roughly chop the leaves and add them to the pan for the last minute or 2 of cooking so as not to lose the flavour. Taste the beans and season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few more minutes if you want to achieve a thicker consistency. Divide the beans evenly among 4 plates and lay a pork chop over each. Sprinkle over the reserved oregano leaves, finish with a drizzle of olive oil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Barolo, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 11175,&quot;Online Round 2 Recipe - Eggs in Purgatory 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 medium yellow onion, diced 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 1/2 cups leftover bloody Mary mix Salt 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves 4 eggs 4 slices crusty bread, toasted Instructions: Heat the canola oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.
