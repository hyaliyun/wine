bins, chopped 4 slices bacon 2 pounds baby potatoes, halved Salt 1 pound thin green beans 2 vine tomatoes, halved lengthwise, seeded and thinly sliced Leaves from 4 fresh thyme sprigs 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 4 scallions, finely chopped, whites and greens 1/4 cup chicken stock Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Using a small sharp knife cut into the thick end of the chicken and make an incision reaching 2/3 the way down the breast. Loosen up the incision with your fingers to make a hole. Season the chicken with pepper. Combine the cheese with arugula and baby spinach and stuff the breasts. Spiral-wrap the breasts with the bacon tightly to cover the meat evenly. Place chicken on a nonstick baking sheet and roast 20 to 22 minutes until bacon is crispy and chicken is firm. Place the potatoes in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, season water with salt and cook potatoes 15 minutes, or until tender. Bring 1-inch water to a boil. Trim beans. Salt water and add beans to water. Simmer 5 minutes, drain and combine with tomatoes, thyme, 1 tablespoon oil, salt and pepper. Place the potatoes back in the hot pot after draining. Coat the potatoes with 2 tablespoons oil, the scallions, chicken stock and salt and pepper. Toss for 1 minute. Serve chicken with green beans and potatoes alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68704,&quot;Drunk&#39;n Steak chuck, or any cut of beef or meat rum cola vegetables, your choice salt pepper, freshly ground butter ice cubes Instructions: Choose your favorite cut of meat. In my family we use chuck because it is very inexpensive and badly NEEDS tenderizing. Take a small-tipped paring knife and puncture the meat on both sides several times. Doing this helps get flavor into the meat, not just on the surface. Place the meat in a glass pan. (I&#39;ve never seen it, but I have heard that acidic liquids can do damage to your metal cookware.) In another bowl, mix one part rum (We use Captain Morgan&#39;s Spiced Rum, though the Coconut one is really good too.) to two parts cola (don&#39;t use Pepsi because it is too sweet). Pour the mixture over your meat (make sure that the meat is covered by the liquid). Cover and let sit for at least two hours in the refrigerator. Make sure to turn the meat at least once. We usually have some grilled vegetables with this as well. Choose your favorite summer vegetables and place on a sheet of buttered aluminum foil, leave half of the foil sheet empty so it can be used to created a packet. On top of the vegetables place one tablespoon of margarine or butter, and one cube of ice. Sprinkle garlic salt, onion powder, and rotiserrie chicken seasoning over the vegetables. Fold uncovered part of foil over the vegetables to form a packet and seal. Get your grill nice and hot and place vegetable packets on. Pull the meat from the refrigerator. Take meat out of the marinade and place on a plate. Rub a small amount of freshly ground pepper and salt into the meat. Put meat on the grill...mix yourself a rum and coke and use a little of it to keep the flames off of the meat. Cooking time depends on your grill. The steaks can also be done in the kitchen but are so much more fun out in the yard. Enjoy one of my families favorites and have a great summer. Happy eating. &quot;,&quot;[Rum, Cola, Merlot, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 68705,&quot;Baked Eggs 3 tablespoons butter, melted 8 eggs<br> 8 tablespoons heavy cream<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper<br> Assorted toppings: shredded Cheddar cheese and crispy chorizo (see Cook&#39;s Note); diced lox and scallions; sauteed sliced mushrooms; 1-inch pieces of steamed asparagus; crumbled feta and chopped chives<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a kettle or small pot of water just to a simmer. Brush the insides of 8 small ramekins with the melted butter. Crack 1 egg into each ramekin. Add 1 tablespoon of heavy cream to each ramekin and season with salt and pepper. Add any combination of toppings to the ramekins. (Or even better, let your guests add their preferred toppings.) Place the ramekins in a high-sided baking dish. Pour the simmering water into the baking dish until it comes about halfway up the ramekins. Cover loosely with aluminum foil and bake until the eggs reach a custard-like consistency and the yolks are just set, 12 to 15 minutes. Carefully remove the ramekins from the water bath. Let cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68706,&quot;Fish Fry Vegetable oil, for frying 1 1/2 to 2 pounds fresh cod Salt and pepper 1 /2 cup all-purpose unbleached flour 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons cold water, a splash 2 cups plain bread crumbs 1/2 teaspoon dried mustard powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, a few pinches Wedged lemons and malt vinegar for topping Instructions: Pour 2-inches of vegetable oil into a large skillet. Place skillet over large burner and heat oil over medium high heat. To check if the oil is hot enough, drop in 1-inch cube of white bread. The bread should brown in a 40 count. Cut cod into 4 servings, 6 to 8-ounce portions and season with salt and pepper. Place a couple of scoops of flour in a pie tin. Combine egg and water in second tin. Season plain bread crumbs and mustard and cayenne in the third tin. Coat fish in flour, then egg, and then bread crumbs. Gently set coated fish into hot oil and fry 5 minutes on each side until medium golden brown in color. When the fish is evenly golden all over, remove and drain on brown paper sacks. Suggested: 3 disposable pie tins . &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68707,&quot;Roasted Pumpkin Soup with Chipotle Cream 1 medium pumpkin, about 4 pounds 1 tablespoon butter 2 slices bacon, diced 1 large yellow onion, chopped 6 cups chicken stock 1/2 cup heavy cream, plus 1 cup, for garnish 1/4 cup orange juice Large pinch freshly grated nutmeg Salt and freshly ground black pepper Whole leaves flat-leaf parsley, as a garnish 1 tablespoon chipotle pepper in adobo sauce Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Halve the pumpkin from top to bottom and place it, cut side down, on an oiled baking sheet. Bake until the pumpkin can be easily skewered, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool for about 20 minutes. With a spoon, remove the seeds and discard. Scrape the pulp and reserve. Discard the skin. Melt butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the bacon and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and the bacon is just turning golden, about 7 minutes. Add the pumpkin and stock and simmer until the pumpkin falls apart, about 30 minutes. Let cool for about 20 minutes. In batches, puree the soup in a blender on high speed, 3 minutes per batch, until very smooth. Strain through a fine mesh into a clean soup pot and add the cream, orange juice and nutmeg. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. If the soup is too thick, correct the consistency with additional water or stock. Chop 1 tablespoon chipotle pepper. Whip 1 cup cream to soft peak. Stir peppers into cream. Ladle the hot soup into bowls. Spoon dollop of chipotle cream into soup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 68708,&quot;Green Beans with Smoked Ham Kosher salt 2 pounds green beans, trimmed and halved 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large onion, thinly sliced 1/2 pound smoked ham, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water and blot dry with paper towels; set aside. (This can be done up to 4 hours ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion, season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden, about 8 minutes. Add the ham and continue cooking until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and remove from the heat. Add the green beans to the pot and stir until combined and warmed through. Add the parsley and season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68709,&quot;Pasta Chips with Alfredo Dip Vegetable oil, for frying Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 12-ounce box tri-color bow-tie pasta 1/2 cup heavy cream 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for sprinkling Pinch grated nutmeg Instructions: Line a baking sheet with a clean dish towel. Fill a large saucepan fitted with a deep-frying thermometer with 2 inches of oil and bring to 375 degrees F over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions for al dente. Drain the pasta and spread it out onto the prepared baking sheet. Pat completely dry with another clean dish towel. Meanwhile, mix the heavy cream, cream cheese, Parmesan, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper in a medium microwave-safe bowl until smooth. Microwave until the Parmesan has melted, about 45 seconds. Stir until smooth and refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes. Line another baking sheet with paper towels. Fry the pasta in the oil, 1 cup at a time, stirring, until golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with salt, pepper and Parmesan. Carefully break apart any pieces that have stuck together. Repeat with the remaining pasta, bringing the oil back to 375 degrees F between each batch. Serve with the Alfredo dip.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 68710,&quot;Portuguese Steak 1/4 cup grapeseed oil 8 pounds veal bones (joints preferred)<br> 24 cups (6 quarts) ice water<br> 8 ounces onions, roughly chopped<br> 4 ounces carrots, peeled and roughly chopped<br> 4 ounces celery, roughly chopped<br> One 6-ounce can tomato paste<br> 8 cups red wine<br> 5 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 bay leaf<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 pounds russet potatoes, well scrubbed 16 cups (1 gallon) vegetable oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons white vinegar 12 large eggs<br> Six 8-ounce New York strip steaks 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br> Six 3-ounce ham steaks (1/4 inch thick), fat trimmed 2 tablespoons butter, for finishing demi-glace Instructions: For the demi-glace: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Pour the oil into a metal roasting pan and put it in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes to heat up the pan and condition it with the oil. Spread the bones out in the roasting pan and cook until browned, turning the bones occasionally so they brown evenly, 30 to 45 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the bones to a stockpot large enough to accommodate the bones and more. (Use tongs so that you do not pour any fat into the stockpot; reserve the fat in the pan.) Add the ice water to the pot and bring to a simmer. Allow the stock to cook for 4 hours at a slow simmer, skimming the surface of the stock occasionally to remove any fat or impurities. While the stock is simmering, discard all but about 1/4 cup of the fat in the roasting pan. Heat the pan on the stovetop over high heat until hot. Add the onions and carrots and caramelize to a golden brown. Add the celery and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook until the tomato paste turns a brick red color (about 15 minutes), stirring regularly. Stir 1 cup of the red wine into the onion, carrot and celery mixture (the mirepoix) and set aside. After the stock has simmered for 4 hours, add the mirepoix mixture, thyme and bay leaf. Bring the stock back up to a simmer and continue to cook for another 2 hours. In a separate pot, bring the remaining 7 cups red wine to a boil and reduce by one-half. Strain the finished stock through a chinois and combine the strained stock with the reduced red wine. Bring the stock to a boil and then reduce the heat to a hard simmer. Reduce the stock until it&#39;s about 8 cups and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 30 to 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and then strain the sauce though a chinois again. For the French fries: Cut the potatoes (with the skins on) into batons the length of the potato (1/4 inch by 1/4 inch by 2 inches). Put the cut potatoes directly into a large bucket filled with water. Run cold water over the cut potatoes until the water flowing over the bucket runs clear. In a large pot or table-top fryer, heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels Cook the potatoes in batches just long enough to make them tender but not give them any color, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the blanched fries to the prepared pan and spread them out in a single layer to cool. For the poached eggs, steak and ham: Combine 8 cups water and the vinegar in a saucepan and heat to 180 degrees F. Poach 4 eggs at a time by cracking the eggs and gently lowering each egg into the water. Once the eggs have turned completely white, use a slotted spoon to gently release any eggs that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. Allow the eggs to cook for 3 minutes. Continue with the remaining eggs. Reheat the French fry oil to 350 degrees F (to fry the potatoes a second time just before serving). While the eggs are poaching, season the steaks with the salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Add the grapeseed oil to the skillet followed by the steaks, making sure not to overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if you have to. Cook the steaks for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side, and then flip. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for medium-rare to medium steaks (depending on the thickness). Remove the steaks and allow them to rest for 5 minutes. While the steaks are resting, sear the ham pieces in the skillet on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Cook the fries in batches in the hot oil until they are golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and toss in a bowl with salt and pepper. To plate: Heat about 1 1/2 cups of the demi-glace in a pan and add the butter. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until combined. Place a steak on each plate. Pour 1/4 cup of sauce over each steak. Place a piece of ham on top of the sauce and then top with 2 poached eggs. Top each plate with fries. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 68711,&quot;Spaghetti Carbonara Kosher salt 1 (16-ounce) package spaghetti 8 strips bacon 4 large eggs, room temperature 1/2 cup Parmesan, divided Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti, cover the pot, and bring it back to a boil. Remove the cover, stir, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and set aside. (Reserve 1 cup pasta for the Round 2 Recipe Savory Noodle Pie.) While the pasta is cooking, place of the bacon into a large skillet over medium heat and cook until crispy, about 8 minutes. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with half the Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Transfer the bacon to a sheet tray lined with a paper bag (reserve 2 strips for the Online Round 2 Recipe Savory Noodle Pie). Chop the remaining 6 pieces and set aside. Remove all but 1 tablespoon fat from the pan and put the pan back on the heat. Add the cooked spaghetti and toss to coat in the bacon fat. Turn off the heat and add the egg mixture. Toss gently to coat the pasta and cook the eggs. Toss in the chopped bacon. If the sauce is too thick, add the pasta water 1/4 cup at a time until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Serve immediately garnished with the remaining cheese and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 68712,&quot;Skirt Steak 1/2 cup olive oil 1/3 cup soy sauce 4 scallions, washed and cut in 1/2 2 large cloves garlic 1/4 cup lime juice 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar or Mexican brown sugar 2 pounds inside skirt steak, cut into 3 equal pieces Special equipment: blow dryer Instructions: Heat charcoal, preferably natural chunk, until grey ash appears. In a blender, put in oil, soy sauce, scallions, garlic, lime juice, red pepper, cumin, and sugar and puree. In a large heavy duty, zip top bag, put pieces of skirt steak and pour in marinade. Seal bag, removing as much air as possible. Allow steak to marinate for 1 hour in refrigerator. Remove steak from bag and pat dry with paper towels. Using a blow dryer, blow charcoal clean of ash. Once clean of ash lay steaks directly onto hot coals for 1 minute per side. When finished cooking, place meat in double thickness of aluminum foil, wrap, and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove meat from foil, reserving foil and juices. Slice thinly across the grain of the meat. Return to foil pouch and toss with juice. Serve with grilled peppers and onions, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 68713,&quot;The Best Bowl of Oatmeal Ever 2 cups water 2 cups milk 1 cup Irish steel-cut oats 1 pinch salt 1/2 cup apple juice 1/2 cup golden raisins or dried cherries 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon Instructions: In a medium saucepan, bring the water and milk to a boil. Stir in the steel-cut oats and salt and cook a few minutes to thicken. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan bring the apple juice to a boil, add the raisins, and cook a few minutes to help them plump. In a mixing bowl, with a whip attachment combine the heavy cream, brown sugar, and cinnamon and whip until stiff. Keep chilled. Remove the cooked oatmeal from the heat and serve piping hot in bowls. Sprinkle the plumped raisins on top of the oatmeal and spoon a dollop of the brown sugar cinnamon whipped cream in the center and serve. Notes about the recipe: To cut some of the cooking time, soak the oats in water overnight by bringing the water to a boil, turn off the heat, and add the oats. Cover the pot and let sit over night. The next morning cook on low heat 9 to 12 minutes stirring occasionally. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>Given the following recipe, provide the wine types that would pair well with the recipe.

Place the sliced cucumbers in a large colander and toss well with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Place the colander over a large bowl and allow the cucumbers to sit and begin to drain for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the sour cream, white balsamic vinegar, olive oil, mint, chives and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Using your hands or a rubber spatula, squeeze or press out the excess water from the cucumbers. It is best to work in small batches to extract as much water as possible. Add the squeezed cucumbers to the sour cream dressing. Using a rubber spatula, toss the cucumber in the dressing until well coated, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68716,&quot;Potato Gratin with Spring Onions 2 1/2 cups heavy cream 3 sprigs thyme 2 bay leaves 1 clove garlic, grated 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 bunch spring onions (whites finely chopped, greens thinly sliced) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 pounds large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced (preferably on a mandoline) 2 cups shredded havarti cheese (about 8 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the heavy cream, thyme, bay leaves, garlic and nutmeg in a medium saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Add the spring onion whites and simmer until just starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Stir in about half of the spring onion greens. Spread the potatoes in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Pour the cream mixture over the top and gently stir, pressing and submerging the potatoes to make an even layer.

Remove the meat from the bone (or have your butcher do it for you, reserving the bone). Season well with salt and pepper. Squeeze over the juice of the lemon to prevent fat flare-ups. Tie the bones to the meat with butcher&#39;s twine. Place 2 to 3 cabbage leaves on the meat side of the roast. Tie the leaves on the roast with butcher&#39;s twine in several places to secure the leaves and prevent the meat from burning. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill, arranging the coals for indirect cooking. Lightly spray the grill rack with vegetable oil spray. The coals should be moderately hot to hot. Sear the meat over intense heat on the bone side and the narrow sides for 1 or 2 minutes per side. Sear the meaty side (top) for about 3 minutes. When turning the meat, use tongs or other utensils to avoid piercing the meat more than necessary to keep as much moisture inside the roast as you can. Transfer the roast, bone-side down, to the cooler part of the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 25 minutes, then baste and turn the roast, cooking for another 15 minutes. Remove the cabbage leaves after about 40 to 45 minutes. Continue grilling, turning and basting occasionally with beer, for a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes for rare. After 1 hour, begin checking the meat by inserting and instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, taking care not to insert the thermometer too close to a bone. When the thermometer registers 135 to 140 degrees F, remove the meat from the grill, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before carving. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until bubbling and hot, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the wine, salt, pepper, garlic, butter, parsley, mushrooms and demi-glace. Cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are tender and the sauce is thick and reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. Yield: about 1 1/2 cups &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 68718,&quot;Tortilla Espanola: Spanish Omelette 3 large eggs Salt, to taste 3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil 3 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped Green olives, for garnish Instructions: Crack the eggs into a bowl. Whisk with a fork and add a pinch of salt. Heat some oil in a frying pan (not one with a heavy base as this will prove to be a hindrance when preparing to do the flip). Add the potato and fry for a couple of minutes. Add the onion and mash together. When the potato starts to brown a little on the edges and is mashed up with the onion in a lumpy fashion then add the eggs. Make sure the potato and onions are fully submerged by the eggs. Poke the potato to allow some of the egg to seep into the mashed mixture. Fry this gently on a low heat. While cooking shake the pan to loosen the tortilla from the base and tidy the edges up with a wooden spoon. Do not over cook. The middle is meant to remain runny and gooey. The egg will start setting, as this happens place a plate over the pan, a large enough plate to cover the pan substantially, and with a quick co-ordinated movement of both wrists ?flip? the tortilla over onto the plate and slide back into the pan to cook the underside. Keep shaking the pan lightly so the tortilla does not stick to the bottom. Once it feels firm on the edges and soft in the middle (after about 1 minute) then slide the tortilla back onto the plate. For the brave heart you can do the flip again if you wish. Let the tortilla rest for about 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Cut into cake slices or cubes.

Add the tomatillos and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the tomatillos begin to break down and release some liquid, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer the tomatillo sauce to your blender, puree, and set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, season them with some salt and pepper and the remaining chopped garlic. Cook until the garlic becomes fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring often. Add the tomatillo sauce and simmer until the shrimp are curled and opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve sprinkled with the cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 68730,&quot;German Egg Noodles: Spaetzle 1 pound flour 7 eggs 1 teaspoon salt Water, as needed Instructions: Combine flour, eggs, and salt. Add enough water to make a batter the consistency of light cookie dough. Beat well until some air bubbles develop. Let the batter rest. Prepare a large pot with salted water. Bring to a boil. Scrape thin rolls of batter from a chopping board or run the batter through a sieve or spaetzle maker into the boiling water. Remove cooked spaetzle from the boiling water with a strainer and serve immediately or place in warm water if you are using the noodles soon but not immediately, or place noodles in cold water if you will be refrigerating or freezing. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris, Sparkling wine]&quot; 68731,&quot;Chicken en Papilotte - Many Ways 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, tenderloins removed 3 tablespoons green or black olive paste 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 3 (12 ounces) new potatoes, washed 2 ripe tomatoes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 small tomatoes, washed and cored and sliced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Rub the olive paste on both sides of each chicken breast half. Cut the potatoes into 1/16th-inch slices and thinly slice the tomatoes. Set 4 12-inch squares of foil on the counter. Lightly oil the center of each piece of foil and spread some potato slices in the middle; season them with salt and pepper. Cover the potatoes with a chicken breast half, then cover with more potato slices, salt and pepper and the tomato slices. Wrap the chicken airtight, in a deli sandwich wrap, and set the packages on a baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes. When the chicken is done unwrap the packages carefully (be careful the steam which will escape when you open the packages does not burn your hands.) Transfer the chicken, potatoes, tomatoes and the natural juices to deep plates. Variations: Instead of the potatoes spread 1/2 cup drained canned white beans, a couple of slivers of fresh garlic, a leaf or two of fresh sage and a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil underneath the chicken. Top the chicken with the tomatoes. Or spread each chicken breast half with 1 teaspoon each of oriental sesame oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar. Top each chicken breast half with 1/2 cup sliced jicama; 1 cup raw fresh spinach and 1 sliced scallion. Open and garnish with sesame seeds. Or, instead of the green olive paste and tomatoes, season each chicken breast half with barbecue sauce or ketchup and top with 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels; leave the potatoes in (especially good for kids) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68732,&quot;Rarebit Sauce 16 ounces proper beer or any brand English golden ale 24 ounces whole milk<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes<br> 1/4 cup bacon fat<br> 1 medium yellow onion, small diced<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard<br> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons thyme leaves, roughly chopped<br> 1 cup grated Irish Cheddar<br> 1 1/2 cups crumbled blue cheese<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: In a large sauce pot, bring the beer and milk to a simmer (180 degrees F). While you are bringing the milk and beer to a simmer, in a separate sauce pot, melt the butter and bacon fat. Once melted, add the onions and sweat until translucent. Add the flour to make the roux, making sure you stir continually so it gets nice and toasty, but doesn&#39;t burn to the bottom of the pot. De-glaze the pan with the mustard, Worcestershire sauce, white wine vinegar and thyme. By this time, the milk and beer should be ready to add to the roux. Add slowly, continually stirring to break up chunks and emulsify the mixture. Bring the mixture up to 185 degrees F and remove from the heat. Add the Irish Cheddar, blue cheese and salt and blend with an immersion blender (if you don&#39;t have an immersion blender, add the cheese while the mixture is still hot and whisk vigorously with a whisk to fully incorporate). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 68733,&quot;The Ultimate Cheese Course Soft goat cheese Aged goat cheese Teleme Camembert Gorgonzola Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 loaf walnut bread or other dark, dense bread Instructions: Lavender Honey drizzled over pungent Stilton or creamy Point Reyes Blue Cheese is surprisingly well-matched. The crumbly sweetness of biscotti with big cheeses and red wine is a wonderful flavor combination. Serve candied almonds or other candied nuts for an accompaniment with a sweet, salty crunch. The most elegant thing you can serve with a cheese course is a bowl full of warm pistachios...to occupy hand and mouth while you&#39;re sitting around the table talking with friends and finishing that great bottle of red wine. If serving Parmigiano-Reggiano, drizzle with a couple of drops of aged balsamic vinegar to enhance the flavor. Set out and arrange cheeses 1 hour before serving, cheeses are best consumed at room temperature. Serve cheeses on a round tray or wheel, arranging clockwise from 6:00 from the sweetest to the strongest cheeses. Serve sweeter accompaniments, such as figs with the stronger cheeses to get some agre dolce flavor. Serve stronger cheeses with lemon and orange wedges to enhance the flavors. As a general rule, the cheeses you choose should follow the flavors and intensity of the wine. If you are drinking a big, intense wine, choose a big, intense cheese. For example, if you&#39;ve chosen Petit Sirah (usually big, deep--colored and full bodied), choose a Gorgonzola, the creamy, classic Italian cow&#39;s milk blue cheese that comes in Mountain (aged) and Dolce (sweet) varieties. If you are serving a Sauvignon Blanc (which tends to be crisp and light - medium bodied), pair it with goat cheese, light and delightfully tart--even tangy. Also, the more acidic your wine is, the higher the fat content of the cheese needs to be (generally). A young, fresh goat cheese, goes well with Robert Mondavi Winery Fume Blanc Reserve or the Luna Pinot Grigio. Or try, St. Paulin (also known as Port Salut), good company for fruit and light wine. Buy a well-aged Brie, Camembert or Cambozola for Chardonnay. This wine has the acid to take the creamier, \fatty\ cheeses. For Reggiano and Blue cheeses try my Old Vine Petit Sirah Zinfandel. Of course, contrasting flavors can also guide you toward great cheese course combinations, so from time to time I like to serve a crisp, fruity sparkling wine with Reggiano! What contrast for the mouth! With numerous varieties to choose from, cheese&#39;s companionship with both sweet and savory ingredients can make serving the ultimate cheese course a creative and colorful celebration every time. Have fun and experiment with your favorite flavors! Next to buying good cheese, the single most important element of serving a great cheese course is the temperature of the cheese when you serve it--room temperature! Set the cheese out at least 3 hours before serving time. It really is true that $5 cheese will taste like $20 cheese at the right temperature and $20 cheese will taste like $5 cheese at the wrong temperature. When you offer it to your guests, your Brie should be weeping, your Blue stinking and your Reggiano glistening with a whisper of its oil. With cheese and wine, I like to add sweetness and texture and present them together on a memorable serving platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 68734,&quot;Vanilla Snack Cakes Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 3 large eggs, at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup sour cream 1 cup whole milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature One 7-ounce jar marshmallow creme 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 cups powdered sugar 1 to 2 teaspoons milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a heavy-duty stand mixer at high speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating just until the yellow disappears. Beat in the vanilla and sour cream until smooth. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Beat the butter and cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add the marshmallow creme and salt and beat until combined. Add the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating until fluffy. Add 1 teaspoon of milk and the vanilla. (The filling should be pipeable, so if it\u2019s too stiff, add a little more milk.) Spoon the filling into a piping bag fitted with a round pastry tip. Turn out the cake onto a clean work surface. Trim the edges and cut into sixteen 1 1/2-by-3-inch-long rectangles. Insert a skewer to create a tunnel throughout the cake and pipe enough filling to reach both sides. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 68735,&quot;Pearsnip Sauce 1 pound parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 pound pears, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch pieces 3 tablespoons maple syrup 1 teaspoon orange zest 1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom Pinch kosher salt Pinch freshly ground clove 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Instructions: Place the parsnips, pears, maple syrup, orange zest, orange juice, cardamom, salt, and clove into a microwave safe, sealable 3 to 4 quart container.

Place butter and shortening in freezer for at least 1 hour before mixing. Pulse flour, salt and cayenne pepper in food processor. Remove the lid and tuck the butter and shortening into the mixture. Pulse the machine 4 times to cut into the butter. Add 1 1/3 cups of cheese and pulse 4 more times. Sprinkle half of the water over the flour mixture and pulse 5 or 6 times. Add the rest of the water and pulse 5 or 6 more times, until the pastry looks like very coarse crumbs. Move mixture to a chilled bowl and work until dough is formed. Round into 2 balls, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap each dough ball in 2 layers of plastic wrap and press them into disks. Chill at least 3 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F To make the filling. Peel and slice the apples. In a bowl, mix the apples, lemon juice, dark brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, vanilla, salt, and nutmeg with your hands. Set aside and retrieve the pie crusts from the refrigerator. To finish: Roll the dough into 2 circles that are 2 to 3 inches wider in diameter than your pie shell or plate. Press the bottom crust into the pie plate and mound apples until they fill the crust and dome slightly. Scatter the butter over the mound. Cut a center vent the size of a dime into the top crust. Sprinkle the remaining cup of shredded cheese onto the crust. With a rolling pin, roll lightly to press the cheese into the dough. Roll the crust onto the rolling pin so that the rolling pin resembles the sausage in a pig-in-a-blanket. Unroll the crust, cheese-side down, on top of the apples. Bake at 400 degrees F, for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and bake for 40 to 50 minutes longer.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Melt the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Continue to cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter browns lightly and smells slightly nutty, about 15 minutes. Transfer the butter to a medium bowl -- be sure to get all the tasty brown bits -- and cool slightly. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in another medium bowl. Whisk the egg yolk, sugar and vanilla into the cooled browned butter. Stir the dry ingredients into the butter mixture to make a uniform but crumbly dough that looks like wet sand. Scoop out dough with a small teaspoon (the kind you set the table with, not the ones you measure with). Rock spoon gently back and forth against the side of the bowl, packing the dough into the spoon, then scrape/slide the spoon against the inside of the bowl to make spoon-shaped cookies. Trim excess dough with your fingers and slide out onto the prepared pans, preserving their shape. (Try to make sure you form an even number of cookies, since these sandwich together.) Bake cookies until just browned, about 12 to 15 minutes. Cool almost completely on the baking sheets, and then transfer cookies to a rack to cool. When cool, spread 1/2 teaspoon jam on the flat side of a cookie, and then sandwich together with a second cookie. Repeat until all cookies have met their match. Lightly dust the cookies with the confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve. Busy baker&#39;s tips: The dough can be prepared several hours ahead and stored at room temperature. Freeze baked cookie halves wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, followed by aluminum foil for up to 2 weeks. When ready to serve, defrost at room temperature and assemble as desired. Store sandwiches in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Do not store with crisp cookies, as moisture from the jam will soften the texture of other crisp cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68749,&quot;Healthy Shrimp Scampi 6 ounces multi-grain spaghetti 1/4 cup multi-grain croutons, crushed 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 1/2 tablespoons grated lemon zest 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 shallot, thinly sliced 1 garlic clove, minced 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper 3/4 pound large shrimp, shelled and deveined (about 16 large shrimp, 21 to 25 count) 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 dry white wine 1 tablespoon lemon juice 6 black pitted and chopped olives such as Kalamata (about 1 tablespoon) Instructions: Cook the spaghetti according to package directions.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Process the crackers, peanuts, bittersweet chocolate chips, and butter in a food processor. Once it comes together in a clump, turn it into a springform pan and press into the bottom and up the sides to make the crunchy crust. Put it in the refrigerator while you make the filling. Add all the filling ingredients to a food processor and pulse until it becomes a smooth mixture. Pour and scrape the filling into the crust and bake for 1 hour, checking after 45 minutes. The top, only, should feel set and dry. Take the cheesecakes out of the oven and set aside while you make the topping. Warm the sour cream and milk chocolate with the brown sugar in a small saucepan over a low heat. Gently whisk to blend in the chocolate as it melts, then take the pan off the heat. Spoon and spread the topping very gently over the top of the cheesecake, being as careful as you so as not to break the surface. (Not that anything bad will happen; you&#39;ll just have chocolate marbling the cake a bit.) Put it back in the oven for a final 10 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and cool. Slice and serve. Make Ahead: Make the cheesecake up to 2 days ahead. Cool and chill as directed. Do not cover until completely cold, then cover with a plate or plastic wrap, making sure that the covering does not touch the surface. Unmold and serve as directed in the recipe. This will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days total. Freeze Note: The cheesecake can be frozen for 1 month. Make sure it is thoroughly chilled then wrap, still in its pan, in a double layer of plastic wrap and layer of aluminum foil. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and eat within 2 days. A small amount of condensation may appear on surface of the cheesecake after thawing, but it is still fine to eat. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 68753,&quot;Hot Sweet Mustard 1 cup spicy Dijon mustard 1/4 cup honey Sea salt, preferably gray salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Mix and use with pickle relish and pass more on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 68754,&quot;Creamy Lobster Bisque 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 6 cloves garlic, smashed 3 carrots, roughly chopped 2 ribs celery, roughly chopped 2 red onions, roughly chopped 1/2 teaspoon sea salt Freshly cracked pepper 1 ounce brandy 1 cup good white wine 6 cups organic vegetable stock 1/3 cup tomato paste 1/2 teaspoon fresh peppercorns 3 cooked lobster carcasses, chopped 2 bay leaves 1 handful fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley sprigs 1 sprig fresh thyme 1 stick unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon saffron 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 cooked lobsters, meat only Instructions: 1 bunch fresh chives, for garnish For the lobster broth: Heat a large soup pot on medium and add the butter, olive oil, garlic, carrots, celery and onions.

Whisk together the flour, graham cracker crumbs, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat together 1/4 cup of vegetable oil with the sugar, egg and vanilla in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl about halfway through. Add about a third of the dry ingredients into the sugar and oil mixture and stir gently until almost combined. Add in half of the buttermilk and continue to stir just until combined. Stir in another third of the dry ingredients followed by the remaining buttermilk and finally the remaining dry ingredients. Stir in the boiling water. Whisk together the cocoa powder with the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a medium bowl. Scoop about 1 cup of the graham cracker cake batter into the cocoa mixture. Whisk to combine and set aside. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the graham cracker cake batter into each cupcake liner followed by 2 tablespoons of the chocolate batter. Using a butter knife or skewer, swirl the batters together to achieve a marbled effect. Bake the cupcakes for 20 to 25 minutes, or until set and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Cool to room temperature. For the marshmallow topping: Whisk together the egg whites, sugar and salt in a large metal or glass bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer and place it over a saucepan containing about 2 centimeters (1 inch) of simmering water. Cook the egg whites, whisking frequently, until they reach 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), or until the mixture thins and you can no longer feel any sugar granules when you rub some between your fingers, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and whip the cooked meringue using a whisk attachment or hand mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 4 to 5 minutes. Whip in the vanilla extract then transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip or a large resealable bag with the corner cut off. Pipe large dollops of the topping onto each cupcake. Using a kitchen torch, toast the marshmallow meringue until golden brown. If you do not have a torch, you can place the cupcakes under the broiler for a minute or two until toasty. If desired, garnish with a piece of milk chocolate. Store the cupcakes in the fridge for up to 3 days, letting them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to soften up before eating. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68773,&quot;Biscuit Sticky Buns Butter, for greasing 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<br> 1 1/2 cups cold buttermilk or 6 tablespoons buttermilk powder 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup granulated pure cane sugar<br> 3 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 cup finely chopped toasted pecans, plus more for topping<br> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/4 cups packed light brown muscovado sugar<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> Pinch fine sea salt<br> Instructions: For the dough: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly butter the sides and bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Using a dough cutter, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and buttermilk powder if using, in a large bowl. Cut in the butter using your fingers or a dough cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the buttermilk or 1 1/2 cups cold water if using buttermilk powder, and gently mix until the mixture just begins to come together. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 16-by-12-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Position the dough so the short side is facing you. For the filling: Brush the surface of the dough with the softened butter. Combine the sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread the mixture evenly over the butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Spread the chopped pecans over the sugar mixture. Fold 1/4-inch of the short side in. Roll the dough up tightly into a log starting on the shorter side. Using your hands to apply pressure, roll the log back and forth a few times to seal the dough. Slice 1/4-inch of dough off each side to even the ends, then cut the log into 8 equal pieces. For the topping: Combine the butter and 1/4 cup water in a medium nonstick saucepan over high heat and cook until the butter is melted. Whisk in the brown sugar and cook until smooth and bubbly. Reduce the heat to low, whisk in the heavy cream and cook for 1 minute. Add the salt, then remove from the heat and keep warm. Pour the warm topping into the prepared baking dish. Scatter some additional chopped pecans evenly over the surface. Place the buns in the baking dish, cut-side down. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a baking rack for 5 minutes. Carefully invert onto a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68774,&quot;Tom Collins with Black Pepper and Cherries 1 cup pitted cherries 1 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, plus more for serving<br> 8 ounces gin<br> 4 ounces lemon juice<br> Bitters and chilled club soda, for serving<br> Instructions: Add the cherries, sugar, peppercorns and 1 cup water to a small saucepan.

Pierce the potatoes a few times with a fork, then place directly on the center rack in the oven. Bake until tender, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 or 4 turns pepper; saute until the leeks are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and thyme and saute until lightly browned, another 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Halve the baked potatoes lengthwise and scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Set aside to cool. Reserve the potato innards for another use. Fill a deep, heavy pot with 3 inches of canola oil; heat to 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, fry the potato skins in the oil until crispy and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Arrange the fried potato skins, scooped-side up, on a baking sheet. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 3 or 4 turns pepper. Fill the skins with the mushroom-leek filling and top with the Brie and prosciutto. Transfer to the oven and bake until the brie is melted and the prosciutto crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Garnish with the chives and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 68793,&quot;French Toast \Jubliee<br> 1 cup drained jarred high-quality maraschino cherries, such as Luxardo 2 strips lemon peel (using a peeler) plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 1 cup rum<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons maple syrup<br> 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom<br> 3 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks<br> Two 1 1/2-inch-thick challah bread slices 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 lemons, zested<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: For the jubilee sauce: Combine the cherries and lemon strips and juice in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook until the mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, add the rum and return it to the heat to burn off the alcohol, about 5 minutes. Just before serving, swirl in the butter and maple syrup. For the French toast: Add the cream, honey, almond extract, cardamom and eggs and yolks to a blender and blend until combined. Transfer to a shallow container and soak the bread in the custard mixture. Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat until frothing. Drain off the excess custard from the bread, add the slices to the pan and cook on both sides until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes a side. Serve by placing the French toast on a platter along with the cherry jubilee sauce. Finish with the lemon zest and a dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Moscato, Riesling, Cava]&quot; 68794,&quot;Goat&#39;s Milk Creme Caramels Nonstick cooking spray 1/3 cup granulated sugar 2 cups goat&#39;s milk 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon superfine sugar 3 egg yolks, beaten 2 whole eggs, beaten 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Cook&#39;s Note: Goat&#39;s milk can be found at your local health food store or online. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease four 6-ounce ramekins with nonstick cooking spray. Set a small saucepan over high heat and add the granulated sugar to make caramel. Without stirring, let the sugar melt. As it melts, gently swirl the pan around to melt all the sugar evenly. When it turns dark amber, carefully divide evenly among the ramekins (take care as the caramel is extremely hot). Combine the milk and superfine sugar in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the egg yolks, whole eggs and vanilla to a large mixing bowl. Whisk together until foamy, then add a little of the hot milk to temper the eggs. Stir to combine, then gradually add the rest of the milk (adding it all at once, or too much, will cook and scramble the eggs). Once completely incorporated, stir well and then divide evenly among the four ramekins. Line a turkey roaster with a kitchen towel and carefully place the ramekins on top. Place the roasting dish in the oven, then fill with hot water so it comes 3/4 of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the custards are set, 35 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the oven and allow to cool. Chill in the fridge before inverting onto a plate to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 68795,&quot;Carrot Salad 6 medium carrots (about 1 pound), shredded on a box grater or mandolin 1/3 cup golden raisins 1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 teaspoons honey 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional) Instructions: Put the carrots in a large bowl, and cover with cold water.

Set each quarter on a flat side and slice thinly crosswise with a sharp chef&#39;s knife. To every 2 pounds 3 ounces of sliced cabbage, add 1 1/2 tablespoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons caraway in a 2-gallon glass or ceramic crock, then smash and stir with a wooden meat tenderizer (the goal is to break cell walls so that water will come out) and tamp down to get air out. Continue until all cabbage is chopped, seasoned and gently smashed. Mixture will produce its own brine from salting and smashing. Brine should completely cover cabbage by about 1/2 inch; if not, add necessary amount of brine made of 1/3 cup salt to 1 gallon water. Place a plate down inside crock on top of cabbage; weigh down with a clear plastic bag or two filled with brine. Put a breathable cloth on top that is big enough to cover the surface of the crock and tie gently with twine, tight enough to hold the cloth in place but loose enough to be slipped on and off. Check kraut daily, skimming any white mold from the top and making sure brine is high enough, adding more brine if necessary. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) After 1 week, begin tasting kraut for doneness. If more salt is needed, dissolve some in water and add to kraut. Kraut should be ready after about 2 to 4 weeks, depending on temperature. When the kraut is ready, transfer kraut to containers, then pour or ladle brine over kraut to cover. Put lids on containers and store in the fridge. (Once the sauerkraut is stored in the fridge fermentation and flavor development will stop.) &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 68798,&quot;Sawmill Gravy 1 pound bulk breakfast sausage 1/4 cup flour 2 cups milk Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Cook sausage in a cast iron skillet.

For the fish: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat and brush with oil so the fish doesn&#39;t stick. Brush the fish on both sides with dipping sauce and grill for 20 to 25 minutes, flipping and brushing with sauce every 5 minutes. When done, the fish should be crispy and nicely charred and the flesh cooked through. The best way check for doneness is to insert the tip of a knife or a cake tester into the flesh, then pull it out and hold it to your wrist; it should feel warm. When it does, you&#39;re ready! Mix the grated daikon and shiso in a small bowl. Serve the fish with the dipping sauce and daikon mixture on the side.

In a large pot, heat the canola oil over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke slightly, season both sides of the brisket with salt and pepper, to taste. Use metal tongs to add the meat to the pot. If the oil is hot enough, the meat will not stick to the bottom. Cook, undisturbed, on its first side until browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Turn over and brown on the other side, about 3 to 5 additional minutes. Remove the meat from the pot and put it onto a baking sheet to rest. Combine the garlic paste and green onions in a small bowl. Spread half of the mixture over the brisket. Flip the meat and add the remaining mixture to the other side. Set aside. In the same pot, over low heat and add the parsnips. Season them with a little salt and a scant 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Stir to coat with the oil and cook until slightly tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add in 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar and the leeks and gently brown them, about 3 to 5 minutes. Adjust the seasonings with salt. Pour in the wine and let it reduce for 5 minutes. Sprinkle the vegetables with the remaining 1/4 cup of brown sugar and another pinch of salt. Cook them until browned, another 3 to 5 minutes. Add the brisket to the pot and stir in 2 to 3 cups of the beef stock. Bring the stock to a gentle simmer. Slide it into the center of the oven and cook for 1 hour.

Add the chestnuts and cook until they are cooked through and tender, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Heat a heavy bottom saute pan over medium heat and season the duck on both sides with salt and pepper. Saute the duck breasts slowly skin-side down, draining the fat that accumulates in the pan into a bowl. Reserve the fat. When the fat has rendered off the duck breasts and the skin is golden brown and crispy, ladle the fat over the tops of the breasts to cook the other side for 2 or 3 minutes, for medium-rare meat. Remove from heat and keep warm. Drain all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan and increase the heat to high. Add the Brussels sprouts and vinegar and cook until they are golden brown and tender. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. To serve, pile some Brussels sprouts in the center of a plate. Slice the duck breasts into 5 pieces and lay on top of the greens.

Combine the coriander seeds, fennel seeds, peppercorns, green cardamom pods, cloves, black cardamom pod and cinnamon stick in a small skillet. Toast, stirring, over low heat until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Grind in a spice grinder to a fine powder and set aside. Heat 4 inches of mustard oil in a Dutch oven to 325 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Meanwhile, pierce the potatoes all over with a fork or sharp knife then pat them dry thoroughly. Working in two batches, add the potatoes to the hot oil and deep-fry until 70 percent cooked (tender on the outside but only partially cooked inside). Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool. Meanwhile, combine the Kashmiri red chili powder with 1 cup water in a small bowl. Combine the oat milk and saffron in another small bowl. Set both bowls aside for 15 minutes. Combine the yogurt and ground ginger in a medium bowl. Mix well and set aside. Heat the 2 tablespoons mustard oil in a deep cast-iron pot over medium heat until smoking. Add the caraway seeds, reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the turmeric, hing and spice mix and stir well. Slowly stir in the Kashmiri chili water and lemon juice and cook until combined, 30 seconds. Lower the heat, gently add the yogurt mixture and whisk slowly and continuously. Add the potatoes, season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are completely cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover and bake for 20 minutes. Top the potato mixture with the par-cooked rice in a single thin layer. Pour the saffron mixture on top. Cover and cook over low heat, steaming the rice until fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Garnish with the fried onions and mint leaves. Wash the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak in cold water in a large clear bowl for 20 minutes, then drain. Meanwhile, add the oil to a Dutch oven and heat over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes; add the green cardamom pods, cloves, star anise, bay leaf, cinnamon and caraway seeds and cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Bring 8 cups water to a rolling boil in a large pot over high heat and add the salt. Add the rice, stir and cook until some of the rice starts floating to the top, 8 to 10 minutes.

Lay out the bread slices. Divide the ham among them, making sure it doesn&#39;t extend over the edges of the bread. Place the cheese over the ham. If the cheese is larger than the bread, bend it over to fit. Heat 2 large ovenproof nonstick pans or griddles over medium heat. (If you have only 1 large pan, make 2 sandwiches and keep them warm in the oven while you make the second batch.) Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to each pan. When it has melted, add half the bread, cheese-side up to each pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden brown. Transfer the pans to the oven for 2 to 3 minutes to melt the cheese. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in a large ovenproof skillet and fry the eggs. Cook the eggs until the bottoms are set, then place the skillet in the oven for a minute to set the top of the whites. (We cook the eggs in 4 to 5-inch individual skillets.) When the cheese is melted, remove the sandwiches from the oven. Place 2 slices together to make each sandwich and put each sandwich on a serving plate. Place an egg on top of each sandwich. Pour about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the white of each egg, leaving the yolk uncovered. Grind black pepper over each egg and garnish the eggs with a diagonal sprinkling of chopped parsley. Serve with frites, if desired. Combine the water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand for 10 minutes, then stir until the yeast is completely dissolved. Set aside. Sift together the flours, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the eggs and beat for 1 minute at low speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Slowly add the dissolved yeast and continue beating at low speed for 5 minutes. Stop the machine, scrape any dough off the hook, and beat for another 5 minutes. Add about one-quarter of the butter cubes at a time, beating for about 1 minute after each addition. Once all the butter has been added, beat for 10 minutes more. Place the dough in a large floured bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, about 3 hours. Turn the dough out onto a generously floured work surface and gently work the air bubbles out by folding the dough over several times while lightly pressing down on it. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. The dough is now ready to shape or use in another recipe. Generously butter two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch loaf pans. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. With floured hands, divide the dough in half and shape it into two rectangles that fit in the loaf pans. Place the dough in the pans. Let the dough rise uncovered in a warm place until it is about 1/2-inch above the top of the pans, about 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the brioche in the center of the oven until it is well browned on top and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the brioche from the oven and immediately turn out onto a wire rack. If serving immediately, let the breads cool for 10 minutes, then slice. If serving within a few hours, wrap the hot bread in aluminum foil and set aside at room temperature until ready to use. To freeze, wrap the hot bread in foil and promptly freeze. The bread can be kept frozen for up to 1 month; when ready to use, reheat (without thawing and still wrapped in the foil) in a 250 degree F oven until heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. If using the brioche for croutons, let sit at room temperature uncovered to dry for a day. Melt the butter in a medium heavy saucepan set on a diffuser over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Sprinkle in the flour and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly so that the roux doesn&#39;t burn or color. Whisking constantly, add the milk and cream and whisk until fully incorporated. Bring to a simmer, whisking, then add the bay leaf, peppercorns, and cloves. Move the pan to 1 side of the diffuser, away from direct heat to avoid scorching, and bring back to a gentle simmer. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, reaching into the corners of the pan, for about 30 minutes. (If the sauce does begin to scorch, pour it into a clean pan--don&#39;t scrape the bottom of the pan--and continue.) Remove the sauce from the heat and season to taste with salt, a grating of nutmeg, and a pinch of white pepper. Strain the sauce, add the cheese, and whisk to melt. Use immediately, or place in a storage container, press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface to keep a skin from forming, and refrigerate for up to a week. If the sauce is too thick after refrigeration, it can be thinned with a little heavy cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68853,&quot;Blackberry Cornbread Cake 2 tablespoons butter 2 cups whole-fat buttermilk<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 3/4 cup yellow cornmeal<br> 3/4 cup maple sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt<br> One 6-ounce container blackberries, plus more for garnish<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> Maple syrup and whipped cream, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Let stand 30 minutes or up to 1 day; drain. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Fill a medium pot with water and add the tomatoes, onion and garlic. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat; let cool. Drain the ingredients, then transfer to a blender and puree until smooth; season with salt. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan; add the tomato mixture and cook until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Prepare the jalapenos: Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Fry the jalapenos until blistered, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, then place in a bowl and tightly cover with plastic wrap. Let steam about 15 minutes, then peel off the blistered skins using a paring knife or rub with a kitchen towel. Using a sharp small knife, cut a T in each jalapeno, starting at the top of the pepper and running almost to the bottom. Using a very small spoon or the tip of the knife, carefully remove the seeds and veins. Set the peppers aside. Make the filling: Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a medium skillet. Add the potato and cook, stirring, until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon. Add the carrot, onion and garlic to the skillet; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 5 minutes. Add the beef and cook, breaking up the meat, until it starts browning, about 5 minutes.

Add a pinch of grey salt, sherry vinegar, and olive oil. Whisk mixture together thoroughly.<br> In a large bowl, toss the greens with enough of the dressing to coat them lightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Set aside.<br> For eggs, make sure that upon starting they are room temperature. Bring the water to a boil in a deep saucepan. Add the wine vinegar and salt. Adjust the heat so the water barely bubbles. One at a time, break the eggs into a custard cups or small bowl, then slide gently into the water. Allow eggs to cook for about 1 1/2 minutes, then, with a slotted spoon, gently lift and shape the whites around the yolks. Continue to cook until the whites are just set and the yolks are glazed but still liquid about 2 1/2 minutes longer. Transfer the poached eggs with a slotted spoon to a clean dish towel or paper towels to drain.<br> Place poached eggs on top of coated greens in large bowl, add a pinch of salt, to taste, and top with about 3 tablespoons or more of the prosciutto bits.<br> Note: Eggs poach best when the water is relatively deep, so use a deep saucepan. Adding vinegar to the water helps to set the whites. TIP: The best way to make these bits is with the shanks of prosciutto. Ask your local butcher to save those shanks, and grind them on the medium grind if you want to save some chopping, or dice it finely yourself. Shank should cost about half of sliced prosciutto, as the store probably has no use for it.<br> Note: Whether you are chopping the prosciutto by hand or putting it through a meat grinder, you&#39;ll have an easier time if the prosciutto is partially frozen.<br> Place prosciutto in heated pan. Drizzle bits with olive oil, and cook, stirring. The prosciutto will give off steam for about 5 minutes while it releases its moisture. When the hiss of steam turns to a sizzle, turn the heat down to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the prosciutto bits are crisp, about 30 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bits to several thicknesses of paper towel to drain. The bits will crisp even more as they cool. Use immediately or freeze the bits for up to 6 months and warm in a skillet as needed.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 68867,&quot;Wilted Bok Choy with Soy Sauce and Cashews 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 bunch bok choy, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices 1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes Salt and ground black pepper 1/2 cup cashews Instructions: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add bok choy and saute 3 minutes. Add soy sauce and red pepper flakes and cook 2 more minutes, until bok choy stalks are tender-crisp and leaves are wilted. Season, to taste, with salt and black pepper.

Add the ground meat, a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring and breaking up the meat into smaller pieces, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste, oregano, red pepper flakes and garlic and cook, stirring, until the tomato paste darkens to a brick red, about 1 minute. Add the tomato puree, 3/4 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bring to a high simmer, then adjust to a low simmer. Cover the pan and cook for 30 minutes. (You can make and cool the sauce the day before. Reheat before using the next day.) For the pasta: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Grease a 9-inch springform pan with 1 tablespoon oil. Cook the pasta until slightly less than al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and toss with the remaining tablespoon oil, then spread out in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Spread 1/4 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared pan. Stand the rigatoni on their ends in the pan until it is completely filled. For the ricotta filling: Stir together the ricotta, Parmesan, egg, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag or resealable plastic bag, snip off just enough of the tip to make a small opening and pipe into each rigatoni tube. Pipe small mounds of any leftover ricotta mixture on top of the pasta and spread out into a thin layer. (You can cook and fill the pasta the day before.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the filled springform pan on a foil-lined baking sheet to catch drips. Pour 2 cups of the meat sauce over the pasta, spreading it with the back of a spoon so that it drips in between the noodles. Top with the mozzarella and Parmesan. Cover the pan with foil, doming it slightly to avoid touching the cheese. Bake for 20 minutes. Uncover the pan and continue cooking until the top is golden brown and bubbly, about 30 minutes more. Let the pasta cool for 45 minutes (do not skip this part or your noodles will fall apart when serving!). Sprinkle with parsley, if using, then carefully remove the sides of the pan. Cut the pie into wedges and serve with the reserved meat sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 68881,&quot;Corned Beef and Cabbage Quiche 1 tablespoon salted butter 2 cups finely sliced green cabbage<br> 1 tablespoon caraway seeds 1 pie crust, homemade or store-bought, recipe follows All-purpose flour, for rolling 8 ounces corned beef, cut into small pieces<br> 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 8 large eggs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup vegetable shortening<br> 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) salted butter<br> 1 large egg<br> 5 tablespoons cold water<br> 1 tablespoon white vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Add the butter to a saute pan over medium heat, add the cabbage and caraway seeds and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Roll out the pie crust on a floured surface and press into a deep fluted tart pan with a removable bottom (or a deep-dish pie pan). Lay the cabbage in the crust, followed by the corned beef. Whip the half-and-half, mustard, eggs and some salt and pepper in a large bowl, then pour it into the crust. Place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet, cover lightly with aluminum foil and bake for 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the quiche is set and the crust is golden brown, another 10 to 15 minutes. (The quiche will still seem slightly loose, but will continue to set once removed from the oven.) Let the quiche sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then, if using a tart pan, remove the quiche from the pan. Cut into slices with a sharp serrated knife and serve. Put the flour in a large bowl. With a pastry cutter, gradually work the shortening and butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal, 3 or 4 minutes. In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork and pour it into the flour mixture. Add the cold water, white vinegar and salt. Stir gently to combine. Form the dough into 2 evenly sized balls and place each ball into a gallon food storage bag. Using a rolling pin, slightly flatten each ball of dough (to about 1/2 inch thick) to make rolling easier later. Seal the bags and place them in the freezer until you need them. (If you will be using them immediately, it&#39;s still a good idea to put them in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to chill.) When you are ready to use the dough to make a crust, remove from the freezer and allow to thaw for 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68882,&quot;Scalloped Potatoes 1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups 2-percent or whole milk, plus more if needed 1/2 cup heavy cream, plus more if needed 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 clove garlic, finely chopped Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 cup grated gruyere cheese (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper to protect the baking sheet from spills and make for easy cleanup.<br> Peel the potatoes and slice them on a mandoline into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Or, using a chef&#39;s knife, carefully slice the potatoes thinly and evenly.<br> Arrange the potatoes in a medium casserole dish in overlapping layers, seasoning with salt and pepper as you go. Place the dish on the prepared baking sheet. Combine the milk, heavy cream, thyme, garlic and nutmeg in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Pour over the potatoes. Sprinkle the cheese over the top.<br> Bake until the potatoes are tender and the top is bubbling around the edges and a deep golden brown, about 1 hour. (If it starts to brown too deeply, cover the top of the dish with aluminum foil.) Let cool 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 68883,&quot;Petit Fours Nonstick cooking spray, for the sheet pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt<br> 3.5 ounces almond paste, broken into small bits<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup honey<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 6 large eggs<br> 1 1/2 batches Royal Icing, recipe follows Violet and green gel food coloring (or your preferred colors), as needed 1/3 cup seedless blackberry jam<br> 1 cup white chocolate chips 4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/3 cup hot water, plus up to 1/4 cup more if needed 1/4 cup light corn syrup<br> 4 cups sifted confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons meringue powder<br> 5 to 6 tablespoons warm water<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Liberally spray an 18-by13-inch sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Stack the lined sheet pan inside a second sheet pan, to avoid extra browning when baking. In a mixing bowl, add the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk to combine. Set aside. In a food processor, pulse together the almond paste, granulated sugar and honey. Pulse until well combined. Open the food processor and scrape the sides and bottom with a metal spoon to check that the almond paste is completely incorporated. Add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing to combine after each addition. Add the eggs one by one, pulsing until each is completely incorporated. After the last addition, scrape down the bowl and then pulse until the batter is completely smooth and slightly fluffy. Pulse in the flour mixture until blended. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared sheet pan. Bake until the cake is golden brown and springs back when gently poked, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely. While the cakes are cooling, color the Royal Icing in the colors of your choosing and add each color to a pastry bag fitted with a #2 tip. Pipe tiny flowers on a piece of parchment by making small closed spirals in one color, then add leaves to either side in the other color. Set aside to set up and harden, about 1 hour. Remove the cake from the sheet pan and cut in half widthwise. Spread the jam on top of one half and top with the second half. Freeze for 10 minutes to set. Use a serrated knife to cut the cake into 1-inch squares. Place onto a parchment-covered sheet pan and freeze for at least 1 hour. For the coating icing: In the meantime, add the white chocolate chips to a heatproof bowl and set over a pot of simmering water (the bowl should sit above and not touch the water). Heat, stirring, until melted and smooth. Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a separate large bowl. Stir in the hot water and corn syrup until smooth. Stir in the melted chocolate. If the icing is too thick (it should be pourable), add more hot water 1 teaspoon at a time. Use while warm; you can reheat it in the microwave if necessary as you are working. Put the little cakes on a wire rack fitted inside a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Coat the cakes with the icing using a spoon and small offset spatula, or add icing to a pastry bag, snip the corner and use to coat each cake. Top each with a hardened royal icing decoration. Allow the icing to set up before transferring to a serving platter. In the bowl of an electric mixer fit with a paddle attachment, add the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder and beat to combine. Beat in 4 tablespoons of warm water to combine. Raise the paddle head to check the consistency of the icing; the icing should be thick and smooth but not dripping from the paddle. Add more water until the desired consistency is reached. (You can add slightly more water to achieve a flooding consistency icing to completely cover cookies. Use a stiffer consistency to pipe decorations and details.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68884,&quot;Lime Pie 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup lard, chilled 2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup ice water 3/4 cup fresh lime juice Drop of green food coloring 1 pound cream cheese, room temperature 1 can sweetened condensed milk Grated zest of 1 lime 1 cup crema or creme fraiche 1/4 cup powdered sugar 1 lime, thinly sliced, for garnish Instructions: Prepare the pie crust: In a bowl, combine the flour, lard, butter and salt. Mix lightly with your fingers until the mixture forms pea-sized pieces. Using a fork, stir in the ice water, a little at a time, until a dough forms, and then knead lightly until it comes together in a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a round about 12-inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Drape the round over the rolling pin and transfer to a 9 inch or 10 inch glass or ceramic pie plate. Ease the pastry into the pie plate, pressing it gently against the bottom and sides. Trim the edges, leaving a generous 1/2 inch overhang. Fold the overhang under, then crimp the edges. Cover and chill for 30 to 60 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prick the bottom and sides of the pastry with a fork. Line the pastry with parchment paper or waxed paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and remove the weights and paper. Transfer the pie shell to a rack and cool completely. Filling: In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the lime juice, green food coloring, cream cheese and condensed milk. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides of the work bowl often. Add the lime zest and process to mix thoroughly. Pour into the pie shell and place in the refrigerator. In a bowl, using a whisk, beat the crema and powdered sugar until soft peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, spread the mixture over the top of the pie, creating peaks evenly over the surface. Garnish with the lime slices. Cover and chill for 4 to 6 hours or overnight before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68885,&quot;Chicken Scarpariello 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 2 red bell peppers, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces 3 hot cherry peppers, drained and chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped or thinly sliced 1/2 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup chicken stock or broth 1/4 cup chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley, a couple of handfuls 2 tablespoons juice from hot pepper jar Orzo with Parsley and Lemon Zest, recipe follows 1/2 pound orzo Coarse salt 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it 2 large lemons, zested Black pepper 1/4 cup finely chopped flat leaf parsley, a couple of handfuls Instructions: Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium high heat.

Add the spinach. As soon as it&#39;s wilted and tender, drain and run under cold water. When the spinach is cool enough to handle, squeeze out any excess water. If you have used whole spinach with long stems, roughly chop it; you should have 1 1/2 cups of chopped spinach. Slice half of the onion into thin disks, and break the disks into rings with your hands. Mix 1 tablespoon of the flour with a bit of salt and pepper, and toss the onion rings in the flour. Heat 1 inch of grapeseed oil to 350 degrees F in a large, deep saute pan or Dutch oven. Add a handful of the onion rings to the oil, making sure they have room to move. Fry in the oil until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. (If desired, keep the fried onions warm in a 200 degrees F oven.) Finely mince the fennel and the remaining onion half. Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat and glaze it with the olive oil. Add the fennel, onion, garlic and a few pinches of salt, and cook until the onion is translucent; you don&#39;t want it to brown. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons flour and stir. When the flour has gathered up all the onion mixture, add the Herbsaint and bring to a boil. Let it reduce by half before stirring in the milk to make a bechamel. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook at a low simmer until the sauce thickens to the point where it coats the back of a spoon, and where drawing your finger down the spoon leaves a clear line. Pour half of the bechamel into a blender along with 1/2 cup of the spinach. Blend until completely smooth. Add the remaining spinach to the pan with the remaining bechamel, then add the spinach puree. Heat, stirring, and season with salt and pepper. Finish by stirring in the butter, nutmeg and Parmesan.

Stir gently as the strawberries break down and begin to thicken. Cook for 20 minutes. Cool and store in jars.<br> Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years. Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.<br> Tips:<br> Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.<br> To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.<br> Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.<br> As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.<br> After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68905,&quot;Pan Seared Salmon with Asparagus Lemon Salad, Red Wine Reduction and Watercress Puree 4 cups dry red wine 2 shallots, chopped 1 sprig rosemary 4 sprigs thyme 4 stems basil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 bunch fresh green asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 shallots, cut into 1/4-inch rings 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 lemon, zested and juiced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil 4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 bunch watercress, washed and stems removed 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 lemon, juiced 1 sprig basil, leaves only Pinch kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Red wine reduction: Put all ingredients in a wide shallow pan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.

Add the eggs and stir until well mixed. Add the flour and mix on medium-high speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Transfer the dough to a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let stand in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch the dough down and lightly flour a work surface. Lay the dough out and pat or roll the dough out into an 18-by-12-inch rectangle. For the filling: Butter a 13-by-9-inch glass baking dish. Spread the softened butter evenly all over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border, then sprinkle evenly with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle with the pecans and raisins if using. Starting with a short end, roll up the dough and press and crimp the edges to seal. Cut the dough into 12 slices and arrange them in the buttered baking dish. If you want to bake them the same day, cover with plastic wrap and let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Otherwise, refrigerate overnight; take out of the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before baking. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the cinnamon rolls until puffed and golden brown all over, about 25 minutes. For the icing: Put the confectioners&#39; sugar in a medium bowl.

Reduce heat, add chicken bouillon cubes and onion, and continue cooking chicken at a low boil until chicken is done, but not quite falling off the bone, approximately 30 minutes. Turn off the heat; remove the chicken from broth and remove skin and bones. Cut up and return to the broth-heat still off. Mix flour, salt, and mace in a large bowl. Crumble the butter into the flour with a fork, and add the eggs and milk. Mix with a strong wooden spoon until the dough is smooth. Divide dough into four portions to make it easy to work with. On a well-floured surface, roll the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness. Put the broth back on the heat and bring to a rolling boil. Cut the rolled-out dough into 2 to 3-inch squares and drop them into the boiling broth. Stir occasionally to keep the dough from sticking together as it boils. After all the dough has been dropped in the pot, turn the heat down to low, and simmer the \pop-eye, lid on, for about 20 minutes.

Cook the macaroni in a large pan of boiling salted water. It needs to be cooked to just under what you would normally do, as the pasta will be cooked again in the oven. Drain, then return to the pan and set aside. Fry the pancetta in a medium skillet over gentle heat until it just starts to brown and crisp up, then add the thyme leaves and scallions and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and add its contents to the pasta. For the sauce, put the butter, flour, nutmeg, and mustard in a small pan set over medium heat and cook until the butter has melted. Mix the milk and cream together in a pitcher and add a little to the flour and butter in the pan, stirring well. Keep adding the milk mixture, bit by bit, stirring well each time. This will prevent the sauce from going lumpy. The temptation is to put all the milk in at once only to find you are left with clumps of flour floating on the surface. Should this happen, take the pan off the heat and whisk it like crazy. This normally does the trick to eliminate all the lumps! Make sure you get the spoon into the \corners\ of the pan, as stray mounds of flour often lurk there. Once the sauce has fully come together, turn up the heat and boil for a minute or two. The sauce will thicken considerably, then remove the pan from the heat. Add two-thirds of both of the cheeses to the sauce while it is still hot and combine well. It may be a bit lumpy, but that is fine. Season to taste with salt and pepper and add to the pasta mix. Stir everything together and spoon into a shallow casserole dish or 4 individual large ramekins. Sprinkle the top with the rest of the cheese and the bread crumbs and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese starts to bubble and the topping goes crumbly and brown. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve while hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 68916,&quot;Basic Royal Icing One 2-pound bag powdered sugar 5 tablespoons meringue powder<br> 2 teaspoons clear vanilla extract<br> 3/4 cup room temperature water<br> Instructions: Add the powdered sugar and meringue powder to a mixer bowl and mix for 30 seconds using the paddle attachment. (It&#39;s not necessary to sift the sugar beforehand.) Add the vanilla to the water. With the mixer on its lowest setting, slowly add the water/vanilla mixture to the dry ingredients. As the water is added, the icing will become thick and lumpy. Continue adding the remaining water until the mixture reaches a honey-like consistency. At this point, turn the mixer to medium speed for 1 minute. After the first minute, turn the mixer to high speed and mix an additional 2 minutes. Use a spray bottle to get extra powdered sugar off the edges of the mixing bowl. Immediately remove the icing and place in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68917,&quot;Oeufs a la Neige 8 ounces granulated sugar 4 ounces pasteurized egg whites, room temperature 3 cups whole milk 1/4 cup granulated sugar, divided 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped 4 ounces pasteurized egg yolks Pinch kosher salt 1/3 cup chopped pistachios, optional Instructions: For the meringue: Heat 1-inch water in a 4-quart saucepan, covered, over high heat until it simmers, about 8 minutes. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer. Combine the sugar and whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and set over the simmering water. Whisk continually until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture lightens in color, doubles in volume, and reaches 140 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes. Place the bowl on the stand mixer and, using the whisk attachment, whisk on high until stiff peaks form and the meringue has cooled slightly, approximately 7 minutes. Set aside. To form and cook the oeufs: Place the milk, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and vanilla bean into a 2-quart saucier, cover, and set over high heat. Bring the mixture just to a simmer, approximately 5 minutes. Uncover, decrease the heat to low, and maintain a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees F. Use a 1-1/2 ounce disher to scoop the meringue, 4 at a time, into the milk, and poach for 3 minutes. Gently flip with a slotted spoon and cook until firm to the touch, another 3 minutes. Remove to a tea towel-lined half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining meringue mixture, maintaining the temperature of the milk to make sure it does not boil. Hold the meringues at room temperature until ready to serve, or store in an airtight container over night. (Can be made a day ahead and stored, and kept covered in the refrigerator.) Decrease the heat to low and keep the milk warm in the pan. To finish the neige: Whisk together the egg yolks, kosher salt, and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a medium mixing bowl until well combined and slightly lightened in color, approximately 2 minutes. Slowly add half of the milk mixture, whisking constantly. Return the entire mixture to the saucepan over low heat, and stir frequently with a spatula or wooden spoon until the sauce has thickened slightly and coats the back of the spatula or spoon, 8 to 9 minutes. You should be able to draw a line on the back of the utensil with your finger. Strain the sauce through the fine mesh strainer into a bowl set over an ice water bath and stir until chilled. (Can be made a day ahead and stored, covered in the refrigerator.) To serve: Spoon a small amount of sauce into the center of a shallow bowl and top with 2 oeufs. Sprinkle on pistachios, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68918,&quot;Couscous with Peas, Prosciutto and Mint One 7.6-ounce box plain or whole-wheat couscous 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed 2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto (6 to 7 slices), cut into thin strips 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small pot. Put the couscous and peas in a large bowl and pour the water over them. Stir once and then cover the top of the bowl with aluminum foil. Set aside to steam for 5 minutes. Uncover the bowl, fluff with a fork and set aside to cool, about 10 minutes. Toss in the prosciutto, mint, lemon juice, olive oil, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

Heat 1 cup water in a small saucepan to a simmer. Add the olive oil and just 2/3 cup of the water to the flours and mix to combine. If the dough still looks a little dry, add more water, a small splash at a time, until the dough comes together. Gather the dough into a ball and transfer to a work surface. Knead the dough until elastic and somewhat smooth, about 3 minutes. Wrap in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 4. Lightly flour a work surface with semolina. Divide the dough in two and roll each piece out to be about 1/4-inch-thick or a little less. Cut all of the dough into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-wide ribbons. Working one ribbon at a time, use the palms of your hands to roll it into a tube shape, pressing firmly to thin it out slightly and make elongated, uneven, wormlike strands. Repeat with the remaining pasta ribbons, transferring the pici to a sheet tray and lightly dusting with semolina as you go. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pici to the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 4 minutes. Reserve about 1 cup of the cooking water, then drain the pici.

Add the eggs, Parmesan, pecorino and a generous amount of pepper to the bowl with the fat and whisk to combine. Add the cooked pici to the bowl with the cheese and egg mixture, then add a splash of the cooking water and the pancetta and toss until creamy and well coated. Add a little more pasta water to loosen if desired. Add to a serving dish and top with parsley. Serve with additional Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 68933,&quot;Sarah&#39;s PB and J Chocolate Bars 1 stick unsalted butter 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 large egg, beaten 1 sleeve saltines (40 crackers, regular or whole wheat), finely crushed 3/4 cup finely chopped roasted peanuts 1/4 cup grape jelly 7 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped Instructions: Make the base: Line an 8-inch square baking pan with foil, extending it over the sides. Put the butter in a medium heatproof bowl; position the bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water (the bowl should not touch the water). Once the butter melts, stir in the sugar and cocoa. Whisk in the egg; cook, whisking, until the mixture is warm and the consistency of hot fudge, 6 minutes. Remove from the heat; mix in the saltine crumbs and peanuts. Press the crust into the pan. Set aside the saucepan of water. Make the filling: Spread the jelly over the crust in the pan; place in the freezer for a few minutes.

Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Allow sauce to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Set aside to cool. Place a pizza stone on the lowest rack of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F. Sprinkle about 2 to 3 tablespoons of yellow cornmeal on a baker&#39;s peel or baking sheet. Place the rolled out pizza dough on the prepared baker&#39;s peel or baking sheet. Spoon 1 cup of the cooled barbecue sauce over the pizza dough, leaving about 3/4-inch of dough uncovered around the edge. Spread the pulled pork over the sauce, then top with the onion slices and chopped bell pepper. Spread the cheeses evenly over the top. Using a quick flick of the wrist, slide the prepared pizza onto the hot pizza stone and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is crisp and golden and cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve with remaining barbecue sauce, if desired. In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, honey, and 1 tablespoon oil, stirring to combine. Let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt, mixing by hand until it is all incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Continue adding the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, working the dough after each addition, until the dough is smooth but still slightly sticky. You may not need all of the flour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth but still slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes. Oil a large mixing bowl with remaining olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place, free from drafts until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 15-inch circle. Remove the pork from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature before proceeding. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a roasting pan with aluminum foil. Season the roast well on all sides with the Essence, salt, and cayenne pepper. Place a roasting rack inside the roasting pan and place the seasoned pork on the rack, fat side up. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 4 hours. Remove the foil from the roast and continue to bake until the roast is very tender and will pull apart easily with a fork, about 2 hours longer. Remove the pork from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Remove any excess fat from the roast and discard. Using two forks or your hands, shred the pork into bite-sized pieces. Combine all ingredients thoroughly.

Process the butter and shortening until they are cut into tiny pieces. Add 8 tablespoons of the water and process until it comes into a ball. If it is dry, add water by tablespoonfuls. Turn the dough onto a board and press it into a round slab about 1-inch thick. If it is not too hot, roll the dough out immediately. (easier to handle) But if the fat is oozing out, then refrigerate for 2 hours at least or overnight to relax the dough. Gently flour your board and rolling pin. Roll dough out from the center until it forms a circle about 1/2-inch thick; turn over and roll until a little thicker than 1/8th-inch thick and 14-inches in diameter. Roll the dough over a lightly buttered 12inch false bottomed tart shell. Press the dough into the pan and trim the edges pressing up a border 1/2-inch wide. Fold that border back into the pan (it should not overlap the bottom) and press it back into the sides of the tart shell so that you are building up a double thickness of shell wall. Roll the rolling pin over the top to trim off excess pastry and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Set the pan on a baking sheet. Line the dough with foil or parchment and fill it with dried beans. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove beans and bake 10 minutes longer. Paint the bottom of the shell with egg and sprinkle on grated cheese and return to oven for 3 to 4 minutes to really seal the bottom. Remove from oven and cool tart shell on a rack for 30 minutes before filling and finishing baking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68936,&quot;Low-Fat Scalloped Potatoes 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the dish Kosher salt 3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup low-fat milk (1%), at room temperature 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature Freshly ground pepper 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 cup grated gruyere cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a bowl combine the pepper, sugar and salt and blend well together. Place the bunches of cilantro, dill, and scallions together in the bowl of a food processor and process until finely chopped. Rinse some cheese cloth under cold running water. Unfold the cheese cloth and lay a large piece out on your work surface. The cloth will have to be large enough to wrap completely around the salmon several times. Choose the freshest salmon possible for this dish as this is a cured but not cooked dish and fresh really counts. Cut the fish fillet into two equal pieces and lay it, skin side down, in the center of the cheesecloth. Spread the sugar, salt, and pepper mixture evenly over the salmon flesh. Spread the chopped herbs in the same manner and then sprinkle the tequila over the herbs. The flesh of the salmon should be totally coated in this curing seasoning. Once all the tequila has been absorbed, sandwich the two fillets together, fleshtoflesh and skinsidesout. Position the fillet \sandwich\ in the center of the cloth and wrap as you would a gift, pulling the cloth as tightly as possible around the fillets. Lay the package on a cake cooling rack set over a cookie sheet. The rack allows air to circulate for more efficient drying, while the cookie sheet will catch the liquid extracted during the threeday curing period. Put the weight in a second, smaller cake pan and place it on top of the fish. The weight must be properly and evenly distributed so as to press out the unwanted water. Place the entire curing setup in the bottom, the coldest area, of your refrigerator and begin the 3 day curing process. Remove the weight and flip the fish package over every 24 hours, replacing the weight each time. Drain off and discard any liquid that collects in the pan when you do this. At the end of the 72 hours the fish must be cleaned. Remove the cheesecloth and discard it. Drain any accumulated liquid, scrape off all of the used herbs and salt and pepper. Rinse the fish under cold running water and pat the fish totally dry. The salmon is now fully cured and as entirely edible as smoked salmon but must be kept refrigerated. To serve, finely chop one cup of fresh cilantro and cover the flesh side of the fish. Using a very sharp knife, slice the salmon as thinly as possible, at a 45 degree angle. Your first slices may look a bit rough, but be patient. With a little practice you&#39;ll soon be turning out elegant greenedged red ribbons of gravlax. Mix the mustard and confectioner&#39;s sugar and serve with pumpernickel and wedges of lime.

Grease two 12-cup muffin tins. (For best results, use cupcake liners here.) Combining the dry ingredients: Whisk together the flour mix, the psyllium, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. Creaming the butter and sugar: Put the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment at medium speed, whirl the butter and sugar together until they are thoroughly combined, creamy, and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula once in a while. Combining the wet ingredients: Whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla extract. Set aside. Finishing the batter: With the stand mixer running, add the egg mixture, one tablespoon at a time, to the creamed butter and sugar. When the entire mixture is incorporated into the butter and sugar mixture, add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the bowl. When there is no visible sign of flour, add 1/2 of the buttermilk. When that is incorporated, repeat this process, ending with the dry ingredients. Baking the cupcakes: Using a small ice cream scoop, spoon enough cake batter into the prepared muffin tins to fill each one 2/3 of the way. Put the tin into the oven and bake until the cupcakes are slightly firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the cupcakes comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the tins for 15 minutes. Run a butter knife around the edges of the cupcakes, then turn them onto a cooling rack. Pour all the flours into a large container. (Restaurant supply stores sell large plastic containers that fit this purpose well. You could also use a large glass jar.)

Make sure the bottom edge of the cakes line up with the styrofoam sphere half. If your sphere is too tall, cut off some of the top. Exfoliate the cake, peeling off excess crumbs until you get a nice gradual curve. Discard excess cake. Transfer the cake/sphere to a round cake stand. Frost the cake and plastic covering the styrofoam using an offset spatula, pressing relatively firmly. Remove the excess buttercream. Put the cake into the refrigerator to let the buttercream harden. When the buttercream is hard remove the cake from the refrigerator and set aside. Dust a workspace with cornstarch. Using a rolling pin, flatten the orange fondant into a large round big enough to cover the cake/sphere. Wrap the fondant over the rolling pin or a wooden rod. Brush the excess starch off the fondant with a towel. Unravel the fondant over the sphere to cover it. By hand smooth out the wrinkles on orange fondant. Cut off the excess fondant at the base of the sphere. Smooth out the fondant. Using the clay tool, draw in pumpkin lines in the orange fondant covering. Run over lines with your finger to make sure they are nice and prominent. Roll out dark brown and light brown fondant for vine to wrap around sphere. Wrap the vine around base of the sphere. Push vine up to cover the broken parts of the orange fondant. Roll out extra orange fondant. Use water to attach it to the orange sphere, covering the holes you have in the orange fondant. Roll out more fondant, and place on base of sphere Roll out more dark brown and light brown fondant. Twist the dark and light brown fondant together until it starts to tear. Reserve for the base of the pumpkin. Fill the airbrush with red orange food coloring, and spray the creased sections of fondant first, then the entire cake. Rinse out the airbrush. Add the gum paste leaves to the base of the cake. Before you make the pumpkin&#39;s face, decide which side is going to be the front. Get out a nice sharp blade and a duster brush. Roll out enough black fondant to make the face, using cornstarch so fondant does not stick to work area. Brush excess cornstarch off the rolled out fondant. Use a knife to cut out the shape of the pumpkin&#39;s grin and eyes. Cut out teeth for pumpkin&#39;s grin. Use water to attach the grin to the pumpkin. Brush off the grin once it is attached to the cake. Use small round cutters to cut out \eyes\ from fondant eyes of the pumpkin. Attach eyes to cake and brush off eyes. From the pieces you cut out from the eyes, use a larger round cutter to cut out crescent moons. Attach the moons to the top of the eyes as the eyebrows, and brush off the eyebrows. Arrange the reserved fondant twists on the base of the pumpkin. Take the empty airbrush and blow out some of the extra cornstarch onto the pumpkin for the effect. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 68991,&quot;Peach-Blackberry Cobbler with Almond-Buttermilk Biscuit Topping and Almond Whipped Cream 6 cups chopped peeled peaches (about 6 large peaches) 2 cups blackberries<br> 2 cups granulated sugar<br> 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch<br> 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 9 ounces all-purpose flour 3 ounces almond flour<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed, very cold<br> 2 ounces leaf lard, cubed, very cold<br> 9 ounces buttermilk<br> Milk, for brushing<br> 2 tablespoons raw sugar, such as Sugar in the Raw 1 cup heavy cream, cold 1 teaspoon granulated sugar<br> 2 tablespoons toasted sliced almonds<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F with a rack in the center of the oven and a second rack underneath; place a baking sheet on the second rack (to catch drips).

Put the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan and place over medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves and bring up to a boil. As soon that happens, stop stirring and let it boil until it turns an amber color, 8 to 10 minutes or so. (If you think that it needs another stir, brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush, and stir the entire mixture, picking up the pot itself by the handle, being careful not to touch the caramel or else it could crystallize.) Once the mixture reaches that dark amber color, turn the heat down. Stand back from the pot and add the cream very slowly, stirring with a heatproof spatula. (If you are nervous about the steam, wear a kitchen glove to protect your hand.) Continue to stir until all is incorporated. Once the mixture is smooth, stir in the fine salt. Take off the heat and pour the caramel over the bowl of chocolate. Whisk to combine, making sure all the chocolate melts. Pop in the fridge for about 1 hour until completely chilled. Take the frosting out of the fridge and beat it with a hand mixer just until it becomes spreadable. Add the butter in pieces and mix until it&#39;s all combined. Pop back into the refrigerator for another hour. Place 1 cake layer on a cake platter, flat-side up. (You want the cake flat-side up so when you get into it you&#39;ll have nice and even layers.) Evenly spread 2 cups of the frosting over the top. Sprinkle with sea salt flakes, then put the other cake layer on top, flat-side up. Spread the rest of the frosting over the top and on the sides of the cake. Sprinkle the top with more salt flakes. Put a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 2 (9 by 2-inch) nonstick round cake pans. Line the bottom of each with a round of parchment paper, and then butter the paper. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt together onto parchment paper. With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, cream the butter and sugars until light and fluffy, 4 or 5 minutes. Add your eggs, 1 at a time, mixing until completely incorporated before adding each additional egg. Mix in the chocolate and vanilla, making sure to combine really well. Turn the mixer to low and slowly add the dry ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk, in 3 batches, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Make sure to let it mix thoroughly. Pour half the batter in each pan and spread it evenly with a spatula or butter knife. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 25 minutes. Remove the pans to racks and allow the cakes to cool for 10 minutes or so. Loosen the edges of the cake from the pan with a knife, then turn them onto the racks. Remove the paper and let the cakes completely cool. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 69000,&quot;Clams with Sausage and Peppers over Rice Pilaf 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 small yellow onion, minced Kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 2 cups long-grain white rice, like basmati 1 fresh bay leaf 2 cups chicken stock 4 cloves garlic, sliced 3 bell peppers (red, orange or yellow), sliced 1 medium red onion, sliced 2 pounds fresh middleneck clams 1 pound smoked sausage, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick pieces 1 cup chicken stock 4 ounces white wine 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving Olive oil, for serving Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium heat. If using a charcoal grill, build an even layer of hot coals on the bottom. For the rice pilaf: Melt the butter and olive oil in a large ovenproof pot or Dutch oven. Add the garlic and onions with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the coriander, cumin and nutmeg and continue to cook to toast the spices, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice, stirring to coat, and toast, about 2 minutes. Add the bay leaf and chicken stock. Bring to a gentle boil then season with salt and cover the pot. Cover the grill and cook until the rice is cooked and all the liquid is gone, about 18 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the foil packets for the clams with sausage and peppers: Lay out a double layer of large heavy-duty aluminum foil pieces in an X formation, totaling 2 packets. Distribute the garlic, peppers and onions evenly between the packets. Top each with the clams and sausage. Bring up all 4 sides of the foil, but don&#39;t seal. Divide the stock, wine and butter between each packet. Season with salt and pepper. Tightly seal the foil. Remove the rice from the grill, remove the lid and fluff with a fork. Place a kitchen towel over the pot and place the lid of the pot back over the kitchen towel. Let sit for 10 minutes without opening. This will help absorb the moisture in the pot so the rice is fluffy and not mushy. Remove the ring from the grill if it has one so the coals are exposed and place the packets directly onto the coals. Steam until the clams open and everything is heated through, 7 to 8 minutes. When ready to serve, transfer the rice pilaf to a serving plate. Carefully open the foil packets and pour everything over the rice pilaf, making sure to get all the juices from the packets. Sprinkle with cilantro leaves, drizzle with some olive oil and serve! (Alternatively, you can cook the rice pilaf in a 350 degrees F oven for 18 minutes and bake the clams with sausage and peppers foil packets in a 375 degrees F oven for 8 to 10 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 69001,&quot;Mini Reuben Meatloaves 8 ounces deli-sliced corned beef 1 slice rye bread, cut into cubes 1 pound ground beef 1 large egg 1/4 cup milk 1/2 onion, grated on the large holes of a box grater 1 1/4 cups shredded Swiss cheese (about 5 ounces) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup drained sauerkraut Russian or Thousand Island dressing, for topping Chopped fresh parsley, for topping Potato chips and pickles, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Slowly add the cornmeal, stirring continuously. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the polenta is cooked to a thick, creamy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in butter. As soon as the polenta begins cooking, prepare the Seasoned Sauerkraut: Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the bacon and continue to saute another 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, let mixture and pan cool for a few minutes, and then sprinkle and stir in the sweet paprika. Deglaze the pan with 1 cup chicken stock, stirring and scraping to dissolve the pan deposits, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Stir in the sauerkraut, bay leaves, juniper berries, and hot paprika until well blended. Add the remaining 1 cup chicken stock and cook over low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Just before serving, stir in the sour cream and taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. While the polenta and sauerkraut are cooking, prepare the fish: Put the oil and butter in 2 medium saute pans over high heat. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper on both sides. Divide the fish fillets among the 2 skillets and saute them about 3 minutes on one side; turn them over, add the diced red bell peppers and the paprika and continue to cook 3 to 4 minutes more, until lightly browned. To serve, on each heated serving plate spoon two 1/4-cup pools of polenta side by side. Mound about 1/2 cup of the sauerkraut in the center of the plate between the pools of polenta.

Meanwhile, make the sauce: Cook the olive oil, smashed garlic and red pepper flakes in a large pot over medium-high heat, stirring, until the garlic softens, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook until it begins to sizzle, about 2 minutes. Add the strained tomatoes, bay leaves and 5 cups water; bring to a boil and cook 20 minutes. Place the beef slices between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound with a heavy skillet until 1/16 inch thick. Position the slices with the short sides facing you and lay a slice of prosciutto on top of each. Add 1/2 cup parsley, the pecorino and minced garlic to the soaked bread and mix with your hands, breaking up the bread; spread on top of the prosciutto. Cut the provolone into twelve 2-to-3-inch-long sticks, about 1/2 inch thick. Put a piece of cheese horizontally across the middle of each slice of beef and trim any overhanging cheese. Starting with a short end, tightly roll up the beef and secure with a toothpick. Transfer the braciole to the sauce. Reduce the heat to medium low, cover and simmer 1 hour. Uncover, stir and reduce the heat to low; continue simmering, uncovered, until the beef is tender and the sauce thickens, 1 more hour. (Add up to 1 cup water if the sauce gets too thick.)

Let cool.<br> Place the granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat (brush down the sides with water to avoid any clinging granules of sugar and prevent crystallization). Cook the syrup until it reaches 250 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Add the toasted pistachios to the hot syrup and stir until the nuts are well coated. When all the sugar coats the pistachios and any remaining syrup turns powdery white, pour the nuts onto a baking sheet to cool. Once cooled, place the pistachios in the bowl of a food processor with the almond flour. Blend until the nuts resemble a coarse meal, approximately 1 minute. Slowly drizzle in the oil while continuing to blend the mixture. Add the butter, almond paste, almond extract and 3 tablespoons water. Keep mixing until mixture is a smooth paste, approximately 3 minutes.<br> For the macarons: Mix the powdered sugar, almond flour and salt in a bowl using a whisk; set aside. In a separate bowl using a hand mixer, mix the granulated sugar, vanilla, food coloring and egg whites. Whip until the batter has firm shiny peaks. Take one-third of the wet mixture and fold into the dry ingredients. Gradually fold in the remaining batter. Once the dry ingredients have been absorbed, run a rubber spatula over the mixture to create a shine. This process is called macaroning and is key to the overall recipe.<br> Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Transfer the batter to a piping bag with a 1/4-inch round tip. Pipe the mixture in 1-inch rounds onto the cookie sheets. It&#39;s important to create a consistent size for each cookie.

Add the pureed veggies, season with salt and bring to medium-high heat. Cook the veggies until all the liquid has evaporated and they begin to stick to the pan - you want to brown the crap out of these guys until crud starts to form on the bottom of the pan. Stir occasionally to scrape up the brown bits, and then let the crud form again. Be patient here and don&#39;t rush it, this is where the big flavor develops; it will take up to 30 minutes.<br> When the lovely brown crud has formed and been scraped down a couple of times, add the tomato paste, stirring to combine. Let it start to brown a little and continue stirring for 2 to 3 minutes. There&#39;s not much liquid at this point to keep things from burning, so be careful and move fast. Add the wine, stir to combine and scrape up any remaining brown bits. Cook until about half the wine has evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes.<br> Add both the spicy and sweet sausage and, using a spoon to break it up, cook until the meat is brown (this is where another round of big brown flavors is formed, so take your time), 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Add enough water to the pan to cover the meat by about 1/2-inch. Stir to combine well, and then add the bay leaves and thyme bundle. Taste, season with salt and taste again; it&#39;s by no means done, but it should taste good. Bring the sauce to a boil (BTB) and reduce to a simmer (RTS). Continue cooking, checking occasionally, for 3 hours, tasting, seasoning and adding more water as needed.<br> For the pickled onions: In a medium bowl, combine the red wine vinegar with 1/2 cup cold tap water. Stir in the sugar, salt and hot sauce. Add the sliced onions and let sit for at least 1 hour. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a large platter, spread out a layer of tortilla chips. Spoon a layer of the ragu over the chips. Cover with a layer of Parmigianino and fontina cheeses. Place in the oven until the cheese melts, 5 to 10 minutes.<br> Remove from the oven, sprinkle a layer of arugula over the top and finish with a large dollop of mascarpone cheese.

Freeze at least 6 hours and up to overnight. For the chocolate domes: Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Once completely melted, let the chocolate cool to about 90 degrees F. The chocolate should still be melted and warm, not set. Meanwhile, wash and dry the outside of 4 medium round balloons. Inflate the balloons so they are about 5 inches in diameter. Holding onto the tied end of a balloon, dip it into the melted chocolate so that two-thirds of the balloon is covered in chocolate. Let the excess chocolate drip off. Place the balloon chocolate-side up in a coffee mug. Repeat with remaining balloons and chocolate. Let set at room temperature until hardened, 4 to 6 hours. Once the chocolate is complete set and hard, very carefully pop each ballon with a knife and remove it from the interior of the chocolate dome. Place the domes open-side down on a warmed baking sheet and gently swirl to create a smooth edge. Transfer to a clean baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Store in a cool place. For the white chocolate sauce: In a medium pot, heat the cream over medium-low heat until hot and bubbling around the edges. Immediately add the white chocolate chips and vanilla and whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and incorporated into the cream. Keep warm until ready to serve. You can make the sauce in advance and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator; reheat in a pot over low heat before serving, adding more cream if needed to thin it out. For the assembly: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the crumbled sandwich cookies, brownies and fresh and freeze-dried raspberries. Gently toss to combine. Line up 4 plates or wide shallow bowls (like pasta bowls). Place a 3-inch ring mold in the center of one of the plates and spoon in a quarter of the fruit and crumble mixture. Carefully remove the cutter. Repeat on the remaining plates. If you don&#39;t have a 3-inch cutter, neatly spoon the mixture into the center of each plate in a circle about 3 inches in diameter. Make sure the white chocolate sauce is nice and hot and transfer to a measuring cup or small pitcher. Working quickly, remove the raspberry sorbet hearts from the molds and place one onto each portion of the crumble mixture. Carefully cover each heart with a chocolate dome. Present to your guests and pour the hot chocolate sauce over the dome to melt and reveal the dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 69036,&quot;Chipotle Lime Pumpkin Seeds 2 cups raw pumpkin seeds 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon lime zest plus 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley<br> 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves<br> 1 teaspoon chipotle powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

For the croutons: Place a wire rack over a baking sheet. Trim the crust from the bread and cut it into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Spread the bread cubes on the rack and toast in the oven until light golden, 12 to 15 minutes. In a small pot, heat the EVOO with the anchovies over medium-low heat. When the anchovies melt into the oil, stir in the Worcestershire sauce, garlic and lemon juice, then remove from the heat. Place the croutons in a bowl, pour the dressing over them and toss to coat. Sprinkle with cheese and season liberally with pepper. Spread the croutons on the baking sheet and return to the oven until they are deep golden and the cheese has set, 7 to 10 minutes. For the soup: Heat the EVOO in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the escarole and cook until wilted, then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add the chicken stock, beans and lemon zest. Simmer at a low boil until the greens are tender and no longer bitter. Serve topped with the Caesar croutons. Cooks&#39; Note: If you are making the soup ahead of time, cool and store it in the refrigerator. Cool the croutons and store them in foil in a cool, dry place. Reheat the soup over medium heat and reheat the croutons in a foil pouch if you wish to serve them warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 69050,&quot;Avocado Pesto Toast 1/2 cup walnuts 1/4 cup olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 4 cloves garlic 2 ripe avocados, pitted and peeled 1 large bunch fresh basil leaves (about 3 ounces) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 pieces whole-grain toast Instructions: In a food processor, pulse together the walnuts, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, avocados and basil until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste. Spread onto each piece of toast. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 69051,&quot;Chocolate-covered Almond Toffee Bars 10 ounces whole unblanched almonds 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/3 cup light corn syrup 1/3 cup water or rum 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into small pieces Instructions: Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spread nuts on a baking tray and bake until toasted, 10 to 15 minutes, turning nuts after 7 to 8 minutes to ensure even toasting. Cool and chop coarsely. You should have about 2 cups. Set aside. Clean baking tray and coat with vegetable oil or vegetable oil spray. Spray both sides of the offset spatula with vegetable oil spray. Set aside. Make the toffee: Place sugar in a small deep saucepan. Add the corn syrup and water or rum and, over medium heat, bring to a boil. Let boil until large bubbles form on the surface, 3 to 4 minutes. Cover with foil and boil 5 minutes longer. Add the pieces of butter and continue cooking, uncovered, over medium heat until temperature reaches 300 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 30 minutes. (The candy thermometer has a clip on the side that can be slid up or down. If desired, you can fit the thermometer on the side of the pan, making sure that it rests in the mixture, not on the bottom of the pan, so that the reading is accurate.) Remove from heat and immediately add the salt, baking soda, and 1 cup of chopped nuts. Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined. Pour the toffee mixture on the oiled baking tray and, using the offset spatula, spread the mixture out, making a block about 10 by 13 inches. The toffee will thicken very quickly, so work as fast as you can. When cool, blot some of the oil or vegetable spray with a clean towel. While the toffee mixture is cooling, melt the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl placed over simmering water. When almost melted, turn off heat and let the chocolate continue to melt, stirring occasionally. Keep warm. When you can lift up the block of toffee, transfer it to a flat work surface or to a clean baking tray. Pour the melted chocolate over the toffee, spreading to cover the entire surface and, before the chocolate cools, sprinkle with the remaining chopped nuts. If the chocolate takes a long time to harden, refrigerate for about 10 minutes to set the chocolate. Return the block of toffee to the work surface and break up into pieces approximately 1 to 1 1/2 inches wide. Then cut into smaller pieces, as desired. Use as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 69052,&quot;Colcannon Soup 2 ounces diced slab bacon 1 chopped white onion 1 leek sliced, sliced 1/2 pound waxy-style potatoes, peeled and diced 1/2 Savoy cabbage, cored and sliced 1/2 cup white wine 4 cups vegetable stock Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups heavy cream 2 tablespoons diced unsalted butter, at room temperature Basil oil, for garnish Fried basil, for garnish Instructions: Put the bacon in a pot over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon renders its fat. Lower the heat to medium. Add the onion, leek, potato, and cabbage and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the wine and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the stock, bring to a boil, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Lower the heat and simmer until the potato is tender. Add the cream and simmer for a few minutes until the soup achieves a creamy texture. Remove from the heat and finish by whisking the butter cubes into the soup. (Don&#39;t re-boil the soup after adding the butter into it, or it will curdle.) Divide the soup among bowls, drizzle with basil oil, and garnish with the fried basil leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69053,&quot;Blueberry Balsamic Vinegar 4 cups frozen, thawed or fresh blueberries 1 quart balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup sugar Lime peel cut in strips from 1 lime (green part only) 1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick Instructions: In a large non-reactive saucepan, crush blueberries with a potato masher or back of a heavy spoon.

Stir in salt, the sugar and the hot sauce. Add the sliced onions and let sit for at least one hour. To make the Chicken Milanese: Set up a standard breading procedure in 3 wide deep plates. Fill 1 with flour, 1 with the beaten eggs, and 1 with the panko and grated Parmigiano. Season the chicken breasts with salt. Using one hand for dry things and 1 hand for wet things, take each piece of chicken through the breading procedure: dredge lightly in the flour, then the egg wash and then through the bread crumbs. Lay the breaded chicken on a sheet tray and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Pour olive oil into a large saute pan until it reaches a thickness of about a half an inch - better a little more rather than a little less. Bring to a medium-high heat and add butter. Test the oil by flicking flour or bread crumbs into the oil. If it doesn&#39;t sizzle-WAIT! When the oil is hot, test it again by dipping the edge of a piece of chicken into the oil, the oil should gently sizzle. Cook the chicken in the oil in batches on both sides until it is a lovely golden brown color and is crispy, about 4 to 5 minutes. Do not crowd the pan or the chicken will become very greasy and soggy. When the chicken comes out of the oil lay it on paper towels to drain off the excess oil and sprinkle with salt. You can keep the chicken in a low oven to keep it warm while the rest of the chicken is cooking. To make the Escarole Salad: Combine the pecorino, hazelnuts and parsley in the food processor and pulse until they are coarsely chopped. Toss together the escarole, hazelnut mixture and some of the pickled red onions and dress with some of the pickling liquid and olive oil. Season with salt. Place chicken on each serving plate and top with the escarole salad. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 69055,&quot;Potatoes with Chorizo and Onions 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 3/4 pound, 1 package, chorizo, very thinly sliced on an angle, pull away any loose casings 6 small Yukon gold potatoes, very thinly sliced 1 medium onion, very thinly sliced Salt and pepper 2 teaspoons sweet paprika 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, a generous 1 or 2 handfuls Instructions: Heat a medium skillet over medium high heat.

Season the potatoes and onions with salt, pepper and paprika then turn sections of the potatoes using a spatula so that the chorizo is on top and potatoes and onions are on the bottom. Place a smaller skillet on top and press down. Weight the skillet with a few heavy cans. Cook 10 to 12 minutes. Remove weight and turn again to combine all ingredients. Cook another 3 to 4 minutes then add parsley, remove from heat and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 69056,&quot;Creamed Leeks 12 firm fresh leeks, 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter 4 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup chicken broth Heavy cream to taste Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cut off roots of the leeks and peel off any withered leaves. Cut off 2 inches from green tops. With a sharp knife slit the green parts in half lengthwise stopping an inch from root end. Make another slit, lengthwise and perpendicular. Spread leaves apart an rinse them under running water, carefully looking out for hidden grit. Cut leeks crosswise into 1 1/2-inch lengths. Heat butter in a saucepan and add the leeks. Toss to combine them with the butter. Add the broth, cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until completely tender. You may do the recipe 2 to 3 days in advance up to this point. Over medium heat, evaporate the liquid from the leeks and when they are totally dry add heavy cream, starting with 1/4 cup or so and simmer, stirring continuously until the cream has been absorbed by the leeks. Add 1/4 cup more and repeat if you wish. Season to taste with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69057,&quot;Cajun Spiced Nuts Vegetable oil, for the baking sheet 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning 2 cups salted mixed nuts Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.

Bring the water and potatoes to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender. Strain the potatoes and allow them to rest in the strainer over the sink for 5 to 10 minutes so they steam and dry out a bit. While the potatoes are draining combine the cream and butter in the pot and bring to a boil, melting the butter. Put the potatoes back into the pot with the cream and the butter and whip with an electric hand mixer until the potatoes are smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm. (If the potatoes cool off, heat them in a pan with the additional 1/4 cup cream and 2 tablespoons butter just before plating.) For the vegetables: Prepare a large bowl of ice water for shocking the vegetables after blanching. Bring 2 gallons of water to a rolling boil and add the salt. Add half of the green beans to the boiling water and cook until tender but not over-cooked, about 3 minutes. Transfer the beans to the ice bath using a hand strainer. Allow the water to come back up to a rolling boil and repeat the process with the remainder of the green beans and then the carrots. For the trout: Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat a large skillet over high heat until smoking hot and reduce the heat to medium-high. Season the trout with salt and pepper, then dredge the skin side of the trout in the flour. Coat the skillet with grape seed oil. Place the trout in the skillet skin-side down and sear until the skin is golden brown and the flesh begins to turn opaque. Gently flip the filets over and finish cooking for an additional 2 minutes. Transfer the trout to the prepared baking sheet and allow the cooked trout to rest for 5 minutes. For the sauce: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until they just begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke. Add the grape seed oil to the pan and then add the shallots and capers. Saute for 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and bring to a boil; cook until reduced by half. Take the pan off the heat and add the butter a little at a time, swirling the pan to emulsify the butter into the lemon juice. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper (be careful with the salt because the capers can be very salty already). Stir in the chopped parsley. For plating: In a large saute pan over high heat add the carrots and green beans and enough water to create a thin layer in the pan. Allow the water to boil and once the beans and carrots are hot, season them with salt and pepper. Place a scoop of the mashed potatoes in the center of each of 6 plates. Arrange two filets of trout on top, flesh-side up. Arrange the carrots and green beans leaning on the trout to one side. Spoon 2 ounces of sauce onto each plate and sprinkle the toasted almond slices over the top of the fish.

Add the almond flour, baking powder and salt and whisk until the mixture becomes a thick batter. Let the batter rest for 10 minutes. Heat a large nonstick saut pan over medium heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining butter to the pan and swirl to coat. The butter should bubble vigorously but not brown. If it begins to brown, turn the heat down slightly. Scoop a heaping 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan, using a small spoon to help coax the batter out and spread it to about 4 inches in diameter. Repeat to add one more pancake, taking care leave at least one inch in between. Cook until the surface of the pancakes is smooth with several tiny bubbles starting to pop up and the underside is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Be patient because undercooked pancakes will be very hard to flip.<br> When the pancakes are ready, gently work a thin, wide spatula underneath each one, then flip and cook 1 to 2 minutes more until the second side is golden brown. Transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Carefully wipe out the pan and repeat with the remaining butter and batter to make 4 more pancakes in 2 batches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69070,&quot;Turtle Soup 1 1/4 sticks unsalted butter 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 pound turtle meat, medium dice 1/3 pound veal stew meat, medium dice 1/3 pound lean beef, medium dice 1 cup each minced celery, white onion, green bell pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic, minced 3 bay leaves 1 teaspoon oregano 1 1//2 cups tomato puree 1 tablespoon hot sauce 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 2 quarts beef stock 1 lemon, juiced 4 eggs, hard cooked and finely chopped 4 tablespoons spinach, chopped 4 tablespoons dry sherry Instructions: Melt 1 stick of butter in a heavy saucepan.

Cook until crisp. Add the carrots and onions to the pan and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, about 1 minute. Add the beans, barbecue sauce, 1 cup stock, honey and brown sugar and mix gently to combine; season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer, about 20 minutes. Check to see if the mixture is dry, and if it is, add a little more stock. Continue simmering until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in the burnt ends. Garnish the top with the parsley and let sit 10 minutes before serving. Mix together all the spices in a bowl. Liberally rub the entire brisket with the spices, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove the brisket from the refrigerator 1 hour before beginning the smoking process to take the chill off, and remove the plastic wrap.<br> Get your smoker running at 225 degrees F with hardwood charcoal and a few handfuls of soaked wood chips. This temperature should be maintained throughout the entire smoke. (If you are using a grill: Set up the grill for indirect heat, banking the coals on one side of the grill and scattering the wood chips on top. Maintain the temperature at 225 degrees throughout the smoking process, adding chips as necessary until you wrap the brisket in foil.)<br> Place the brisket fat-side up on your smoker grate and close it up for the long smoke.<br> Open your barbecue smoker every hour or 2 and spray the brisket liberally with apple juice to help keep the meat from drying out. Also keep apple juice in the water pan if you are using a water smoker.<br> When the internal temperature reaches 165 to 170 degrees, after about 4 hours, wrap the brisket in aluminum foil and continue to cook for another 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours. This little trick is a big help in getting the meat tender, especially for beginners. Figure that a brisket smoked at around 200 degrees will take about 1 1/2 hours per pound. The brisket is done when the internal temperature reaches 185 degrees F. Remove and let rest 20 minutes before slicing. Remove the foil from the brisket over a large pan or disposable pan and reserve the liquid. Cut off the brisket points and reserve for Honey-Rum Baked Pinto Beans with Burnt Ends. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 69084,&quot;Peppermint Chocolate Fudge 2 cups (12 oz. pkg.) milk chocolate chips 1 cup (6 oz. pkg.) semi-sweet chocolate chips 1 (14 oz.) can Eagle Brand?

Strip the zest from the lemons with a sharp vegetable peeler, making sure you remove the yellow zest but none of the white pith beneath. If you do remove some of the white pith, scrape it off the strips of zest with the point of a paring knife and discard it. Add the zest to the milk and sugar and bring to a simmer over low heat. Remove from heat and allow to steep for 5 minutes; remove the strips of zest with a slotted spoon or skimmer and discard them. Squeeze lemons to make 1/2 cup strained juice. Place juice in a mixing bowl and whisk in cornstarch, then yolks. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil over low heat and whisk about a third of the boiling milk into the lemon juice mixture. Return remaining milk and sugar mixture to a boil once more and whisk the lemon juice and yolk mixture back into it, whisking constantly until the filling comes to a boil and thickens. Allow to boil, whisking constantly, for about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, whisk in butter and pour into a nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface of the filling and chill until it is approximately 75 degrees. (If you prepare the filling in advance, let it come to room temperature before proceeding.) Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Roll out the dough to make bottom crust and arrange in pan. Chill crust until firm. To bake the crust, pierce it all over with the tines of a fork at 1/2inch intervals. Line it with a disk of parchment or waxed paper and fill with cherry stones or dried beans. Bake about 20 minutes, until lightly colored. Remove paper and beans and continue baking until the crust is a deep golden brown. Cool crust on a rack. Spread the cooled filling evenly in the cooled crust. Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. To make the meringue bring a small pan of water to a boil. Lower heat so that water simmers. Combine egg whites, sugar and salt in the bowl of the mixer or if you are using a hand whisk another heatproof bowl. Place bowl over pan of simmering water and whisk gently for about 2 minutes, until egg whites are hot (about 140 degrees) and sugar has dis solved. Whip meringue on medium speed until it has cooled and is able to hold a shape, but it should not be dry. Distribute spoonfuls of the meringue all over the top of the pie, then use the back of a spoon or a small offset metal spatula to spread the meringue evenly. It should cover the top of the pie and touch the edges of the crust all around. Here and there, bring up the surface of the meringue so that it is swirled. Place the pie on a cookie sheet and bake for about 5 to 10 minutes, until the meringue is colored evenly. Cool on a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69091,&quot;Shrimp Jambalaya 1 pound shell-on shrimp 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 onion, 1 half left intact, the other chopped 3 celery stalks, 1 cut into large chunks and 2 chopped 5 garlic cloves, 3 crushed and 2 chopped 4 bay leaves 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 green bell pepper, chopped 1 bunch scallions, chopped, white and green parts separated<br> 2 links (about 5 1/2 ounces) andouille sausage, chopped 1 tablespoon tomato paste Kosher salt 1 cup long-grain rice One 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1 teaspoon dried thyme Large pinch cayenne pepper 1/2 cup parsley leaves, roughly chopped Louisiana-style hot sauce, for serving Instructions: Make the shrimp broth: Remove the shells and tails from the shrimp and put the shells and tails in a medium saucepan. Clean and devein the shrimp and refrigerate until ready to use. Add the peppercorns, the intact onion piece, large celery chunks, 3 crushed garlic cloves and 2 bay leaves to the saucepan and cover with 5 cups of water. Bring to a high simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook until the water has reduced by about a third, 20 to 30 minutes. Let the broth cool completely and then strain (you should have about 3 cups. If you have less than 3 cups, add enough water to make up the difference). Make the jambalaya: Heat the oil in a large 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the flour and use a whisk to constantly stir until the mixture is toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the bell pepper, scallion whites, andouille, tomato paste, the chopped onion, celery and garlic, the remaining 2 bay leaves and 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes (add splashes of shrimp broth or water if the mixture sticks at all). Add the rice and stir to coat. Pour in the remaining broth, crushed tomatoes, thyme, cayenne, half the scallion greens and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Add the shrimp, cover and continue to cook until the rice is tender and the shrimp are cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove the bay leaves. Sprinkle the top of the jambalaya with the parsley and remaining scallion greens.

Remove from the heat, and let rest for 2 to 3 minutes, then pour into the cake pan, evenly coating the entire bottom. The caramel is extremely hot, so be careful when pouring it into the cake pan or molds. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the condensed milk, the milk, the lime juice and zest, orange liqueur, and vanilla. Simmer for 12 to 15 minutes, stirring throughout to combine flavors. In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and yolk together, then slowly temper into the milk mixture, constantly stirring the eggs into the warmed milk. Slowly incorporating the eggs will keep the eggs from scrambling. Pour milk mixture over the caramel in cake pan. Put the cake pan into a larger shallow vessel filled halfway up with water. Put the dish into the oven and bake for 40 to 50 minutes. Remove the flan from oven and let cool. Refrigerate the flan overnight. To remove the flan from the pan, put the pan into a shallow container with about 1-inch of warm water. Let sit for about 10 minutes, which will soften the caramel and make it easier to remove.

Let the pizza stone heat for at least 30 minutes. Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and then pulse to fine grains (resembling couscous) in a food processor. Measure 2 cups of the pulsed cauliflower and place in the center of a clean side towel along with 1 teaspoon salt. Wring the cauliflower of its liquid by twisting the side towel around the cauliflower and twisting with your hands to remove excess water. Combine the mozzarella, Parmesan, eggs and pepper in a medium bowl. Grate the garlic clove into the bowl and then add the cauliflower. Mix together until thoroughly combined. Spread the cornmeal in a circle on a half sheet of parchment. Form the cauliflower mixture into a ball, place it on the cornmeal and evenly spread into a 1/4-inch-thick round. Pinch the edges of the crust to form a rim. Using a pizza peel, transfer the parchment of cauliflower crust onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake for 15 minutes. For the toppings: Saute the merguez over medium-high heat until cooked through and browned, about 10 minutes. Toss the arugula in some olive oil and season with salt. Once the pizza has cooked for 15 minutes, spread it with harissa to the edges. Then evenly top with the goat cheese, merguez and some sliced olives. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes. When the cheese is melted and starting to bubble and brown, slide the pizza peel under the parchment and remove the pizza to a pizza pan. Let rest for a few minutes, then top with arugula and pecorino. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 69110,&quot;Chocolate Cherry Treats™ 2 cups Kellogg&#39;s?

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Pulse the flour, granulated sugar, gingerbread spice, baking powder and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter and pulse until the butter is thoroughly combined with the dry ingredients and the mixture looks sandy. Transfer to a large bowl.<br> Whisk together the molasses, vanilla, eggs and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl; stir into the flour mixture until a crumbly dough forms. Press together and knead into a moist, uniform dough.<br> Divide the dough in half and place on the prepared baking sheet. Shape the dough into two 10-by-2-inch logs, keeping 3 inches between the logs. If the dough is sticky, splash a couple drops of water on your hands and continue shaping. Bake until the outside is set but the inside is still slightly soft, about 30 minutes.<br> Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Transfer the logs to a cutting board and slice 1/2 inch thick on the bias with a serrated knife. Return the slices to the baking sheet, slat-side down, and bake, flipping the slices halfway through, until crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the biscotti to a wire rack to cool.<br> Once the biscotti are cool, combine the white chocolate and oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high in 30-second increments, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth, about 1 1/2 minutes total. Dip half of each biscotti at an angle in the white chocolate, letting the excess drip off. Return to the wire rack, then refrigerate until just set, about 5 minutes.<br> Pour the remaining white chocolate mixture into a small piping bag or resealable bag, then snip the tip or corner with kitchen shears to create a small hole. Drizzle the white chocolate at an angle across the dipped end of each biscotti, drizzling in the opposite direction to create a crisscross pattern. Return to the wire rack, then sprinkle with sanding sugar. Refrigerate until all the chocolate is completely set, about 10 minutes. The biscotti can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69161,&quot;Wrapped and Grilled Whole Striped Bass with Salsa 1/2 cup cracked black peppercorns 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 1 bunch cilantro leaves, chopped 1/2 cup olive oil 2 (1 1/2 pound) striped bass, cleaned, with heads and tails on 1 pound Roma tomatoes 6 to 8 garlic cloves, peeled 1 to 2 jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded if desired 1/2 yellow onion, peeled 1 teaspoon coarse salt Pinch of freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 avocado, diced 2 bunches collard greens, washed, untrimmed Instructions: Combine marinade ingredients in a glass or ceramic baking dish. Whisk to combine. Using a sharp knife, score several diagonal lines along the length of the fish, down to spine, on either side. Marinate 1 hour in the refrigerator. After marinating, preheat grill or broiler. Meanwhile, prepare salsa: Preheat the broiler. Place the tomatoes, garlic, chilies and onion on a baking tray. Tuck the garlic underneath the vegetables to avoid blackening. Broil, turning frequently, until well charred, 15 minutes. Set aside to cool. Transfer roasted ingredients to a food processor fitted with the metal blade or blender and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk in the olive oil and add the avocado. Set aside. Blanch greens in a large pot of boiling, salted water, just until the water returns to a boil. Refresh with iced water and drain. On a large baking sheet, arrange greens, overlapping to form 2 rectangles as long as each fish and more than twice as wide. Place each fish in the middle of each rectangle and wrap with greens so that only the head and tail are exposed. The dampness will make them cling. Transfer fish to grill, reserving marinade. Cook 7 to 8 minutes per side, until greens, head and tail blacken. It will take 2 spatulas, one at the head and one at the tail, to turn fish. Don&#39;t be concerned about greens sticking. To test for doneness, try to pull out a dorsal fin from the top of the fish. If it slides out easily, the fish is done. To serve, place whole fish on a serving platter. Using a dull knife and soup spoon, scrape off any remaining skin and remove fins. Cut along spine first and serve the top fillet. Lift tail, insert knife between bones and flesh, and run it along length. All (or most) bones should easily lift out. Repeat for second fish. Serve with the salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 69162,&quot;Salami and Gorgonzola Biscuits 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt 6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into small pieces 3/4 cup buttermilk 1/4 cup finely diced salami 2 tablespoons crumbled Gorgonzola Special equipment: 1-inch diameter cookie cutter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Churros: Put the flour into a bowl and stir in the baking powder, then beat in the olive oil and 1 cup freshly boiled water. Keep mixing until you have a warm sticky dough, and let rest for about 10 minutes or for as long as it takes for the corn oil to heat up. Heat the oil in a smallish saucepan; it should come about a third of the way up the sides of the pan. When you think it&#39;s hot enough, toss in a cube of bread and see if it sizzles and browns. If it browns in about 30 seconds, it&#39;s hot enough; or if you&#39;re using an electric deep-fat fryer regulate the temperature, it should be at 325 degrees F. Keep a watchful eye on your hot oil pan at all times. Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F. When you are ready, load up a piping bag with a large star shaped nozzle (8mm) and fill it with the churro dough. Squeeze short lengths, approximately 1 1/2 to 2 inches, of dough into the hot oil, snipping them off with a pair of scissors as you go. Cook about 3 or 4 at a time. Once they turn a rich golden brown, fish them out with a slotted spoon or tongs onto a kitchen towel lined baking sheet. To keep the churros warm while you fry the remaining dough. Blot them with paper towels and transfer them to a parchment lined baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the oven to keep the churros warm. Even if you let them sit out of the oven, they do need 5 to 10 minutes to rest before you eat them, to allow them to set inside. Chocolate sauce: Melt all of the chocolate sauce ingredients in a heavy based saucepan over low heat. Once combined and the chocolate has melted, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside in a warm place. Toss the hot churros into the sugar and cinnamon mixture and shake them about to get a good covering, just before serving. Arrange the churros on a serving platter and serve. Pour the chocolate sauce into individual pots for serving (to avoid the double dipping dilemma) and dip&#39;n&#39;dunk away. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinotage]&quot; 69192,&quot;Tempura Asparagus Vegetable oil, for frying 1 large box tempura batter mix 3 large bunches asparagus, tough ends trimmed off 3/4 cup soy sauce 1/3 cup mirin 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 2 scallions, thinly sliced Instructions: Pour 1-inch vegetable oil into a large, deep skillet.

Line two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment, then spray with nonstick baking spray. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the butter and coffee and mix on low speed until the butter \grabs\ a lot of the dry ingredients--otherwise you will have a poof of cocoa powder and flour to contend with! Turn the speed up to medium and mix until well blended, about 1 1/2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer to low and add the eggs one at a time, mixing just until each one gets incorporated. Scrape down the bowl, add the vanilla and mix a little longer, 10 to 15 seconds. Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool on racks for 10 to 15 minutes, then invert onto plastic wrap and wrap well. Place in the freezer for 8 hours or overnight. When ready to use, thaw at room temperature, still wrapped, for 1 hour before cutting. For the caramel Irish cream buttercream: Place the egg whites and sugar in a metal bowl and set over simmering water. Whisk constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is very thin and warm. Remove from the heat and pour the sugar mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer. Whip on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Turn to low speed and continue to whip until the bowl is cool to the touch.<br> Turn the speed to medium and beat in the chunks of butter. (The mixture may appear curdled at first, but continue beating and it will come together.) Add the vanilla extract, then the liqueur and a little bit of the dulce de leche until it achieves a creamy texture.<br> (If your buttercream has sat for a while and lost its creamy texture, re-beat it before using.) For the dark chocolate ganache: Place the chopped chocolate and cream in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high power for 1 minute. Stir thoroughly with a fork or whisk, then microwave on 50-percent power for 1 minute; stir again. If there are some chunks in there, allow to sit for a few minutes, then re-stir. If necessary, continue with one or two more 15-second intervals at 50-percent power, being careful not to overheat the mixture. Add the vanilla if using. Spray a piece of plastic wrap with nonstick spray, then cover the bowl, with the sprayed portion pressed directly against the surface of the ganache to prevent a skin from forming. Allow to sit until completely cool and set. Assemble the cake: Use a serrated knife to cut the cake layers horizontally into 4 layers total. Smear a little buttercream on a serving plate, then top with a cake layer. Spread some ganache on the first layer, then spread some buttercream about 1/4-inch-thick on top of the ganache. Spread some buttercream on a second cake layer, then invert it to top the cake layer on the serving plate (buttercream will face buttercream). Repeat with the remaining layers of cake, topping each layer with ganache and then buttercream, and covering with a layer spread with buttercream, buttercream-side down. Once you have topped the cake with the last cake layer, use an offset spatula to smooth out any icing squishing out of the sides of the cake. Coat the entire cake with a thin layer of ganache for a \crumb coat.\ Place the cake in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes to firm up. Ice the cake with the remainder of the buttercream. Serve right away, or keep chilled. Allow the cake to come to room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 69201,&quot;cl Relleno 4 pasilla chiles 1 pound queso fresco cheese Toothpicks 3 eggs 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1 cup oil 4 medium Roma tomatoes, halved 1 cup water 2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped 1 tablespoon chicken broth powder 1/4 cup oil 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon chopped oregano leaves Instructions: Rice and beans, for serving, if desired Heat grill to medium. Grill and char the chiles on both sides. Once blackened put in a plastic bag for 10 minutes to sweat out any moisture. Remove from the bag, slit them down the middle and remove the seeds.

Butter a deep 9 by 2-inch pie plate. Drizzle the crushed vanilla wafers with the melted butter and stir until blended. Press on the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate. Pop in the oven and bake until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 30 minutes. Toss the banana slices with the orange juice, making sure all the slices get coated. (This helps keep the bananas from browning.) Place the slices on a paper towel-lined plate and pat any excess juices dry. Arrange half the banana slices in a single layer over the cooled crust. Cover completely with the Chocolate Pudding, spreading it with an offset spatula or butter knife. Top with the rest of the bananas. Sprinkle the peanut brittle crumbs over the bananas. Place dollops of the Peanut Butter Cream on top, spreading it out evenly. Chill the pie in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Whip the cream until stiff peaks are just about to form. Whip in the almond extract and sugar until stiff peaks form. Take the pie out of the refrigerator. Place dollops of the whipped cream on top and spread it out evenly. Scatter pieces of peanut brittle on top and serve. Whisk the sugar, cocoa powder and flour in a bowl until there are no lumps. Crack the eggs into the bowl, add the yolks and whisk into a paste. Slowly whisk in 1 cup milk until it is fully incorporated, and then whisk in the remaining 1 cup milk. Put the milk mixture into a saucepan and put over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until it starts to look like pudding, 10 to 15 minutes. It will begin to bubble and it will hold soft peaks when you lift the whisk out. Take off the heat and cool to room temperature. Beat the cream cheese and confectioners&#39;sugar with an electric mixer until completely smooth. Add the vanilla and peanut butter, beating until fully incorporated. In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Working in batches, taking care not to deflate the whipped cream, fold a large spoonful of whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture. Fold in the remaining cream in 2 additions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69203,&quot;Roasting Pork Shoulder and Beef Chuck 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 1/4 pounds boneless pork shoulder roast 2 1/4 pounds boneless beef chuck roast Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Set aside. Combine the butter, shortening, brown sugar and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the molasses, vanilla and egg and beat on medium until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the sifted flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined into a smooth dough, about 1 minute. Form the dough into a flat square, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until just firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Meanwhile, make templates for the gingerbread house. Gather 3 sheets of stiff paper or 2 manila folders (split at the seam), scissors, a ruler and a pencil. For the side panels, draw and cut out a rectangle that measures 4 by 7 inches. For the front and back panels of a house with a peaked roof, draw and cut out a template that is 6 inches wide at the base, 4 inches to the roofline and 4 1/2 inches slanted to a peak. The template for the roof panels should measure 4 1/2 by 8 inches. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> Unwrap the dough and cut into 3 equal pieces (a pizza wheel is handy for this). Working with 1 piece of dough at a time and keeping the other pieces refrigerated, roll the dough into a rectangle 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Using the template, cut out the side panels and remove the scraps around the cutouts. Repeat with the remaining 2 pieces of dough, cutting out the front and back panels and 2 roof panels. If the dough gets too soft while rolling, return it to the refrigerator for 15 minutes before proceeding. (Discard the dough scraps or reroll to make cookies.) Chill the dough pieces on the prepared baking sheets for 15 minutes.<br> Bake the dough pieces until crisp almost all the way through (the very center will still be a little soft), 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans 10 minutes on a rack, then remove the house pieces to the rack to cool completely.<br> For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add the vanilla and 5 tablespoons water and beat on medium-high speed with an electric mixer, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed. Divide the icing between the 2 prepared piping bags (one fitted with a small plain tip and the other fitted with a large plain tip).<br> Decorate the side panels: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe icing to draw a window on 1 of the side panels; press nonpareils around the edges to line the window frame. Pipe icing onto the backs of 2 of the gummy candy canes and attach them on either side of the window. Attach a row of 8 of the chocolate-covered mints along the bottom by piping pea-size dots of icing onto the backs and pressing them on. Repeat with the second side panel. Let the panels rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the front panel: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe a double line of icing across the front panel where the roof starts to incline; press on 13 of the chocolate chips. Pipe a large dot of icing onto the back of 1 of the chocolate hearts and attach it to the panel just above the line of chocolate chips; outline the heart with icing. Pipe icing to draw a door; attach a nonpareil with a dot of icing to make a doorknob. Pipe icing to draw 2 windows; line the windows with nonpareils. Pipe icing onto the backs of the gummy penguins and attach 2 on either side of the door. Let the panel rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the back panel: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe a double line of icing across the back panel where the roof starts to incline; press on the remaining 13 chocolate chips. Pipe a large dot of icing onto the back of the remaining chocolate heart and attach it to the panel just above the line of chocolate chips; outline the heart with icing. Pipe icing to draw 2 windows; line the frames with nonpareils. Let the panel rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the roof panels: Pour half of the melted chocolate onto 1 of the roof panels; using an offset spatula, spread it to form a thin, even layer. Sprinkle the chocolate-coated roof panel with the chocolate curls. Repeat with the other roof panel. Refrigerate the panels for 15 minutes to let the chocolate set.<br> Assemble the walls: Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe a 6-inch line of icing on the foil-wrapped base (this will be for the front of the house). Press the front panel into the icing and pipe a line of icing along the inside of the panel at the base to reinforce it. Prop up the front with a can. Pipe a 7-inch line of icing perpendicular to the front panel. Pipe icing up the edge of 1 of the side panels. Press the side panel into the icing on the base and against the edge of the front panel, creating a corner. Pipe a line of icing along the inside of the panel at the base to reinforce it. Prop up the side with a can. Repeat the process with the second side panel and the back panel. Let the house rest until the icing is firmly set, at least 1 hour. Attach the roof: Gently test the walls to make sure the icing is set. If they give, let the house rest until firm. (If you add the roof too soon, the house will collapse.) Once the walls are set, remove the cans. Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe icing along the angled roof edges on 1 side of the house. Pipe icing on the unfrosted side of 1 of the roof panels along the 2 short edges (where the roof will attach to the slanted edges of the house). Press the panel onto the house and hold it in place until the icing sets, about 5 minutes. Repeat with the other side and the remaining roof panel. Let the roof rest until completely dry, 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Landscape the yard: Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe a rectangular icing walkway in front of the house; line the edges with the brown candy-coated chocolates and pave the middle with candy rocks. Pipe pea-size dots of icing onto the backs of the chocolate-covered raisins and press them in a row along the bottom of the back panel. Use the piping bag fitted with a large tip to pipe icing snowdrifts around the walkway and the base of the house. While the snowdrifts are still wet, sprinkle them with chocolate puffed cereal and snowflake sprinkles, pressing gently to help them adhere.<br> Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe icing along the top seam of the house where the roof panels connect; line with a row of the chocolate kisses. Let the house rest until dry. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]</p><p>These wines pair well with the rich flavors and textures of the chocolate gingerbread house due to their fruity and floral notes, moderate acidity, and tannins.

Make a well and add the eggs, olive oil and salt in the center. Using a fork, whisk the egg mixture, slowly incorporating the surrounding flour into the egg mixture until all the flour is mixed in. Use your hand to combine the rest of the dough. Knead, sprinkling extra flour on the work surface if the dough is sticking, until the dough is smooth and elastic and the center springs back when poked, about 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 1 hour. For the filling: Meanwhile, heat the spinach in the microwave just until the spinach is warm, about 1 minute. Strain the spinach, then place the spinach inside a clean kitchen towel and wring out all the excess liquid. Add the spinach to a bowl along with the mascarpone, mozzarella, salt, garlic powder and egg and mix to combine. Set a stand mixer pasta attachment or a table pasta roller attachment to the widest setting. Cut the dough in half and keep one half covered as you work with the other half. Flatten out the dough you are working with, adding a little bit of flour as you flatten. Feed the flattened dough through the pasta attachment once, catching the dough with the back of your hands. Add a little more flour and fold the pasta in thirds. Flatten the dough down and run it through the widest setting 2 more times. Then run the dough through each setting, decreasing the number each time you add the dough until you get to the thinnest setting. Your dough is now ready to be molded into raviolis. Cut the pasta sheet in half and drop teaspoon-size dollops of filling over the dough, spacing them 1 inch from the edges and 2 inches apart from each other. Brush water around the perimeter of the pasta. Place the other half layer of pasta on top. Press down and around the filling, taking care to get the air out and seal the filling in. Use a ravioli stamp to cut the pasta. Place each piece on a parchment lined pan. If you do not have a ravioli stamp, use a knife to cut squares around the filling and use the prongs of a fork to seal the pasta all the way around the filling. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Heat enough canola oil so that it comes to 2 inches up the side of a high-sided pan to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a rack. Dip each ravioli in the milk and shake off the excess. Dredge in the breadcrumbs and place back on the a parchment lined sheet pan. Fry in batches, without crowding the pan, around 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the oil using a spider or a slotted spoon. Place on the lined baking sheet to drain and immediately sprinkle with salt. For the creamy marinara dressing: Mix the marinara and ranch in a bowl, then set aside. For the salad: Combine the romaine, onion, tomato, olives and some Parmesan in a large bowl, then add a little dressing and toss to combine. Plate and add the desired amount of toasted raviolis, a drizzle of more dressing and more Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 69211,&quot;Oyster Carbonara 2 cups all-purpose flour Fresh cracked black pepper Kosher salt Canola oil for frying 8 oz. dried spaghetti 4 strips smoked good-quality bacon, diced 1 shallot, finely diced 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 12 shucked Louisiana oysters with liqueur 6 eggs, beaten and seasoned with salt and pepper 2 cups breadcrumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper 2 large egg yolks ? cup chicken stock 2 oz. Parmigiano-Reggiano Grated zest of 1 lemon Instructions: In a bowl combine flour, 10 grinds of pepper, and 2 tsp salt. Preheat the oil over medium heat to 350°F. Begin to cook spaghetti in a large pot of salted water according to package directions. Render the bacon slowly in a skillet over medium-low heat; when cooked, add the shallot and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Remove the oysters from the liqueur, trying to retain as much liquid as possible. Place the oysters in the flour and coat completely. Dip them in the beaten egg, and then place them in the breadcrumbs and coat completely. Fry the oysters in the oil until golden brown and crispy; set aside on a paper towel and season with salt. Whisk the egg yolks and chicken stock into the oyster liqueur. When the pasta is 1 minute away from being finished, remove it from the boiling water and place it in the skillet with the bacon. Add the liqueur/yolk mixture. Cook over medium low heat until the sauce thickens and coats the pasta. Grate in half of the Parmigiano, and toss to coat the pasta. Season with black pepper. Place the pasta in a bowl and the fried oysters around it. Grate the remaining Parmigiano over the entire dish.

The first is that you should try to get a mixture of different, tasty, local (if possible) tomatoes in all different shapes, sizes and colors. Second, the flavor is brought out by salting the tomatoes, so don&#39;t skip this bit. Some people get worried about putting this much salt on their food, but the bulk of it will drip off, leaving you with really beautiful, intensely flavored tomatoes. If you can get hold of some dried flowering oregano then do, as it has the most heavenly flavor. Feel free to use the dried stuff that you get in a little container, but it can taste a bit like sawdust when compared to the fruity, fragrant flavor you get from the flowering variety. Oregano is also great to grow in the garden. Depending on the size of your tomatoes, slice some in half, some into quarters and others into uneven chunks. Straightaway this will give you the beginnings of a tomato salad that&#39;s really brave and exciting to look at and eat. Put the tomatoes into a colander and season with a good pinch of sea salt. Give them a toss, season again and give a couple more tosses. The salt won&#39;t be drawn into the tomatoes; instead it will draw any excess moisture out, concentrating all the lovely flavors. Leave the tomatoes in the colander on top of a bowl to stand for around 15 minutes, then discard any juice that has come out of them. Transfer the tomatoes to a large bowl and sprinkle over the oregano. Make a dressing using 1 part vinegar to 3 parts oil, the garlic and the cl. Drizzle the tomatoes with enough dressing to coat everything nicely. This is a fantastic tomato salad, which is totally delicious to eat on its own. It&#39;s also great served with some balls of mozzarella or some nice, grilled ciabatta bread. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Butter six 6-ounce ramekins and then spray them with cooking spray; line the bottoms with rounds of parchment. Put the ramekins on a baking sheet and put in the oven to preheat. Assemble the ingredients from the box for making the cake-like brownies, but separate the eggs. Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks in a bowl with a mixer. In a separate bowl, add the brownie mix and mix in the water, oil and egg yolks. Mix in 1/2 cup of the whipped egg whites to thin the brownie batter. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Working quickly, evenly divide the batter among the preheated ramekins, filling them about halfway full (about 1/2 cup per ramekin). Bake until the tops of the cakes are set but the centers are still a little soft to the touch, about 14 minutes. Let sit for 5 minutes. Run an offset spatula around the edge of each cake and invert onto separate serving plates. Drizzle the plates with Sunny&#39;s 1-2-3 Berry Sauce, top each cake with a spoonful of whipped cream and garnish with a mint sprig. In a saucepot on medium-high heat, add the berries, sugar and lemon juice. Cook, stirring, until the berries begin to break down, the sugar dissolves and the liquid reduces slightly, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.

Line a 12-inch deep dish pizza pan or 10-inch cast-iron skillet with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk the flour, oatmeal, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together in a medium bowl and set aside. Beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until well combined, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until light in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until well incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips by hand using a rubber spatula. Press the dough into the prepared pan and arrange 12 to 15 peanut butter cups on the top, pressing flush into the dough. Bake until deep golden brown and set, 20 to 25 minutes for the pizza pan or 30 to 35 minutes for the skillet. Cool in the pan 10 minutes. If removing from the pan, invert the cookie onto a large plate and remove foil, then upright onto a cutting board. For the frosting: Beat the butter with the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk and vanilla extract until firm enough to pipe. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round or star tip. When the cookie has cooled, drizzle with melted chocolate if using, then decorate as desired with the frosting and finish with sprinkles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69221,&quot;Apfelstrudel (Classic Apple Strudel) 3 cups bread flour 1 egg 1/4 cup soft, unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup cold water Vegetable oil Bread flour 3/4 cups coarse white bread crumbs 1/2 cup, melted unsalted butter 1 1/2 pounds, 14 ounces peeled, cored and thinly sliced Granny Smith, Pippin or other cooking apples 1/3 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup dark raisins 3/4 cup coarsely crushed nuts 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 5 ounces firm, unsalted butter Instructions: To make the dough: Place the flour, egg, soft butter and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Mixing with the dough hook on low speed, add enough of the cold water to make a soft dough. Knead the dough in the electric mixer at medium speed until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Form the dough into a ball and coat it with oil. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 1 hour. For the filling: To make the coarse bread crumbs, toast slices of white bread in the oven until crisp, about 10 minutes. Break into pieces and place in a food processor. Pulse the processor until the bread resembles large bread crumbs. In a saute pan, over medium heat, saute the bread crumbs in 1/4 cup of the melted butter until they are golden brown. Reserve the sauteed bread crumbs and the remaining melted butter separately. Combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, raisins, nuts, ground cinnamon and about half of the bread crumbs. Cut the firm butter into chunks and gently toss together with the apple mixture. To Assemble: Cover a work surface approximately 4 feet by 4 feet with a clean piece of cloth. The cloth is used to facilitate stretching and rolling the dough. Make sure that the cloth is securely fastened to the table. Dust the cloth lightly with the flour. Place the rested dough in the center of the cloth. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a large, thin rectangle. When the dough is as thin as it will go with the rolling pin, it is time to begin stretching and pulling the dough. To stretch and pull the dough, place your hands under the dough, and, using your thumbs and the back of your hand, gently begin pulling and stretching the dough. Pull and stretch the dough until it is a rectangle approximately 3 1/2 feet by 2 1/2 feet. Be very careful when you are pulling and stretching not to tear the dough. After it is pulled to the proper size, let the dough relax on the table for a few minutes. There will be a thick edge around the edges, trim this away. You also want to trim off any parts of the dough that hang over the edges of the table. Place the apple filling next to the long edge of the dough closest to you. Form the filling into a thick log. Brush some of the reserved melted butter generously over the remainder of the dough. Sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs over the dough. Using the cloth to help lift the dough, roll the strudel as you would a jelly roll, starting from the filling side. Place the strudel, seam side down, in a horseshoe shape on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Brush the strudel with the last of the melted butter. Bake in a preheated 375 degree F oven for about 35 minutes, Remove the pan from the oven and cool. Slice the the strudel into individual servings and serve either warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 69222,&quot;Stuffed Avocado 2 avocados, diced 2 scallions, diced 1 cucumber, diced 4 radishes, diced fine 2 tablespoons tamari 2 teaspoons sesame oil 1/4 teaspoon garlic, minced 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast 1/2 cup bean or radish sprouts 1/2 teaspoon sesame meal AVOCADO SANDWICH 9 grain bread with sprouts, tomato and red onion GREEN GUACAMOLE Instructions: Cut avocados in half; remove pits and gently scoop out insides, leaving shell intact.

Pour half the water into the well, then add your yeast, sugar and salt and stir with a fork. Stage 2: Getting It Together Slowly, but confidently, bring in the flour from the inside of the well. (You do not want to break the walls of the well, or the water will go everywhere). Continue to bring the flour into the center until you get a stodgy, porridge-y consistency, then add the remaining water. Continue to mix until it&#39;s stodgy again, then you can be more aggressive, bringing in all the flour, making the mix less sticky. Flour your hands and pat and push the dough together with all the remaining flour. (Certain flours need a little more or less water, so feel free to adjust). Stage 3: Kneading! This is where you get stuck in. With a bit of elbow grease, simply push, fold, slap, and roll the dough around, over and over, for 4 or 5 minutes until you have a silky and elastic dough. Stage 4: First Proof Flour the top of your dough. Put it in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow it to proof in a warm, moist, draught-free place until doubled in size, about half an hour. This proof will improve the flavor and texture of your dough, and it&#39;s always exciting to know that the old yeast has kicked into action. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C/gas 4). Chop and mix all the ingredients for the filling and season well. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll into balls, using flour for dusting. Then roll into little frisbee shapes just over 1/4-inch (0.5 centimeter) thick. Place a good spoonful of your filling into the middle of each, brush the edges with a little water, then fold the rounds in half, pushing their edges to seal. Some people prefer to use a fork to do this but I just pinch them with my fingers. Dust with flour, do the same with all the others and move to a flour-dusted baking tray. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, then score the top of the bread to allow your filling to bubble over when cooking. Bake in your preheated oven for 20 minutes, until golden and scrumptious-looking, and allow to cool. Always good for picnics or as portable food. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 69224,&quot;Lollipop Pots Large swirled lollipops Assortment of different sizes and shapes of candy Assortment of different sizes and shapes of candy<br> Instructions: Glue floral foam to the bottom of pot.

Coat an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Combine the graham crackers, coconut, walnuts, condensed milk, chocolate chips and salt in a medium bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and press to the edges. Bake until the chocolate melts and the top is golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir the hot mixture in the pan until the chocolate is incorporated throughout. Press back out to the edges and set aside until cool enough to handle. Spread the confectioners&#39; sugar on a dinner plate. Scoop out the brownie mixture by the tablespoon and shape into balls. While still warm, roll each ball in the sugar to coat.

Put the juice, citrus halves, wine, water, honey, ginger, black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, star anise and bay leaf in a wide saucepot. Gently place the pears into the liquid. Make a circle of parchment paper that is 1/2-inch larger than the pot and cover surface completely with the parchment paper (see Cook&#39;s Note*). Make sure the pears are fully submerged but not touching the bottom of the pot. Bring the poaching liquid and pears to a boil, then reduce the heat to just below a simmer. Cook the pears until fork tender. Test for doneness by inserting a sharp knife in the base; there should be little resistance when fully cooked. Gently transfer pears to a glass or ceramic bowl. Pour enough poaching liquid over pears just to cover. Cover and refrigerate for several hours, preferably overnight; the longer the pears soak, the darker they will become. Strain remaining poaching liquid and return to saucepan. Cook over high heat until a syrupy consistency is achieved or the syrup coats the back of a spoon. Chill until the pears are served. Use a parisienne scoop to remove each pear&#39;s core, hollowing out a 1-inch wide cavity that starts at the base and extends 3/4 of the way up the pear. Transfer the Creamy Pistachio Nut Filling to a piping bag without a tip. Gently fill the pear cavity until it slightly overflows. (The overflow will help to provide a sticky surface to stand the pear up on.) Place the pear, base side down, in a bowl and surround with 1-ounce of the syrup. Serve. In a medium-sized bowl, cream the mascarpone, sugar, and vanilla together. Stir in the pistachio nuts. Use immediately or refrigerate and return to room temperature before filling the pears. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz/Syrah, Zinfandel, Barolo, Ribera del Duero]&quot; 69237,&quot;Indoor S&#39;mores 32 miniature graham crackers or 8 regular size graham crackers, broken in 1/2 2 milk chocolate bars, the kind that can be broken into squares 8 marshmallows Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Place the pig&#39;s foot in the center of the pan, with the smaller part of the foot down. Place the tomatoes along 1 side of the foot and the mushrooms along the other. Pour the pork stock and mushroom juice over the pig&#39;s foot and place the pan on the top rack of the oven. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, basting every 3 minutes, until the skin is crisp and golden and the center is hot (approximately 145 degrees F). Once the pig&#39;s foot is ready, place it on a plate and cut the butcher&#39;s twine. Serve with boiled potatoes, if desired. While you are doing this, let sauce cook over a high flame until slightly reduced. Add the vinaigrette base, salt, pepper, and haricots verts and stir to combine. Once you have added the vinaigrette, remove from heat or the emulsification will break. Dress the pig&#39;s foot with the sauce and sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Rinse the pig&#39;s foot under cold running water for 10 minutes and dry thoroughly. Use a spoon to stuff half of the pig&#39;s foot with the Stuffing. Liberally salt the foie gras and place it inside the pig&#39;s foot. Add the rest of the stuffing and pack tightly. Thread the butcher&#39;s twine through the needle and heat the tip of the needle over the candle; the hot needle will pass through the fat and skin more easily. Sew the pig&#39;s foot shut, tying it off at 1 end and then the other.<br> Bring the poaching liquid to a boil, add the pig&#39;s foot, and turn off the flame. Poach for 10 minutes or until pig&#39;s foot feels firm to the touch. Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to haze. Add 1 tablespoon of pork fat and the mushrooms, making sure mushrooms are in 1 even layer. Let the mushrooms sit in the pan, without movement, for 30 seconds or until a nice golden color forms. Toss the mushrooms and repeat until nicely colored. Sprinkle with salt and cook for 30 more seconds. Pour mushrooms into a sieve set over a plastic container and set aside. Deglaze the pan with a splash of water or white wine and pour over the mushrooms.<br> Reheat the pan over medium heat and add the rest of the pork fat. Add onions and rosemary, stirring constantly so as not to form any color. Sweat the onions until they become soft and translucent. At this point, add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Then add cubed pork meat and toss lightly until everything is combined; make sure the meat does not fall apart or you will lose some texture in the stuffing. Once everything is combined, add pig foot meat, season with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low. As the collagen in the foot meat begins to melt, add the reserved porcini mushrooms, reserving the liquid for the sauce. Stir occasionally until everything is combined and evenly seasoned. Transfer stuffing to a plate and place in the refrigerator to cool completely. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.<br> Using a boning knife, peel the skin of the shank away from the meat until you reach the ankle. Use a saw or a cleaver to cut the bone at the ankle.

Serve with the reserved BBQ sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 69275,&quot;Romesco Seafood Stew 2 dried pasilla or red New Mexico cl peppers or 1 ancho cl pepper, stemmed and seeded Water or chicken stock, to cover 1/4 cup dry Marcona almonds, toasted 1/4 cup blanched hazelnuts, toasted 1 tablespoon sweet or smoked sweet paprika 4 roasted piquillo peppers packed in water, drained well 2 slices (3/4-to-1-inch thick) stale good-quality white bread, diced 2 cloves garlic, grated or made into a paste 1 large or 2 medium very ripe tomatoes, grated on a box grater Splash of sherry vinegar (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/3 cup EVOO 1/4 cup EVOO, plus more for drizzling 1 1/2 pounds small white or yellow potatoes, chopped or quartered Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 small stalks celery, finely chopped 1 large fresh bay leaf 1 onion, finely chopped 1 small bundle fresh parsley, tied with kitchen string 1 cup dry white wine 2 cups chicken or seafood stock 24 small mussels or clams, scrubbed 12 ounces medium shrimp, peeled and deveined EVOO, for drizzling 4 slices Serrano ham 4 thick center-cut pieces cod or other sustainable white fish Sliced crusty bread, for serving Gremolata, recipe follows 1 clove garlic, halved 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves 2 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves stripped and chopped 1 anchovy fillet or anchovy in hot pepper 1 clove garlic, grated Zest of 1 lemon Instructions: For the romesco sauce: Toast the cl peppers in a small pot over medium heat, pressing them flat with a metal spatula and turning occasionally. Add enough water or stock to cover and simmer until the chiles are tender. Transfer the chiles to a food processor with a splash of the cooking liquid. Add the almonds, hazelnuts, paprika, piquillos, bread, garlic, tomato, vinegar and some salt and pepper. Turn the processor on and add the EVOO in a slow, steady stream until a thick, almost smooth sauce forms. For the stew: Heat the EVOO in a pot over medium to medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook until lightly browned, then add the celery, bay leaf, onions and parsley bundle and cook for 5 minutes. Deglaze with the wine, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Stir in the stock and romesco sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are just tender. For the seafood: Add the mussels and shrimp to the stew and cook, covered, until the mussels open and the shrimp are firm and opaque. Discard any unopened shells. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat a drizzle of EVOO in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Wrap the ham around the fish fillets, then add to the skillet and cook until crisp on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the fish is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the fish rest in the skillet. Meanwhile, char the bread in the oven. Divide the stew among shallow bowls. Place a piece of fish in the center and top with a spoonful of Gremolata. Rub the charred bread with the cut sides of the garlic clove and drizzle with EVOO; serve on the side. Cook&#39;s Notes: You can make extra romesco sauce and freeze it. Use it as a base for soup or for topping any grilled or roasted meat or seafood. The stew, without the seafood, can be covered and refrigerated for a make-ahead meal. Reheat over medium heat. Pile the parsley, thyme, anchovy, garlic and lemon zest on a cutting board and roughly chop together until well combined. &quot;,&quot;[Grenache, Tempranillo, Albari?o, Vermentino]&quot; 69276,&quot;Jammin&#39; Salmon Burgers 2 teaspoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 1/2 Vidalia onion, diced 2 eggs 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 lemon, zested 4 tablespoons Dill Mayonnaise, recipe follows 2 (6 1/2-ounce) cans Alaska skinless and boneless pink salmon, drained well 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil Hamburger buns 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 lemon, juiced 2 tablespoons freshly chopped dill leaves Pinch cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

In a small pot, heat about 1/2 cup of the extra-virgin olive oil with the crushed garlic, rosemary sprigs, and red pepper flakes. Let the oil infuse over low heat for a couple minutes. Meanwhile, arrange cooling racks over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Trim the tops and bottoms of the eggplants and thinly slice the eggplants and the tomatoes. Brush the eggplant with seasoned oil, using a pastry brush, and arrange the slices on 1 of the racks. Arrange the sliced tomatoes on the other rack and season both the eggplant and tomatoes with salt and pepper, to taste. Roast until the eggplant is tender and slightly shriveled up, about 15 minutes. While the eggplant and tomatoes roast, add the basil, parsley, nuts, Parmigiano, and salt and pepper, to taste, in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. With the processor running, stream in about 1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil to form a thick pesto. Arrange about 1/2 cup of arugula leaves on each sub roll bottom. Top with layered slices of roasted eggplant, mozzarella, and roasted tomatoes. Spread some pesto on the roll tops and set in place. Cut the subs in half and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]</p><p>&quot; 69278,&quot;Brown Sugar Shortbread 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened at room temperature 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons granulated sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 10 by 14 1/2-inch sheet pan (with sides) with parchment or waxed paper. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter until soft and smooth. Add the brown sugar and mix until incorporated. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour and cornstarch. Add to the butter mixture and mix at low speed just until the ingredients are incorporated and the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead it 5 to 10 times, just to smooth the dough. Reflour your work surface. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to fit the sheet pan. To transfer to the sheet pan, roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, lift it up, and unroll into the pan. Using light strokes of the rolling pin, roll the dough evenly into the corners and edges of the pan, and roll out any bumps. (Or, press the rolled-out dough thoroughly into the pan with your fingers.) Prick the shortbread all over with a fork to prevent any buckling or shrinking. Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, rotate the pan and knock it once against the oven rack, to ensure even cooking and a flat surface. Bake 10 to 15 minutes more, until very lightly browned. Immediately sprinkle the granulated sugar evenly over the surface. Let cool 10 minutes, then cut into 1 1/2 by 3-inch bars. Let cool completely in the pan, then store in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 69279,&quot;Grilled Prosciutto Wrapped Figs Stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce 24 Black Mission figs, cut in half lengthwise 2 cups balsamic vinegar 2 pounds gorgonzola dolce Crushed red pepper flakes 48 slices prosciutto Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat the grill to medium-high. Drizzle each fig half with vinegar and fill each fig center with 1 tablespoon of the cheese. Sprinkle a couple flakes of crushed red pepper on top of the cheese and wrap each fig with a slice of prosciutto. Paint the outside of each fig very lightly with olive oil. Put the figs on the grill. The idea here is that we want to grill the figs gently to cook the fig all the way through but to still get the char on the outside. Grill the figs on all sides so the prosciutto is starting to become crispy and the fig feels soft when squeezed, 5 to 6 minutes. Drizzle a couple of drops of balsamic on each and serve. It&#39;s figgy delicious! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 69280,&quot;Shrimpylicious Egg Rolls 4 cups (about 1/2 of a 12-ounce bag) dry coleslaw mix 4 ounces cooked and chopped ready-to-eat shrimp 1/2 cup canned sliced water chestnuts, drained and cut into strips 1/2 cup canned sliced water chestnuts, drained and cut into strips<br> 1/4 cup bean sprouts, chopped 2 scallions, chopped 1 stalk celery, thinly sliced widthwise 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium or lite soy sauce 1 teaspoon crushed garlic 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/8 teaspoon salt Dash black pepper 6 large square egg roll wrappers* Sweet and sour sauce, for optional dipping Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Put slaw mix in a large microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons of water, cover, and microwave for 2 minutes. Drain any excess water from the bowl. Add all of the other ingredients except the wrappers and optional sauce, mix well, and set aside. For a more intense flavor, allow the mixture to marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Prepare a large baking sheet by spraying it lightly with nonstick spray. Place an egg roll wrapper on a clean, dry surface. Evenly distribute about 1/2 cup of the mixture onto the wrapper, in a row a little below the center. Moisten all four edges by dabbing your fingers in water and going over the edges smoothly. Fold the sides of each wrapper about 3/4 inch towards the middle, to keep the mixture from falling out of the sides. Then, roll the bottom of each wrapper up around the mixture, and continue rolling until you reach the top. Seal the outside edge with another dab of water. Carefully transfer egg roll to the baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining wrappers and filling, making sure you have a clean, dry surface each time. Spray the tops of the egg rolls with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Allow them to cool slightly. If you like, dip the egg rolls in some sweet and sour sauce! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69281,&quot;Spaghetti with Oil, Garlic and Spices Water, for boiling pasta 1 pound spaghetti 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh oregano 2 teaspoons dried oregano 2 tablespoons dried parsley 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon red cl pepper flakes Parmesan, to taste Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the spaghetti.

Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Scoop out half of the onion and set aside. Add the broth and potato, partially cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for 20 minutes.<br> The blossoms: While the broth is simmering, clean the squash blossoms: break off the stems, then the little green sepals that come out from the base of the blossoms (they originally covered the buds). Use your fingers to break loose the long pistils in the center of each flower and discard. With a very sharp knife, cut the blossoms cross-wise into 1/4-inch strips, including the bulbous base.<br> Add half the blossoms to the broth and simmer 3 minutes. In a food processor or in batches in a loosely covered blender (or using an immersion blender), puree the mixture; return to the pot.<br> The chiles: Roast the chiles directly over the gas flame, on a medium-hot gas grill, or 4 inches below a very hot broiler. Turn occasionally, until blistered and blackened on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes for the flame or grill, about 10 minutes for the broiler. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand about 5 minutes. Peel off the charred skin, cut out the seed pod, then quickly rinse to remove straggling bits of skin and seeds. Cut into 1/4-inch dice.<br> Finishing the soup: Add the chiles to the soup along with the milk and reserved onion; bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Add the zucchini and corn, simmer a couple of minutes, then add the remaining squash blossoms. Simmer a couple of minutes longer (the strips of blossom will soften into deep-golden \streamers), remove from the heat, stir in the cream, taste, and season with salt.

Cut the phyllo pastry in half lengthwise so that you have 2 (5 1/2-inch) wide pieces of dough. Keeping the piles of dough covered with a damp tea towel, lay one sheet of phyllo out on a lightly floured surface, brush it with a little melted butter, and place another sheet on top of it, staggered bu 1/2-inch to the left. Repeat until you have 4 layers of phyllo, staggering each by 1/2-inch, and then repeat the process to make a second identical pile. Spread half the goat cheese mixture in a line 1/2-inch in from one long inner edge of each phyllo pile. Next to the strip on the inside, make a long line of half the shredded crab meat. Distribute half the grilled onions and asparagus next to the crab, brush the long edge and the 2 short edges of the phyllo with meted butter and roll up the strudels tightly from left to right, squeezing the edges to seal them. Place the 2 strudels seam-side down on a baking sheet and brush the outside of each strudel with more melted butter. Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and, if desired, refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Roast the bell peppers over a gas flame, or on a tray under a hot broiler, turning so that the skin is evenly charred without burning and drying out the flesh. transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. The easiest way to peel them is to pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits. Do not peel them under running water since that will wash away flavorful juices. Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds, and veins. In a blender, process the flesh to a smooth puree. You should have about 1 cup of puree. In a medium mixing bowl, combine red pepper puree with the lime juice, sour cream, paprika, salt, and pepper to taste. Blend together well and refrigerate, covered, until needed. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and bring the sauce to room temperature. Bake the strudels in the hot oven for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are crisp and golden. Remove them to a cutting board, rest for 5 minutes, and slice off and discard or eat the very ends of the strudels. Slice each strudel into 3 equal lengths and slice each length into 3 spirals. Make a little pool of the red pepper sauce on each of 6 plates and place 3 spirals, cut side up, on the sauce. Garnish with a leaf of lettuce and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 69290,&quot;Squash, Bell Pepper and Scallion Soup 2 tablespoons bacon drippings or olive oil 1 cup sliced scallion, white and light green parts only 1 cup chopped peeled potato 3 to 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1 medium clove garlic, minced Pinch of cayenne pepper, plus more, for serving Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 1/2 cups vegetable broth 2 cups sliced yellow squash 1 cup chopped yellow bell pepper Sour cream and chopped fresh cilantro, for serving Instructions: Heat the drippings or oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the scallion and cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.

Add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent and very soft, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, oregano and red pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the tomato paste deepens in color, about 4 minutes. Add the wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the liquid mostly evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add the crushed and diced tomatoes, 2 teaspoons salt and several grinds of black pepper. Rinse out each tomato can with 1/2 cup of water and add it to the sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until reduced by about one-fourth and thickened, about 1 hour. Blend the sauce with an immersion blender until smooth. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and stir in the basil. Set aside (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> For the eggplant: Arrange the eggplant slices on a rack set over a baking sheet and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt. Set aside to draw moisture out from the eggplant, flipping them over halfway through, about 30 minutes.<br> Combine the matzo meal, thyme, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk the eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper together in another shallow bowl.<br> Blot the eggplant slices very dry on both sides with paper towels. Working one slice at a time, dip the eggplant into the egg mixture, allowing excess to drip back into the bowl, then dredge it in the matzo mixture, pressing gently to coat. Place coated slices back on the rack and repeat with the remaining eggplant.<br> Pour enough oil into a large skillet to reach a depth of about 1/4 inch and heat over medium-high heat until very hot and shimmering and a slice of eggplant immediately sizzles as when it touches the oil. Working in batches, fry the slices until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Place cooked eggplant back on the rack to drain and season lightly with salt while hot. Repeat until all the eggplant is fried.<br> For the ricotta filling: In a medium bowl, stir the ricotta, Parmesan, egg, basil, garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper together. Refrigerate until ready to assemble the lasagna. To assemble the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray all sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan or casserole dish at least 2 1/2 inches deep with nonstick spray. Set aside 3/4 cup of the tomato sauce, 3/4 cup of the ricotta filling and 1 1/2 cups mozzarella.<br> Spread 1 cup tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of the dish. Top the sauce with full sheets of matzo, then break others to fit as needed. Spread 3/4 cup ricotta filling evenly over the matzo with a small offset spatula. Layer one-third of the eggplant over the ricotta, top with one-third of the mozzarella and top with one-third of the remaining sauce. Repeat the layers of matzo, ricotta, eggplant, mozzarella and sauce two more times. Add a final layer of matzo, then spread with the reserved 3/4 cup ricotta, the reserved 3/4 cup sauce and sprinkle with the 1 1/2 cups reserved mozzarella and 3 tablespoons Parmesan.<br> Spray a piece of foil large enough to fit over the baking dish generously with nonstick spray and cover the baking dish tightly. Place on a baking sheet and bake until the matzo is soft and the sauce is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the mozzarella is lightly browned in spots, 15 to 20 minutes longer.

Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Using your hands or a pastry blender, rub the butter into the dry ingredients by breaking it into tiny pieces, continuously pinching and squeezing it into the dry ingredients. Be careful to keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to the bottom of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Beat the egg(s) in a small bowl and pour over the flour and butter mixture. Stir in with a fork, continuing to stir until the dough begins to hold together, but still appears somewhat dry. Scatter flour on the work surface and scrape the dough onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth. To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl.

Extra Virgin Olive Oil, plus more for brushing and drizzling 3 cups All-Purpose Flour 1 tsp. Salt 1 cup Warm Water 1 package Johnsonville? Hot or Mild Italian Sausage Links 1/2 cup Prepared Pesto 1 cup Fresh Mozzarella, sliced 1/2 cup Roasted Red Peppers, sliced 1/2 cup Roasted Green Peppers, sliced 2 Tbsp. Extra Virgin Olive Oil Salt &amp; Pepper 1 cup Micro Greens, Pea Shoots or other Baby Greens 1/2 bunch Basil, torn 1 Medium Red Onion, wedged 1 cup Shiitake Mushrooms, stems removed. Instructions: Preparation instructions: Prepare the dough: Whisk 1 cup warm water (about 105 degrees F) and the sugar in a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast over top. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in olive oil. Whisk the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, pour in the yeast mixture and stir to make a shaggy dough. Place dough on a floured surface and knead about 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic, adding just enough flour to prevent it from sticking. Form into a ball, place in a large oiled bowl, turning to coat with the oil. Turn seam-side down and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature about 1 hour, 30 minutes, until doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat a grill to medium high (if using a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side) and grill the toppings. Add vegetables to grill, cook until tender or: Onion: Cut 1 medium red onion into 8 wedges. Toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning, until soft, about 10 minutes; slice. Mushrooms: Toss 8 oz. stemmed shiitake mushrooms with 3 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning, until soft, about 2 minutes per side; cut in half. Remove and arrange the grilled vegetables on a baking sheet, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil. Add the remaining toppings to the baking sheet; place near the grill. Grill Sausage, remove and coin slice. Reduce the grill heat to medium-low (on a charcoal grill, spread the coals into a single layer and let cool until they are covered in a light gray ash). Divide the dough in half and dust the dough and work surface with flour. Roll each piece into a 7 x 12\ rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. Brush baking sheet with olive oil and place both crusts on it. Lift each piece by the corners and place on the grill, oiled-side down; cook about five minutes until the dough puffs and the underside is stiff and marked. Flip the dough with tongs, brush with olive oil, spread with the pesto sauce and top with mozzarella. Arrange the grilled vegetables and sliced sausage on top. Cover and cook about five more minutes or until the cheese melts. Remove pizzas from grill and transfer the pizzas to a cutting board. Top with the greens, basil, a drizzle of olive oil and salt.

Reserve the zest, juice the oranges and strain the juice into a small saucepan. Add the zest, salt, bourbon, sugar, peppercorns, tea bags, cloves, bay leaves and 1 quart (4 cups) of water. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes. Pour the brine into a plastic container or pot large enough to hold the turkey, add 5 quarts (20 cups) ice water and stir to combine. Submerge the turkey, adding more ice water if needed. Weight it down with a plate to keep it submerged and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. Drain, rinse and pat the turkey dry. Place on a large paper-towel-lined cutting board and let sit out at room temperature until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour. Mix the butter, Dijon, spicy brown mustard and honey in a medium bowl until well combined. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Pat the turkey skin dry again and rub the honey-mustard butter evenly over the surface, also pushing some underneath the skin of the breasts. Lay the turkey in a large roasting pan as flat as possible. If the pan is a bit small, tuck the wings behind the back with the drumsticks resting on the ledge of the pan and place a large rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil at the bottom of the oven to catch drippings. Roast, basting the turkey with the pan drippings every 30 minutes or so, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.

Using a paring knife, cut a 3-inch wide pocket, about 2-inches deep, into the side of each tenderloin. Season the cavity with salt and pepper. Stuff 1 slice of prosciutto, 1 slice of cheese, and 2 basil leaves into each pocket. Tie 1 piece of kitchen twine at each end and 1 piece in the center of each tenderloin to secure the filling. Season the stuffed tenderloins with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat, add the tenderloins and sear until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the tenderloins to an oiled baking pan. Roast for 8 to 10 minutes or until the internal temperature registers 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare. Place the skillet over high heat, add the Marsala wine, and cook for 1 minute, scraping the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
