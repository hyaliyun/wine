Remove from the heat. Beat the egg yolks and sugar on medium-high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, sprinkle on the cornstarch. Beat on medium-low speed until combined, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture back into the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes. (Pay attention because it will thicken and then quickly become orange scrambled eggs!) Immediately, pour the mixture through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Stir in the vanilla, Grand Marnier, butter, and heavy cream. Place plastic wrap directly on the custard and refrigerate until cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31889,&quot;Antipasto Pie 1 (12-inch) round or oval, crusty, chewy bread, such as Tuscan-style or a sesame semolina 1 (14 to 16-ounce) jar giardiniera*, drained 1/2 pound thinly sliced sharp provolone 1 (14 to 16-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, or 2 fresh roasted red bell peppers, see note 1 (14-ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts in water, drained 1 (12-ounce) bag mixed salad greens, any variety 1/2 cup (a couple of handfuls) fresh Italian flat leaf parsley leaves 15 to 20 leaves fresh basil, torn 1/3 pound sliced Genoa salami 1/3 pound sliced sweet soppressata 1/3 pound sliced cappacola (hot cured pork shoulder) 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced 1 vine-ripe tomato, thinly sliced Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Coarse salt and pepper 8 hot or sweet pickled cherry peppers Instructions: 8 (8,10 or 12-inch) bamboo party skewers Serving suggestions: green and black olives, herb flavored potato chips</p><ul><li>Giardiniera is a Italian pickled salad of cauliflower, hot peppers and carrot found in International Foods aisle of market Cut the top off of a large round or oval bread and hollow it out leaving a half inch rim and bottom to your bread. The loaf should resemble a bowl or deep pie shell. Pulse the giardiniera in a food processor into a coarse relish. Spread and press relish into the bottom of your bread shell in an even layer. Top relish with a layer of provolone slices, red pepper pieces, and artichoke hearts. Press ingredients down as you work to make room in your shell for as much antipasto as possible. Combine mixed greens, parsley, and basil in a bowl. Add a thin layer of greens on top of artichokes, and drizzle with oil. Layer in meats and remaining cheese. Top with a few more greens, onion and tomato slices, and another drizzle of oil. Season the top of filled shell with salt and pepper. Bag up remaining unused greens and herbs for tomorrow night&#39;s salad. Replace top of bread and wrap your GIANT, drip-less antipasto stuffed pie for travel. When you are ready to serve, spear hot or sweet cherry peppers on 10 or 12-inch bamboo skewers and space eight skewers equidistant around the bread. Cut bread into wedges, like a pie, and serve with olives and fancy potato chips. Note: to roast peppers, split each red bell pepper down the center and gut them by scooping out seeds with a tug using your cupped hand. Place peppers skin-side-up under broiler preheated to high. Leave oven door ajar for steam to escape and blacken peppers entirely. Place charred peppers into a paper bag and roll the bag up tightly. Let stand 5 minutes until peppers are cool enough to handle and peel off charred skins. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 31890,&quot;Tiramisu Italiano 7 egg yolks 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup sweet marsala, plus 2 tablespoons 8 ounces mascarpone, softened to room temperature 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup brewed espresso coffee 1 ounce dark chocolate 1/4 cup rum 1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract 48 ladyfingers 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder Instructions: Cream together egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Add 1/3 cup of the marsala and continue to whisk until mixture is thick and doubled in volume. This is basically a zabaglione. Remove from heat. Stir in the mascarpone until completely blended. In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks. Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture, to lighten. In a small saucepan, combine espresso, chocolate, rum, vanilla, and remaining 2 tablespoons marsala. Heat gently, and stir to dissolve the chocolate. Then, chill the mixture to cool it down, about 15 minutes. Quickly dip each ladyfinger in the chilled coffee mixture and arrange in a single layer on a 9 by 13-inch glass baking pan. Do not soak the cookies or they will become too moist. Spread 1/2 the mascarpone cream evenly with a spatula on top of the dipped ladyfingers. Repeat with a second layer of dipped ladyfingers and remaining mascarpone cream. Sprinkle top with cocoa powder. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]</li></ul><p>&quot; 31891,&quot;Mashed White and Sweet Potatoes with Parsley Butter 3 pounds red or white potatoes, peeled and cut into large dice Kosher salt 2 bay leaves<br> 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 7 tablespoons salted butter<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> Freshly cracked black pepper<br> Two 15-ounce cans sweet potato puree, such as Farmer&#39;s Market Organic brand<br> 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped<br> Instructions: Place the potatoes in a large stockpot and cover with water. Generously season the water with salt. Add the bay leaves and place over high heat. Cover, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender enough to smash with a fork, 25 to 35 minutes. Drain the potatoes and discard the bay leaves. Return the potatoes to the pot and add the heavy cream, sour cream and 4 tablespoons of the butter. Smash with a potato masher until smooth. Add the thyme, nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Place the sweet potato puree in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover and heat until warmed through, about 4 minutes. When ready to serve, mound a third of the white potatoes in the center of a serving bowl. Next, mound a third of the sweet potatoes on top of the white potatoes. Repeat this process, alternating between the vegetables, to make white and orange circles. Swirl together to create a marbled effect showing both colors. In a small pot, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Combine the butter and parsley. Pour over the potatoes and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 31892,&quot;Broiled Chokes 8 whole artichokes Acidulated water: 6 cups water with juice of 4 lemons 1/4 cup olive oil 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper 1/2 bunch parsley 1/2 cup packed fresh basil 1/2 bunch fresh thyme 1/2 cup packed fresh oregano 1/2 orange, zested 1 whole dried arbol cl 1 teaspoon whole black pepper corns 2 cups canola oil 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to broil setting. Cut the top 1/4 off the choke and snap off the outer leaves until you reach pale green, soft leaves. Using a spoon, remove the hairy choke from the center and discard. Immediately plunge in acidulated water to avoid discoloration. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Drain the artichokes and spin to dry. Toss in a bowl with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Lay the chokes out on a sheet pan lined with foil and place on the lower rack of the oven, and broil for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip the artichokes and return to the oven for 3 minutes. Eat as they are or marinate in herb oil for up to 2 days. Herb oil: In a 1-quart mason jar, place all of the herbs, zest, cl, and peppercorns.

Set aside. Mix the dry: In a large bowl, add flour and a pinch of salt.<br> Pull it together: Make a well in the center of the bowl of the dry ingredients and whisk in the beer until combined. It should be slightly thicker than pancake batter. Gently fold in the apple mixture and let it rest 10 minutes at room temperature.<br> Fry the fritters: In a large pot, bring oil temperature to 360 degrees F, so when adding the fritters, the temperature rests at 350 degrees F. Once the oil is ready, using a small ice cream scoop or large tablespoon, gently drop the dough into the oil in batches. Fry until golden brown on both sides, flipping once, about 4 minutes total. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate. Serve with Peanut Butter Caramel Sauce. Melt the sugar: In a saute pan over medium heat, add the brown sugar and allow it to melt while whisking. Melt the butter: Once melted, add the butter and continuously whisk while melting until everything is smooth.<br> Add the cream: Turn off the heat and slowly pour in the heavy cream while whisking until smooth. (Don&#39;t get hit with the splatter!)<br> Add the peanut butter: Add the peanut butter and turn the heat back on to low to help it melt into the caramel sauce while whisking for just under a minute. Remove from the heat, serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 31895,&quot;Grandma Guarnaschelli&#39;s Lasagna Appetizer 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 medium yellow onions, minced<br> 8 large cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Kosher salt<br> Two 28-ounce cans peeled whole tomatoes<br> 1 bay leaf<br> Kosher salt 1 pound dried lasagna sheets<br> 1 pound whole-milk mozzarella, shredded<br> 1 pound Parmesan, finely grated<br> 1 cup tightly packed fresh basil leaves<br> Balsamic vinegar, for drizzling<br> Chopped fresh Italian parsley, for topping<br> Instructions: For the tomato sauce: Heat the olive oil in a medium pot, then add the onions, garlic and red pepper flakes and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden. Add the tomatoes and bay leaf, bring to a simmer and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Season to taste, then discard the bay leaf. For the pasta: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Stir in a generous handful of salt and add the lasagna sheets. Cook, stirring so they don&#39;t stick together, until still very firm to the touch, about 4 minutes, then drain and rinse under cold water. Separate the sheets carefully so they don&#39;t stick together. Spoon a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of an 8-inch square baking pan. Arrange a layer of the pasta sheets over the sauce. Sprinkle some of the mozzarella, Parmesan and basil leaves over the pasta, then add another layer of sauce. Repeat the layering process 2 more times, ending with pasta and cheese. Cover the baking pan tightly with aluminum foil and place in the center of the oven. Bake for 45 minutes, then raise the temperature of the oven to 450 degrees F and remove the aluminum foil. Bake until the top browns slightly, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes, then cut into squares. Drizzle with the balsamic and top with chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]&quot; 31896,&quot;Mexican Street Corn 4 ears sweet corn, husks removed 2 tablespoons corn oil 1/2 cup Hidden Valley?

Using a mandolin (or sharp knife), slice the cucumbers 1/4-inch thick and place in a large heat-safe bowl or container. Once the mixture boils, pour the liquid over the sliced cucumbers, making sure the cucumbers are submerged. Let the cucumbers sit in the liquid as it comes to room temperature, for about 20 minutes. Drain the pickles and reserve the liquid. Serve as is or fry em&#39; up! To serve, add a little of the pickling juice right on top of the pickles. Cook&#39;s Notes: Reserve your pickling liquid to use on the pickles later or as a vinegary addition to sauces. The longer the pickles sit in the liquid the softer they become, so for me 20 minutes is perfect. This pickling liquid is great to pickle a variety of vegetables, try carrots, one of my favorites. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31900,&quot;Hydrated Raisins 1 cup raisins Water, as needed 1/2 cup dark rum or flavored liqueur Instructions: Place the raisins in a mixing bowl or glass jar and add water so that it covers the raisins by at least 1/2-inch. Stir in the rum or flavored alcohol. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 24 hours. It is even better to allow the raisins to hydrate for 2 to 3 days. They will become very plump as they absorb the liquid. You can keep them in the refrigerator for a few weeks. When you are ready to use them, strain the amount that you need through a fine-mesh sieve before adding them to the recipe. &quot;,&quot;[Port, Sherry, Madeira, Moscato]&quot; 31901,&quot;Sausage-Stuffed Zucchini Boats 4 medium zucchini, cut in half lengthwise 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 8 ounces sweet loose Italian sausage<br> 8 ounces hot loose Italian sausage<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 1 small onion, chopped<br> 2 medium vine-ripened tomatoes, chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup Parmesan, finely grated<br> 1/2 cup mozzarella, shaved<br> 1/4 cup breadcrumbs<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Line a baking sheet with foil. Cut the stem end off the jalapenos, cut each in half lengthwise and remove and discard the seeds (wear food-grade gloves if your skin is sensitive). Arrange the jalapenos skin-side up on the prepared baking sheet, and brush with the oil. Broil until the peppers are blackened and puffy, 3 to 4 minutes. When cool enough to handle, rub off the skins (running under cold water helps). Cut 2 of the halves into large dice so you have 32 pieces (1 for the top of each biscuit); set aside. Finely chop the rest of the peppers, and transfer to a medium bowl. Switch the oven from broil to bake, and preheat to 400 degrees F. Remove the foil from the baking sheet, and line it with parchment. Beat the egg well in a small bowl. Add the cream cheese, mozzarella and half the egg to the bowl with the chopped peppers, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and mix to combine. Separate the biscuit rounds, and cut each into quarters. Make a deep indentation in the center of each quarter, and fill with a heaping teaspoon of the pepper-cheese mixture (it will mound above the biscuit a fair amount). Brush any exposed biscuit with the remaining beaten egg. Bake until the biscuits are puffed and golden around the top, 10 to 12 minutes.

If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, espresso powder, salt and 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Place on the direct-heat side of the grill and bring to a gentle simmer. Remove from the grill. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar until smooth. Slowly stream half of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Pour the mixture back into the pot of milk and whisk to combine. Place the pot over the indirect-heat side of the grill and cook, stirring with a rubber spatula and scraping the bottom and sides of the pot until the pudding has thickened and small bubbles form on the surface, about 5 minutes. (You may have to move the pot on and off the heat while cooking so that the mixture cooks and thickens but the eggs do not scramble.) Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the mascarpone, butter and vanilla paste. Pour the pudding into a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap touching the surface. (This will prevent a pudding skin from forming.) Chill for 1 to 2 hours or up to overnight.

Let them stand for a couple of hours until husks are pliable. To make the dough: Beat the lard in a mixer until very light, for about a minute. Add 1/2 pound (1 cup) fresh masa to lard. Beat until well blended. Continue beating, adding alternately the remaining 1/2 pound masa and the poultry broth, adding only enough broth to give consistency of medium-thick cake batter. Then sprinkle in the baking powder and salt. Beat 1 minute more. To make the salsa: Husk and wash the tomatillos. Put the tomatillos and 3 Serrano chiles and some salt in a pot of water and boil them until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Then drain them and put them in the bowl of a food processor. Add the coriander, onion, and garlic. Process until smooth. Heat 1 tablespoon lard in a medium large skillet over medium-high heat. When the lard is hot enough to make a drop of the tomatillo puree sizzle, pour it all in at once. Stir the sauce constantly for 4 to 5 minutes until it gets darker and thicker...thick enough to coat a spoon. Add the chopped tomatillos and cilantro. Season with salt. Mix the shredded chicken with 1/2 cup cooked tomatillo sauce. To form the tamales: Remove husks from water when they have softened. Pat husks dry. Tear extra husks into 1/4-inch wide, 7-inch long strips -- one for each tamale. Take one that is at least 6 inches across on wider end and 6 to 7 inches long. Lay out this cornhusk with tapering end toward you. Spread a couple of tablespoons of dough mixture into a square, leaving at least a 1 1/2-inch border on side toward you and 3/4-inch border along other sides. Pick up two long sides of cornhusk and bring them together, overlapping one over the other. Fold up the bottom section of husk tightly right up to the filling line. Leave top open. Secure it in place by loosely tying one of strips of husk around tamale. Repeat with remaining husks and dough mixture. Stand tamales on the folded bottom in prepared steamer, being sure they are not packed too closely in steamer -- they need to expand. Cover with layer of leftover husks. Cover with lid and steam for 1 hour. Check carefully that all the water doesn&#39;t boil away, adding boiling water when necessary. Serve with additional salsa on the side.

For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (The grill should be around 400 degrees F. Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer\u2019s guide for the best results.) Slice the zucchinis down the middle, lengthwise like a hotdog, so that you have 4 long, equal pieces of zucchini. Use a teaspoon to remove the flesh of the zucchini, being sure to leave a 1/4-inch border and to not pierce the bottom of the zucchini. Finely chop 1/2 cup of the zucchini flesh and discard or save the remainder for another use. Place the chopped zucchini flesh into a clean kitchen towel and wring out as much liquid as possible. Place the zucchini flesh into a medium liquid measuring cup or bowl. Flip the zucchini boats over so that the peel side is facing up and brush all four pieces with olive oil. Season the peel side with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then flip over and season the flesh side with another 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the Cheddar, Havarti, chives, cream, eggs, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper to the liquid measuring cup or bowl with the zucchini flesh. Whisk until well combined. Pour the mixture into the cavity of each zucchini boat. Using both hands to lift the zucchini carefully, place the filled boat in the middle of the grill over indirect heat (where the burner is turned off), cover, and cook until the eggs have puffed up slightly and are just set, 25 to 30 minutes. Use grilling tongs to remove the zucchini to a cutting board. Carefully wrap each zucchini boat in 1 of the bacon strips. Return to the grill over indirect heat and continue grilling, covered, until the eggs are completely set and the bacon is warmed and just crispy, 18 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 31932,&quot;Fried Artichoke Bottoms with Picholine Olive Dressing 5 lemons 6 large artichokes 4 celery stalks, chopped 1 garlic clove, chopped 1 cup white wine 4 sprigs parsley 4 sprigs thyme 2 quarts chicken stock Salt and pepper 2 cups flour 3 eggs, lightly beaten 2 cups bread crumbs 1/2 cup picholine olives 2 ounces olive juice 2 ounces lemon juice 2 ounces sherry vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 egg yolk 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 1 head romaine lettuce 1 lemon, cut into wedges Instructions: To cook the artichokes, prepare a bowl with cold water and 3 sliced lemons to store the artichokes in after they have been peeled to prevent discoloration. Using a paring knife, remove the outer leaves and trim off the stem of each artichoke, and place in lemon water until ready to use. In a medium size pot, combine the celery, garlic, white wine, juice of 2 lemons, parsley, thyme, chicken stock, and salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer. Add the artichokes and cover them with a dishtowel to submerse the artichokes in the liquid. Cook for approximately 45 minutes, or until fork tender. When finished cooking, remove artichokes from liquid, and let cool to room temperature. Once they have cooled, remove any inner leaves and choke that are remaining. Slice the artichoke bottoms into four pieces. To bread the artichokes, set up the flour, lightly beaten eggs, and bread crumbs in separate dishes. Dredge the cut artichoke bottoms first in the flour, then in the eggs, and finally in the bread crumbs. Repeat this process until all pieces are breaded. Refrigerate until ready to fry. To prepare the dressing, combine the olives and olive juice in a food processor. Process until ground. Add the lemon juice, sherry vinegar, Dijon mustard, and egg yolk, and pulse until all ingredients are mixed together. While pulsing, drizzle in the olive oil to create an emulsion. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve. To fry the artichoke bottoms, use a heavy-bottomed saucepot, filled half way up with corn oil. Place over medium high heat and bring oil to 350 degrees F. Use a candy thermometer to determine the temperature. When oil is hot, add the artichokes a few pieces at a time and fry until golden brown. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and season with salt and pepper. To serve, fill a ramekin with the picholine dressing. Line a platter with romaine lettuce, and place the fried artichokes on top. Garnish the platter with lemon wedges and parsley sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 31933,&quot;Sauce Bearnaise 1 cup white wine vinegar 4 shallots, finely chopped 10 cracked peppercorns, or to taste 1/2 bunch fresh tarragon, washed, leaves removed 1/2 bunch fresh chervil, washed, leaves removed 3 large egg yolks 1 pound butter, cubed Salt and pepper to taste Fresh chervil, tarragon - chopped Instructions: In a small saucepan over medium high heat bring white wine vinegar, shallots, peppercorns, tarragon, chervil to a boil and reduce by 9/10th, strain, set aside.

Continue to mix for another 5 minutes on second speed. Once all ingredients have combined, remove dough from mixing bowl, wrap in plastic, and place in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Flatten the butter out into an 8 by 8-inch square shape. Roll out the dough into a 14 by 14-inch square shape, with the corners pointing towards you. Place the butter on the dough, with the corners placed opposite the corners of the dough. Fold in the corners of the dough over the butter to the center, sealing all the seams. Wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and roll the dough out approximately 18 inches in a rectangle. Then fold one end to the center, and fold other end, overlapping each fold. This is what we call a three-fold. Wrap dough and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Repeat same process one more time, and refrigerate. Remove dough from refrigerator, and roll out until dough is a rectangle that is approximately 1/8-inch thick. Halve the dough lengthwise, and then cut each section into 10 triangles.

Cut the squash in half on the equator and remove the seeds with a spoon. Cut a flat spot on each end so the squash will sit flat. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange the squash, cut side up. To 3 of the squash halves, add a peeled shallot and to the other 3 add 2 garlic cloves on each. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with 1 tablespoon each of the salt and freshly cracked pepper. Roast in the hot oven until very tender and starting to caramelize and collapse, approximately 1 hour. Remove from oven and when cool enough to handle, remove the squash from the skin. Reserve the roasted shallots and garlic with the squash. Can be done ahead. In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat and when the butter is starting to foam, add the raw diced shallots and saute until they are starting to caramelize, about 5 to 6 minutes. Deglaze with 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and stir to remove any fond. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add in the reserved squash, roasted shallots and garlic and then the remaining chicken stock. Stir to combine, then puree with a stick blender. The mixture will be very thick. Add in the cayenne, white pepper and the herbs.

Transfer the slices to sheets of plastic wrap, cover with plastic wrap, and, using the smooth side of a meat mallet, pound the sliced top portions until slices are very thin - ideally about 1/8-inch thick, being careful not to tear the meat. You should have approximately 16 (3 by 6 to 7-inch) rectangular portions of meat. In a small skillet heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil on a medium-high heat and saute the onion until tender and translucent. Transfer to a small mixing bowl and add the bread crumbs, cheese, raisins, pine nuts, parsley, and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside for filling. Preheat a grill, grill pan, or broiler to high heat. Lay the beef slices on a clean flat work surface and drizzle with 4 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil, turning to coat evenly. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the bread crumb mixture evenly among the beef slices, about 2 tablespoons each, placing the filling on 1of the short ends. Using your fingers, roll the slices lengthwise up and over the filling until the meat is completely rolled up. Using butcher&#39;s twine, tie both ends of each roll firmly to secure. Thread the meat rolls onto 2 skewers, 1 at either end of the roll, and thread bay leaves and onions onto each skewer, then top with a second beef roll and 2 more onions, until you have used all of the ingredients, like a kabob. Lightly brush each skewer with some of the remaining olive oil. You should have 8 double-skewered kabobs, each with 2 beef rolls, 4 onions, and 2 bay leaves. Grill the skewers, turning occasionally, until meat is charred on the outside but still medium-pink on the inside, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.

Lightly brush two 9-inch-round cake pans with vegetable oil. Line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper, then lightly oil the paper. Combine 2 tablespoons each potato starch and cocoa powder in a small bowl. Dust the prepared pans with the potato starch mixture, tapping out the excess. Sift the matzo cake meal and the remaining 1/2 cup potato starch and 2/3 cup cocoa powder into a bowl. Put the eggs, granulated sugar and salt in a stand mixer bowl. Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) and whisk until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is hot (110 degrees F to 120 degrees F), about 5 minutes. Attach the bowl to the stand mixer base and beat with the whisk attachment on high speed until very light and foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk 1/3 cup vegetable oil, the food coloring and vanilla in a small bowl. Reduce the mixer speed to low; gradually beat the cocoa mixture into the egg mixture, then gradually beat in the oil mixture until just incorporated. Turn off the mixer and finish folding the batter with a rubber spatula until combined. Divide the batter between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops. Bake until the cakes pull away from the pans and the centers spring back when pressed, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool 15 minutes in the pans, then run a knife around the edges to loosen. Invert the cakes onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and let cool completely; peel off the parchment. Make the frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with a mixer on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, then the vanilla. Increase the speed to high and beat until smooth and fluffy, about 3 more minutes. Transfer 1 cake layer to a platter and spread with 1 1/2 cups frosting; top with the second cake layer. Cover the whole cake with a very thin layer of frosting (this is the crumb coat; it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect). Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes.

They are not typically sold in supermarkets because the sub-zero temperatures required to store them are generally not achievable in home freezers, so we are using nonpareils instead.) &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Prosecco, Cava]&quot; 31964,&quot;Chocolate Soup 4 1/2 cups whole milk 1 cup sweetened condensed milk 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 10 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 5 tablespoons cornstarch 5 tablespoons cold water Mini chocolate biscotti, for garnish Fresh raspberries, for garnish Fresh mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together the whole milk, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla bean. Bring the mixture almost to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and let it steep for 20 minutes. Strain and return to the pan. (Rinse and dry the vanilla bean and save it for another use.) Put the pan on low heat, add the chocolate, and whisk until the chocolate melts. Combine the cornstarch and water to form a slurry. Add the slurry a little at a time, whisking constantly, until the soup is thick and smooth. You will know it is ready when the bubbles are gone and the chocolate has thickened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the soup into bowls and garnish with biscotti, raspberries, and mint leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 31965,&quot;15-Minute Chicken, Rice and Grape Salad 3 cups store-bought frozen precooked or leftover brown rice 1/2 cup 2 percent Greek yogurt 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon mayonnaise 1 small shallot, roughly chopped 1 small clove garlic, roughly chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup walnut pieces<br> 1/2 rotisserie chicken, skin removed and meat shredded (about 3 cups) 2 cups small seedless red grapes 1/2 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves 4 cups loosely packed baby spinach Instructions: Put the frozen rice in a medium glass mixing bowl, and break it up using a fork.

Blend until smooth. Pour into a bowl and add the lemon juice, Tabasco, and olives. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31970,&quot;Fermented Dill Pickles 2/3 cup pickling salt 1/4 head green cabbage, cut into 2-inch pieces 8 cloves garlic 8 fresh grape or black currant leaves, each the size of a silver dollar 12 dried red cl peppers (optional) 4 large heads fresh crown dill (bloomed dill), stems trimmed (or 4 teaspoons dried dill seeds) 30 to 40 Persian or other small cucumbers (about 6 inches long and 1 inch thick)<br> Instructions: Grape leaves keep the pickles crisp. Ask for them at a farmers&#39; market, or as an alternative, add 1/2 teaspoon alum powder to each jar before filling. Sterilize the jars: Wash the jars, lids and bands in hot soapy water and rinse well. Place a canning rack or folded kitchen towel in the bottom of a stockpot and fill halfway with water. Add the jars, making sure they are submerged. Bring to a boil and boil 10 minutes. Remove with a jar lifter or tongs and place on a clean towel. Put the lids and bands in a saucepan of simmering water until ready to use. Make the brine: Combine 13 cups water with the pickling salt in a large pot and bring to a boil, whisking to dissolve the salt. Set aside. Fill the jars: In the bottom of each sterilized jar, add a layer of cabbage leaves, 1 garlic clove, 1 grape leaf, 2 chiles and a tuft of crown dill. Pack the jar with cucumbers, standing them upright and getting in as many as you can. Top each jar with another garlic clove, grape leaf, cl and tuft of crown dill. Add the brine: Ladle the hot brine into each jar (use a funnel if you have one), leaving 1/8 inch headspace. You may not need all of the brine. Close the jars: Wipe the jar rims with a cloth dipped in boiling water. Screw the sterilized lids on tight-as tight as you possibly can. Ferment the pickles: Once the jars cool, transfer them to a warm place (75 degrees For so) and let the pickles ferment 1 week. This is the warm jump-start period; the brine should get cloudy and the lid tops should become tight with pressure. Then transfer the jars to a cool, dark place and wait at least 6 weeks and up to6 months before eating. Be careful opening the jars-fermentation causes the brine to carbonate and it may spray. And don&#39;t worry if the garlic changes color; it&#39;s still edible. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31971,&quot;Spicy Agave Wave Ice 1 slice jalapeno, seeded 1 by 1/4-inch piece 1-ounce fresh lime juice 1/2-ounce fresh lemon juice 1 1/2 ounces tequila blanco (100 percent blue agave) 3/4-ounce agave nectar 1/2 celery stick, for garnish Instructions: Fill a glass or cocktail shaker with some ice.

Lightly butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Pulse the graham crackers into fine crumbs in a food processor. Add the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt and pulse until well combined. Beat the butter and both sugars in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the pumpkin puree (the batter will look curdled). Beat in half of the flour mixture, then the buttermilk, then the remaining flour mixture. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Tap the bottoms of the pans against the counter to release any air bubbles. Bake the cakes until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then loosen the edges with a knife and invert the cakes onto the rack; discard the parchment and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Microwave the chocolate, marshmallows, cocoa powder and 1/3 cup heavy cream in a bowl in 30-second intervals, whisking occasionally, until melted and completely smooth. Stir in the vanilla. Let cool to room temperature. Whisk the remaining 2/3 cup heavy cream in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Whisk one-third of the whipped cream into the chocolate-marshmallow mixture, then gently fold in the rest with a rubber spatula. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the meringue: Whisk the egg whites, granulated sugar, cream of tartar and salt in a large heatproof bowl. Place over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) and cook, whisking, until the mixture is warm and the sugar dissolves, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan. Add the vanilla to the bowl and beat with a hand mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture is cool and stiff glossy peaks form, about 12 minutes (or transfer to a stand mixer and beat 6 to 8 minutes). Assemble the cake: Using a long serrated knife, split each cake in half horizontally to make 4 layers total. Place 1 layer on a cake stand or plate. Transfer 1 cup meringue to a large resealable plastic bag and snip a corner. Pipe a ring of meringue on the perimeter of the cake layer (the meringue will keep the filling from oozing out). Spread one-third of the chocolate filling inside the ring. Repeat with 2 more cake layers, then top with the final layer. Cover the top and sides of the cake with the remaining meringue, using the back of a spoon to make peaks. Brown the frosting with a kitchen torch. Refrigerate the cake for 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31990,&quot;Chicken and Baby Spinach with Raspberry-Balsamic Vinaigrette 1/2 cup lite balsamic vinaigrette 1/2 cup fresh raspberries 3/4 teaspoon sugar 8 cups baby spinach 1/3 cup red onion, thinly sliced 1 cup fresh raspberries 1 cup sliced cucumbers 1 1/3 cups cooked store-bought chicken breast, cut into strips 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese 1/4 cup chopped pecans Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the dressing: Combine vinaigrette, raspberries, and sugar in a blender.

Add the sugar and salt and continue to beat until evenly combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat in the egg yolk. Add half of the flour, beating until just crumbly. Scrape down the bowl again; add the remaining flour and the sour cream, beating just until the dough is evenly moistened. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead lightly to bring it together. Roll the dough between 2 generously floured sheets of waxed or parchment paper into a circle about 1/4-inch thick. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Cut out six 4 1/2-inch rounds using an inverted bowl or round cookie cutter. Place a round in each cup of a nonstick standard 6-cup muffin tin and use a small shot glass or your fingers to press each round into the corners and about halfway up the sides for a snug fit. Freeze the dough in the muffin tin for 15 to 30 minutes. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Spray the outside of 6 standard muffin liners with cooking spray and place 1 on top of each dough cup. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until the crusts are just brown around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for about 1 minute; then carefully remove the muffin liners and baking beans. Return the muffin tin to the oven and continue baking until the crusts are cooked through and evenly browned, 15 to 20 minutes more. Cool slightly, then carefully remove the crusts from the muffin tin and cool completely on a rack. Combine the sugar, cornstarch and egg yolks in a nonreactive saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is smooth and the sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Add the lime juice and lemon zest and juice and continue to cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is as thick as sour cream and is just about to simmer, 3 to 4 minutes. (Take care to stir into the sides of the saucepan so that all the curd thickens evenly.) Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Whisk in the butter a little at a time, until smooth. Stir occasionally until cool. (Setting the bowl in a larger bowl of ice will speed this up.). Fill each tartlet with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the cool lemon filling. Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a stand mixer&#39;s bowl above the water. Whisk together the sugar, egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in the bowl by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and heat, whisking, until the mixture is hot to the touch (135 degrees F) and the sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat the whites at medium-high speed until they hold soft peaks. Increase the speed to high and continue to beat to make a stiff, cool meringue, about 10 minutes. Dollop or pipe on top of the filling. Just before serving, brown the merinque with a kitchen blow torch. (Alternatively, preheat the broiler to high. Set the pies on a baking sheet and place under the broiler until the meringue is evenly toasted, about 2 minutes.) Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.

Season with 2 teaspoons salt and a generous amount of pepper and stir until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32009,&quot;S&#39;More Rockin&#39; Reindeer Ravioli 5 graham crackers, broken into pieces 6 ounce milk or dark chocolate, or a combination, chopped 3 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons molasses 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 11/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup graham flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: For the filling: Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until crumbly. Add the chocolate and cream cheese and continue to pulse until crumbly and pasty. Using the filling portion (&#39;the bumpy side) of a 12-section ravioli mold, cover the indented side with plastic wrap. Pack some of the filling into each indentation, leveling each one so it&#39;s flush with the top of the mold. Remove and place on a plate. Repeat to make 24 fillings. Cover the filling with plastic wrap and refrigerate. (Eat the crumbs left behind.) To make the dough: Combine the butter and sugars in a large mixing bowl. Beat at medium speed, until fluffy and combined, about 2 minutes. Add the molasses and vanilla and beat until combined. In a separate bowl, whisk both flours, the baking soda, salt and cinnamon together. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in 3 parts, alternating with cream in 2 parts, beginning and ending with flour. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Divide into 2 disks, wrap in plastic warp and chill until very firm, about 1 hour. Lay out an 11 by 15-inch piece of foil on a clean workspace and sprinkle generously with flour. Place a disk of dough on top and cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap. Roll the dough between the 2 layers (Voila, no messy hands) until you have a rectangle measuring 10 by 13 inches, cutting and patching as needed. Repeat with the other disk of dough. Transfer each foil to a cookie sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. When chilled, remove plastic wrap from 1 flat of chilled and rolled dough. Spray the zigzag side of the ravioli mold with nonstick spray and sprinkle it with flour. Place the mold, zigzag side down, onto the lower half of the dough, making a slight indent in the dough. Take the chocolate filling from the refrigerator. Place a round of filling on the center of each square ravioli impression. Using the foil to lift the top of the dough, fold it over the mounds on the bottom half leaving plenty of give to tuck dough between each mound. Gently press out the air around the mounds with wet fingers to keep the dough from cracking. Spray the zigzag side of the mold again and sprinkle the top of the ravioli with flour. Invert the press on the cookies, making another impression in the dough, and press very firmly to seal the 2 layers together and cut off excess dough. To remove the mold, gently lift by pressing downward on the 2 mounds on the end. Lift up on the mold working your way across the dough slab. Use a dry pastry brush to brush off excess flour. Cut ravioli into individual portions, trimming away excess dough with a knife or fluted pastry cutter. Arrange on a baking sheet. Chill the molded ravioli in the refrigerator until firm to the touch, 30 more minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the ravioli for 25 to 30 Minutes. Remove from oven and let sit on cookie sheet 5 more minutes, using a pastry cutter to cut in between the ravioli while warm, if desired. Then slide the slab onto a cookie sheet to cool. Eat 1 slab and freeze the other to keep it really fresh.

Make the gelatin: In a large bowl, combine the gelatin with 5 1/2 cups boiling water, then stir in the still warm reduced red wine. Stir until dissolved. Add the cranberry sauce; stir until melted. Create the first layer: Layer 1/2 pint raspberries, top-side down, in each crevice of a 10- to 15-cup Bundt mold. Imagine you are looking at them and building this dessert upside down (because you are) and will see the opposite side when the dessert is unmolded. Gently pour enough of the cranberry mixture to cover the first layer of fruit, about half. Place the mold on a sheet pan and chill in the refrigerator until mostly set, about 2 hours. Create the second layer: On top of the set up gelatin, gently arrange another half pint of raspberries all through the center of the mold. Put mint leaves wherever there are gaps. Pour the remaining gelatin carefully on top. Refrigerate for another 2 hours or up to overnight. To serve: Dip the mold very briefly in a large bowl of warm water to loosen the gelatin from the sides of the mold. Place a serving plate or cake stand on top of the Bundt mold and invert onto the plate. Unmold the cake. Top with mint leaves and arrange the last half pint raspberries around the edges.

Stir until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the corn syrup. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage, between 234 and 240 degrees on a candy thermometer. Pour the mixture over a dampened marble slab. Sprinkle it with a little water to prevent a crust from forming and leave to cool for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a triangular scraper work the sugar syrup scraping it from the slab and turning the sides to the center. Alternatively, work the fondant in an electric mixer with a dough hook. Work vigorously particularly when the fondant starts to thicken and become creamy. After 3 to 5 minutes it will suddenly become stiff. Break off one piece of fondant at a time and work it by pinching it hard in your fingers until pliable and smooth. Press all the pieces of pliable fondant together and knead in any flavoring or coloring.

Wrap the beets tightly in a packet of aluminum foil. Set directly on the oven rack and bake until very tender, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool the beets in the foil to room temperature. The beets can be prepared to this point up to 1 day in advance. Refrigerate them in their foil, returning them to room temperature before proceeding. Peel the beets and cut them into eighths. On a sheet pan, toss the potatoes with the oil. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Toss the potatoes, stirring them occasionally, until they are tender and well browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. Bring a medium pan of water to a boil. Add the artichokes and 2 teaspoons salt and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain well and cool. Quarter the artichokes vertically. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the haricots verts and 2 teaspoons salt. Cook until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes after the water returns to a boil. Drain the haricots verts, immediately transfer them to a bowl of iced water and let stand just until cool. Drain well. Prepare a hot charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium high. When the fire is hot, distribute the wood chips if you are using them. Position the grill rack about 6-inches above the heat. Spread one side of the tuna with half the tapenade. When the fire is hot, lay the fish on the rack, tapenade side down. Cover and grill for 4 minutes. Spread the upper side of the tuna with the remaining tapenade. Turn the fish and grill another 3 to 5 minutes for medium rare, or until done to your liking. Transfer to a cutting board and cool slightly. Remove and discard the skin and cut the tuna into slices that are 2-inches long and about 1/2-inch thick. Season generously with freshly ground pepper. In a medium bowl, toss the artichokes with 1 tablespoon of the vinaigrette. In a second bowl, toss the potatoes with 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette. In a third bowl, toss the beets and red onions with 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette. In a fourth bowl, toss the tomatoes with 2 tablespoons of the of the vinaigrette. Season each vegetable to taste with salt and pepper and marinate for 30 minutes. Mound the mesclun in the center of a large platter. Spoon the marinated artichokes, potatoes, beets, and tomatoes around, not on, the mesclun. Add the hard cooked egg wedges to the platter and drizzle them with a tablespoon or two of vinaigrette. Arrange the tuna slices over the mesclun and drizzle the fish with 3 tablespoons of vinaigrette. Scatter the olives and arrange the caper berries decoratively over and around the various components and serve immediately. Pass the remaining vinaigrette at the table. In a medium bowl whisk together the vingar, mustard, shallot, hot pepper sauce and salt. Continue to whisk while adding the oil in a slow stream; the dressing will thicken. Add freshly ground pepper to taste and adjust the seasoning. Use within an hour or so of completion. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 32023,&quot;Olive Puffs 2 large egg yolks 1 large egg 1/4 cup whole milk 20 pitted olives Store-bought puff pastry, rolled into 1 (10 by 12-inch) rectangle Instructions: Prepare the egg wash: Combine the yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small mixing bowl and whip with a hand whisk until well combined. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Set the puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface, with the long side facing you and cut in half from top to bottom. Use a pastry brush to coat one piece of the dough with egg wash. Lay the olives spaced about 1-inch apart from top to bottom on the egg-washed dough. Place the other rolled-out dough half on top of the olives and mark each olive by pressing the dough on either side of the olive. Use a sharp paring knife to cut between each puff pastry-covered olive. Place on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and brush with more egg wash. Bake until well risen and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving. There is no need to cut these in half. Just cut between the olives to make small packages.

Pour in the stock and scrape the bottom of the pan, getting all the flavorful bits off the bottom. Allow the stock to cook down until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.<br> Pour in the crushed tomatoes and stir to combine. Add the sugar and more salt and pepper to taste. Allow to cook for 30 minutes.<br> Toward the end of the cooking time, add the chopped parsley and give the sauce a final stir.<br> Carefully lay the chicken breasts on top of the sauce and completely cover them in the grated Parmesan. Place the lid on the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Allow to simmer until the cheese is melted and the chicken is thoroughly heated. Add more cheese to taste.<br> Place the cooked noodles on a plate and cover with the sauce. Place the chicken breasts on top and sprinkle with more parsley and the basil chiffonade. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 32030,&quot;Sorrel Pistachio Pesto with Seared Salmon Four 6-ounce filets of salmon, skin-on 1 bunch sorrel (about 7 ounces) 1/2 cup shelled pistachios 1 small clove garlic, peeled 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat a large heavy-bottomed skillet over low heat while you prepare the pesto. Remove the salmon from refrigerator to come to room temperature. Separate the sorrel stems from the leaves, and then discard the stems (especially if it&#39;s later in the sorrel season, when the stems are fibrous and tough). You should have about 4 packed cups of sorrel leaves. Combine the pistachios and garlic in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture is the consistency of coarse sand. Add the sorrel and pulse until all of the leaves are chopped and incorporated into the nuts. With the machine running, slowly add up to 3/4 cup of olive oil until the mixture is smooth. Season with about 1 1/4 teaspoons salt. Spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons of pesto on the bottom of each plate. Transfer the remaining pesto to a bowl and cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent it from turning brown. For best use, keep in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Blot excess moisture from the salmon with a paper towel and sprinkle both sides with salt. Turn up the heat to medium-high and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. When the oil is shimmering, carefully place the salmon in the pan skin-side down to avoid any splattering oil. Don&#39;t worry if the salmon skin seems stuck to the pan, after about 2 minutes it will release. Lower the heat to medium and cook until the skin is crisp and brown, about 4 minutes total. Flip over and cook until the salmon is firm to the touch (it would still be a bit translucent in the center if you peeked), an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the pan and place the salmon skin-side up on each plate and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 32031,&quot;Chai Tea 1 tablespoon fennel seed 6 green cardamom pods 12 whole cloves 1 cinnamon stick 1 (1/4-inch) piece ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced 6 black peppercorns 7 cups water 2 tablespoons Darjeeling tea 4 tablespoons brown sugar 1 cup milk Instructions: In a medium saucepan, combine fennel seed, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, ginger root, peppercorns and water.

In the same pan, add a little more coconut oil and grill the whites of the spring onions until golden brown on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes total. Remove from the pan and allow to cool prior to cutting into bite-size pieces. Deglaze the pan by adding the stock and stirring to pick up any browned bits in the pan. Whisk in the butter. Once completely melted, add the sumac and red pepper flakes, and simmer until it reduces by a third, about 3 minutes. Add the shrimp back into the pan along with the sliced spring onion greens and the grilled spring onion pieces. Toss to coat and allow the shrimp to warm through, but do not overcook! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 32033,&quot;Lemon Profiteroles 1 quart whole milk 6 whole eggs 14 ounces sugar 12 ounces all purpose flour 5 whole lemons, juiced 1 cup heavy cream 12 profiteroles, pre-made 4 tablespoons lemon zest Instructions: For the lemon curd: In a large saucepan, add the milk, eggs, sugar, flour, and lemon juice.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place l of the puff pastry circles on the baking sheet. Brush a 1-inch rim around the outside edge with some of the beaten egg. Pat the cheese mixture into an 8-inch circle in the center and spread the guava paste or jam evenly over the top. Fold the remaining piece of puff pastry in half and place over the first piece. Unfold the pastry to enclose the filling, being careful not to trap air beneath. Gently press the top and bottom edges together and refrigerate about 25 minutes, or until the dough is thoroughly chilled. Remove from the refrigerator. Working about 1 1/2-inches from the outside, firmly press the edges of pastry together with the tines of a fork to seal. Then trim the excess dough, leaving an even 1-inch border of crust surrounding the filling. With a sharp paring knife, cut out and discard a 1/4-inch circle of dough from the center, and press out any trapped air. Then, making shallow cuts, trace 6 to 8 circular lines in a spiral pattern from the center hole to the inside edge of the sealed crust (if the dough gets too warm to work with, just return to the refrigerator for 30 minutes or so to harden). Mix the heavy cream, with the remaining beaten egg and brush over the top of the tart: Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours or overnight. To bake, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Transfer the pan from refrigerator to the oven and bake 15 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown on top. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Bake until the jelly is bubbling and the bottom crust, when lifted with a spatula, is browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Set aside to cool on a rack to 15 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 32059,&quot;Braised Pork with Apricots and Beer 1/3 cup olive oil 2 3/4 pounds pork shoulder, cubed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 medium carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces 2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 onion, cut into large chunks 5 cloves garlic, smashed 1/3 cup all-purpose flour Three 12-ounce bottles Belgian-style wheat beer 1 cup dried apricots 5 sprigs fresh thyme Cooked egg noodles, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325F.

Heat the caramel topping in a small saucepan so that it is viscous and spoon some on each cookie. Place the brandy and bananas in a saute pan and light the brandy to flambe the bananas. When the brandy has burnt off, place a banana piece on top of the caramel on each cookie. The chocolate to coat the bananas will be tempered, a term used to describe the successive melting and cooling of the chocolate within a certain temperature range. This process allows the molecules of the chocolate to align so that it will retain a silky appearance without a chalky finish. To temper the chocolate, place half of the semisweet chocolate pieces in each of 2 stainless steel bowls which will fit over a saucepan double-boiler fashion. Bring an inch or so of water to a boil in the saucepan and fit 1 of the bowls of chocolate pieces over it and heat until those chocolate pieces are just melted (about 90 to 100 degrees F on the candy thermometer). Then pour this just-melted chocolate into the other bowl with the un-melted chocolate, stir to combine, and return all of the chocolate to the double boiler and heat to about 105 degrees F. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the ground espresso. You will need to work quickly to spoon the espresso chocolate over the caramel coated bananas, and sprinkle each with a teaspoon of shredded coconut before the chocolate hardens. Allow chocolate to harden, remove carefully from the utility platter using a thin bladed spatula, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 32062,&quot;Garlic Roast Chicken with Rosemary and Lemon 2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into large chunks 6 cloves garlic, crushed 3 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves stripped from stems 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 tablespoon grill seasoning blend (recommended: Montreal Seasoning) or, coarse salt and black pepper 1/2 cup dry white wine or chicken broth Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely melted, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the cilantro and stir until completely wilted. Let cool completely at room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Put the melon, lime zest and juice and a pinch of salt in a blender. Strain the cilantro syrup into the blender, pressing the cilantro in the strainer with the back of a spoon to extract as much flavor as possible; discard the cilantro. Puree the melon mixture until completely smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender partway through if needed. Transfer the mixture to a large liquid measuring cup with a pouring spout. Pour the mixture into the molds, leaving 1/4 inch of space at the top (the mixture will expand). Insert the sticks. Freeze until solid, 5 hours to overnight. Unmold, and enjoy immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 32067,&quot;Asparagus and Wild Leek Tart with Goat Cheese and Red Pepper Vinaigrette 1 pound pencil asparagus 1/2 pound wild leeks (ramps) or scallions 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup chicken broth 1/2 package phyllo dough 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, more if needed 6 ounces fresh goat cheese 1/2 small red pepper, ribs and seeds removed 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1/4 cup white wine vinegar Salt and pepper 1/2 cup walnut oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Wash the asparagus and cut off the bottom of the stems that are greenish-white and tough. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon salt, submerge the asparagus for 30 seconds to blanch, remove the asparagus from the pot and quickly submerge in iced water to shock. Set the asparagus aside. From the wild leeks, trim off the dirty roots and snip an inch off the tops, before washing them carefully in cold water. Heat a saute pan over medium heat with 1 tablespoon of butter. When the butter begins to foam add the wild leeks, season with salt and pepper, and cook gently for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the broth to the wild leeks and simmer until all of the broth has evaporated but be careful not to burn the leeks. Remove from the saute pan and allow to cool. Prepare a space to work with the phyllo dough: unwrap the dough and cover with a cloth, have a brush and the olive oil ready and have a cookie sheet ready on which the tart will be baked. Begin by lightly brushing the center of the cookie sheet with a film of olive oil. Next, lay the first sheet of dough on the cookie pan, brush the dough lightly with oil and overlap width wise the next sheet over only half of the first so that now the two sheets make a pastry sheet 50 percent wider (not longer) than the original dimension of the pastry. Don&#39;t be concerned if the lengthwise ends of the dough are overflowing from the edges of the pan: all of the edges of the dough will be rolled up to form the edges of the tart. Brush the second sheet of dough with oil and lay another sheet squarely over the first so that in alternating this pattern you build your wide pastry base. Continue to alternate the dough sheets, brushing each layer with oil, until you have used half the package of dough. Gather the edges of the phyllo between the tips of your fingers and begin to roll them toward the center to form the sides of the tart. Roll uniformly inward until the rolled edge is even all around and the round tart resembles a pizza. Leave a pastry base of 10 to 12 inches into which the vegetables and cheese will go after the tart shell is blind baked. Place the empty tart shell into the oven and bake for 6 minutes. Remove the pastry from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before filling. This pastry preparation can be done over the course of several hours and can even be done a day or two ahead if the blind baking is reserved until the last moment and the raw pastry is covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated. To fill the tart crumble the goat cheese and spread it evenly over the base of the tart. Next add an even layer of wild leeks, followed by the asparagus which should be fanned, tips out, from the center of the tart. Season the tart lightly with salt and pepper, place into the 375 degree oven and bake for 15 minutes or until the cheese has softened and the crust becomes a rich golden brown. Serve immediately. While the tart is baking (or ahead of time if possible) prepare the vinaigrette. Place the red pepper, mustard, vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper in a food processor. Pulse to chop the red pepper to a fine dice. When the pepper has been pulsed enough, begin to drizzle in the walnut oil to create an emulsified dressing. Serve the tart with a small green salad and a drizzle of red pepper vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 32068,&quot;Hot Fudge Sauce 1 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1/3 cup light corn syrup Pinch of kosher salt 8 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate (or a combination), chopped 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 tablespoon vanilla extract Instructions: Combine the heavy cream, butter, brown sugar, corn syrup and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking. Add the chocolate and cocoa powder, reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking, until the chocolate is melted and the sauce is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the vanilla. Let cool 10 minutes before serving. To store, let cool completely, then cover and refrigerate up to 2 weeks; reheat before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage]&quot; 32069,&quot;The Fish Point Sandwich 4 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 teaspoons white wine 2 eggs, beaten 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup all-purpose flour Four 6-ounce fillets of sole 4 tablespoons butter 4 slices white sandwich bread Fresh parsley sprigs for garnish, optional Instructions: To make the lemon butter: Melt 4 tablespoons of butter over low heat in a small saucepan. Add the lemon juice and white wine. Keep the sauce warm on a corner of the stove. To prepare the fish: Whisk the eggs with the heavy cream in a large bowl. Put the flour in a separate bowl. Dredge the fillets in flour; shake off any excess then put the fillets into the batter. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Lift the sole out of the batter, allow the excess to run off, then gently lay the fillets in the pan. Cook, turning the fish once, until the sole is flaky and the crust is crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. While fish is cooking, toast the bread and cut each piece in half diagonally (corner to corner). Arrange the toast points on 4 plates--2 per plate. Lift the fish from the pan onto the toast points. Drizzle the fish with lemon butter and serve immediately garnished with a sprig of fresh parsley, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32070,&quot;Green Tomato and Cheddar Pizza 1/3 cup olive oil 6 medium to large green tomatoes (about 3 pounds) 12 scallions Kosher salt 1 pound store-bought pizza dough, at cool room temperature 8 ounces sharp white Cheddar, grated (about 2 /12 cups) Instructions: Preheat an indoor or outdoor grill to medium heat. Put the olive oil in a small bowl or measuring cup. Slice the tomatoes 1/4 inch thick and spread them on a baking sheet or large tray. Put the scallions on the baking sheet. Brush everything on both sides with oil and season with salt over the top. Grill the tomatoes, seasoned-side down, until they develop dark grill marks, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, brush with more oil, season again and cook until charred and tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, another 3 to 5 minutes. Put the scallions on the grill and grill, flipping once, until charred in spots (don&#39;t overdo it) and tender when pierced in the white part, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the tomatoes and set aside. Remove the scallions and coarsely chop. While the tomatoes and scallions are grilling, shape the dough. Oil two 12- by 15-inch pieces of foil. Halve the pizza dough. Drape one half over your fist and gently tug and turn it, letting the weight of the edges help stretch it thinner, so that it makes a rough oblong. Then put it on the oiled foil and press, pull and push gently until it is very thin, and measures about 9 by 12 inches. Be sure to get the edges thin too, or they won&#39;t cook through on the grill. Repeat with the second piece. Brush the dough with olive oil. Brush the grill grate with olive oil. Leaving the dough on the foil, flip them top-side-down onto the grill and peel the foil off. Cook until the dough just comes up from the grill without sticking, about 3 minutes, and then flip. Scatter a handful of cheese and then half of the tomatoes and scallions over each pizza. Top with the rest of the cheese. Cover the grill and cook, about 6 minutes. Give the pizzas a 45-degree turn, cover and cook until the bottoms are deep golden brown, the cheese is bubbling and the dough is cooked through, another 6 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 32071,&quot;Cheesy Hasselback Chicken 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1/2 cup Food Network Kitchen?

Put the garlic bulbs straight on the oven rack and roast them until they are soft when squeezed, about 30 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let cool. Turn the oven up to 375 degrees F. While garlic is roasting, prep the chicken. Into a food processor or a bowl, add the lemon zest and juice and set aside. When the garlic bulbs are cool, slice the tops off and squeeze out the roasted garlic into the bowl or food processor along with the thyme, cumin, crushed red pepper and salt to taste. Add a little olive oil and puree or mash into a loose paste. Massage the mixture all over the chicken pieces and let sit for at least 1 hour. For the couscous: Bring a pot of well salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the couscous and cook it until it&#39;s about two-thirds of the way cooked, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and reserve. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the pan and brown it on all sides. Remove it to a plate, drain the fat and add the celery and onions. Season with salt and crushed red pepper. Deglaze with the white wine, scraping up all the crud on the bottom of the pan, and cook for 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 2 minutes. Add in the saffron, zucchini, cooked couscous and chicken stock. Stir to combine, and then taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Transfer the mix to an ovenproof dish. Nestle the chicken, skin-side up, in the couscous and cover with foil. Add some more chicken stock to keep everything nice and moist. Sprinkle with pine nuts and cover with foil. Place the baking dish on a sheet pan. Roast the chicken for 20 minutes, and then remove the foil and roast for another 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and top with scallions before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 32077,&quot;Chicken Gismonda 3 ounces bread crumbs 1-ounce grated Parmesan cheese 2 eggs 4 tablespoons salad oil 2 large whole boneless chicken breasts 3/4 cup flour 3 ounces clarified butter 6 ounces (1-inch diameter) mushrooms, sliced in 1/2 2 teaspoons lemon juice Freshly ground salt, to taste Freshly ground pepper, to taste 1/4 cup dry sherry 1/4 cup salted butter 1 pound trimmed leaf spinach, washed very well 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg Instructions: Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan; set aside.

In a medium bowl, sift the cake flour, granulated sugar, baking soda and salt. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the oil, buttermilk, coconut milk, vanilla and eggs. Mix until all the ingredients are fully combined, about 1 minute. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix only until all the ingredients are barely incorporated. Fold in the shredded coconut. Fill the liners about three-quarters of the way full and bake, 17 to 19 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool slightly before removing them from the pan and transferring to a cooling rack. For the lime curd: In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Slowly add the eggs and yolks, and then beat until combined. Add the lime juice. The mixture WILL look curdled. Do not fear, it will smooth out as the butter melts when you cook the mixture. In a stainless steel saucepan, cook the mixture over low heat until it smooths out. Increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not let it boil. Remove the curd from the heat and stir in the lime zest. Put the curd in a clean bowl and wrap it tightly. Place in the fridge until cool, about 1 hour. For the frosting: In electric mixing bowl with paddle attachment, beat the butter until fluffy and pale in color. Add the powdered sugar gradually and beat until fully combined. Drizzle in the coconut milk and rum. Add more powdered sugar or coconut rum to adjust the consistency of the frosting. Core out the center of the cupcakes, fill with lime curd and frost with coconut rum frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 32081,&quot;Grands!

Cut out disks of dough 1-inch bigger than your ovenproof 8 to 12 ounce crocks. Keep chilled until ready to use. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Drain the cherry juices into a medium saucepan; you should have about a cup of juice. Add the cornstarch, sugar, ginger, and lemon juice and whisk to dissolve the cornstarch then bring it to a simmer over medium heat whisking all the while. When thickened, turn off the heat, stir in the cherries. Pour the cherry filling into the ovenproof dishes and set aside to cool slightly. Carefully place the rolled-out disks on top and ease them into the dishes so it doesn&#39;t hang over the edge. Brush each disk with a little heavy cream and then sprinkle lightly with 2 tablespoons of sugar. With the tips of a pair of scissors, snip a X vent hole in the top of each crust. Place the pies on a sheet pan, to catch any juices that boil over. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling at the vents, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Serve at room temperature with vanilla ice cream. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter. Turn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape into round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between two sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won&#39;t be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It&#39;s entirely up to you. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don&#39;t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don&#39;t do this more than two or three times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies. Set your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it&#39;s up to you. Either choice will work. To transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan. Don&#39;t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don&#39;t be concerned; it will patch easily. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4 inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. For a double-crust pie: Leave the edges of the bottom crust hanging over the rim. Roll out the second piece of dough into a circle about 11 inches in diameter. Line a sheet pan with parchment or waxed paper. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, then unroll it onto the sheet pan. Chill the finished crust or crusts for 20 to 30 minutes before filling the pie. When the bottom crust is filled, rest the top crust on top and pinch the edges together, turning them under all the way around. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \V\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. For a prebaked pie or tart crust (blind baking): Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don&#39;t turn it down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights or dried beans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \blond. Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent over baking, until medium brown.

Allow the French vanilla ice cream and peach sorbet to soften at room temperature, until they can be scooped easily, approximately 20 minutes. Spread the vanilla ice cream along the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch baking dish, and layer it with the peach sorbet. Using a knife, swirl the 2 flavors together until the ice cream mixture has streaks of ice cream and sorbet. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and freeze until the ice cream firms up again, approximately 2 hours. Brush the peaches and each side of the pound cake slices with canola oil and put them on the grill. Cook until heated through and obtain nice grill marks, approximately 1 minute per side for the pound cake and 2 to 3 minutes per side for the peaches. Remove the peaches from the grill to a cutting board. When cool, cut each piece into 4 wedges. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and the cinnamon, then sprinkle the cake and peaches evenly with the cinnamon mixture. Add the sliced almonds to a dry skillet and put the skillet on the grill. Toast the nuts until they are golden brown and fragrant, tossing frequently, approximately 3 to 5 minutes. To serve, put 1 piece of grilled pound cake on a serving plate. Arrange 4 wedges of grilled peach on top, and finish with a large scoop of the ice cream/sorbet mixture. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Combine 1 1/4 cups of the sugar, the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Combine the egg yolks and water in a small bowl. Add to the dry ingredients in 3 stages, stirring until smooth. Add the melted butter and vanilla and stir until well incorporated. In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites and the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar to soft peaks. Gently fold the whites into the cupcake batter, just until incorporated. Divide the batter into a 12-cup baking tin and bake until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out dry, about 20 minutes. In a small saucepan add the cream and bring just to a boil over low heat. Put the chocolate into to a medium bowl and pour in the hot cream. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir until smooth. Stir in the butter and mix until incorporated. Put plastic wrap directly on the surface of the chocolate and refrigerate for 1 hour. When the chocolate is cool, transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a large tip. In a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot, heat enough peanut oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 350 degrees F. Combine all the batter ingredients in a large bowl and stir until just combined. Do not overmix. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. With a paring knife, remove the middle of the cupcakes, but leave the tops intact. Using the pastry bag, fill the holes with the chocolate. Replace the top firmly. Coat the cupcakes in batter and deep-fry, in batches, until golden brown on all sides. Remove from the fryer and drain on paper towels for a few seconds. Transfer to a serving platter, then indulge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 32094,&quot;Lemon-Mint Vodka Spiked Watermelon 1/4 cup sugar 2 lemons, juiced 1 (750 ml) bottle vodka 2 fresh mint sprigs 1 whole watermelon, 10 pounds or larger Instructions: Dissolve the sugar in the lemon juice.

Heat 1/2 cup of the oil in a small saucepan until hot but not smoking. Turn off the heat. Add half of the scallions and ginger. Let cool for 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into a blender and add the cabbage kimchi, sesame seeds and rice vinegar. Blend until coarsely chopped. Transfer the kimchi pesto to a small bowl and set aside. Rinse the blender carafe with hot water. Cook the bacon with the 2 remaining teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until brown and crisp, about 12 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate and crumble 2 of the slices. Discard all but 1 tablespoon of the drippings from the skillet. Increase the heat to medium high. Add the garlic and the remaining scallions and ginger. Cook until browned, about 1 minute, then add 1 1/2 cups of the chicken broth and the crumbled bacon. Simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Transfer the bacon-chicken broth to the blender. Add the kimchi juice, miso, mirin and remaining 1 1/4 cups chicken broth. Leave the lid cracked and cover with a kitchen towel to collect any splatters. Blend until smooth. Add the ramen noodles to the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 1 1/2 minutes for fresh noodles and 2 1/2 minutes for dried noodles. Drain and divide among 4 soup bowls.

Use caution when baking in glass. Test one first to be sure it will withstand the heat of the oven. 4-ounce ramekins may be used as a substitute if necessary.) Instructions: For the lemon curd: Beat the eggs and sugar in a small stainless steel or copper pot (do not use aluminum as it will leave deposits in your curd!). Add the lemon juice, zest, and butter. Bring to a high simmer and cook until mixture thickens. Strain immediately through a sieve or cheesecloth. Spoon 1-ounce of curd into each of the 10 martini glasses. This is best done while the curd is warm but can also be done once it&#39;s cooled if necessary. Chill the glasses with the curd until the curd is cold and set. For the custard: Split the vanilla bean with a paring knife and scrape the seeds into the sugar. Use your fingers to work the beans into the sugar ? making an even mixture. Mix this mixture with the egg yolks and the eggs. Don&#39;t whip it but be sure to completely mix it so the color is consistent throughout. Bring the cream to a boil, remove from the heat and slowly pour it into the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Add the vanilla extract. To bake the creme brulee: Pour 3 ounces of the warm custard mixture into each of the glasses (over the lemon curd). Find a deep pan (preferably at least 6 inches deep. Restaurant supply stores commonly sell these as \hotel\ or \insert\ pans) and place the filled martini glasses in them. Set the pan on the bottom shelf of a 325 degrees F oven. Using a water pitcher, pour enough water into the pan to at least cover the stems of the glasses - ideally you can pour enough to come up about 1/3 of the way on the part of the glass the holds the custard. Baking times will vary depending on the amount of water in the pan and the type of pan used, but will be somewhere around 45 minutes to 1 hour. The custard is done when you tap the side of the glass and it looks thick and moves as one (as opposed to the center of the custard giggling more than the outside). Carefully remove the pan from the oven and let cool at room temperature for about 1 hour. Transfer creme brulees into the refrigerator to cool and set completely. To finish the creme brulee: Sprinkle about a tablespoon of sugar over each of the custards. Use your finger to spread it evenly over the top. Light a blowtorch and turn it to the high setting. Melt and caramelize the sugar quickly. Note that a flame that is too low or prolonged heat towards the edge of the martini glass may break the glass. Use caution and practice on one away from the others so that if it does break you don&#39;t get glass in the other custards. Creme brulees can be caramelized (\burnt) up to 4 hours before service and held in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 32097,&quot;Thyme-Scented Goat Cheese with Prosciutto and Shallots 2 teaspoons olive oil 2 large shallots, finely chopped (about ? cup) 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 4 ounces goat cheese, softened 1 tablespoon milk 1 ? teaspoons chopped fresh thyme ? teaspoon kosher salt ? teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 thin slices prosciutto, crosswise cut into 1 ?inch-wide strips (about 3 oz. total) 24 Keebler?

Once boiling, add salt, bay leaves, and lobster meat. Cook lobster only until it is opaque. Do not overcook lobster as it will get tough. Remove lobster with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain, reserving cooking liquid. Remove bay leaves from liquid and discard.; Melt the butter in a saucepan, and add garlic and scallions, cooking them until they become tender. Stir in the grits, and toast lightly in the pan, then add the cooking liquid from the lobster and simmer until the grits are cooked, about 20 minutes. (The grits should be fluffy.) While the grits are cooking, cook bacon in a large skillet until crispy and golden brown, then remove to paper toweling to drain. Pour off most of the fat from the pan. To the same pan which now has a coating of bacon fat, add the mushrooms, onion, garlic, thyme, tomatoes, and parsley. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to integrate flavors, then return bacon pieces to pan and add white wine. Let wine reduce by half while grits are cooking. To finish, gently fold lobster, lime juice, and Parmesan into grits. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Transfer lobster grits to serving dish and spoon mushroom wine sauce around.

Add the turkey and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring to break up the turkey, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the turkey to a bowl and keep the fat in the pan. Add the chili powder, coriander, cumin, garlic, onions and bell peppers, and cook until soft and fragrant, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the meat back to the pan and stir to incorporate. Add the tomato puree, raisins, capers, olives, thyme and bay leaf, and cook until all of the flavors come together and the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Season with the lime juice, salt and pepper. Cool the filling completely. For the dough: In a large bowl, sift together the flour, masa harina, baking powder and salt. Stir in the melted butter. Gradually add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup water, and work it in with your hands to incorporate; the dough should be easy to handle and not sticky. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Lightly flour a rolling pin and a clean surface. Divide the dough in half. Refrigerate half of the dough and roll out the other half of the dough to 1/8-inch thick. Using a 4-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 10 circles of dough. Repeat with the remaining dough. In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water. Spoon 2 generous tablespoons of filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Brush the edges with the egg wash and then fold the dough to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle. Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork. Chill for at least 30 minutes. For the sauce: In a small mixing bowl, add the crema, cilantro and lime juice. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet. Place the empanadas on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with some egg wash. Using a fork, prick a few holes in the tops of the empanadas for the steam to escape.

Add about a third of the butter and process until thoroughly combined with no visible chunks of butter (the mixture will be slightly yellow). Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a very coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add the vinegar in a single pulse. Gradually add 1/4 cup ice water through the feed tube, pulsing just until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together-it should just hold its shape and be a little crumbly. If still very powdery, pulse again, adding up to 2 tablespoons ice water. Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Pat about two thirds of the dough into a square about 1/2-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining third of dough. Wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. For the filling: Nest a colander in a bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large high-sided pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions, chard stems, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent and starting to brown, 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for an additional minute. Transfer to the colander. Drizzle another tablespoon of olive oil in the pan; add half the chard leaves and a sprinkle of salt. Stir until the leaves are wilted and cooked, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the colander. Repeat with the remaining oil and chard leaves. Press the cooked chard with the back of a large spoon or dry measuring cup to squeeze out as much excess liquid as possible. Let cool completely. Whisk together the ricotta, 1/2 cup Parmesan, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. To assemble the pie: Adjust an oven rack to the bottom position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch-square baking dish and lightly beat the remaining egg in a small bowl. Let the dough pieces stand at room temperature for a few minutes until slightly softened to make rolling easier. Place the larger piece of dough between two large pieces of floured parchment and roll into a rough 14-inch square, 1/8-inch thick (if the dough gets too soft, pop it in the fridge to firm up, then continue rolling). Roll the smaller piece into a rough 11-inch square in the same manner. Transfer the larger piece of dough to the prepared baking dish. Gently press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the dish, leaving some overhang. Brush the bottom and sides with some of the egg wash. Sprinkle the bottom with breadcrumbs and the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Add the cooled chard and pat down gently. Spread the ricotta mixture evenly on top. Put the remaining dough over the filling, lining up the edges with the bottom piece of dough as best you can. Pinch the edges together, trim any excess, then fold and crimp the edges to form a tight seal. Brush the top and edges of the crust with the egg wash and cut decorative slits in the top of the pie. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using. Bake until the crust is deep golden brown, about 1 hour. (If the crust browns too quickly, cover the pie loosely with foil.) Let cool at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 32123,&quot;Thalia&#39;s Tostones and Shrimp Party Boats 3 green plantains 1 1/2 cups cold water 1/4 teaspoon salt Canola oil, for frying Extra-virgin olive oil, for sauteing 12 large fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined Salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch dried oregano Fresh lime slice 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1/2 cup ketchup 1/8 teaspoon minced garlic in olive oil Lime slices Salt, for seasoning Instructions: Cut off both ends of the plantains with large knife. Slice end to end in the grooves and peel. Cut the plantains into approximately 5 (2-inch) pieces. You should have approximately 15 pieces. Put them into a bowl with the cold water and salt. Set aside. In a large skillet heat about 2 to 3 inches of canola oil over medium heat. Dry the tostones with paper towels. Carefully drop them into the hot oil, in batches if necessary, and fry until they turn from peachy white to yellow, but not brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to paper towels to drain. Turn off your flame. Pat the tostones dry and cool briefly. Use a clear bowl or your hand to flatten them into round saucers. Watch through the bowl as you flatten them. Cook&#39;s Note: These are going to be your fiesta boats so they must be thick and large enough to hold the shrimp and for a toothpick to fit through them. So keep that in mind. Don&#39;t get upset if they aren&#39;t a perfect round shape or if they fall apart. That is why I recommend using 3 plantains so you have extra surface to work with. As they cool you can reshape them with your hands. Reheat the oil and add the tostones back to the skillet and fry for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove again to paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Set aside. In a large skillet heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over a low flame. Add the shrimp to the skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste, a pinch of dried oregano and a squeeze of a small slice of lime. Cook until the shrimp turn pink. Party Boat Topping: Combine the mayonnaise, ketchup, and minced garlic in olive oil in a small bowl. The color should be light pink. Squeeze a slice of lime juice into the mixture. Making your Party Boats: Smear about 1/2 teaspoon of the topping on each of the tostones and season with salt. Top with 1 shrimp and secure it with a toothpick. Arrange on a colorful platter and serve.

Toss with the adobo, a pinch of salt and a few cracks of pepper and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oregano, smoked paprika, olives and brine, cilantro, onion, red bell pepper and a pinch of salt and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour in half of the beer, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom, and cook down for 1 minute. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and the rest of the beer. Cook over medium-high heat until the liquids reduce by a third, about 5 minutes, then turn the heat to low and keep warm. For the mofongo: Heat a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat and add the corn oil. Heat until the oil reaches 325 degrees F or it bubbles when in contact with a wooden spoon. Add the plantains to the oil, lower the heat to low and fry, flipping halfway through, until light golden and cooked through but not yet crispy, about 15 minutes. Drain the plantains on paper towels and season with salt. Combine the olive oil and garlic in a mortar and pestle and process to form a paste. Season with about 1 teaspoon salt. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and set aside. Add 5 to 6 chunks of the fried plantains, 1 tablespoon of the oil mixture and about 2 tablespoons of the crushed pork rinds, if using, to the same mortar and pestle. Mix until well mashed and combined. Scoop out the mofongo with a spoon and use your hands to form the mixture into a bowl, creating a cradle for the shrimp stew. Repeat 3 additional times. For serving: Return the stew to medium-high heat and cook until it starts to simmer. Add the peas and cook for 1 minute. Add the shrimp and lemon juice, then continue to cook until the shrimp are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.

Put the chicken on a baking rack set over a baking sheet. Return to the refrigerator and let sit, uncovered, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the mangoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until broken down and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add the white wine and cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Carefully transfer the glaze mixture to a blender; add the pineapple juice, orange juice and the cl de arbol powder and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain into a bowl and season with the honey and salt and pepper. The mixture should be a thick puree. If it is too thick, thin it with a touch of water. Let cool to room temperature before serving. Grill the chicken: Heat your grill to medium for indirect grilling. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Brush the chicken on both sides with the oil; season with salt and pepper. Put the chicken, skin-side down, on the hotter side of the grill (direct heat) and grill until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the chicken and continue grilling until the bottom is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Move to the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat), close the cover and continue grilling until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast (not touching the bone) registers 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 more minutes. During the last few minutes, brush with some of the glaze. Remove the chicken to a platter and drizzle with more of the glaze.

Heat a medium oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat and add the extra-virgin olive oil. While the oil heats up, season the chicken breast with salt on both sides. Add the chicken to the preheated oil, skin-side down. Sear on the first side until the skin is crispy, about 5 minutes. Flip to the other side, place the skillet in the oven, and cook until the chicken is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes more. While the chicken finishes cooking, bring about 2 1/2 cups of the chicken stock to a boil in a small saucepan and season with salt to taste (if needed). Add the couscous, return the stock to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook until all the liquid is absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes. Set a large bowl of ice water on the counter. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and add enough salt so it tastes like the ocean, then add the haricots verts. Blanch the beans until they are bright in color and al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the beans and immediately add them to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain, then transfer the beans to paper towels to dry. Remove the chicken from the oven and set the skillet back on the stovetop. Transfer the chicken breasts to a cutting board. Turn the heat back on under the skillet and deglaze the pan with the remaining chicken stock and the red pepper flakes. Bring the stock to a boil and taste, seasoning with salt if needed. Toss the warm couscous with the beans, 2 tablespoons of pomegranate seeds, the pomegranate molasses and the chopped chives. Serve with the chicken breast and drizzle the pan sauce over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 32129,&quot;Gruyere and Spinach Bakes Vegetable oil cooking spray 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 ounces thinly sliced pancetta, diced into 1/2-inch pieces 2 shallots, chopped 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Two 1/2-to-3/4-inch-thick slices country-style bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 4 cups) 6 large eggs, beaten, at room temperature 2 packed cups chopped spinach 1 1/2 cups grated gruyere (6 ounces) 1/4 cup milk, at room temperature Special equipment: four 10-ounce ramekins Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F.

Chop the chicken thighs and add to a bowl. Add the lime juice and season with salt and pepper. There is no need to marinate, just put the chicken straight on the grill and cook until golden but not too dry, about 20 minutes. Set aside for the sope assembly. For the sope: Mix the Maseca with 1/2 cup water in a bowl and mix by hand, adding more water if necessary, until you get a putty-like consistency. Using your hands, shape the Maseca into circles about 1/4 inch thick and 4 inches wide. Place the sopes in a non-stick pan and cook until light brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. While the sopes are warm, pinch the top side up to create an edge all the way around. Let them cool for 30 minutes. Pour the enchilada sauce into a bowl and dip the sopes in the sauce, completely covering them. Let the sopes sit for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fry the sopes in a deep-fryer or pan filled with enough canola oil to cover them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or a little longer if you want them crispy. Put 1 sope on each serving plate and top with the grilled chicken, refried beans, queso fresco and iceberg lettuce divided evenly among the 4 plates. Garnish with the radishes, jalapenos and tomatillo salsa and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 32132,&quot;Raspberry Cloud Cake 6 tablespoons butter, cubed, at cool room temperature 3 cups raspberries (1 1/2 pints) 1 egg 3/4 cup sifted self-rising cake flour 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Pour in the boiling water and stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and allow it to cool slightly. Knead the dough until smooth, about 2 minutes, adding more flour if needed. Cover with a clean kitchen towel to rest for 30 minutes. For the chicken: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and scatter with the five spice. Add the sesame and canola oil to the pan and sear the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Remove the chicken from the skillet and transfer to a sheet pan. Meanwhile, whisk together the hoisin, soy, vinegar, ginger, garlic and toasted sesame seeds in a small bowl. Drizzle over the chicken then transfer to the oven. Cook for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the glaze has thickened and the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). For the pickles: Whisk together the vinegar, honey, fish sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds in a large bowl. Add the carrots, cucumbers and green onions. Toss to coat and set aside. For the pancakes, place a stainless steel or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Cut the dough into 16 equal pieces, and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep moist. Slightly flatten a piece of dough into an oval approximately 10 centimeters by 5 centimeters (about 4 by 2 inches) and scatter about a teaspoon of green onions to cover the surface. Roll the dough up starting at one long side to form a tight cylinder. Coil the cylinder into a tight spiral, resembling something like a tiny cinnamon bun and gently press the dough in your hand again to form a small disc. Return the now green onion-filled dough under the towel to rest, while you prepare the other pieces in the same way. Roll out a disc into a very thin circle on the floured work surface, approximately 12 to 14 centimeters (5 to 6 inches) round. Lightly oil both sides with sesame oil. Add to the heated pan and cook for about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm while you continue to roll and cook the remaining pancakes. To serve, slice the chicken into 1 centimeter (about 1/2-inch) thick slices and transfer to a platter along with the pickles and green onion pancakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32139,&quot;Chocolate Hot Tamale Generous 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter 2 cups cake flour 1/4 cup almond flour 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons cocoa powder Pinch salt 3/4 cup powdered sugar Pinch ancho chili powder 1 large egg Cookie mold Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the butter and flour in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set the mixer to medium speed and mix just until combined. Add the rest of the dry ingredients; almond flour, cocoa powder, salt, sugar, ancho chili powder. Add the egg and mix just until combined, about 30 seconds. Remove the dough from the bowl and pat into a disk. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough about 1/4-inch thick. Use a knife to cut a square about the size of the mold. Press the dough into the mold. Be sure to press firmly so the impressions of the mold are transferred onto the dough. Remove the dough and place on a parchment paper lined sheet pan. If you do not want to make a mold, you can also use cookie cutters. To do so, roll the dough to the desired size on a lightly floured work surface. Press the cookie cutters into the dough. Lift the cutter and place the cookies on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Bake 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Tempranillo]&quot; 32140,&quot;Meusli 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 1/2 cup skim milk Dash ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon raisins 1/2 apple, peeled, cored and diced or grated 1 tablespoon plain, low-fat yogurt Instructions: Place oats, milk, cinnamon, and raisins in a bowl, stir to combine.

Place the lime in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since the lime will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set it aside briefly, until it cools just enough to handle. Pour vinegar into a blender, turn it on, and then squeeze in lime juice from the micro-waved lime. Leaving the blender running, add 1 at a time through the feed opening: mint, mustard, garlic chives, honey, salt, and ground pepper, and blend until smooth. While keeping the blender running, add oil through the feed opening in a slow stream. Heat grill. Brush fennel and mushrooms with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill until they begin to soften, and then allow cooling. Bring a pot of water to boiling. Have a bowl of ice water standing by. Add salt and blanch green beans for 2 to 3 minutes, then stop the cooking by plunging into the ice water. Separate the lettuce into bite size pieces and add to a mixing bowl with oranges, cucumbers, and mint. Slice the fennel and mushrooms and add to the bowl. Add dressing and toss to coat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 32143,&quot;Pork Stew: Carne Adovada 2 dried red cl peppers 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns 2 teaspoons salt 2 pounds cubed pork 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons butter, cubed 2 tablespoons grape seed oil 1 large white onion, minced 3 garlic clove, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade, and minced 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 tablespoon paprika 4 cups water Instructions: Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.

Reserve the zest, juice the oranges and strain into a medium saucepan. Add the zest strips, salt, bourbon, sugar, tea bags, peppercorns, cloves, 4 bay leaves and 4 cups (1 quart) of water. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes. Pour the brine into a plastic container or pot large enough to hold the turkey, add 20 cups (5 quarts) of ice water and stir to combine. Submerge the turkey, adding more ice water if needed. Weigh it down with a plate to keep it submerged and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. The next day, drain, rinse and pat the turkey dry. Put on a large paper-towel-lined cutting board and let sit out at room temperature until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Stuff the onion, garlic, herbs and remaining bay leaf inside the cavity. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan and brush half of it all over the bird. Sprinkle the skin with black pepper. Tie the legs together with twine. Tuck the wings under the body and put the turkey breast-side-up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Tent the turkey with aluminum foil and roast 2 hours. After 2 hours remove foil from turkey and increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 1 hour more. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 30 minutes. Before serving, remove the vegetables and herbs and discard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 32152,&quot;Grandma Guarnaschelli&#39;s Lasagna with Mini Beef Meatballs 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped<br> 5 garlic cloves, minced<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 2 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes<br> 2 teaspoons dried oregano<br> 1 cup tightly packed fresh basil leaves<br> 12 ounces 90% lean ground beef, preferably chopped sirloin 4 ounces ground veal<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs, toasted, plus more if needed<br> 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese<br> 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves<br> 1 large egg<br> 3 medium garlic cloves, grated<br> 1/3 cup canola oil<br> Kosher salt 1 pound dried lasagna sheets, preferably De Cecco brand<br> 1 pound whole-milk mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced<br> 1 pound whole-milk ricotta cheese<br> 3 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese<br> Instructions: Make the sauce: In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and season with 1 tablespoon salt. Stir in the red pepper flakes and sugar, and cook for about 2 minutes. Then add the tomatoes, with their juices, and the oregano. Cook for a few minutes over high heat, stirring from time to time. Taste for seasoning, add the basil leaves, and remove from the heat. Make the meatballs: Put the beef and veal in a large bowl and spread the meat all over the bottom of the bowl and up the sides a little. (This will help you to distribute the seasonings evenly through the meat.) Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons salt. Then sprinkle the bread crumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and parsley all over the meat and use your hands to mix the ingredients together. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and garlic. Drizzle the egg mixture over the meat. Mix the meat thoroughly with your hands.<br> Test a meatball: Form 1 small meatball (about 1 inch in diameter) with your hands. Heat a splash of the canola oil in a small skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, add the meatball, lower the heat, and cook it over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Taste for seasoning and texture. If it seems too wet, add some more bread crumbs to the mixture in the bowl. If it is too dry, add a splash of water. Adjust the seasoning of the mixture in the bowl as needed. Roll the remaining meat into balls; you should have about 40 very small meatballs.<br> Cook the meatballs: Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add half of the remaining canola oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, remove the pan from the heat and add half of the meatballs in a single layer, spreading them apart somewhat so they have a chance to brown instead of steaming. Return the pan to high heat and brown the meatballs, turning them so they brown all around, until medium-rare, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to transfer them to a baking sheet lined with a kitchen towel to drain. Wipe out the skillet and repeat the process with the remaining canola oil and meatballs.<br> Cook the pasta: Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil in a large pot over high heat and season with 1/2 cup salt. The pasta water should taste like seawater. Add the lasagna sheets, stirring with a slotted spoon to make sure they do not clump or stick to the bottom, and cook for 4 minutes. Drain in a colander, rinse under cold water, and drain again. The pasta should still be very firm to the touch. Separate the sheets carefully so they don&#39;t stick together.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Assemble the lasagna: Spoon a thin layer of the sauce over the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Arrange a layer of pasta sheets over the sauce. Sprinkle one-fourth of the mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmigiano-Reggiano over the pasta, and then add another thin layer of sauce. Dot the surface with about one-third of the meatballs, spacing them evenly. Repeat the layering process two more times. Add a final layer of pasta and top it with the remaining sauce and cheese.<br> Bake the lasagna: Cover the dish tightly with foil and put it in the center of the oven. Bake for 45 minutes. Then raise the oven temperature to 450 degrees F and remove the foil. Bake the lasagna until the top browns slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the lasagna from the oven and allow it to cool for 15 minutes or so before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 32153,&quot;Vegan Coconut Cake 8 ounces silken tofu 1 pound plus 5 ounces sugar 2 cups coconut milk 12 ounces coconut flakes 1 cup canola oil 1 pound plus 4 ounces all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 pound soy margarine 1 pound powdered sugar, sifted 1/4 cup coconut milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

This will be your bloomed saffron. Place the chicken wings in a large bowl and add the bloomed saffron with the lemon juice, onion, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Mix and make sure all the wings are coated with the saffron mixture. Marinate the chicken wings for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours in the refrigerator. Fill a 2-quart nonstick saucepan with water (about 7 cups) and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Rinse the rice a few times to get rid of the excess starch. Add 1 tablespoon of salt and the rice to the boiling water. Return to a boil and par-cook for 6 minutes, just until the rice is tender on the outside but still firm in the middle (test by pinching a single grain). Drain the rice in a colander and rinse with cold water to get rid of the excess salt. Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Remove the wings from the marinade, discarding the onion, and add to the skillet. Sear the wings until golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side, and set them aside. Dry the nonstick saucepan and place it over medium heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and the butter to the saucepan and heat until shimmering, then add the turmeric and arrange the wings skin-side down in the saucepan in a single layer. Spoon the rice over the wings and press it down using a spoon or spatula. Using the end of a wooden spoon, poke 5 holes in the rice to allow steam to escape and promote the formation of the crust. Wrap the lid in a clean kitchen towel and place it on the saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until the rice is tender and the wings are crispy and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Remove the lid, place a plate on the saucepan and carefully flip it over, crispy side up. You can also scoop out the rice and then place the wings on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 32166,&quot;Dutch Baby with Berry Compote 1/2 pint raspberries 1/2 pint blueberries 1/2 cup sugar 1 cinnamon stick Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon 6 to 7 strawberries, sliced 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon orange zest 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup milk 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus 1 tablespoon cold for the pans 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 large eggs Pinch salt Whipped cream, for serving 1 tablespoon fresh mint leaves, sliced into thin ribbons, for serving 1 tablespoon shaved bittersweet chocolate, for serving Instructions: For the berry compote: Combine the raspberries, blueberries, sugar, cinnamon stick, lemon zest and juice and a splash of water to a small pot.

While the sausages simmer, slice the bacon into 1/2-inch wide batons. Add a drizzle of olive oil to the pan and heat over medium-high heat. Thick cut the knocks on an angle and add them to the skillet and sear at the edges, remove the sausages and add the bacon and render until almost crisp but not-quite. Remove the bacon from the skillet to paper towel to cool but reserve the drippings. In a casserole dish, stir together the beans, garlic, and shallots and season with lots of coarse black pepper. Smooth out in the dish and wipe down the sides of the dish. Nestle the chunks of knocks into the beans, arranging them all around the casserole and allowing them to peek up and out a bit. Dot the beans with thick Worcestershire sauce. Scatter the chiles and scallions and herbs over top of the casserole. Scatter the bacon over top and using a pastry brush, dot with some of the drippings. Cover and store for a make-ahead meal. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the casserole in a hot oven on a baking sheet liner until the top surface is crispy in spots and bubbly all over. Slice the brown bread into 1-inch thick slices.

Put the spinach to one side so that you can add it to the wok or pan at the last minute, as it cooks very quickly. Prepare the rest of the Chinese greens; i normally cut the Chinese broccoli into strips and the bok choy into quarters. Plunge the greens into boiling water for about 1 1/2 minutes until just tender, and drain well. Put the oil and the ginger into a very large, hot wok or other suitable pan and cook for about 30 seconds. Add the scallions and the rest of the ingredients apart from the seasoning. Stir, then add the spinach and toss so that everything is coated in sauce. The vegetables will sizzle and stir-fry. The oyster and soy sauce will reduce, just coating the greens. At this point season to taste. Stir-fry for a further minute and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 32172,&quot;Beer-Braised Bratwurst 1 onion, sliced 1 clove garlic, smashed 1 bay leaf Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into pieces 4 links fully cooked bratwurst (about 1 pound) 1/4 cup lager Sub rolls, sauerkraut and mustard, for serving Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high.

Remove bacon and set aside to drain. Add onion, celery, and sage to the bacon fat rendered in the skillet, and cook until onions are translucent and celery is soft, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add sage and broken-up bread to the skillet. Stir in parsley, butter, oysters, salt, and pepper. Lightly toss stuffing, but mix well, and let cool. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F. Butterfly the turkey breast with smooth side down and stuff, folding edges over to hold stuffing. (You may want to secure with skewers or cotton kitchen twine.) Season turkey breast with salt and pepper and place into the oven to roast until it reaches an internal temperature of about 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. While turkey is in oven, place the turkey neck and giblets in a medium saucepan with 4 cups water and cook until you have about 1 cup of giblet stock. Reserve the neck and giblets, removing meat from neck when cool enough to handle and chopping giblets. When turkey is done, remove breast to a platter to let rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Skim most of the fat from the pan juices, reserving 1/3 cup of the fat. Add the wine to the remaining pan juices and cook over medium high heat until reduced by half. In a separate saucepan, heat reserved 1/3 cup of fat and whisk in flour over moderately low heat for a few minutes to make a roux. Add stock and wine reduction, continuing to cook until gravy simmers. Add reserved cooked and chopped giblets and neck meat. Slice turkey to reveal stuffed interior and arrange on plate.

Spray four 9-inch cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. This cake batter will be made in two batches. You will color the first batch red and the second batch blue. To make the first batter, sift the flour three times, then measure 2 1/2 cups. Combine the sifted flour with the cocoa and salt in a bowl. Set aside.<br> In another bowl, stir together the buttermilk and vanilla. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the sugar, shortening and eggs. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.<br> In a small bowl, stir together the baking soda, vinegar and red food coloring. Feast your eyes on the colorful chemical reaction! Fold the food coloring mixture into the cake batter. Pour the batter into two of the prepared cake pans. Make the second batter in the same manner, using the blue food coloring. Pour the blue batter into the remaining two prepared pans. Bake all four pans until a toothpick comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely wire racks. Using a serrated knife, level the top of each cake layer. Place one layer on a serving plate; spread Boiled Icing over the top. Continue stacking and icing until you have used all of the layers. Cover the outside of the cake with Boiled Icing. Cook the milk and flour in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it reaches the pudding stage (the consistency of glue), no longer than 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm. Strain to remove any clumps of flour. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the sugar, butter, shortening, vanilla and salt on medium speed until nice and fluffy. One teaspoon at a time, add the pudding mixture. Beat on high speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Voila!

You will need to repeat this several times until the mixture is milky in appearance, pureeing for approximately 3 minutes. Combine the remaining ingredients with the pureed almonds. Process this in a blender or food processor in batches until smooth. Strain thoroughly and chill for at least 1 hour. For the lobster: Blanch the lobsters in a pot of boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the lobsters from water and let cool. Preheat a grill pan on medium heat for 10 minutes. Remove the tails from the lobsters and crack the shells to remove the meat. Cut the tail meat into 1/2-inch pieces and put 3 pieces each onto 8 (5-inch) skewers. Coat the lobster with olive oil and season with lemon zest, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Grill the skewers for 2 to 3 minutes until the lobster is firm. Place the skewers in small glasses and pour the soup over the lobster.

Put the diced figs in a medium bowl and add the warm water. Let soak until softened. Whisk the unbleached flour, cake flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. Put the maple syrup, milk, eggs, egg yolks, and canola oil in a medium bowl and stir with the whisk to combine. Add the mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring with a spoon just until all the flour is moistened. This should be a wet batter, because the oats absorb a lot of the liquid during baking. Fold the walnuts and figs into the batter (the figs do not need to be drained). Divide the batter evenly between two oiled 9- by 5-inch loaf pans. Bake for about 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (If your oven bakes unevenly, rotate the pans from left to right and front to back about halfway through the baking time.) Remove the pans from the oven and use a pastry brush to glaze the tops of the loaves with maple syrup. Set them on a rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Turn the loaves out of the pans and set them on the rack to cool completely before serving. Wrap any leftovers tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. They may also be frozen, wrapped first in aluminum foil and then in plastic wrap or a heavy-duty freezer bag. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 32185,&quot;Fresh Raspberry Gratins 8 extra-large egg yolks 2/3 cup superfine or caster sugar 1 cup sweet Marsala wine 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 6 half-pints fresh raspberries Granulated sugar Instructions: Preheat the broiler for at least 15 minutes, with the rack about 5 inches away from the heat. To make the sabayon, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of simmering (not boiling) water until thick and creamy, about 4 to 5 minutes. Whisk almost constantly, scraping the egg mixture from the bottom of the bowl. Slowly whisk in the Marsala wine and continue whisking over the simmering water for about 5 more minutes, until the mixture is thick and smooth, like a soft whipped cream. It should register about 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Whisk in the vanilla, remove from the heat, and set aside. Place one snug layer of raspberries in 6 (6 to 7-inch) shallow gratin dishes. (Each of my dishes holds about one half-pint of raspberries.) Spoon enough sabayon over the raspberries to cover them. Sprinkle each one lightly with granulated sugar. Arrange the dishes on 2 sheet pans and place themone pan at a timeunder the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the tops of the gratins are lightly browned.

Halve the long strips across to give 2 shorter strips (to echo the size of the bell pepper strips). Don&#39;t get too hung up on precision, though; you&#39;re just trying to cut the chicken into uniform shapes. Add the oregano, cumin, salt, sugar, 1 tablespoon garlic flavored oil, and the lime juice to the chicken. Stir to combine and let marinate while you get on with the onions and bell peppers. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F if you wish to warm your tortillas. Warm the peanut or olive oil in a large frying pan or wok and fry the onion slices over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Spread the tortillas out on a cookie sheet and put it in the oven to warm. Add the bell pepper strips to the pan with the onion and cook for 10 minutes. When both the onions and peppers are tender, remove them to a bowl. Warm the remaining 2 teaspoons garlic flavored oil in the pan over medium heat and add the chicken with its marinade. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Check that the chicken is piping hot and cooked through, then add the onions and bell peppers. Stir together, then transfer them to a serving dish. Take the warmed tortillas out of the oven and put them on the table alongside the chicken mixture and all the other accoutrements. Wrap what you fancy in the tortillas and eat straightaway.

Put the cabbage, carrot, green onions and Spanish onions in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper, toss to combine. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss again. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours. For the ketchup: Whisk together the ketchup and chipotles in a small bowl. For the mustard: In another small bowl, whisk together the mustard and horseradish. For the burgers: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to high. Form the ground beef into four 3/4-inch-thick patties by tossing the meat from hand to hand and flattening gently. Make a well in the center of each patty with your thumb. Brush the patties with oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Grill the burgers until slightly charred and crusty, about 3 minutes (5 minutes for turkey, which must be cooked through to serve). Flip and continue grilling until slightly charred and crusty on the other side, 4 to 5 minutes longer for medium doneness (another 5 minutes for turkey). During the last minute of cooking, top each burger with two slices of cheese; cover the grill and cook until the cheese has melted. Transfer the burgers to a platter. If desired, toast the buns on the grill, flat-side down, for about 15 seconds, or until golden. Place the burgers on the bun bottoms. Top with some chipotle ketchup, horseradish mustard, Russian slaw dressing and a few potato chips, if using. Set the bun tops on top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 32195,&quot;Crisp Cheese Wafers Friuli-Style 1/2 teaspoon polenta flour 1/3 cup loosely packed grated Montasio cheese or Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: Turn the heat under a 9-inch skillet to medium low and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of polenta flour into the pan. Immediately sprinkle the cheese over the polenta, distributing it evenly. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, running the edge of a spatula under the perimeter of the wafer as the cheese melts and hardens to loosen it from the pan. Remove from heat and let it settle for 1 minute. Using toaster tongs or a large tweezer and a spatula, lift the wafer from the skillet and turn over. Return to heat for 1 more minute. Transfer the cheese wafer from the pan to a platter. If it breaks it doesn&#39;t matter because you must break it up anyway to eat it. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 32196,&quot;Spiced Kettle Corn 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup popcorn kernels (unpopped) 3 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon fine salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon cayenne Instructions: Have a hot pad or kitchen towel and a paper grocery bag or large baking sheet handy. Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or pan over medium heat. Place a couple of kernels of popcorn in the pan. When the kernels pop, proceed to the next step. Once the oil is hot enough, add the butter and stir quickly into the oil to prevent burning. Immediately add the popcorn and stir (the butter may not be completely melted). Add the sugar right away and stir again. Cover the pan, and start shaking it gently back and forth on the burner, using a hot pad or kitchen towel to protect your hands. Keep shaking as the popcorn pops. Once you start hearing 1 or 2 seconds of quiet between the pops, turn the heat off immediately. This means the popcorn is mostly popped. (Be careful not to overcook, as the popcorn can easily burn.) Pour the popcorn into the paper bag or onto the baking sheet and sprinkle with salt, cinnamon, and cayenne. Allow to cool a few minutes before placing in a bowl. (Careful, the hot sugar makes the popcorn extremely hot!) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32197,&quot;Pasta Primavera Kosher salt 12 ounces tricolor fusilli 4 cups broccoli florets 3 carrots, thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips 1 cup frozen peas 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth Freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or basil Juice of 1/2 lemon Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs, adding the broccoli, carrots, bell pepper and peas during the last 3 minutes of cooking. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain the pasta and vegetables and return to the pot. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, about 1 minute. Add the vegetable broth, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste; bring to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter until melted and the sauce is thickened, about 1 more minute. Pour the sauce over the pasta and vegetables and add the cheese, parsley and lemon juice. Cook over low heat, stirring, until the cheese melts, about 1 minute, adding enough of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce. Season with salt and pepper and top with more cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 32198,&quot;Thai Peanut Burgers 1/2 cup Jif?

With a hand held mixer in a large bowl, cream the butter until fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, add both sugars, and continue beating until light, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl again, if needed, then add the egg mixture, beating for about 1 minute. Sift the salt with the flour. Reduce the mixer to a low speed and then add the flour mixture, mixing just until blended. Turn the dough out of the bowl. Divide the dough in half and place each half between 2 pieces of lightly floured parchment or waxed paper. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a disk about 1/4-inch thick. Slide the dough/parchment sheet onto a flat cookie sheet, or on the back of a rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours or overnight. Evenly space the racks in the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Place 1 disk of the cookie dough on a clean work surface and peel off the top sheet of paper. Cut cookies with a 1 1/2-inch round or a decorative shaped cookie cutter directly on the parchment. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to a parchment-lined or non-stick baking sheet, spacing them about 1-inch apart. Repeat with other sheet of dough. Any excess dough can be re-rolled, refrigerated, and cut. Bake until the edges of the cookies are a light golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool. For decorating: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar with just enough milk to make a thick icing. Transfer icing to a small plastic bag. Press the icing into a corner of the bag and snip off the corner with scissors to make a small opening. Gently press the icing onto the cookie to make a simple pattern. Decorate as desired. Set aside for about 1 hour to let the icing harden. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Walnut Orange Variation: Add 3/4 teaspoon grated zest of orange with the sugar, and 2/3 cup finely chopped walnuts with the flour. Pecan-Cinnamon Variation: Mix 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon with the flour, and add 2/3 cup finely chopped pecans with the flour. Sprinkle the tops of the cookies before baking with a mixture of 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon. Almond Variation: Reduce the vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon and add 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract. Add 3/4 cup chopped toasted sliced almonds to the dough with the flour. If desired, for decoration, brush the tops of the unbaked cookies with some egg white and press a few un-toasted almond slices onto the top of each cookie prior to baking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 32200,&quot;Caprese Skewers with Plum Balsamic Drizzle 20 bocconcini (mozzarella balls) 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 15-ounce jar plum preserves 1 cup balsamic vinegar<br> 20 fresh rosemary sprigs 2 pints grape tomatoes<br> Instructions: Put the bocconcini in a large bowl with the olive oil, red pepper flakes and some salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. In a food processor or blender, puree the plums with the balsamic vinegar until smooth. Pour the mixture into a medium pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn the heat down to simmer and cook until the mixture has reduced by about half, several minutes. It should be fairly thick, but remember, it will continue to thicken as it cools. When cool, pour it into a squeeze bottle and refrigerate. Trim about 2 inches of the leaves off the bottoms of the rosemary sprigs. Skewer a tomato followed by a bocconcino onto each. Arrange on a platter, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Strain and set aside; reserve the amaretto. Beat the butter, 2 cups all-purpose flour, the almond flour, granulated sugar, milk powder, salt and egg in a large bowl with a mixer on low speed until combined but not fluffy, about 1 minute. Mix in the currants and candied citron. Toss the candied cherries with the remaining 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour. Stir into the dough using a wooden spoon. Divide the dough in half and roll each half into a 12-inch-long log. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 5 hours. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice the frozen dough into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Arrange the slices 1 inch apart on the prepared pans. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are firm and light golden around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the pans, then brush the tops and sides of each cookie with the reserved amaretto. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Roll the edges of each cookie in the confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 32202,&quot;Smothered Pork Medallions with Sage and Apples 4 (6-ounce) boneless center-cut pork medallions Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 large onion, sliced 1 cooking apple, like Rome, Gravenstein, or Golden Delicious, peeled, halved, cored, and sliced 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh sage leaves 1/2 cup chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard Instructions: Heat a large heavy bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Dry the pork medallions well and season with salt and pepper. Add the oil to the skillet and heat until shimmering. Lay the pork in the pan and cook until browned on the first side, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the second side is browned, about 3 minutes more. Transfer the pork to a plate, and cover loosely with foil. Add the onions to the skillet, stir and season with salt and pepper. Cover, and reduce heat to medium and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the cider vinegar and stir, scraping up the browned bits that cling to the skillet. Add the onions to the pork. Add butter to skillet, raise heat to medium-high. Add the apples and sage; cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in the broth and mustard, and simmer until the apples soften, about 2 minutes. Return the onions and any accumulated juices from the pork to the skillet. Simmer to thicken slightly, about 2 minutes. Nestle the pork in the onions and heat until the meat is warmed through. Divide the pork medallions among 4 plates and smother them with apples and onions.

Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Place broccoli into pot and cook for 2 minutes. You just want to parboil the broccoli at this point since you will saute it later on. Using a spider strainer, remove broccoli from pot and shock it in a bowl of ice water. When broccoli is completely cool, place it in a colander and allow to drain. Refresh the bowl of ice water. Bring the water back to a boil. Add green beans and cook for 4 minutes. Like the broccoli, you just want to parboil the green beans. Remove green beans from pot with spider strainer and add to ice water. When green beans are completely cool, add them to the colander and allow to drain. In a large saute pan, heat olive oil. When almost smoking, add the garlic and saute for about 45 seconds. When the garlic starts to brown, remove immediately and discard. Overcooking the garlic will impart a very bitter taste to the dish. Add the red pepper flakes, broccoli and green beans to the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 32204,&quot;Chocolate Raspberry Fizz 5 raspberries, fresh or frozen 1/2 oz. chocolate liqueur 1/2 oz. hazelnut liqueur 3 oz.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and add the ice cubes. Place the turkey and brine into a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. For the herb-roasted turkey breast: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the garlic, parsley, rosemary, thyme, lemon zest, olive oil, salt and black pepper in a small mixing bowl and mix well. Rub the turkey all over with the herb-olive oil mixture to completely cover. Place the turkey in a large cast-iron skillet and roast for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees F and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F, 75 minutes to 90 minutes. Cover with foil if the turkey starts to get too dark. Let the turkey rest for 10 minutes. Reserve all the juices from the bottom of the skillet. Shred the turkey when cool enough to handle and reserve. For the grilled cremini mushrooms: Preheat a grill to high. Add the creminis, olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper to a medium mixing bowl and toss well to coat.

Reserve 2 tablespoons of the marinade for the peanut sauce. Add the remaining marinade to a large bowl with the chicken and toss to combine. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, up to overnight. For the peanut sauce: Process the peanuts in a food processor until finely ground but not a paste. Transfer the peanuts to a medium saucepan and add the coconut milk, tamarind paste, vinegar, brown sugar, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup water and the reserved 2 tablespoons marinade. Bring to a boil over high heat. Immediately reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Set aside. For the toppings and serving: Place a fine-mesh sieve over a heatproof bowl near the stove. Process the garlic in a food processor until finally chopped but not a paste. Add the garlic to a medium skillet with the oil and set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is light golden brown (be careful not to let it get too dark or it can become bitter), 4 to 5 minutes. Immediately pour the oil and garlic into the sieve and let drain, reserving the garlic oil. Spread the garlic on a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Return 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil to the skillet (reserve the rest for another use) and add the peanuts. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the peanuts are heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and toss with the brown sugar and a pinch of salt. Let cool completely. Heat a 2-burner cast-iron grill pan over medium-high heat until evenly hot, about 10 minutes. Divide the chicken among twelve 10-inch bamboo skewers, packing the pieces close together.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the pecans and toast, while stirring, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove the pecans from the pan and set aside.<br> Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, vanilla, 2 1/4 teaspoons water and cayenne, if using, to the saucepan. Simmer over medium, stirring, for about 1 minute or until the sugar is melted, all the ingredients are combined and the sauce is thick. Add the pecans back into the saucepan and stir to coat evenly.<br> Spread the coated pecans evenly on the baking sheet and toast in the oven for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. You can make these up to 5 days ahead of time and store in an airtight container at room temperature.<br> For the latkes: Now, latke time! Peel and shred the sweet potatoes one at a time using the large holes of a box grater or with a food processor into a large bowl. Dry the shredded potatoes very well with a towel, squeezing out all the moisture. Dry potatoes lead to crunchier latkes! Add the eggs, potato starch, salt and cinnamon to the sweet potatoes and mix to combine. You can use a large spoon or your hands.<br> Set up a cooling rack over paper towels near your stovetop.<br> Heat up a large pan over medium-high heat and add canola oil. You want enough oil to come up slightly on the sides of your latkes. When it\u2019s ready, the oil will sizzle when you add a tiny bit of potato batter. Pro tip: Add a small piece of carrot to your frying pan; it magically absorbs all the brown bits that fall off so your latkes don\u2019t burn.<br> Scoop 1/4 packed cup of potato mixture into the pan for each latke and flatten slightly into a patty. Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Fry in batches and do not overcrowd the pan, as that lowers the oil temperature, which can affect the crunchiness of your latkes. Place the latkes on the rack and let cool slightly.<br> For assembly: There are 2 options for toasting your marshmallow topping. I don\u2019t recommend broiling with the marshmallows on the latkes, as it\u2019s easy to slightly burn the latke edges. If you have a culinary torch at home, pile about 8 mini marshmallows onto the center of each of the latkes. Torch until browned and soft, and immediately place a few candied pecans into the marshmallows.<br> If you don\u2019t have a torch, preheat your broiler to low and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Make 10 to 12 piles of 8 mini marshmallows around the baking sheet (one for each latke you made). Broil for 1 minute just until browned and soft. Use a spatula to place a pile of the marshmallows on each latke.

Reduce the heat to low and slowly cook the leeks until tender. Transfer to a utility platter, cover and keep warm. (Keep the same pan handy to sear the scallops.) While the leeks are cooking, in a separate medium saucepot heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat (reserving the last tablespoon of oil) and saute the onion and garlic until the onion becomes translucent. Add the mango peach juice and curry paste and let reduce by two-thirds. Whisk in the chocolate chips and cook for about 10 minutes to integrate flavors. While the sauce is cooking, dust the scallops on both sides with chili powder and cocoa powder, and season with a little salt. Return to the saucepot, and reduce the heat to low. Take 1/4 cup of the hot sauce and put it into a separate bowl. Gradually add the sour cream into the hot sauce, a spoonful at a time to temper the sour cream and keep it from \breaking.<br> Gradually add the bowl of tempered sour cream to the sauce a little at a time and allow to thicken over low heat, about 5 more minutes. While the sauce is thickening, return to the pan in which you sauteed the leeks and if you have not already done so, remove them to a utility platter to keep warm. Wipe out the same pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat to the smoking point and melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in it (reserving the last 2 tablespoons of butter). Sear each side of the scallop leaving undisturbed for the first 2 minutes or so to let the caramelization process to begin. This will not only allow the seasonings integrate into the surface of the scallops, but will prevent tearing. Further cook the scallops until you see (from the side) that they are beginning to turn opaque inside. When you notice that the opacity extends about 1/4 of the way down from each flat side of the scallop, remove the scallops to a plate and cover them with a pot lid to allow carryover cooking to take over, to avoid overcooking the scallops. Spoon some leeks into the center of serving plate. Top with scallops and spoon curry sauce around. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 32252,&quot;Champagne and Pomegranate Cocktail 1 sugar cube 1 fluid ounce pomegranate juice 3 fluid ounces dry sparkling wine Pomegranate seeds, optional Instructions: Place a sugar cube in the bottom of a champagne flute.

Put the graham crackers in a small bowl. Thread a strawberry stem-end first onto a 6-inch wooden skewer and dip the tip straight down into the chocolate to coat half the strawberry. Lift and twist slightly, letting any excess chocolate fall back into the bowl. Dip the tip of the strawberry into the graham crackers, leaving a stripe of chocolate visible. Carefully grasp the exposed base of the strawberry and rotate and push the skewer until 1 inch of the skewer extends beyond the tip. Stick the skewer upright into a large sheet of floral foam. Repeat with the remaining strawberries. Allow the chocolate to set, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, shape two wet floral foam bricks so they fit snugly inside a 5-inch square planter, flowerpot or cardboard box. Do so by holding the bricks together and cutting them with a serrated knife so the resulting rectangle is 5 inches wide by 5 inches long by 8 inches tall. Wrap the rectangle tightly with plastic wrap and fit it into the planter (it will extend to the top). Drape about 6 large kale leaves rib-side down over the planter, sticking the stems into the planter. Try to cover the foam entirely. (Reserve the remaining kale for another use.)<br> Once the chocolate-dipped strawberries are set, top each skewer with a marshmallow.<br> Stick 1 skewer into the top center of the wet foam, pushing the skewer in so about 1 inch of wood is still exposed. Continue sticking the remaining skewers into the foam in concentric circles, packing the strawberries as closely as possible without touching, and working outward. When you&#39;re done, only a little frill of kale should be visible below the strawberries.<br> Just before serving, wave a kitchen propane torch near the marshmallows until toasted to a golden brown.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 32266,&quot;Spinach and Artichoke Pasta Bake One 10-ounce bag frozen spinach 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for the pasta water<br> 1 pound rigatoni<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br> Pinch crushed red pepper flakes One 4-ounce jar artichoke hearts packed in oil, drained and roughly chopped<br> 4 ounces cream cheese, cubed<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella Instructions: Microwave the spinach according to the package instructions, then allow to cool slightly.

Coat the pan with olive oil and add the diced onions, carrots, celery and garlic. Season with some salt and pepper, and then sweat the vegetables (cook without adding any color) for about 5 minutes. Add the kale, corn, edamame and red bell pepper and cook for a few more minutes so they have a chance to saute. Add the stock, season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Cook until the vegetables are soft, 7 to 8 minutes. Serve. Begin by fortifying store-bought broth (this will add more depth of flavor to the finished soup). In a large stock pot, add the broth, 1 quart cold water, chicken carcasses, peppercorns, celery, carrot, onion, garlic, thyme and bay leaf. Set over medium heat and slowly bring to a rolling boil. Heating the broth up slowly will draw out the flavors of the chicken bones, vegetables and aromatics. Season lightly with salt and let the stock simmer (slightly covered) for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When done, it will have reduced by about a quarter, leaving you with approximately 3 quarts of rich stock. Strain the stock through a large sieve, discarding the bones and vegetables. Chill the stock immediately until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 32272,&quot;Panini with Caramelized Onion, Pear and Fontina 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for drizzling 1 tablespoon butter 1 medium onion, chopped 8 thin slices of a large loaf of crusty, chewy Italian bread 1 pound fontina, shredded or sliced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage 1 red skinned ripe pear, thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat a large grill pan or griddle over medium to medium high heat.

Butter the bottoms and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans; line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the parchment and dust the bottom and side of each pan with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the granulated sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time until incorporated, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the milk in two batches, until just incorporated. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until smooth, about 30 seconds. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and lightly tap each against the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake until lightly golden and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes in the pans, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely; discard the parchment. Meanwhile, make the filling: Beat the cream cheese and coffee extract in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. If using a stand mixer, switch to the whisk attachment. Add 1 1/2 cups heavy cream and the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Divide the filling between 2 small bowls (about 1 heaping cup each). Stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon heavy cream and the espresso powder in a small bowl to make a paste; fold into one bowl of filling. Fold the cocoa powder into the other bowl of filling. Refrigerate until ready to use. Make the frosting: Beat the butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 teaspoon coffee extract, the vanilla and salt until just combined. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until fluffy, about 4 more minutes; set aside. Make the ganache: Put the chocolate in a small bowl. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan until steaming, then pour over the chocolate. Let sit 5 minutes, then stir until melted and smooth. Stir in the remaining 1/2 teaspoon coffee extract; let sit until cool but still pourable, about 1 hour. Assemble the cake: Using a long serrated knife, carefully slice each cake in half horizontally to make 2 thin layers; brush the cut sides of each cake with coffee liqueur, if desired. Put 1 cake layer cut-side up on a plate and spread with 1 heaping cup frosting. Top with another cake layer and spread the coffee filling over the top. Top with another cake layer and spread with the cocoa filling. Top with the remaining cake layer. Frost the top and side of the cake with the remaining frosting. Pour the ganache over the top and gently spread with an offset spatula, letting it drip down the side. (If the ganache is too thick to pour, microwave in 10-second intervals until smooth.) Let set about 20 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 32298,&quot;Blue Crab Cake Panini 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/3 cup minced celery 1/3 cup minced green onion, plus 1/4 cup 1/2 cup cracker crumbs 1 egg 2 tablespoons minced parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 pound lump Maryland blue crabmeat 8 semi-hard round buns 8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Onion Relish, recipe follows Basil Sauce, recipe follows 2 small garlic cloves 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, washed 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 3/4 cup mayonnaise Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup red onion, chopped 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano Instructions: Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium high heat. Saute celery and 1/3 cup green onions until soft. Set aside. Preheat the broiler. In a large bowl, mix the cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup green onions, egg, parsley, seafood seasoning, and salt. Add the sauteed onion and celery, and the crabmeat and gently mix. Form the crab mixture into 8 cakes using either a round mold or your hands. Place the cakes, not touching, on a metal baking sheet. Broil the crab cakes for about 4 minutes. Gently turn them over, careful not to break them, and broil the other side. At the end of 8 minutes, they should be nicely browned. Heat stovetop grill on medium high heat. Alternately, you can make this recipe on an outdoor grill. \Crown\ the buns by cutting off the rounded tops with a bread knife. This will leave you with 8 buns with flat tops. Cut in half lengthwise, if not already split. Brush the outsides with olive oil. On the inside of the top half of each bun, spread about 1 tablespoon of the basil sauce and 1/2 tablespoon of the onion relish. You can vary the amounts to your taste. Place a crab cake on the bottom half of the bun and cover with the top half of the bun. Grill each sandwich for 1 to 2 minutes per side. While you grill, press down on the sandwich with a metal spatula. This will flatten the sandwich, and make pretty grill marks on the bun. The sandwich is done when it is lightly browned on each side. Cut the sandwiches into halves or quarters and serve. Mix all ingredients in a food processor and set aside. Toss the ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 32299,&quot;Bibb and Butternut Salad with Pumpkin Seeds, Cracklings and Cranberry Vinaigrette 1 large butternut squash 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic, peeled and chopped 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup pumpkin seeds 1 tablespoon Madras curry powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper Salt and pepper 3 heads Boston Bibb lettuce 1 head frisee lettuce 1 cup olive oil 1 cup trimmed turkey skin, torn into pieces 1 cup dried cranberries 1 cup frozen cranberries 1 cup orange juice 1 cup sugar 1 cinnamon stick 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 1 shallot, finely diced 1/4 cup pumpkin seed oil, plus more for drizzling 1/2 cup shaved Parmesan Instructions: Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.

Butter a 10- to 12-cup Bundt pan, making sure to get in all the crevices; dust with flour and tap out the excess. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the sour cream and vanilla. (The batter may look curdled.) Reduce the mixer speed to medium low and add the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk; beat until combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 15 minutes in the pan; loosen the edge of the cake with a knife and invert onto the rack to cool completely. Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, lemon juice, vanilla and 1 tablespoon water in a bowl; add a splash more water if the glaze is too thick. Spoon over the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Decorate with nonpareils. Let stand until set, 5 to 10 minutes.

On a cutting board, mash the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt together with the flat-side of a knife into a paste. Add the rosemary and continue to mash until incorporated. Put the garlic-rosemary paste in a small bowl and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil; stir to combine. Season both sides of the brisket with a fair amount of kosher salt and ground black pepper. Place a large roasting pan or Dutch oven over medium-high flame and coat with the remaining olive oil. Put the brisket in the roasting pan and sear to form a nice brown crust on both sides. Lay the vegetables all around the brisket and pour the rosemary paste over the whole thing. Add the wine and tomatoes; toss in the parsley and bay leaves. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and transfer to the oven. Bake for about 3 to 4 hours, basting every 30 minutes with the pan juices, until the beef is fork tender. Remove the brisket to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes. Scoop the vegetables out of the roasting pan and onto a platter, cover to keep warm. Pour out some of the excess fat, and put the roasting pan with the pan juices on the stove over medium-high heat. Boil and stir for 5 minutes until the sauce is reduced by 1/2. (If you want a thicker sauce, mix 1 tablespoon of flour with 2 tablespoons of wine or water and blend into the gravy). Slice the brisket across the grain (the muscle lines) at a slight diagonal. Serve with potato pancakes. Using a box grater or food processor, coarsely grate the potatoes and onions. Put the grated potatoes and onions together in cheesecloth or a tea towel and twist it to squeeze out the excess liquid. Put the dry potatoes and onions in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Fold in the egg whites and chives to bind the mixture together. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat and coat with 1/4-inch of oil. For each pancake, take about 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture and drop into the hot oil; gently flatten with a spatula so they fry up thin and crispy. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until golden. Remove to paper towels to drain; season with salt while the potato pancakes are still hot. Continue frying, adding more oil as needed, until all of the mixture is used up. Serve immediately with apple sauce, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 32313,&quot;Smoky Orange Margarita 1 cup sugar 1 cup fresh lime juice<br> 1 cup orange liqueur<br> 1 cup mezcal<br> 1/2 cup fresh orange juice 1 clementine, cut into wheels Margarita salt, for rims Instructions: Combine the sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepot.

Line the cups of two 12-cup muffin tins with cupcake liners. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted, about 1 1/2 minutes (or melt it in a double boiler). Put the granulated sugar, brown sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the melted chocolate and beat to combine. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, and beat on low until just combined. Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners, about 1/4 cup batter in each. Bake until the cupcakes are domed slightly and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool completely on a rack. For the icing: Make the icing right before you are ready to frost the cupcakes. Combine the granulated sugar, buttermilk, butter, baking soda and vanilla in a medium to large heavy-bottomed saucepan (the liquid will double in volume). Insert a candy thermometer, bring to a boil and boil over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches soft-ball stage (235 degrees F), 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat as it hits the soft-ball stage to avoid over caramelizing. Working very quickly but carefully, pour the caramel into the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium-high speed until cooled to warm, about 5 minutes. Working quickly, spoon about a tablespoon of the caramel icing onto each cupcake. (Caramel hardens a little as it cools; whip in a splash of heavy cream to loosen it up if needed.) Let stand until set, about 5 minutes. Decorate with edible silver dragees. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32321,&quot;Just-Add-Water Miso Chicken Noodle Soup 1 tablespoon yellow miso 1/2 teaspoon chicken base<br> 1/2 teaspoon chili-garlic sauce, such as sambal oelek 1/8 teaspoon grated fresh ginger Small handful broken-up dried rice vermicelli 1/3 cup shredded rotisserie chicken 2 shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded, caps sliced thinly 6 snow peas or sugar snap peas, strings removed, sliced thinly on the bias 1 scallion, greens only, thinly sliced Instructions: Add the miso, chicken base, chili-garlic sauce and ginger to the bottom of a lidded 16-ounce heat-safe container.

Set aside. Place a layer of cake, jam side up, in the bottom of a 2 1/2- to 3-quart glass serving bowl, cutting the pieces to fit. Top with a layer of raspberries and orange cream. Repeat the layers of cake, raspberries, and orange cream, ending with a third layer of cake jam side down and raspberries. Whip the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When it starts to thicken, add the sugar and vanilla and continue to whip until it forms stiff peaks. Decorate the trifle with whipped cream. The trifle can sit for a while at room temperature. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper. Cream the butter and 2 cups of the granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. With the mixer on medium speed, beat in the eggs, one at a time, and the orange zest. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the orange juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean. While the cakes bake, cook the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar with the remaining 1/2 cup orange juice in a small saucepan over low heat until the sugar dissolves. When the cakes are done, let them cool for 10 minutes. Take them out of the pans and place them on a baking rack set over a tray. Spoon the orange syrup over the cakes and allow the cakes to cool completely. To glaze, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and orange juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth. Add a few more drops of juice, if necessary, to make it pour easily. Pour over the top of one cake and allow the glaze to dry. Wrap well, and store in the refrigerator. Combine the milk and orange zest in a medium stainless-steel saucepan over medium heat and bring almost to a boil. Remove from the heat. Beat the egg yolks and sugar on medium-high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, sprinkle on the cornstarch. Beat on medium-low speed until combined, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture back into the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. (Pay attention because it will thicken and then quickly become orange scrambled eggs!) Immediately, pour the mixture through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Stir in the vanilla, Grand Marnier, butter, and heavy cream. Place plastic wrap directly on the custard and refrigerate until cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32348,&quot;Ranch Snack Mix 1/4 cup buttermilk powder 2 tablespoons onion powder 5 teaspoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon dried dill Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 cups rice cereal squares 2 cups square white cheddar crackers 2 cups roughly broken salted pita chips 1 cup roasted salted almonds 1 cup sesame sticks 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 2 cups small pretzels (preferably ranch-flavored) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250? F. Combine the buttermilk, onion and garlic powders, dill, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Combine the cereal, crackers, chips, almonds and sesame sticks in a large bowl and toss. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar. Pour about half of the butter mixture over the cereal mixture and toss, then pour in the remaining butter mixture and toss again until everything is well coated and there is no butter at the bottom of the bowl. Add half of the spice mix and toss to coat. Spread the cereal mixture on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, until dry, crisp and lightly toasted but not browned, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and toss with the pretzels and remaining spice mix. Set aside to cool, stirring occasionally. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32349,&quot;Ambrosia 4 large seedless oranges 1 1/2 cups grated unsweetened coconut 1 papaya, peeled and sliced thinly 1 pint blackberries 3 starfruit, sliced 1 1/2 cups pecans Blueberry or clover honey Instructions: Remove the skin and membranes from the oranges and slice them in 1/4-inch slices. Place a layer of orange slices in the bottom of a large glass bowl, add a layer of coconut, then a layer of papaya, then blackberries, then starfruit, and then pecans. Repeat the process until all the fruit has been used. If the oranges are not especially sweet, a light layer of blueberry or clover honey will help.

Place the sausages into a low-sided roasting pan (this makes the cooking time quicker). Slice the halloumi into 1/4-inch slices and then lay them on and around the sausages in the pan. Take the peppers out of the jar and also strew them around the sausages and cheese, cutting them into smaller slices and pieces as you go, then drizzle over the oil. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, by which time the sausages should have browned and the cheese colored in places. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, GSM, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 32351,&quot;Pumpkin Chutney 1 pound pumpkin flesh, preferably a sweet type pumpkin 2 tablespoons good quality extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 large onion, preferably Walla Walla, Maui or other sweet onion 1 clove garlic, well minced 3 tablespoons white vinegar 3 quarter-size slices fresh ginger Dash cayenne pepper, or to taste 1 teaspoon ground mustard 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup apricot jam 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 cup raisins 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 lemon, juiced 1 red cl, any kind or your preference, leave whole and pick out after cooking Brie cheese Instructions: Put all the ingredients into a pot and cook slowly on low heat until thick. It will take 1 or 2 hours of patience and watching, but worth it when it is time to have it with the brie. This is a Robin White original recipe and can come out different according to the type of pumpkin you choose. Some pumpkins are dryer than others, so if it appears too dry then add no more than a 1/2 cup of apple cider or apple juice in the beginning. The most important thing is LOW heat and patience. Enjoy! Soak an untreated, (must be untreated) cedar shingle in wine or apple juice or anything you want for about 1 hour. Place shingle on grill with brie cheese with only the top cut off. Top with chutney of your choice. Cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes depending on grill heat. Serve spread on fruit slices, bread, crackers whatever it is great. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 32352,&quot;Strawberry Cupcakes with Macerated Strawberries and Peanut Brittle 1 cup strawberry preserves 1 ounce fresh strawberries, chopped (about 2 tablespoons chopped) Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 1/4 ounces freeze-dried strawberries 2 1/2 cups flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened<br> 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar 3 eggs, room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup whole milk 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1 cup peanut butter 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 to 2 tablespoons whole milk Pinch fine sea salt (optional) 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup honey 1 tablespoon water 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 cup lightly toasted chopped peanuts 1 1/2 teaspoons unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon baking soda Nonstick cooking spray 1/2 cup crushed freeze-dried strawberries Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup muffin trays with 18 cupcake liners. In a small bowl, mix together the strawberry preserves, chopped fresh strawberries and lemon juice. Grind the freeze-dried strawberries into a fine powder using a coffee grinder or food processor. Sift together the strawberry powder, flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium until creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until just combined after each addition. Beat in half of the strawberry preserve mixture and the vanilla until just combined. With the mixer running on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture and beating until just combined after each addition. Evenly distribute the batter between the lined muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full. Bake until a toothpick can be inserted in the center of a cupcake and comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out the cupcakes and let cool completely on a wire rack. For the frosting: Beat the butter and peanut butter with an electric mixer until creamy, then add the confectioners\u2019 sugar. Beat on medium-high until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Stir in the milk 1 tablespoon at a time to the desired consistency. Season with a pinch of salt, if desired. For the peanut brittle: Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Stir together the sugar, honey, water and salt in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar and honey are dissolved, about 30 seconds. Stir in the peanuts and cook, stirring often, until the mixture turns amber in color (or reaches 300 degrees F on a candy thermometer), 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in the butter until it is completely melted. Working very quickly, stir in the baking soda (the mixture will foam a bit). Immediately pour onto the prepared baking sheet; take an offset spatula, spray with cooking spray, and spread the peanut mixture over the baking sheet to create a thin, even brittle. Top with crushed freeze-dried strawberries, gently pressing down into the peanut mixture. Let the brittle cool until completely hardened, 15 to 20 minutes. Break into pieces. Using a paring knife, cut a 1/2-inch-deep piece from the top of each cupcake. Fill each hole with 1/2 teaspoon of the reserved strawberry preserves mixture. Then pipe the peanut frosting over that. Top with brittle pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32353,&quot;Steak Sandwich with Onion Rings and Cheese Sauce One 6-ounce strip steak 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> Canola oil, for frying 2 large onions, cut into 3/4-inch-thick rings<br> 2 cups buttermilk 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> Pinch cayenne<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 quart whole milk, cold<br> 12 ounces fontina cheese, grated<br> 2 shots Tabasco sauce<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard<br> 1 seeded semolina roll, cut in half 8 ounces fontina cheese, sliced<br> Jarred sliced banana peppers<br> Handful of arugula<br> Instructions: For the steak: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat.

Sprinkle the chicken breast all over with salt and pepper and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from pan and allow to cool. Return the pan to high heat and coat with more oil. Add the onions and peppers and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with the cumin and some salt and pepper. Finely dice the chicken breast and fold in with the peppers and onions. Mix well, and then remove from the pan and set aside to cool.<br> Preheat a waffle iron. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.<br> In a large bowl, mix together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and add the milk, melted butter and eggs. Mix together with a whisk, working your way from the center out to gradually incorporate the dry ingredients. This helps avoid lumps. Fold in the pepper and chicken mixture. Ladle the mixture onto the waffle iron and cook until the waffles are puffy and golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Place on a wire rack over a sheet tray and keep warm in the oven as you cook the waffles and the chicken (this will also help them crisp up even more).<br> For the chicken and gravy: Set up a breading station with a container each for the 1 cup flour, whisked eggs and panko breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Then take each of the chicken breasts and lightly dredge in the flour. Dip in the eggs then coat in the panko. Pour the oil into a large nonstick saute pan and set over medium-high heat. When hot, add the breaded chicken breasts. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes on each side, and then set aside to drain on paper towels. There should be about 3 tablespoons of oil remaining, if not pour some out. Then add the remaining 3 tablespoons flour, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder and cayenne. Whisk together to make a roux and cook until brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the milk while whisking, and then season well with salt and plenty of ground black pepper. Simmer until the sauce is slightly thickened and smooth. Serve the chicken on top of the waffles and pour the gravy over the top. Drizzle with some maple syrup and serve with Fiery Fieri Hot Sauce on the side. Remove the green stems of the chiles and split down the middle to open them up. Place in a medium saucepan with the onions, salt and 1 1/2 cups water. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Cook until the water has almost completely evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes. Place the mixture in a food processor and add the white vinegar. Pulse 6 or 7 times until the chiles have broken down. Pour into a sieve over a bowl to strain and use the back of a rubber spatula to squeeze out the cl pulp. Stir in the agave nectar. Cool the hot sauce. Use immediately or store in an airtight glass jar or bottle to keep. Makes about 1 cup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 32366,&quot;Eggnog Syrup 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup eggnog<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon baking soda, optional Instructions: Melt the butter in a saucepan set over medium heat, then add the sugar and eggnog.

Add the flour and beat on the lowest speed until just blended. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the dried cherries and almonds. Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and shape it into a log, about 12-inches long and 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Wrap the dough in the plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. (Dough can be made up to 3 days in advance). Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 heavy baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut the log crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Transfer the dough slices to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1-inch apart. Bake until the cookies are golden around the edges and puffed, about 15 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely before icing, about 30 minutes. For the Icing: Put the powdered sugar in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in the vanilla extract and water, adding more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the mixture becomes a drizzling consistency. (Makes about 2/3 cups icing, enough to ice both variations.) Put the cooled cookies on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Using a spoon or a fork, drizzle the cookies with the icing, allowing any excess icing to drip onto the baking sheet. Allow the icing to set before serving, about 1 hour. Cook&#39;s Note: To toast the almonds, arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven for 6 to 8 minutes until lightly toasted. Cool completely before using. Cook&#39;s Note Alternative: Replace the dried cherries with 1/2 cup coarsely chopped dried apricots and add 2 tablespoons of toasted pine nuts. Also, use 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and omit the almond extract. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>Note: The wine pairing suggestions provided are based on general guidelines and may not be suitable for everyone&#39;s taste preferences.

Add the pork, turn to coat in the marinade, and refrigerate 1 hour or up to overnight. Meanwhile make the chutney. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the vinegar, rum, raisins, brown sugar, red onion, bell pepper, ginger, garlic, and allspice. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the onions and peppers are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the mangoes and the apple and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the fruit begins to break down and the mixture is thick and jammy, about 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside to cool. Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Spread the flour on a plate and season with salt and pepper. Put the eggs in a shallow bowl and lightly beat. Spread the bread crumbs out on another plate and season with salt and pepper. Remove the pork from the marinade and pat dry. Dredge both sides of the cutlets in the flour, and then dip into the egg, letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Press both sides of the cutlets in the bread crumbs so they stick. Set the pork cutlets on a platter and set aside for 30 minutes to allow the breading to set. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the cutlets until they are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.

This is a real time-saver! If a butcher is not available to you, cut into each breast from the fatter side and work across the breast, leaving them attached at the opposite side. Open the breast up and pound lightly with a mallet to about a 1/4-inch thickness. Also, in many supermarkets chicken cutlets are available in packages. They are small pieces of thinly sliced breast meat. Simply adapt the method and make 2 small roll-ups rather than 1 large roll up per portion. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 32373,&quot;Lemon Meringue Napoleon with Ginger Cream 4 large egg whites 1/3 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 3 large egg yolks 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 2 lemons) 1/3 cup granulated sugar 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 cup cold heavy cream 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.

Lightly grease, then line a 13 by 18-inch jelly-roll pan with parchment or waxed paper. (Let the paper come up the long sides by about 2 inches - this will make it easier to form the roll.) Brush paper with oil or butter, dust with flour, tap out excess. Cake: Whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, salt, ginger and cardamom together in a medium bowl. In another bowl, combine sweet potato, buttermilk, and vanilla until smooth. Beat butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce to low; add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the wet mixture in 2 parts, beginning and ending with flour. Beat until just blended. (If needed, fold batter together with a rubber spatula.) Spread batter evenly in prepared pan. Bake until cake springs back when pressed lightly, about 15 minutes. Run knife around cake edge, and invert cake onto a cotton tea towel (100 percent cotton works best and keeps the cake from sticking) generously dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar.

Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Poach by placing the calamari and the shrimp into the colander and simmering until the calamari is firm and the shrimp is pink, about 3 minutes. Remove to a mixing bowl and set aside. Poach the clams until the shells open, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer the clams to the already poached shellfish, discarding any unopened shells. Add the sliced tomato to the shellfish. Toss with two-thirds of the vinaigrette, season and refrigerate until chilled, about 10 minutes. For the salad: Gently toss the arugula and fennel in a large mixing bowl with the remaining vinaigrette to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large serving dish. Arrange the marinated seafood atop the salad. Garnish with the diced tomatoes, scallions, lemon wedges and fennel fronds around the platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32382,&quot;Peanutty Somen Noodles with Shrimp 8 ounces uncooked somen noodles 3 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter 2 teaspoons sesame oil 1 teaspoon hot sauce 2 teaspoons peanut oil 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 1/4 cup dry roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup chopped scallions Chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish, optional Instructions: Cook noodles according to package directions.

Remove from the heat and allow to cool for a while. Halve the passion fruits and scoop out the flesh, seeds and juice using a spoon. Stir this up--you can pass it through a sieve to remove the seeds, but quite frankly I think that&#39;s palaver (nonsense). I like the seeds. Mix the passion fruit with the Campari and sugar syrup in a plastic tub or earthenware dish and place in the freezer. Generally, sorbet takes 2 hours to set. Try to stir it around every 1/2 hour if you remember. Serve on its own, with some seasonal fruit, or in a cone with some vanilla ice cream.; &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 32384,&quot;Zuppa Osso Buco 1 pound ground veal 1 large egg, beaten 1/3 cup Italian bread crumbs, a couple of handfuls 1/4 cup, a generous handful, grated Parmigiano or Romano 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, eyeball it Coarse salt and black pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pot 2 carrots, peeled 2 ribs celery and their greens 1 medium yellow skinned onion, peeled and halved Coarse salt and pepper 1 fresh or dried bay leaf 1/2 cup white wine 1 (14-ounce) can white beans, cannellini, drained 1 (15- ounce) can diced tomatoes in puree or coarsely ground tomatoes 3 cups chicken stock, available in re-sealable boxes on soup aisle 2 cups beef stock, available in 1 cup small boxes on soup aisle 1 cup egg pasta, broken egg fettuccini or medium egg noodles 2 cloves garlic, cracked away from skins 1 (2-ounce) tin flat fillet anchovies, drained Handful flat-leaf parsley, about 1/4 cup loosely packed 1 lemon, zested Crusty bread, to pass at table Instructions: Combine the veal and the next 5 ingredients then reserve mix and rinse off your hands.<br> Heat a medium soup pot over medium to medium-high heat. Begin to chop veggies while pot heats up: dice carrots into 1/4 inch pieces, chop celery and onion. Add extra-virgin olive oil to hot pot and carrots. Turn carrots to coat them in oil and add celery and onion as you get them chopped up. Work near the stove so you can chop, then drop into the pot. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper and a bay leaf. Stir vegetables and cook 5 minutes to begin to soften. Do not let vegetables brown, reduce heat if necessary. Add the wine and cook for 1 minute. Next, add beans and tomatoes and stock to the pot. Put a lid on the pot and raise heat to high. When soup boils, about 3 minutes, add 1-inch balls of veal dumplings directly to the pot. When you are done adding the veal, stir in the egg noodles. Simmer stoup for 6 minutes to cook noodles and meat dumplings.

Blend well. Remove from the blender to a mixing bowl and slowly whisk in the heavy cream. All the cream may not be needed. The correct consistency, is like a crema. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Add more chipotle in adobo for more spice, if desired. Cover and refrigerate. For the slaw: Add the cabbages to a mixing bowl. Toss with the carrot, onion, cilantro, olive oil and lime juice, to taste. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Mix well, cover and refrigerate. For the catfish balls: In a hot skillet, over medium heat, add the butter, onion, jalapeno, and garlic. As it is cooking, add a pinch of salt, cracked pepper, paprika and cumin. Saute until tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside to cool. Heat enough peanut oil in a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot, to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 350 degrees F. Remove any silver skin from the fillets. Pulse the catfish in the food processor until it is chopped, about 30 seconds. You don&#39;t want to puree the fish, just chop it into small chunks. Put the fish in a mixing bowl and add the cilantro, Creole mustard, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, mayonnaise and Jack cheese. Add the cooled onion mixture to the bowl along with another pinch of salt and pepper. Mix gently with a spoon, then gently mix in 1 cup of the panko bread crumbs. The consistency will still be wet, but still formable for the catfish balls. Put the remainder of the bread crumbs into a bowl. Scoop out the catfish mixture using a 2 tablespoon-size scoop and form into a ball shape. Don&#39;t make the catfish balls to be too big, they won&#39;t cook all the way through. Roll the balls in the panko bread crumbs, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Carefully drop them into the hot oil and fry in batches of 5 or 6 depending on your fryer. Do not crowd. Fry the balls for about 3 to 4 minutes. They are done when they are slightly more than golden brown. Remove from the oil and let cool on a paper towel lined sheet pan. Check the first batch to make sure they are cooked through. Repeat the process with the remaining fish mixture. Remove the chipotle sauce and the slaw from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature to remove some of the chill. Heat the tortillas. Stack 7 or 8 tortillas and wrap in a damp kitchen or paper towel and microwave for about 15 seconds. Repeat with remaining tortillas. They can also be wrapped in foil and heated in the oven. Add 2 or 3 catfish balls, depending on the size, to a tortilla, and slightly crush them. Some people tear them completely apart, it is up to you. Top with a little grated Jack cheese, chipotle cream sauce and slaw. Repeat with remaining tortillas and fillings. Arrange on a serving platter and enjoy with a nice cerveza. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]&quot; 32386,&quot;Grilled Clambake Dinner 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay, plus more for serving 1 small baguette, cut into 8 slices on a long bias 2 ears fresh corn, shucked One 14-ounce kielbasa 1 pound large tail-on, peeled and deveined shrimp 12 ounces small red potatoes, sliced 1/8 inch thick 1 medium red onion, cut into 1/2-inch thick wedges 12 littleneck clams (about 1 pound), scrubbed and rinsed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup dry white wine Juice of 1 lemon, plus more lemon wedges for serving 1 clove garlic, grated 1 tablespoon chopped chives Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Melt the butter and seafood seasoning in a small saucepan over medium heat. Brush the baguette slices on both sides with 1 tablespoon of the butter mixture and place on a baking sheet. Brush the corn with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter and add to the baking sheet. Brush the kielbasa with 1 tablespoon butter and add to the same pan. Toss the shrimp with 2 tablespoons butter mixture then transfer to the pan. Reserve the remaining melted butter mixture. Cut three 22-inch long pieces of heavy-duty foil. Put two sheets on a work surface, one on top of the other so they form a cross. Place the potatoes in a 10-by-10-inch square in the center of the foil. Scatter the onions and clams over the potatoes and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Fold all four sides of the foil up towards the center to create a bowl, but do not seal it. Add the wine, lemon juice, garlic and the remaining 3 tablespoons of the melted butter mixture. Tightly seal the foil packet so no liquid can escape. Wrap the packet with the remaining piece of foil to make sure it is secure. Place the foil packet, corn and kielbasa on the grill and cook, flipping the corn and kielbasa as needed (do not flip the foil packet) until the corn is tender and charred in spots, the kielbasa is charred and heated through and the potatoes in the foil packet are tender and the clams have opened up, about 20 minutes. Remove the corn and sausage from the grill to a clean cutting board as they are ready. With 5 minutes of cooking time left, add the shrimp to the grill and cook, flipping once, until bright orange on the outside and white and opaque at the center, about 5 minutes. Grill the bread slices, flipping once, until toasted and charred on both sides, about 1 minute. Cut each ear of corn into 4 pieces and slice the kielbasa on a deep bias. Divide the shrimp, corn and kielbasa between 4 shallow bowls. Open the foil pack (watch out for hot steam) and divide the potatoes and clams between the bowls (discard any clams that do not open). Spoon some sauce into each bowl. Sprinkle with chives and Old Bay seasoning.

In a large bowl, mix the cubed baked goods, vanilla wafers, apricots, cranberries, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Slice the bananas and fold into the dry ingredients. Transfer to the baking dish, distributing evenly. In another bowl, mix eggs, milk, vanilla and amaretto, whiskey or warm water. Pour the milk and egg mixture over the dry ingredients. Let the baking dish stand for about 20 minutes to allow the liquid to absorb into the cubed baked goods. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a bain marie by placing the baking dish into a larger pan or dish, into the preheated oven, and then pouring hot water into the outer dish (without splashing any into the custard dish). Bake until the pudding firms and puffs up and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and from water bath. Spread apricot jelly over the top of pudding and let rest.

Spread the ice cream in the pan using an offset spatula to create a smooth, even layer. Freeze until very firm, about 2 hours. Make the pineapple topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the sides of another 9-inch round cake pan. Stir the granulated sugar and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Cook, gently swirling the pan but not stirring, until the mixture is light brown, 6 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully whisk in the butter. Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan, quickly swirling to coat the bottom before the caramel hardens (use a rubber spatula if needed to push the caramel to the edges). Lay the whole pineapple slice in the center of the caramel, then lay the remaining half slices around the whole slice, all facing the same direction. Place 1 maraschino cherry half cut-side up in the center of each slice. Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk the milk, sour cream and vanilla bean paste in a liquid measuring cup until smooth. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until well combined. Reduce the speed to medium low and beat in the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with the milk mixture, until combined. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula, then increase the speed to medium high and beat 30 more seconds. Pour the batter over the pineapple topping in the pan and spread in an even layer. Bake until well browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 minutes to 1 hour. Run a knife around the cake to loosen, then transfer to a rack and let the cake cool in the pan, 30 minutes. Invert the cake onto the rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the pineapple compote: Combine the dried pineapple, pineapple juice, brown sugar, lemon juice, water and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the pineapple is soft and the liquid is syrupy, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla bean paste. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse until the pineapple is finely chopped. Let cool. Assemble the cake: Clean the 9-inch round cake pan and line with plastic wrap, leaving a 2-inch overhang all around. Slice the cake in half horizontally with a long-serrated knife. Place the half without the pineapple cut-side up in the pan. Top with the pineapple compote and spread evenly. Unwrap the frozen ice cream disk and carefully place on top of the compote. Place the remaining cake half, pineapple-side up, on top of the ice cream. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove the cake from the pan, using the plastic wrap to help; transfer to a platter. Let the cake sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 32405,&quot;Tomato Steak with Baked Goat Cheese and Herb Salad 1/4 cup fine dried bread crumbs Gray salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg 4 rounds fresh goat cheese, about 2 ounces each 4 thick, ripe beefsteak tomato slices 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the salad 2 cups lightly packed mixed tender fresh herb leaves such as basil, chervil, tarragon, Italian flat-leaf parsley, chives (1-inch lengths), or young cress Red wine vinegar Instructions: In a small, shallow bowl, mix the bread crumbs with salt and pepper, to taste. In another small, shallow bowl, beat the egg just until blended. Dip each goat cheese round in the egg, and then in bread crumbs, patting the crumbs in place. Cover and refrigerate the coated cheese rounds for about 15 minutes. Center the tomato slices on 4 salad plates and season with salt and pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat and pour in 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the oil is almost smoking, add the cheese rounds. Cook until lightly browned, about 45 seconds. Turn them over and cook on the other side until the cheese just feels quivery, about 45 seconds longer, depending on the thickness of the rounds. Place a cheese round on each tomato slice. In a bowl, toss the herbs with a light drizzle of olive oil, a splash of red wine vinegar, and salt and pepper, to taste. Mound the herbs on top of the cheese, dividing them evenly. Serve immediately. Michael&#39;s Notes: This salad looks best when the tomato slice and the goat cheese slice are about the same size. So if you can only find goat cheese in small logs, you may want to serve 2 goat cheese rounds to each diner and perch them on slices of smaller tomatoes. Be sure you take all the stems off the herbs carefully so your guests can enjoy just the soft leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 32406,&quot;Vegetables with Olivada 1 can medium, pitted, black olives, drained 1 teaspoon lemon zest 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 small clove garlic, coarsely chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 carrots, peeled and cut into 2 by 1/2-inch sticks 1/2 hothouse cucumber, cut into 2 by 1/2-inch sticks 1 large fennel bulb, trimmed, halved and sliced into 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup cherry tomatoes Instructions: Place all ingredients, except the salt and pepper in the bowl of a food processor.

Fit a sheet pan with a wire rack and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise and mustard. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Using a pastry brush, coat the chicken all over with the mayo mixture. Use a food processor to grind the pork rinds into fine crumbs. Alternatively, you can put the rinds in a resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a medium bowl or wide shallow dish. Add the cheese, thyme, garlic powder, smoked paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Stir to combine. Pour 1/2-inch oil into a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat until it registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, transfer the chicken to the pork rind mixture and press the crumbs into the chicken on both sides to ensure that it sticks. Add the chicken to the oil as breaded and fry until golden, about 1 minute per side. Transfer the chicken to the prepared sheet pan as done and season with salt. Keep warm in the oven.

To make the citrus supremes: Using a paring knife, cut off 1/2-inch from both ends of the orange and grapefruit and stand them upright so they sit flat on the cutting board. Make downward cuts, following the contour of the fruit, to remove the entire pith and peel. Hold the orange in your hand over the bowl with the zest (to catch the juice) and carefully slice between the membranes to remove the segments. Squeeze the orange remnants to release the remaining juice. Place the orange supremes in a separate bowl and set aside. Repeat with the grapefruit, adding the juices to the zest bowl for a total of about 3 tablespoons juice. Set aside the orange and grapefruit supremes. To make the salad dressing: Into the bowl with the reserved citrus juice and zest, add the mustard, vinegar, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds black pepper. Whisk in the olive oil. Place the kale in a large serving bowl. Add the onions and drizzle with the dressing. Toss to coat. Season with salt if needed. Top with the citrus supremes, sesame seeds and Wontons.

Roughly chop 1 bunch rosemary, sage and thyme, 5 of the bay leaves and the 3 garlic cloves. Add to a bowl, and mix with the olive oil, 3 tablespoons salt and 2 tablespoons pepper. Rub the birds with the herb mixture so it sticks to the skin. Transfer the chickens to a roasting pan. Roast for 2 1/2 hours, or until the temperature between the breast and thigh near the bone registers 150 degrees F. At this stage the chickens are 75-percent cooked. Set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, break down the birds into 10 pieces each, with the breasts boneless and halved. You will end up with a wing, leg, thigh and 2 pieces breast meat per half chicken. In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, hot sauce and sugar. Submerge the chicken pieces in the buttermilk and let sit for 30 minutes. Fill a large, heavy pot with grapeseed oil to a depth of 3 inches. Turn the heat on, and add the remaining bunches rosemary, sage and thyme, the remaining 5 bay leaves and the head of garlic, broken into cloves. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. The herbs and garlic will crisp up and perfume the oil as it comes to temperature. Once they are crispy, remove them to a paper-towel-lined plate and set aside--they will serve as a garnish for the finished dish. In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, rice flour, garlic powder, onion powder, 1/3 cup salt and 1/4 cup black pepper; mix thoroughly. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk (do not dry) and coat well in the flour mixture. Without over-crowding the pot, fry the breaded chicken until all the pieces are golden brown and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove to a clean kitchen cloth and season with flaked salt and freshly ground pepper. Line a serving platter with a paper bag, brown parchment paper or a clean napkin. Pile the chicken onto the platter. Serve with the fried herbs and garlic and the lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 32422,&quot;Cape Cod Pot Pie 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (half a 17-ounce package), thawed 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large leek (white and light green parts only), halved lengthwise and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup milk Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup soft garlic-herb cheese (such as Boursin) 2 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest, plus 2 teaspoons lemon juice 1 1/4 pounds cod fillet, cut into 1-inch chunks 1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives 1 large head Boston or Bibb lettuce, leaves separated Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Lightly rinse the shrimp to help separate them and remove any large pieces of ice. Shake off any excess water, then toss the shrimp with the lemon pepper seasoning. Add the shrimp to the hot oil, using tongs to move into a single layer. Cover and let cook until the shrimp start to defrost and turn pink, about 2 minutes. Uncover, flip the shrimp and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, flipping for the final minute.

Grease a cookie sheet thoroughly. Whip the egg whites on low speed until light and foamy. Blend in the sugar and continue to beat until soft peaks form. Pour in the melted butter, flour, salt, and extracts; mix until well combined. Drop a tablespoon of the batter onto the prepared cookie sheet. Using the back of a spoon, spread the batter evenly into very thin 3-inch rounds. Alternatively, use the lid of a jar with a 3-inch circle punched out as a template, pour the batter in the ring, and remove. Because you must work quickly to shape these cookies, bake just 3 at a time. Bake for about 5 to 8 minutes or until the edges are a light golden color. Remove the cookies with a spatula and place on a work surface. Lay a fortune in the lower middle of the cookie, and gingerly (they will be hot) fold in half to make a semi-circle. Bend the edges up toward each other to make a crescent. Drag the crease across the rim of a small measuring cup, with the ends facing down. Cool in mini muffin tins to hold shape until crisp. Repeat with remaining batter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32442,&quot;Cool Cucumber Soup Two 14 to 16 ounce English (seedless) cucumbers 1/2 clove garlic, minced 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt plus more to taste 1 small scallion, trimmed and chopped<br> 2 cups buttermilk or 1 cup milk plus 1 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon minced fresh mint 1 teaspoon minced fresh dill 1 teaspoon minced flat-leaf parsley Large pinch cayenne pepper plus more to taste Freshly ground black pepper to taste Freshly squeezed lemon juice, to taste (optional) Instructions: Peel the cucumbers, trim the ends, cut in half lengthwise and scrape out the watery area where seeds would be.

Quarter the chickens. Be careful to leave the breasts covered with skin. Be sure the oyster is left attached to the leg. Remove the thighbone and carefully cut off the drumsticks. Reserve until needed. In a large heavy bottomed stock pot, brown the bones and trimmings from the chickens with the chopped carrots and onions. Pour off the excess fat and moisten with the chicken or veal stock. Add the tomato paste and the bouquet garni. This produces an enriched stock for the sauce. Cook at a low simmer for 40 to 45 minutes, then strain and skim off any excess fat. Next gather all ingredients for the sauce, and measure out the wine and cognac. To assemble the dish, season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large saute pan heat clarified butter and brown the chicken skin side down. When the chicken is browned, remove it from the pan and into a 375 degree oven. Remove excess fat from the pan, return the pan to the heat and saute the mushroom slices. After 2 minutes add the chopped shallots and saute for a couple of minutes longer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the Cognac. Return the pan to the heat and ignite the Cognac. When the flames have died down add the white wine. Reduce by half. Strain the reinforced stock and skim off any fat that has floated to the top. Add the stock to the mushroom mixture and continue reducing. Add the tomato concasse. When the sauce begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon, swirl in the butter. Once the butter is incorporated and the chopped chervil and tarragon to taste. To assemble the dish, remove the chicken pieces from the oven. Remove the breastbone from the chicken breast. The advantage to removing the breastbone after cooking is that it helps the breast keep its shape and remain moist during cooking. Since breast tend to cook more quickly than thighs, removing the thighbone and leaving the breastbone intact during cooking ensures that the two are done at the same time. Place 1 piece of white meat and 1 piece of dark on a clean plate and cover with the sauce. Garnish with chopped chervil and tarragon and serve immediately.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 32449,&quot;Brutti Ma Buoni Butter for greasing the cookie sheet 6 egg whites 1 cup toasted hazelnuts, coarsely chopped 1 cup toasted almonds, coarsely chopped 3/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon cocoa powder 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, and extra for dusting 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 tablespoon amaretto Butter for greasing Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Pulse 5 or 6 times in 1/2-second bursts to break up the butter. Add the shortening, turn on the machine and immediately add the ice water, pulsing 2 or 3 times. The dough should look like a mass of smallish lumps and should just hold together in a mass when a handful is pressed together. If the mixture is too dry, pulse in more water by droplets. Turn the dough out onto the work surface and with the heel of your hand, rapidly and roughly push egg-size blobs into a 6-inch smear. Gather the dough into a relatively smooth cake, wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours (or up to 2 days). Slice the halved apples into 4 lengthwise wedges each, and toss in a large bowl with the lemon juice and zest and 1/2 cup sugar. Drain the apples after macerating 20 minutes. In a 9-inch skillet melt the butter over high heat. Stir in the remaining sugar and cook until the syrup bubbles and caramelizes, and turns a brown color. Remove the pan from the heat and arrange a layer of apple slices in a neat pattern on the caramel in the skillet, then arrange the remaining apples neatly on top. Return the pan to moderately high heat and cook for about 25 minutes, covering the pan after 10 minutes. Every few minutes press down on the apples and baste them with the exuded juices. When the juices are thick and syrupy, remove the pan from the heat. On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a circle, 3/16-inch thick and 1-inch larger than the top of the pan. Drape the dough over the apples, pressing the edge of the dough between the apples and the inside of the pan. Cut 4 small steam holes on the top of the dough. Bake until the pastry has browned and crisped, about 20 minutes. Unmold the tart onto a serving dish (so the pastry is on the bottom), and serve warm or cold with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32465,&quot;Lobster, Lobster, Lobster and Lobster Sauce 1 1/4 pounds cooked lobster, claws and knuckles shelled and tail split lengthwise 1-ounce minced ginger 2 ounces minced shallots 1/2-ounce julienne carrot, blanched 1/2-ounce julienne leek, blanched 1/2-ounce julienne snow peas, blanched Salt and pepper, to taste 1 (9-inch by 9-inch) spring roll wrapper 1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water 8 tablespoons butter, softened 1/2-ounce minced chives 1-ounce fresh peas 1 cooked artichoke, leaves and choke removed 2 baby bok choy, blanched 2 scallions, trimmed and blanched 5 ounces lobster stock Instructions: For the spring rolls: Dice 1 lobster claw in 1/2-inch pieces.

Lightly oil the swordfish all over and season generously with salt and pepper. Lay 15 pieces of prosciutto out flat on waxed paper, overlapping a bit, and place the swordfish loin on top. Roll the prosciutto around the circumference of the fish, to wrap it. Remove the waxed paper. Secure the swordfish ?roast? with butcher?s twine. Thread the thyme sprigs under the pieces of string. Coat a roasting pan with olive oil and set on 2 burners over high heat until almost smoking. Sear the swordfish on all sides until the prosciutto begins to crisp up, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until the fish is opaque and feels springy-firm when poked. Using a paring knife, peel the oranges, removing all the white pith. Place a mixing bowl under the orange to catch the juice and cut between the membranes to release the segments; add to the bowl. Add the raisins to the oranges so they plump while preparing the rest of the dish. Trim the stalks from the fennel bulbs, reserving the fronds for garnish, and remove tough outer leaves. Cut the bulb in half lengthwise, trim the base, and cut out the core. Slice fennel into strips as thin as possible. Put the fennel slices in the bowl and add the olives, anchovies, vinegar, oil, basil, and fennel seeds. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper; toss gently to mix. To serve, spoon the fennel salad down the length of a serving platter.

For the duck: Score the skin on the duck breasts in a crosshatch pattern and season on both sides with salt. Place skin-side down in a cold medium saut pan. Place the pan over low heat and slowly render the fat for 10 minutes, occasionally removing and reserving the fat. Flip the breasts and cook on the flesh side for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a sheet pan, reserving the saut pan, and bake for 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 10 minutes and leave the oven on for the sweet potato cake. Meanwhile, to the reserved saut pan, add the shallots and salt and turn the heat to medium. If the pan is too dry, add 1 tablespoon of the reserved duck fat. Sweat the shallots, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of the stock and deglaze the bits from the bottom of the pan. When the stock is reduced by about half, add the grapes and 1/2 cup of the stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the stock by about half again. Remove the pan from the heat and add the port wine. Return to the heat and slightly tilt the pan forward to flambe. Reduce until the alcohol has cooked off, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup stock and any juices from the duck that have accumulated on the sheet pan and reduce by about half. Finish the sauce with the butter, taste for seasoning and keep warm. For the sweet potato cake: Coat a small nonstick pan with olive oil. Starting in the center of the pan, arrange a layer of sweet potato slices to cover the bottom of the pan, slightly overlapping them in a circular pattern. Season with salt. Repeat the process with a second layer, adding salt, olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan. Repeat this process 4 more times, adding Parmesan on every other layer. On the last layer, add salt and Parmesan, but not olive oil. Firmly press down on the top of the potatoes. Place the pan over medium-low heat and slowly cook until the bottom of the potatoes is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes, gently shaking the pan occasionally to prevent the potatoes from sticking. Cover with a flat lid, flip the sweet potato cake onto the lid, then slide the cake back into the pan (the layer of potatoes that was on the bottom will now be on the top). Cook 5 minutes more, then bake until the potatoes are fully cooked through and fork tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain off some of the excess fat, then slide the cake onto a cutting board and slice into wedges. For the haricot verts: While the sweet potato cake bakes, season a pot of boiling water generously with salt. It should be as salty as the sea. Prepare an ice bath and season generously with salt. Add the haricot verts to the boiling water and cook until bright green and tender, but still slightly crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the haricot verts and immediately plunge into the ice bath. Coat the bottom of a large saut pan with olive oil, add the shallots, red pepper flakes and salt and sweat over medium-high heat until the shallots are soft and translucent, 5 minutes. Add a bit of the reserved duck fat and the drained haricot verts and toss to combine. Season with salt to taste, then remove from the heat. To serve: Slice the duck on the bias, then plate it. Spoon the sauce over the duck and around the plates and garnish with some chives. Serve alongside a wedge of sweet potato cake and the haricot verts. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]&quot; 32475,&quot;Mushroom Buns 1/2 cup whole milk 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one 1/4-ounce package) 2 tablespoons sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the bowl 1 large egg yolk 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 small clove garlic, chopped 1 small shallot, chopped 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves 1/2 pound cremini or white button mushrooms, ends trimmed 1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, destemmed 4 tablespoons unsalted butter; plus 2 tablespoons, at room temperature, for the pan 1/4 cup dry white wine 2 tablespoons heavy cream Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan Kosher salt Instructions: For the dough: Warm the milk and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan over low heat to about 100 degrees F (but no more than 110 degrees F). Remove the saucepan from the heat, and sprinkle the yeast over the liquid. Sprinkle a pinch of the sugar over the top, and set aside without stirring until foamy, about 5 minutes. Then whisk in the butter and egg yolk. Whisk the flour, remaining sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon until you have a thick, sticky dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Add the dough ball, turning to coat lightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, trace a circle the size of the dough ball on the plastic and note the time. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl, and knead briefly to release excess air. Re-form the dough into a ball, and return it to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap, and lay it on the dough. Cover the entire bowl tightly with the rest of the plastic, and refrigerate it for 4 hours or overnight to let the dough proof. For the filling: Process the garlic, shallots and thyme in a food processor until combined. Add the cremini and shiitake mushrooms, and pulse until nearly pureed (a few small chunks here and there are fine), stopping to scrape down the side of the bowl as necessary. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, and melt 4 tablespoons of the butter. Add the mushroom mixture, and cook, stirring frequently, until it releases liquid and begins to bubble and brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, stir in the wine and cream and bring the mushroom-cream mixture to a low boil. After 1 minute, remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Transfer the filling to a medium bowl, and let it cool completely. (The filling will firm up a bit, but if it&#39;s too warm, it will be difficult to form the buns.) To fill and form the rolls: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with the 2 tablespoons softened butter. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and press it flat. Roll it into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle, with 1 long side facing you. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on the long side opposite you. Sprinkle the Parmesan evenly over the filling. Starting from the side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight roll. Lightly brush the 1-inch border with water, and continue rolling to seal the roll. Fold the ends in just a bit, and if any spots look thicker than others, even out the roll with your hands. Cut the roll every 1 1/2 inches with a serrated knife, to make 12 buns. Place the buns cut-side down (except for the end pieces) in the prepared pan, spacing them 1 inch apart. Cover them loosely with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place to rise until they double in size with no gaps in between, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. For the topping: Stir together the butter, parsley and Parmesan in a small bowl; set aside. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the buns until they&#39;re golden brown and the tops spring back when pressed lightly, 25 to 30 minutes. Spread the topping evenly over the buns, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and return them to the oven until the butter is melted and the topping is fragrant, 5 minutes more. Let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 32476,&quot;Panzanella (Tuscan Bread Salad) 1 pound English cucumbers 1 pound sweet onions, (such as Vidalia, Walla Walla or Maui) Salt 1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes (about 5 medium) 1 pound coarse rustic or Italian-style bread, crusts removed, torn in large chunks and left to stale 1 week 1/2 cup torn basil leaves 6 tablespoons fruity extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar Freshly-ground black pepper Instructions: Peel cucumbers leaving some green skin in alternating strips; slice as thinly as possible.

Meanwhile, make the red sauce: Process the chili powder, garlic and 5 cups water in a blender until smooth. Season the flour with garlic salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toss the beef in the flour, then add to the skillet to brown on all sides. Pour in the chili powder mixture and simmer until the beef is tender, about 15 minutes. Make the enchiladas: Preheat the broiler. Place 4 tortillas on a baking sheet. Sprinkle each with cheese, then top with green sauce on one side and red on the other. Repeat to make two more layers. Top the stacks with more cheese and broil until melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mist a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and fry the eggs as desired, then season with salt and pepper. Top each enchilada stack with lettuce, tomatoes and a fried egg. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 32479,&quot;Cinnamon Almond Dark Chocolate Monkey Bread with Cream Cheese Drizzle All-purpose flour, for flouring the work surface 3 tubes crescent roll dough<br> One 10-ounce can almond filling<br> 1 cup dark chocolate chips<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon table salt<br> Cream Cheese Drizzle, recipe follows 1 cup toasted, salted almonds, crushed<br> 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons whole milk<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a floured surface, unroll each tube of dough and separate along the perforations. Mound 1 teaspoon of the almond filling in the center of a dough triangle, top with 2 teaspoons chocolate chips and fold the sides over to make a package. Roll it in your hand to seal. Repeat with the rest of the dough, almond filling and chocolate chips. Brush a liberal amount of butter all over the inside of a 12-inch Bundt pan. Mix together the granulated sugar, cinnamon and salt in a shallow bowl. Dip each dough ball in melted butter, then roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place in the prepared pan. Cover with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until golden brown, an additional 10 to 15 minutes; let cool slightly. While still warm, take a knife or offset spatula and carefully separate the sides of the cake from the pan. Turn it over and turn out onto a serving dish. Drizzle with the Cream Cheese Drizzle and sprinkle with crushed almonds. Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, cream cheese, almond extract and 2 tablespoons milk in a bowl until very smooth. If the mixture needs to be looser, add an additional 1 tablespoon milk. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 32480,&quot;Jack-O-Lantern Cheesecakes 8 (1/2 pound) mini pumpkins 1 1/2 pounds cream cheese at room temperature 6 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature 1 cup lightly packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon cinnamon 2 teaspoons ground ginger 3/4 teaspoons ground cloves 4 large eggs 1 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup pumpkin puree (canned is just fine) (Optional mint leaves and birthday candles for garnish) 3/4 cup orange juice 1/2 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 pound fresh or frozen cranberries Instructions: Side Bar: Before you start, set your cream cheese and butter out for several hours, so it can warm up to room temperature. Set rack in middle of oven and preheat to 300 degrees. Cut the tops off the pumpkins and set aside, With a teaspoon or grapefruit knife, scrape the fibrous pulp and seeds out of the pumpkins. Scrape some of the meat off the inner walls so they are no more than 3/8-inch thick. Put the cream cheese, butter, sugars, cornstarch, cinnamon, ginger and cloves in a large mixing bowl and beat at medium speed until blended. Take care not to mix too much air into the batter. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, until each is incorporated. Reduce the speed and beat in the sour cream, vanilla and pumpkin puree. Fill the pumpkin shells with the batter and bake, on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes. Turn the pan and place the tops next to the pumpkins. Bake for 10 more minutes, until barely set and firm. If, at any time, the cakes start to puff up, turn the oven down or remove them. Let cool, in the pan, then refrigerate.; Place all ingredients in a medium saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes until the berries have popped and form a thick sauce. Let cool. To serve, spoon cranberry sauce on top of filling. Place the pumpkin lid on a jaunty angle. Stick the birthday candle and mint sprig into the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 32481,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Heirloom Tomato and Pesto Tart 2 premade pie crusts, store bought or homemade Nonstick baking spray 3 to 4 heirloom tomatoes in various colors, sliced 1/4-inch thin 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 bunch parsley (1 lightly packed cup) 1 bunch basil (1 lightly packed cup) 10 sprigs thyme, leaves stripped 3 to 4 cloves garlic 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish 1/2 cup almond slivers Zest of 2 lemons 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/Combine the milk.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Cold%20Curry-Peanut%20Noodles.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Cold Curry-Peanut Noodles</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/Combine%20the%20pork.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Combine the pork</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
