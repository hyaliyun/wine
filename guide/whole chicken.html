chicken can now be opened to lay flat on cooking surface. The cooking vessel for this dish is a stovetop griddle pan (an extra-large saute pan would work, if necessary). The griddle pan needs to be medium-high when chicken is first placed on surface for cooking. The chicken should be seasoned with gray salt, fresh ground black pepper, and a slight drizzle of olive oil. Place skin side to pan first, place a saute pan or another griddle pan on top of chicken to apply pressure and weight while cooking. Cook 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium to avoid burning, cook additional 10-15 minutes on skin side. Remove weighted pan and turn over. Replace weighted pan and continue cooking 10-15 minutes until done. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 19965,&quot;Apple Compote 2 honeycrisp or McIntosh apples, peeled, cored and chopped 1/2 cup orange juice 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 2 to 3 scrapes of fresh nutmeg Salt Instructions: In a saucepot on medium-high heat, add the apples, orange juice, lemon juice, brown sugar and nutmeg. Simmer over medium heat until the apples are tender and the juices are thickened to a thin syrup, 10 to 12 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 19966,&quot;Mini Mint Patties 1 pound fondant, store-bought 2 to 3 drops mint extract, to taste Powdered food coloring, as desired 1/2 teaspoon invertase 1 pound bittersweet chocolate, tempered Instructions: Place the fondant in a saucepan placed over medium heat. Warm the fondant with a few drops of water so the fondant will become soft, like the consistency of royal icing. Insert a candy thermometer and heat to 140 degrees F. Stir in a few drops of mint extract, to taste. Stir in a drop or 2 of green food color, to your taste for color. Place the fondant in a cornet and use a scissors to cut off the tip. Pipe the fondant in small rounds onto a parchment paper lined baking pan. Let the candies cool until they are hard, about 30 minutes. Use a chocolate dipping fork to dip each candy in the tempered dark chocolate. Place back on a parchment lined baking sheet. When cool, the candies are ready to eat. The invertose will cause the fondant consistency to change over time. The inside will become the consistency of honey. SOURCES: Invertose Chocolate melter: demarle &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19967,&quot;Apple Hash Napoleon 3 Granny Smith apples 1/4 cup clarified butter 1/4 cup powdered sugar, plus more for garnish 2 cups apple cider 1 pint Apple and Anise ice cream, recipe follows 2 cups half-and-half 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 2 pieces star anise 8 large egg yolks 3/4 cups sugar 1/2 cup homemade applesauce Instructions: Preheat convection oven to 275 degrees F. Cover a sheet pan with a silpat mat or parchment paper. Using a Japanese mandoline, julienne the apple into thin sticks, like potato sticks. Make little nests or haystacks of the sticks on the silpat, about 3 inches in diameter. Spatter the haystacks with melted clarified butter and douse with powdered sugar from a shaker. Bake in a convection oven until dry and crisp, about 60 to 75 minutes. Or use a fruit dehydrator to dry them out. Store them in an airtight container until ready to serve. To make the sauce, place the cider in a small saucepan, and bring it to a simmer. Continue cooking until it becomes a thick golden syrup, about 1 hour. Let cool until ready to serve. You can refrigerate it if made the day before. To serve the dessert, place one apple hash on a dessert plate, top it with a scoop of ice cream, then carefully place another piece of hash on top as a lid. Press down gently. Spoon a \swoosh\ of cider reduction on the plate and sprinkle the whole thing with powdered sugar. Put a large mixing bowl in the freezer to chill. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the half-and-half, cream, vanilla bean, and star anise to a simmer, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn?t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer turn it off, do not let it boil! In a thin stream, whisk half of it into the egg yolk mixture. Then pour the egg-cream mixture into the saucepan containing the rest of the cream mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees, it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don?t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready, if the edges blur, it is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove from the heat. Meanwhile, remove the bowl from the freezer, put 4 handfuls of ice cubes in the bottom, and add cold water to cover. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Strain the cream mixture through a fine sieve to remove the vanilla bean pieces and star anise, into a smaller bowl. Stir in the homemade applesauce and chill 3 hours, then freeze according to the directions for your ice cream maker.

Make the cake batter: Combine the flour, granulated sugar, milk, shortening, baking powder, vanilla, salt, eggs, pineapple juice and 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium speed until well combined. (There will still be a few small lumps in the batter.) Set aside. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat; swirl to thoroughly coat the skillet. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the butter, making sure it&#39;s evenly distributed--you want the entire surface of the butter to be covered in brown sugar. Do not stir. As soon as the sugar dissolves, remove from the heat, layer the pineapple slices over the top and add cherries to the middle of the pineapple slices. Pour the batter evenly over the pineapple and gently spread to even out the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Immediately run a knife around the edge of the cake, then put a plate upside down on top of the skillet. Carefully invert the skillet so the cake is turned onto the plate. It should come out pretty easily; if bits of cake stick to the skillet, use a small knife to patch it together. Let cool slightly before cutting into wedges.

Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 311 degrees F, or what is known as the \hard crack\ stage. Remove from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-sized, microwave-able glass bowl. Wash, dry, and lightly but thoroughly coat with cooking spray a clean, dry bowl that matches the diameter of whatever you&#39;re placing the sugar cage over. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the bowl, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly on the sides and bottom of the bowl, making sure to come all the way to the rim, however, not so thick that you can&#39;t see the bowl through the sugar. Using a sharp chef&#39;s knife, slice the edge of the cage clean by scraping the blade of the knife along the rim of the bowl. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. To unmold the cage, place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and your fingers on the inside of the sugar cage. Gently pull the cage loose from the side and bottom of the bowl; you will be able to see the cage release from the inside of the bowl. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside of the bowl. Once the cage has released from the bowl, carefully lift it out and place it over the dessert. If the sugar is still too warm, the cage may begin to collapse. A good idea is to release the cage from the bowl but leave it in the bowl until it has cooled completely. This will ensure that it keeps its shape. (At this stage, the cage can be stored, right side up, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for one to two days.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 19992,&quot;Cranberry-Rosemary Julep 2 teaspoons sugar 2 tablespoons frozen cranberries<br> Two 1-inch snips of rosemary, plus 2 sprigs, for garnish, optional 1/2 cup bourbon, such as Woodford Reserve<br> 2 orange twists<br> Instructions: Muddle the sugar, cranberries and rosemary in a cocktail shaker until crushed and bruised.

Once reduced, turn off the heat and whisk in the butter. Sprinkle the steak liberally with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Add a light coat of oil and place the steak in the pan. Cook the steak almost to desired doneness, depending on thickness, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Turn off the heat and glaze the steak on all sides in the pan while flipping. Remove the steak from the pan to rest. For the sandwich build: Pile some Bourbon Creamed Spinach on the bottom piece of the pretzel roll. Thinly slice the steak against the grain and place on top of the spinach.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. On a baking sheet brushed liberally with olive oil, stretch the dough to desired shape and thickness. Brush the crust with olive oil and top with the mozzarella slices. Bake the pizza until the dough crisps up and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Remove the pizza from oven. Top the melted mozzarella with the grated Parmesan and sliced chicken. Toss the romaine hearts with the Caesar Salad Dressing and season with salt and pepper. Top the pizza with the Caesar salad and shave over some Parmesan. Serve and enjoy! Cook&#39;s Note: If you don&#39;t have a pizza stone at home, no worries, use a well-oiled sheet tray and a hot oven to achieve a crisp bottom on your pizza! Also place the dough on the very bottom rack of your oven. It will help to create that crispy crust. In a blender or food processor, process the Parmesan, mayonnaise, lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, garlic and anchovy until emulsified and smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.; In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you&#39;d like! Cook&#39;s Notes: This dough is wet dough, keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef, if the dough is to wet, add more flour, if it is too stiff, add a little water. Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don&#39;t need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature, it should just feel warm to the touch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 19996,&quot;Airline Cookie Sheet Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 cup buttermilk 1 cup speculoos spread 1/2 cup canola oil or other neutral oil 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup speculoos spread 1 cup powdered sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt Brown gel food coloring, optional Shredded coconut, fresh rosemary sprigs and mini candy canes, for decorating, optional Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Kosher salt 1 pound ground turkey 1/2 teaspoon honey 1/4 cup half-and-half Small handful chopped fresh cilantro (soft stems included) 4 to 6 hamburger buns Instructions: Begin by making the sauce: Warm the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, until it shimmers. Add the ginger, garlic and serrano pepper. Saute until the ginger and garlic brown a little. Add the garam masala and paprika and saute for 30 seconds. Stir in the tomato sauce and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile for the turkey, in large skillet, warm 2 tablespoons of oil. When shimmering, add the pistachios and raisins. Cook until the raisins swell up and the pistachios toast slightly. Remove from the pan and set aside. Return the pan to medium heat, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of oil, and warm until shimmering. Add the cumin seeds and allow them to sizzle for about 10 seconds, or until some of the sizzling subsides. Stir in the onions and bell pepper; saute until softened and starting to brown. Add the serrano pepper. Saute for another couple of minutes, seasoning with a little salt. Stir in the turkey, breaking up the big lumps. Cook until opaque, about 5 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. Whisk together the cider, flour and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a large bowl until no lumps remain and the batter is completely smooth. Stir together the sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl. Slice the apples in half crosswise (not through the stem). Scoop out the core and seeds using a melon baller, being careful not to go all the way through the apple. Have ready a 1 1/2-inch, 2-inch and 2 1/2-inch round biscuit or cookie cutters. Make 3 concentric circles on each apple half starting with the smallest biscuit cutter around the core and then working out with a slightly bigger cutter each time. Press each ring down into the apple but don&#39;t go through the skin (you should have 3 rings). This keeps the apple intact. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Flip an apple over and, visualizing a quarter placed on top of the stem in the center, cut slits through the apple about 1/2 inch apart, circling around the quarter. This also keeps the apple intact. Repeat with the remaining apples. Use your hands to gently pull apart the outer layers of the apple while keeping the skin intact. This will allow the batter to sink into the cuts and help the apple bloom. Sprinkle each apple half with 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon-sugar mixture and let sit for 5 minutes. Stuff the centers with 4 marshmallows each. Place 2 apples at a time in the batter, using a slotted spoon to turn them and evenly coat. Lower each apple cut-side down into the hot oil with the slotted spoon and fry until crispy and golden brown on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip the apples over and continue to fry until the apples are tender and golden brown and crispy on the top, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the prepared baking sheet to drain. Repeat with the remaining apples, being sure to bring the oil temperature back to 350 degrees F before frying again.<br> Meanwhile, stir the caramel sauce and salt in a small bowl until well combined. Dollop each apple with whipped cream and drizzle with the caramel sauce. Serve with the remaining sauce for dipping.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20020,&quot;Franks Twisted Diner Bread 1 egg 4 1/2 cups baker&#39;s flour 1/3 cup powdered milk 1 teaspoon salt 4 ounces wheat bran 1 package dry yeast 4 ounces yogurt 1-ounce honey 1-ounce butter, melted 2 1/2 cups warm water Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Instructions: Boil the potatoes in their skins for 20 minutes, drain and leave to cool. Peel them. Using a cheese grater, grate them into a large mixing bowl and sprinkle with salt. In a frying pan saute the bacon and onions. Strip the leaves off the sprigs of thyme into the pan. Add mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes until soft. Combine with the potatoes and mix gently, taking care not to mash them too much. Heat oil in a frying pan and add 3 or 4 spoonfuls of the mixture, See cook&#39;s note*. Using a spatula, pat the mixture into a round flat cake. Brown it over a high heat. When the bottom side is cooked flip it over. Repeat with remaining potatoes to make 6 cakes.

When the pancetta starts to become crispy, add the onion, celery, carrots, 3 cloves of garlic, pinch of crushed red pepper and season lightly with salt. Sweat the veggies for 6 to 7 minutes or until they become very aromatic and start to soften. Drain the water from the soaked chickpeas, rinse and add to the pot. Add the chicken stock, thyme bundle, bay leaves and 1 quart of water. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until the chickpeas are very soft and falling apart, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn off the heat, season the water with salt and let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Fill a skillet with olive oil until it is about 1/2-inch deep, and the remaining 3 garlic cloves, the rosemary leaves and a pinch of crushed red pepper and bring it to a medium heat. Remove the garlic once it is golden; it has fulfilled its garlic destiny. Add the bread cubes and cook until they start to become crispy and golden. (They will absorb a LOT of the oil. That&#39;s why they taste good!) Season with salt and remove the croutons from the oil to a bowl, reserving the rosemary oil. MMMMM! Add the infused oil to the soup. Puree the soup in a food processor, blender or good old fashioned food mill. Correct the consistency and seasoning, if necessary. If the soup is too thick, cook it a little more to reduce it, or thin it by adding more stock or water. Taste to be sure the seasoning is perfect. Ladle the soup into serving bowls, top with the croutons and finish with a large drizzle of olive oil.

Add the crayfish a little at a time so as not to stop the boil, and let cook until pink. Using a slotted spoon remove the crayfish and set aside until they are cool enough to handle. (Skim off and discard any impurities that have risen to the surface of the stock.) Now, remove the shells from the shrimp and add the shells to the pot of chicken stock, reserving the uncooked shrimp on a utility platter. Allow the shrimp shells to cook in the broth until pink, then strain the stock into another container and discard the shells. While the shrimp shells are boiling, heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Brown the sausage and remove to a platter until it is cool enough to handle. In the sausage drippings over medium heat, saute the onion, celery, and green bell pepper until the onion turns translucent. Reduce the heat and whisk in the flour to make a roux, and let cook for about 15 minutes until it becomes a brown roux. While the roux is browning, slice the sausage into 1/4 to 1/2-inch pieces. Put the tomato paste in a small bowl and add some of the warm stock to make a slurry. Gradually whisk the warm stock and the tomato paste into the roux. Add the garlic powder, crushed red pepper, okra, 1 tablespoon parsley, scallions, red bell pepper, tomatoes and sausage. Cook over low heat until the okra - which contains a thickening agent - is tender, about 15 minutes, and the sausage is cooked through. While the mixture is cooking, remove the crayfish from their shells. (This is done by cracking the tail with both hands and forcing it back out through the curve of the tail.) Add the oysters and shrimp to the pot and cook about 5 minutes until the oysters are plump and the shrimp are pink. Stir in crayfish. Remove pot from heat and carefully fold in crab, trying not to break up the lumps. To serve, place some rice on serving dish and spoon some gumbo over. Sprinkle with file powder and garnish with remaining parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 20048,&quot;Corn, Cheddar and Red Onion Tortilla 3 ears Smoked Corn on the Cob, recipe follows 4 medium red-skinned new potatoes or Yukon Gold potatoes (about 12 ounces) 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 yellow onion, halved and sliced 1/2-inch-thick<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning the vegetables Freshly ground black pepper 10 large eggs 1/2 cup milk 3 cups coarsely grated medium-sharp Cheddar 4 ears corn Olive oil or vegetable oil, for seasoning Instructions: Smoke the corn according to the directions below. When it is cool enough to handle, strip the kernels from the cobs. Pour enough cold water over the potatoes in a 3-quart saucepan to cover them by a few inches. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then adjust the heat so the water is at a gentle boil. Cook until the potatoes are tender when poked with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes. Drain the potatoes, and cool them to room temperature. Peel them, if you like, and cut them into 1/2-inch slices.<br> Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.<br> Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onions, season them lightly with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are wilted but not browned, about 6 minutes.<br> Beat the eggs, milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt together in a large bowl until thoroughly blended. Stir in the corn kernels and cheese.<br> Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the pan and swirl it around to coat the sides as much as possible. Gently stir the sliced potatoes into the skillet and cook them a minute or two to warm them through.<br> Reduce the heat to medium-low and pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Don&#39;t stir. In about a minute, the egg should begin to bubble in a few spots around and near the edges. If it starts to bubble sooner, lift the pan from the heat and reduce the heat slightly. Wait a minute and return the pan to the heat. Cook until the edges are lightly browned (check by carefully slipping a thin metal spatula or knife along the edge of the tortilla), about 5 minutes.<br> Set the skillet in the oven and cook until the top is puffed and brown and the center is firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes.<br> Serve the tortilla hot after letting it rest 5 minutes, warm after resting 30 to 40 minutes, or cooled completely to room temperature. In any case, run a thin, flexible spatula around the sides, then underneath to make sure the tortilla hasn&#39;t stuck to the pan. Serve the hot tortilla right from the pan.<br> You can serve the warm or room temperature tortilla from the pan as well or, if you&#39;re feeling adventurous and have strong wrists, invert it onto a plate as follows: make sure the tortilla is not stuck to any part of the pan. Cover the pan with a plate that is at least 2 inches wider than the pan. Working about one foot over a counter, hold the handle of the skillet with one hand and clamp the plate over the top of the skillet with the other. Invert the skillet over the plate in one quick motion, then lower the plate onto the counter and lift off the skillet. You can also cut the tortilla into wedges in the pan and lift them to individual serving plates. Trim the husk and as much of the silk as you can from the ears. Season the corn by rubbing the ears lightly with olive or vegetable oil.<br> Smoke the kernels until they are tender and browned, about 20 minutes, checking the corn for doneness after about 15 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 20049,&quot;Stuffed Veal Chops 1/4 cup minced prosciutto 1/4 cup grated sharp provolone cheese 1/4 cup small diced roasted peppers 1/2 small onion, grated 2 tablespoons seasoned Italian bread crumbs 2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano leaves 1/2 teaspoon coarse black pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 (1-inch thick) veal chops, frenched Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: In a medium bowl, mix all the filling ingredients together until well combined.

Season the pork chops on both sides with the spice mixture, cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. For the blue cheese dressing: Meanwhile, whisk the sour cream, milk, mayonnaise, lemon zest and some salt and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Fold in the blue cheese so the crumbles do not come apart. Refrigerate the dressing until you serve the salad. Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat, then add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan; heat. Add the pork chops and cook until golden brown on both sides and a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F., 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and let rest 5 minutes. For the layered salad: Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook, turning once, until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on a paper towel- lined plate and crumble. To assemble the salad: Slice the pork chops 1 1/2-inches thick. Put a layer of lettuce in the bottom of the trifle dish, then layer in the spinach, grape tomatoes, onion, hard-boiled eggs, crumbled bacon and peas in that order. Repeat the layers and then top with the pork chops.

Add the wheat berries, and cook until the grains have plumped and are tender but still chewy, 55 minutes to 1 hour; strain. (The wheat berries can be cooked and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance.) Squeeze the sausage out of the casings, divide into 20 pieces and roll into Ping-Pong-ball-sized meatballs. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs, and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown and crispy on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until brown and crispy, about 3 minutes more. Remove the skillet from the heat, and transfer the meatballs to a plate. They should be about 3/4 of the way cooked. Wipe out the skillet. Put the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and crushed red pepper in the skillet, and set over medium heat. Once the oil starts to shimmer, stir until the garlic is lightly golden, about 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste, and stir until the oil turns yellow, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and their juices, the basil and 1/2 cup water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Add the meatballs, and continue to simmer until the sauce thickens and the meatballs are cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes more. Stir in the wheat berries, and transfer to a serving dish.

Add butter in pieces and rub it in with your fingertips until you reach a texture similar to fine bread crumbs. (Try to keep your hands cool). Add cold water gradually, mixing only enough water as you need to make the dough form. Form the dough into a disk (for ease of handling), and place it in a bowl covered with plastic or a clean damp towel, and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. When rested, roll the pastry out onto a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin, to a thickness of about 1/8-inch and line a well buttered 9 1/2-inch flan pan with a removable bottom. Trim away any excess pastry hanging over the edge of the pan. Place pastry shell into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the base of the chilled pastry shell with parchment paper. Then fill with ceramic pastry weights (or dried beans) and place on a baking tray in the oven and partially bake (\blind bake) for 25 minutes. Remove the weights/beans, prick the base of pastry to prevent bubbling-up of base, and return to the oven for a further 5 minutes to dry out the base. Remove pastry shell from oven and allow to cool. Also allow oven to cool to 350 degrees F. While the pastry shell is cooling, prepare the sponge cake batter: Heat the milk over low heat. Add the butter and let it melt into the milk. Set the pot aside temporarily. Beat the sugar and eggs in a large bowl with an electric beater until it is about triple in volume and is the consistency of soft whipped cream. Return the pot with the milk to the stovetop and heat until hot. Sift cake flour and baking powder together several times to aerate. Sift the 1/3 of the flour and baking powder into the bowl of beaten eggs and sugar, and fold together. Repeat for each remaining third of the flour mixture, folding together after the addition of each third. Then, add the hot milk and butter all at once and fold in. For the filling and topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the jam over the base of the cooled pastry shell and pour the cake batter over the top of the layer of jam. Then sprinkle the surface of the cake batter with coconut. Bake in oven for 20 to 25 minutes until the surface springs back when touched and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes. Then while wearing oven mitts, push base of tin upwards from bottom to release tart from sides of pan. You may want to use a spatula to also slide the tart off the base onto your serving plate; however, if it starts to break apart, the nearly invisible base of the flan pan enables you to use it for service with little consequence to your presentation. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20055,&quot;Persian Baked Omelette 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced<br> 4 green onions, white and pale green parts only, finely chopped<br> 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 2 ounces baby spinach, coarsely chopped<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives<br> 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped<br> 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped<br> 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup pine nuts<br> 9 large eggs<br> 1/4 cup whole milk or half-and-half<br> 1 cup Greek yogurt, for serving, optional<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Wrap the outside corners around and seal together. Heat the chicken broth in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When the broth has come to a simmer, add the wontons and the broccoli. Cook for 3 minutes, then ladle into serving bowls and serve hot. In a small bowl whisk together all the ingredients for the marinade. Cut the spareribs into individual ribs and put in a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade into the bag and toss to coat. Put the bag into a large bowl and refrigerate to let marinate for at least 2 hours or as long as overnight. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Remove the spare ribs from marinade and arrange on a baking sheet, cover with foil and poke holes in the foil to vent. Reserve the marinade. Bake until the ribs are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. In the meantime, pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer the mixture until thick, about 30 minutes. Set aside. After 1 1/2 hours, remove the foil from the spareribs and raise oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Baste the ribs with the reduced marinade and roast in oven for 5 minutes. Turn and baste the ribs again with the remaining sauce and roast for an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and arrange the ribs on a serving platter. Serve hot with Fried Noodles. Fried Noodles: Heat 1 cup canola oil in a medium heavy saucepan, to about 350 degrees F. Cut the wonton wrappers into 1/2-inch wide strips.

Spray an 8-inch square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the milk, vegetable oil, vanilla and egg until smooth and combined.\u202f Pour into the prepared baking dish and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 7 to 10 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack, then turn out onto a cutting board. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut 6 rounds from the cake (save the scraps for another use); set aside.\u202f For the white chocolate domes: Meanwhile, add 1 black candy melting wafer to each of the bottom cavities of a silicone half-sphere mold with six 3-ounce cavities. Microwave until the wafers are melted, about 1 minute. Transfer the mold to a baking sheet to keep it stable and tap it on a hard surface to make sure there are no air pockets. Freeze until hardened, about 5 minutes.\u202fThese will be the pupils of the eyeballs.\u202f Combine the blue candy melting wafers with 1 teaspoon of the coconut oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring in between each, until the wafers and coconut oil are melted and the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a small piping bag.\u202fPipe the blue mixture around each pupil to create an iris, then freeze until hardened, about 5 minutes.\u202f\u202f Combine 4 ounces of the white chocolate with 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until the chocolate and coconut oil are melted and the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute.\u202f\u202f Pour the white chocolate mixture over the pupils and irises and tilt the mold to swirl the chocolate around until each half-sphere is coated entirely (you can also use your finger to swirl the chocolate around). Tap out any excess chocolate and freeze until the chocolate is hardened, about 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining 4 ounces white chocolate and 1 tablespoon coconut oil to create a second white chocolate layer. (Some chocolate may spill over on top of the mold, which is fine; it will break off when you unmold the domes.) Tap out any excess chocolate and freeze until the chocolate is hardened, about 5 minutes.\u202f For the filling: Whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the cream and milk in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until small bubbles begin to form around the edges, about 4 minutes. Add the dry mixture to the saucepan in 3 additions, whisking well after each addition. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thickened, about 4 minutes. (Do not allow the mixture to boil; adjust the heat if needed.) Remove from the heat and add the butter, vanilla and 5 drops of gel coloring. Whisk to combine. Transfer the pudding to a medium glass bowl, then cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\u202f Scoop 3 tablespoons of the pudding into each white chocolate cavity in the half-sphere mold. Using the back of a teaspoon, make a divot in the middle of each portion of pudding about halfway down. Dollop a heaping teaspoon of the raspberry jam into each divot. Top each half-sphere with a cake round, pressing down gently into the pudding just so the cake adheres to the pudding. Freeze until the pudding is set, about 30 minutes.\u202f Gently peel the mold away from each of the domes and trim the edges with a paring knife if needed.

Add the diced onion and cook slowly until it has turned translucent. Do not brown the onion, but allow it to almost melt away. Add the garlic cloves and very lightly cook them in the oil until golden before adding the tomatoes and all their juices. Add salt and pepper to taste, and the basil leaves and set the heat on low. Allow the tomatoes to cook at very low heat for at least 2 hours before adding the meat. Make the meatballs: mix the ground beef and veal together in a large bowl. Combine the bread and milk and mash together to form a paste; add the bread to the ground meat. Add the eggs, garlic, parsley, cheese, salt, and pepper to the meat mixture and combine all the ingredients using your fingers to mix uniformly, but do not over mix or the meat will dry out when cooked. Pick up 2 tablespoons of the mixture and roll it into a ball shape, between the palms of your hands. Do this until you have used all the meat. This should yield approximately 24 meatballs. Place the remaining olive oil in a heavy skillet and heat over medium flame. Add the meatballs in 1 layer and brown on all sides before removing. Do this to the remaining meatballs until all are browned to a caramelized color. After all the meatballs have been browned and removed from the skillet, add the sausage links and brown well, following the same method as the meatballs.

If it is too close, the chicken will cook too fast, burn and dry out. Pile the charcoal in a pyramid. Ignite the charcoal with lighter fluid. Once the top portion of the charcoal has turned white, spread the charcoal out evenly using a fireproof tool such as a metal rake or shovel. Place the chicken on the cooking surface. Approximately every 5 minutes, turn the chicken with tongs (being careful not to tear the skin) and baste with the sauce each time (for best results, used a clean shaker or squeeze bottle). Grill for approximately 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Add charcoal, if necessary, to finish off (maybe 1/2 to 2/3 way through the cooking process) and be sure not to use lighter fluid, just sprinkle the new charcoal over the existing. The chicken is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 20112,&quot;Rigatoni with Grilled Sausage and Broccoli Rabe Kosher salt 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 bunch broccoli rabe, trimmed (about 1 pound) 4 sweet and/or hot Italian sausage links (about 14 ounces total) 10 ounces mezzi rigatoni (about 4 cups) 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano Grated parmesan cheese, for topping Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high.

Pour the cream cheese mixture into the cooled crust and spread evenly with an offset spatula. Refrigerate, uncovered, until the cheesecake is just set but still soft, about 30 minutes. For the rose: Peel the mangoes using a vegetable peeler. With a very sharp knife, carefully cut each mango in half, tracing your knife around the pit. Slice the halves lengthwise as thinly as possible, about 1/8 inch thick. Halve the plums and remove the pits. Slice the halves as thinly as possible, about 1/8 inch thick. Fan out small stacks of about 6 to 7 mango slices into 8-inch-long strips. Arrange around the outer edge of the tart, leaning the slices upright against the crust. Overlap the strips slightly, making two rings of mango. Fan out a stack of about 6 to 7 slices of plum into 6-inch-long strips. Arrange the plum slices inside the innermost ring of mango, repeating with additional slices to create a ring of plums. Repeat with the remaining mango and plum slices creating alternating rings until you reach the center. Shingle 4 slices of mango to form a 4-inch-long strip; tightly roll it up and place it in the center of the cheesecake to create a rose bud.<br> Refrigerate uncovered for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours.

With a fine grater or zester, zest the skin of 1 lime over the onions. Cut the 4 whole limes in half cross wise and squeeze the juice over the onions. Add a pinch of salt and mix. Submerge the onions in the juice; use the squeezed limes as a weight to push down any onions sticking out of the juice. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate. Marinate the onions in the juice for as long as possible, at least 15 minutes or up to 3 days. Pour the oil into a large heavy pot that has at least a 6-quart capacity. (There should be at least 2 inches of oil in the pot.) Clip a deep-frying thermometer to the side of the pot and be sure the thermometer is touching the bottom of the pot. Heat the oil to 400 degrees F over medium heat (do not ever cover the pot). Place a chicken thigh on a cutting board and cut into 4 to 5 even-sized chunks. Repeat until all thighs are cut into chunks. Arrange all the chunks on a microwave-safe plate and season both sides with 1/4 tablespoon of adobo powder, as well as pepper. Place the plate in the microwave and cook on high for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Remove the plate and turn each piece of chicken over. Microwave again on high until the chunks are just cooked through, another 1 to 2 minutes, depending on your microwave. Let the chicken cool to room temperature. Put the egg whites in a bowl and beat with a fork until just foamy, about 1 minute. In a separate wide and shallow bowl or cake pan, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of adobo powder and paprika with the cornmeal and whole-wheat flour. Mix thoroughly. Submerge the chicken pieces in the egg whites. With a fork, toss to coat. One at a time, lift the chicken pieces from the egg whites, transfer them to the flour mixture, and coat each piece thoroughly. Let the chicken sit in one layer over the flour mixture. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly prior to assembling the salad. Place the iceberg chunks in a bowl and add the cherry tomatoes. Drain the lime juice from the onions and reserve. To the salad, add the onions, a dash of salt, and 2 tablespoons of the reserved lime juice. Toss to dress evenly. Divide the salad among four serving plates. Divide the avocado pieces equally among the salads. Fry the chicken in the oil in four separate batches until deep golden brown, about 12 seconds. Using metal tongs or a stainless steel spider basket, remove the chicken pieces from the oil and transfer them to a plate with either a wire rack on top or paper towels to drain off any excess oil. (Turn the stove off immediately after your last batch.) Arrange the cooked chicken evenly around the individual salads. Place 4 cilantro sprigs over each salad. Serve with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 20122,&quot;Cherry Ricotta Cheesecake Nonstick cooking spray 1 16-ounce container of part-skim ricotta cheese 1/2 cup of reduced-fat sour cream 4 ounces of neufchatel cheese, or reduced fat cream cheese, softened 3 large eggs 3/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 teaspoon of finely grated lemon zest 1/4 teaspoon of salt 2 cups fresh or frozen pitted sweet cherries 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin 1 tablespoon warm water Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a ramekin, add the olive oil and garlic. Roast until the oil begins to bubble and the garlic becomes a very light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the garlic to a large bowl and put half of the oil in a large pan. Reserve the rest of the oil in the ramekin for garnishing. For the dip: In the large pan with the garlic-infused oil, add the eggplant, onion and paprika; you may have to do this in batches. Turn to medium-high heat and cook, tossing, until all sides of the eggplant are lightly golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer everything in the pan, bits and all, to the large bowl with the awaiting garlic. Using a mezzaluna, chop the contents of the bowl until broken down but still a bit chunky. Sure you can do this in a food processor, but it may lose the texture if over-pulsed. You can also chop all of this on a cutting board, then scrape everything back into the large bowl. Add the parsley, yogurt and lemon zest and juice to the bowl. Stir to combine, taste and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until cool. If traveling with this to a swanky party, wait to garnish until just before serving at your host&#39;s place.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, white pepper, salt, baking soda, nutmeg and cloves. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, brown sugar and barley malt syrup until smooth. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add the egg and continue to mix until completely incorporated. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl again and add the vanilla, fresh ginger and orange zest. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in the mixer. Mix until just combined. Then, turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and press into a disk. Cover completely in the plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes. Roll the dough out about 1/4 inch thick between 2 pieces of lightly floured parchment paper. Place the rolled out dough onto parchment on a cookie sheet in the freezer for 15 minutes. Cut the dough with cookie cutters and place onto parchment-lined cookie sheets. You can gather scraps together and reroll the dough 1 additional time. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until just beginning to brown around the edges. Allow the cookies to cool completely before decorating. For the royal icing: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (see Cook&#39;s Note), add the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder and beat to combine. Add 4 tablespoons of warm water and beat to combine. Raise the paddle head to check the consistency of the icing; the icing should be thick and smooth, but not dripping from the paddle. Add more water until the desired consistency is reached. (You can add slightly more water to achieve a flooding consistency to completely cover the cookies; use a stiffer consistency to pipe decorations and details.) Immediately transfer the icing to a pastry bag fitted with a small open tip. Decorate the gingerbread cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20126,&quot;Crispy Skillet Potatoes 1 tablespoon hot chili oil 1 cup cooked Yukon gold potatoes 2 minced garlic cloves 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper Instructions: Heat hot chili oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Add the marinade ingredients and mix well. Bring a pan of water to the boil. Add the noodles and cook for 2 minutes (fresh Shanghai and udon noodles are already half-cooked when you buy them, which is why this doesn&#39;t take long). Turn the cooked noodles into a colander and cool under the cold tap. Shake them dry. Drip over 1/2 tablespoon oil and stir in thoroughly to prevent sticking. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a seasoned wok over a high flame. Add the pork strips and stir-fry swiftly to separate them. When they are just cooked, remove from the wok and set aside. Clean and re-season the wok if necessary, then return it to a high flame with the remaining oil.

When the oil gets hazy, add the onion and cook, stirring, until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, breaking it up with the back of a spoon, and cook until nicely browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the ketchup, chili powder, and mustard; simmer for 15 minutes until thick; season with salt and pepper. For the hot dogs: While the chili is cooking: place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep the hot dogs from sticking. Parboil the dogs first before grilling: bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the hot dogs for about 5 minutes. Remove from the water and grill the hot dogs just long enough to give them grill marks. Brush the insides of the rolls with the remaining oil and place them face down on the grill until toasty. To serve, top each hot dog with the chili and some Cheddar cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec]&quot; 20182,&quot;Caesar Stuffed Eggs 12 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled 1 small clove garlic 2 teaspoons anchovy paste A handful grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 3 to 4 tablespoons mayonnaise, just enough to bind 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 teaspoon coarse black pepper 2 romaine lettuce leaves, from the heart, finely chopped Instructions: Cut the fat rounded ends off the eggs and scoop the yolks into a bowl. Stand the hard-boiled egg whites upright in the egg carton. If you prefer to serve the eggs on a platter, trim a small piece of egg off the pointed ends so they will stand upright. Break the egg yolks up a little bit using a fork. Grate the garlic directly over the bowl, then add the anchovy paste, Parmigiano, mayo, Worcestershire, lemon juice, pepper and half the finely chopped lettuce.

Turn the meat over several times to coat it well, then cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Take it out occasionally whenever convenient to turn the pork over, basting it with its marinade. The following day, take the meat out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before proceeding with the preparation of the dish. Turn it over and baste it when you take it out of the refrigerator, and once every half hour thereafter. Detach the mushroom caps from the stems, discarding the stems. Wash the caps quickly in running cold water without letting them soak. Pat them dry gently but thoroughly with a cloth towel, and cut them into thin slices. Lift the tenderloin out of the deep dish, pick out any bits of the vegetables from the marinade that may be sticking to it, and pat the meat dry with kitchen towels. In a skillet that can accommodate the two pieces of pork without overlapping, put in the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, and turn the heat to high. When the oil is hot enough to sizzle when you put in the meat, slip in both pieces. Turn the meat over to brown it evenly all around, then transfer it to a platter. Pour all the marinade from the deep dish into the skillet, turn the heat down to low, and cover the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are very soft or almost dissolved. While the marinade is cooking, put 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium skillet, turn the heat to medium, and add the sliced shiitake caps with some salt. Cook, turning the mushrooms over occasionally, until the liquid they shed evaporates completely and they have become very tender. When the vegetables of the marinade are very soft, add the cooked shiitake mushrooms, cooking them together for about a minute or two. Add both pieces of pork, sprinkling them with salt and several grindings of black pepper, and raise the heat to high. Cook the meat for 10 minutes on each side. Transfer the meat onto a cutting board, cut into slices 1/3-inch thick, and place slices on a very warm serving platter. Remove the bay leaves from the marinade -- and the garlic cloves, if you can find them -- then cover the meat with the cooked marinade and mushrooms and serve at once. Ahead-of-time note: When the overnight marinating of the meat is complete, it would be desirable to proceed at once through all the succeeding steps, but if you wish you can stop a few hours in advance right after the shiitake mushrooms and cooked-down marinade have been combined. Cook the meat, however, only when ready to serve, because it may dry out and become stringy if reheated. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Dolcetto]&quot; 20184,&quot;Pappa al Pomodoro 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 ounces pancetta, diced<br> 1 small red onion, halved 1 carrot, halved 2 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Two 14-ounce cans finely chopped or crushed tomatoes, such as Mutti<br> 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth, plus up to 1 cup more 4 cups stale bread cubes (1-inch cubes)<br> 2 sprigs basil<br> One 2-inch piece Parmesan rind<br> 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil<br> Instructions: Heat a medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

Add the red onion, carrot, garlic and red pepper flakes to the pot. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the salt, canned tomatoes, chicken broth and bread cubes; stir to combine. Nestle in the basil sprigs and Parmesan rind. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle bubble. Stir in the pancetta. Cook for 25 minutes, stirring often to break apart the bread and prevent the Parmesan rind from sticking to the bottom of the pan. If the soup gets too thick, add extra broth as needed; the finished soup should be silky and thickened. Stir in the grated Parmesan. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top with a sprinkling of Parmesan, a drizzle of olive oil, and chopped basil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]&quot; 20185,&quot;Panettone Trifle 1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 8 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, melted 1/2 cup powdered sugar 2 teaspoons espresso powder 1/4 cup coffee liqueur 12 ounces panettone, cubed Chocolate shavings, for garnish Instructions: Using an electric mixer, beat the mascarpone cheese, melted chocolate, powdered sugar, and espresso powder in a large bowl until smooth and fluffy.

Instructions: For the garlic confit: Cut the tops off of the tip of the garlic heads, leaving the root ends intact. Add to a small saucepan and cover with the vegetable oil. Cook gently over medium-low heat until the oil is infused and the garlic is soft to the touch, about 45 minutes (it should not come to a simmer). Remove the garlic heads from the oil and allow to cool prior to removing the softened cloves. Squeeze out the cloves from their skins and mash slightly; set aside. Reserve the oil. For the deviled eggs: Lay the eggs flat in a saucepan and cover with water. Put the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once at a boil, cover with a tight-fitting lid, turn the heat off and let the eggs sit for 12 minutes. Submerge or rinse in cold water until cooled.<br> Peel the eggs, cut lengthwise and separate the yolks. Mash the yolks in a bowl with the melted butter, mayonnaise and mustard until smooth. Stir in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Put the filling into a piping bag, no tip needed. Season the egg white halves with salt and pepper and drizzle with some of the garlic oil. Refill the egg whites with the filling. For the spiced almonds: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. In a bowl, whisk the egg white until thick and frothy. Add the sugar, cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and stir to combine. Add the almonds and coat with the egg white mixture. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the nuts to a baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and crunchy, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring halfway. (Note: There will be way more spiced nuts than you need, but they hold up well in an airtight container.) For the roasted celery root: Raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Toss the celery root with the coconut oil in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Place on the outer perimeter of a baking sheet, which is where they will roast evenly, and roast until golden brown, about 20 minutes. For the creamy garlic vinaigrette: In a food processor, add the honey, garlic confit, mustard and egg yolks and pulse to combine. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and pulse. Add the sherry vinegar and pulse to combine. Turn the speed to low and slowly drizzle in the oil. Turn off immediately after the last oil is combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Divide the kale into 4 parts. In a small bowl, place one-quarter of the kale and 1 tablespoon of the creamy garlic vinaigrette and toss to coat. Arrange on a plate, add 3 deviled egg halves, a small handful of spiced almonds and some roasted celery root. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 4 servings. Serve with the Spiced Biscuits and drizzle with another tablespoon of dressing. Combine the flour, baking powder, 1 tablespoon of the za&#39;atar, the sugar and salt in a medium bowl using a whisk. Using a bowl scraper or your fingers, mix in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal; using your fingers will create a more cake-like texture. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk. Stir until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead 5 or 6 times. Roll the dough into a 1-inch-thick disc and cut out biscuits using a 3-inch biscuit cutter. Make sure you don&#39;t twist the cutter otherwise you&#39;ll squish the sides and the biscuit won&#39;t rise. Knead the scraps together, re-roll and cut out biscuits until all the dough has been used. Place the biscuits bottom-side up on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Whisk together the vegetable oil with the remaining 1 tablespoon za&#39;atar and brush the mixture on each biscuit.

Sprinkle the yeast over the milk, and let it sit until dissolved, about 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into a large bowl, and stir in the butter, 1/2 cup of the sugar, egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of the vanilla and the salt. Fold in the flour (it&#39;s OK if there are a few lumps). Cover and set aside in a warm place until the mixture is bubbly and rises by about half its original volume, 1 to 2 hours. (The batter can be made a day ahead and refrigerated after it rises.) Once the batter is ready, preheat the waffle iron and preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Whip the egg whites and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar with an electric mixer to soft peaks in a medium bowl. Fold the whites and sprinkles into the batter. Brush the top and bottom of the preheated waffle iron with butter, and pour the batter into each compartment (this varies from 1/4 to 1/2 cup, depending on the size of your waffle maker). Cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp; remove them to a plate, and transfer to the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter. Meanwhile, warm the maple syrup in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon vanilla. Set aside and keep warm. To serve, stack 2 waffles on a serving dish, drizzle with some of the maple-vanilla syrup and top with a dollop of whipped cream.

Butter just the sides of a 9-inch round cake pan. For the caramel topping: Stir the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring, and gently swirl the saucepan occasionally until the mixture is the color of light amber, 6 to 8 minutes. If needed, brush any sugar crystals off the side of the saucepan with a wet pastry brush. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and carefully whisk in the butter (take care: the mixture can bubble up considerably). Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan, tilting the pan to cover most of the bottom (be careful: the pan will be very hot from the caramel). Arrange the figs, cut-side down, on the caramel. For the cake: Spread the hazelnuts out on a baking sheet, and bake until nicely toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool, then pulse in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl and whisk them together with the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as needed, then beat in the vanilla and lemon zest (it&#39;s okay if the batter looks slightly separated and broken). Adjust the mixer speed to low, and add 1/2 the flour mixture, then the sour cream, then the remaining flour mixture. Pour the batter over the figs in the cake pan, spread it into an even layer and give the pan a few taps on the counter. Bake the cake until it&#39;s golden brown and pulls away from the edge of the pan and a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the center, 45 to 50 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to separate it from the pan. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until just cool enough to handle, 20 to 30 minutes. Invert a serving platter over the cake pan and, while holding them together, quickly flip them over so the cake unmolds, fig-side up. Let cool completely.

Warm the filtered water to 90 degrees, dissolve the yeast and set aside for 15 minutes. Add the salt to the well along with half the yeast mixture. Working from the center outward, pull the sides of the well into the center until all the flour is incorporated (the mixture will be sticky). Continue to mix the dough and add the remaining yeast in increments until all the yeast mixture is incorporated. Knead the dough until it is elastic, silky and no longer sticky. Add pinches of flour if necessary to reduce the stickiness but do not add too much or the dough will be dry. Knead the dough for 15 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and put the dough in a bowl covered with a damp cloth. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 hour. Punch the dough down, press out most of the air and shape it back into a ball. Let the dough rise for an additional 3 hours. Punch the dough down, form it into a ball and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours to \retard\ on a sheet tray covered with plastic wrap. When ready, let the dough warm to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before using. For the pulled prosciutto: Add the prosciutto end, carrots, celery, onion and garlic to a stockpot and cover with 1 galloncold water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours. Allow the prosciutto to cool in the liquid for 1 hour (it should be fork tender). Remove the prosciutto, pull the pork, discard half of the outer skin and mix the rest in with the pulled prosciutto. For the melted leeks: Cut the tops off the leek to the tender part of the leek. Cut the leek in half, top to bottom. Rinse the leek well in cool water to remove all the dirt. Cut the leek into 1/4-inch half-moons. Saute the leeks on medium heat in a large saucepot with the butter until very tender, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring as needed. When the leeks are dry, deglaze with the wine and reduce until almost dry. Add the cream and reduce until almost dry. Season with salt and pepper. Allow to cool before adding to the pizza. For the caramelized onions: Heat a large saute pan on medium-high heat. Coat the bottom of a pan with the oil, then add the onions and stir to coat. Add the sugar and some salt to taste. Saute the onions until beginning to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water and cook until evaporated, stirring occasionally. Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce until the onions lose their crunch and the pan is dry. Allow to cool before topping the pizza. For the cured black olives: In a large stockpot, bring 1 gallon water to a boil. Add the olives to a strainer and dip 5 to 6 times in the boiling water to remove the excess salt. Meanwhile, heat the extra-virgin olive oil on medium heat in a saucepan. Add the fresh rosemary and heat in the oil until just fragrant. Remove the pan from the heat and add the olives to the rosemary oil. Allow to cool at room temperature to marinate. Marinate the olives overnight to pick up the rosemary flavor. For the pizza: Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 550 degrees F. Let it heat for at least 30 minutes. Form the dough into a 12-inch disk with plenty of bench flour (make sure the dough is the same thickness throughout, especially the center). Place on a pizza peel dusted with flour and spread the melted leeks onto the dough evenly, leaving a 1-inch border around the outside. Evenly spread 2 ounces grated fontina cheese, 3 ounces pulled prosciutto and about 1 ounce caramelized onions over the pizza. Scatter 8 rosemary-marinated salt-cured olives. Sprinkle with a little Parmigiano-Reggiano. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone and bake until the cheese melts and the crust starts to char, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and slice into 6 pieces.

Set rack on the bottom third of the oven so the roast will fit completely inside. In a small mixing bowl or mortar and pestle, combine thyme, sage, garlic, and salt and pepper, to taste, and mash to break up herbs and garlic. Add oil, about 1 cup, and combine with pestle. Take crown roast of pork and if your butcher hasn&#39;t already prepared it, clean the bones of meat with a boning knife (French them) and make a small cut into the meat in between each rib so you can wrap it into a circle easily; save the scraps. Rub the pork all over with the herb mixture. With the ribs on the outside, wrap the rack around onto itself so the ends meet and secure with kitchen twine so it holds its crown shape. *Cook&#39;s note: if you are doing this by yourself, using a skewer to help hold its shape while you wrap the kitchen twine around the roast. Place in a roasting pan. Add the scraps into the bottom of the pan alongside the roast. This will help add flavor to your sauce. Set aside to bring the pork to room temperature prior to cooking. Fill the cavity with Apple Pecan Stuffing. Cover the stuffing and the tips of the rib bones with foil then place the whole roast in the oven and bake for 2 hours and 20 minutes, an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should register 150 degrees F when done. About 30 to 45 minutes prior to doneness, remove the foil to brown the stuffing and create a crust. Remove from the oven, loosely cover with foil and allow to rest for 30 minutes before cutting. Serve with Apple Pecan Stuffing and Gravy. Garnish with watercress, if desired. Set a large saute pan over medium heat and add olive oil, sage and thyme sprigs. As the oil heats up the herbs will crackle and fry, infusing the oil. Remove the sage and thyme and set aside on a paper towel to drain - these can be as a garnish, if desired. Add onions to the pan and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes until caramelized. Season with salt and pepper. Remove onions from pan and add apples. Crush the pecans and add to the pan. Add more oil, if needed and season with salt and pepper. Gently saute until pecans are lightly toasted and apples are just cooked slightly - about 3 to 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl whisk together egg, cream, chicken stock, and salt and pepper, to taste. Add torn sourdough, caramelized onions, apples, pecans and chopped parsley. Using a wooden spoon, mix the stuffing until well combined. Place carrots, onion, celery, turnip, apple and garlic in a food processor and pulse until you have a coarse textured puree. Once roasting pan comes out of the oven (and meat is removed) set it over medium-high heat on the stove. Add a 2-count of olive oil then add vegetable puree. Sweat for 7 to 8 minutes until most of the moisture has cooked off, then dust with flour. Cook for 2 more minutes stirring well to incorporate all the flour with the fat in the pan. Add the apple liqueur and scrape the bottom of the pan. Gradually add chicken stock, stirring as you go to ensure there are no lumps. Bring to a simmer and season well with salt and pepper. Simmer then remove from heat and strain through a sieve - it&#39;s okay if some of the pulp goes through as this will naturally add body to the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20271,&quot;Peanut Butter Brownie Bites Cooking spray 1 stick unsalted butter, cut into pieces 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped Coarse gold sugar, for decorating (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the polenta to the chicken stock and stir to combine. Place into a bowl and place over the simmering water to act as a double boiler. Once it starts to get soft, after about 5 minutes, add the mascarpone, 2 large tablespoons Parmesan cheese and 2 large tablespoons butter. Stir to combine and allow to slowly cook for about 40 to 50 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the polenta starts to become too hard, add more liquid, chicken stock or water, as needed. Place a saute pan over medium heat and add 1 large tablespoon butter. Add the chanterelles and evenly space them in the pan to not overcrowd. Season the mushrooms with salt, to taste. Add the shallots, garlic and 6 to 8 sprigs thyme and allow the mushrooms to caramelize.

Season with 1 tablespoon of the rub. Set aside in the refrigerator. Make a roux by combining the oil and flour in a large cast-iron or enameled cast-iron Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir slowly with a wire whisk or wooden spoon for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the roux becomes dark brown, the color of chocolate. Add the celery, onions, bell peppers, and chilies. Cook, stirring often, for 6 to 7 minutes. Add the bay leaves and garlic and cook for about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, water, and the remaining 1 teaspoon rub. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, for about 1 hour, or until a thin oil film appears on the surface. Stir occasionally to prevent the mixture from sticking. Increase the heat to medium, add the broth, salt, and cayenne and cook for about 15 minutes. Lay the fish in the mixture and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.

Cut out and discard the core. Cut each quarter crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Combine the water and salt in a large bowl and stir to dissolve. Add the cabbage and toss well to coat with brine. Leave for 4 hours, tossing every hour. Drain the cabbage well, then spread the cabbage out on a baking sheet and gently pat dry with paper towels. Pasting (optional): While the cabbage is brining, make the sweet rice flour paste. In a small saucepan, combine the rice flour with a cup of cold water and whisk vigorously to fully dissolve the flour. Gently heat to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. (Be sure to scrape the bottom of the saucepan, as the rice flour has a tendency to settle there.) Simmer until the mixture thickens and becomes glossy and gelatinous, 2 to 3 minutes. Saucing: Pulse the garlic and ginger in a blender. Add the apple, onion, fish sauce, salted shrimp and sugar and puree until everything is well broken down--no need to overdo it. Empty the contents of the blender into a large bowl. (If you&#39;re using the rice paste, add it now and stir well, to fully incorporate.) Add the gochugaru to the bowl and mix well. This is the point at which things get messy. Suit up with a pair of clean latex gloves. (Dish gloves-well-washed, of course-will do perfectly well.) Add the scallion and carrot to the bowl and, with your gloved hands, work it all together to coat the vegetables with sauce. Do the same with the cabbage, gently massaging sauce into cabbage. Firmly pack the cabbage mixture into clean, quart-size mason jars, pressing as you go to remove any air pockets. Leave 1 inch of headroom in the jars to allow for expansion during fermentation. Press a small sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the cabbage and seal the jars tightly. Fermenting: Refrigerate the jars, set on a plate to catch leaks. In a week, the kimchi will be fresh, very lightly fermented and pretty darn tasty. In two weeks, as the fermentation really kicks into gear, the kimchi will ascend to a whole other plane of awesome. Kimchi keeps for months, getting increasingly pungent over time. Dig in and enjoy it every step of the way. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20287,&quot;Sweet and Sticky Spareribs with Fried Noodles 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce 2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce 3 tablespoons white vinegar 1/4 cup soy sauce 2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 cup pineapple juice 1/4 cup brown sugar Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 pounds pork spareribs 1/2 (12-ounce) package wonton wrappers 1 cup canola oil Instructions: In a small bowl whisk together all the ingredients for the marinade. Cut the spareribs into individual ribs and put in a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade into the bag and toss to coat. Put the bag into a large bowl and refrigerate to let marinate for at least 2 hours or as long as overnight. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Remove the spare ribs from marinade and arrange on a baking sheet, cover with foil and poke holes in the foil to vent. Reserve the marinade. Bake until the ribs are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. In the meantime, pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer the mixture until thick, about 30 minutes. Set aside. After 1 1/2 hours, remove the foil from the spareribs and raise oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Baste the ribs with the reduced marinade and roast in oven for 5 minutes. Turn and baste the ribs again with the remaining sauce and roast for an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and arrange the ribs on a serving platter. Serve hot with Fried Noodles. Fried Noodles: Heat 1 cup canola oil in a medium heavy saucepan, to about 350 degrees F. Cut the wonton wrappers into 1/2-inch wide strips.

In a large bowl, combine all of the dry ingredients until they are integrated. Dip each fillet in the herb mixture until both sides are covered. Slowly place each fillet in the hot oil and saute them until they are blackened on each side and fully cooked internally. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside. Thoroughly clean the bok choy and separate the leaves from each other. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and add the bok choy to the pot for approximately 1 minute. Remove the bok choy leaves and immediately put them in ice-cold water to stop the cooking process. Prepare the couscous according to the package directions. Finely chop a couple of tomatoes and add them into the prepared pot of couscous. Flatten each leaf of bok choy and spoon a generous helping of couscous in the center. Wrap each leaf with the couscous inside. In a grill pan over medium heat, drizzle a small amount of olive oil and grill both sides of the bok choy until the wraps are heated through. Remove the wraps from the pan and add salt and pepper, to taste. In a medium sized grill pan, heat just enough olive oil to saute the vegetables. Clean and slice all of the vegetables and saute them in the pan until they are slightly tender. In the pan, stack several julienne strips of red pepper, squash and asparagus on top of a slice of eggplant. Generously spread goat cheese on top the vegetable stack and place another slice of eggplant on top of the stack to create a \sandwich.\ Heat the stacks until the cheese begins to soften and then remove them from the pan.

Pour enough boiling water into each bowl to cover the ingredients, 1 1/2 to 2 cups. Set aside to soak, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, using the large side of a box grater or a food processor with the shredder attachment, grate the daikon into shreds. This may take several batches; just transfer the shredded daikon to a large bowl and continue with the rest. Be sure to reserve all the liquid.<br> Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the shredded daikon with its liquid. Cook, stirring occasionally so the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or brown on the bottom, until the daikon is softened and cooked down by half and much of the liquid has cooked out, 20 to 25 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). The daikon should resemble something like sauerkraut. Set aside.<br> When the shiitakes are done soaking, remove them from the bowl; discard the liquid and mushrooms stems. Cut the mushroom caps into small dice. Discard the liquid from the dried scallops and shrimp and cut into small dice.<br> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until some of the fat starts to render, about 3 minutes. Stir in the sausage and shallots and continue to cook until the sausage is slightly golden and more of the fat has rendered, about 3 more minutes. Add the shiitakes, scallops and shrimp, toss to coat in the fat and cook until the aromatics are slightly golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.<br> Fit a large wide pot with a steamer insert, fill with 2 to 3 inches of water and set over high heat. Cover and bring to a boil.<br> Combine the cornstarch and rice flour in a large bowl. Slowly add 2 1/2 cups of water and mix with a large rubber spatula until well combined. It will be very thick and difficult to stir, but as it slowly combines, it will become easier. The mixture should resemble a thick slurry. If it?s too thick, feel free to add an additional 1/4 cup water at the end to help bind everything.<br> Return the wok with the daikon to medium-high heat. Give the slurry mixture one last stir to make sure everything is mixed well, then pour it into the daikon. Cook, stirring with a large wooden spoon or large rubber spatula so the mixture does not set up, until the mixture is thickened and beginning to clump up, about 5 minutes; it should resemble grits or thick mac and cheese. Remove from the heat, add the bacon mixture and the fat from the skillet and stir to combine. Add the bouillon, white pepper, sugar if using and 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside.<br> Lightly coat two 9-inch round disposable aluminum pans with vegetable oil and divide the daikon mixture between the pans. Steam one pan at a time in the steamer, adding more water to the pot as needed, until a skewer or chopstick inserted in center of the mixture comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Carefully remove the steamed daikon cake and transfer to a trivet and cool to room temperature. Repeat with the remaining pan.<br> When ready to serve, cut the daikon into 3-inch-long by 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough vegetable oil to lightly coat the bottom. Once it starts to shimmer, add the daikon cake pieces in batches and pan-fry until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and serve with oyster sauce on the side. Garnish with sliced scallions.

Put the shallots on a flat surface and slice them into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Toss the rounds in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of the white wine vinegar, orange juice, and salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside. In a large bowl, toss the radicchio halves in 4 tablespoons of the olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Arrange them, cut sides down, in a single layer on the grill. You want them to be in an area of the grill that is good and hot without being so hot that they flame and scorch. Meanwhile, combine the honey and the remaining vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat and cook until the mixture begins to foam. Turn the heat to low and keep warm. After the radicchio has grilled for 5 minutes, turn them over to the other side and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. They may vary in cooking times depending on their size. What you are looking for is that the halves hold their shape somewhat, but are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Remove from the grill to a platter, drizzle with the honey mixture and top with the pickled shallots. You can allow this dish to \rest\ for a while so it can absorb the flavors of the dressing, or enjoy it immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 20303,&quot;Shigoku Oysters with Ricard Mignonette 1/2 c. champagne vinegar 1/2 c. dry white wine 4 tsp.

Add about one-third of the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Add half the milk mixture and beat until smooth. Repeat, adding flour, then milk, and then the rest of the flour, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat briefly to make a smooth batter. Put the egg whites in a clean bowl. Whip on high speed until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue to beat until the egg whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks, about 10 minutes. Fold the whites into the batter in three batches. Divide the cake batter evenly between the liners. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, rotating the tin about halfway through, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes on a rack in the tin for 10 minutes, and then remove from the tin.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Use a pastry blender, two butter knives or your fingers to cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the buttermilk to make a soft dough. Use a little more buttermilk, if necessary, to keep the dough very soft. Lightly flour your table or countertop and dust your hands with flour. Turn the dough out onto the floured surface and gently pat it into a cake 1 1/2 inches high. Use a 3-inch biscuit cutter to cut the dough into rounds. Use a pastry scraper or a metal spatula to place the cutout biscuits, with sides closely touching, on the parchment-lined sheet. Gently pat the scraps together, sprinkling on a little buttermilk to keep dough soft, and cut out more biscuits. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20307,&quot;Instant Pot Confetti Birthday Cake Nonstick cooking spray 1 1/2 cups bleached cake flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3 tablespoons rainbow sprinkles, plus more for decorating 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 large egg, at room temperature 1/2 cup sour cream 4 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 24 tablespoons (3 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 vanilla bean, split 2 to 3 tablespoons heavy cream Instructions: For the cake: Coat a 7-inch round cake pan with 3-inch sides with nonstick spray. Line the bottom of the pan with a parchment, coat the paper. Whisk together the flour, sprinkles, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl to combine.<br> Beat the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale yellow, 2 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat on high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg, scraping down sides and bottom of the bowl, and continue to beat until creamy, about 2 minutes (the mixture will look curdled but will come back together after it has been beaten for 1 or 2 minutes). With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the sour cream in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Place two 18-inch pieces of twine criss-crossing one another on a clean work surface. Place the cake pan over the twine, then lay a clean dish towel over the top of the cake pan and tuck the ends under. Take the 2 ends of 1 piece of twine and tie them into a tight knot over the top of the cake pan. Repeat with the remaining twine so that you have two twine handles to support and lift the cake. Set a rack inside the Instant Pot? and add 2 cups water. Using the twine handles, place the cake inside the pot. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high pressure for 40 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). After the pressure cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for natural release for 15 minutes and then quick release and wait until the cycle is complete. Be careful of any remaining steam and unlock and remove the lid.<br> Lift the cake out of the pot. Cut the twine and unwrap the cake pan, then transfer to a wire rack. Let the cake cool in the pan, 30 minutes, then invert the cake onto a rack, peel off the parchment and let cool completely. Invert the cake again so that it is right-side up. Horizontally trim the top dome from the cake with a long serrated knife to create a flat surface. Slice the cake in half horizontally to make 2 layers. (Cake can be baked 1 day ahead.) Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. For the buttercream: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar and butter with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape in the seeds from the vanilla bean, then add 2 tablespoons cream and continue to beat on high speed for 1 minute more, adding more cream if necessary for a spreadable consistency.<br> Place 1 cake layer on a cake stand or large plate. Spoon 1 1/2 cups buttercream over the top. Smooth the buttercream to the edge of the cake using an offset spatula or the back of a spoon, creating an even layer. Place another cake layer on top. Spread the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with sprinkles as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 20308,&quot;Gluten-Free Gingerbread Men 2 cups white rice flour 1 cup tapioca flour (also called tapioca starch) 1/2 cup buckwheat flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice (or mixture of nutmeg, allspice, cloves) 1/2 teaspoon table salt 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 2/3 cup dark brown sugar, packed 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1/2 cup blackstrap molasses 1 1/2 teaspoons gluten-free vanilla extract Easy Royal Icing, recipe follows Candies, nuts and sprinkles, for decorating 1/3 cup pasteurized egg whites (from a carton is fine) 1 tablespoon freshly-squeezed orange juice 1/4 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla extract 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more if needed Food coloring Instructions: In a medium bowl, sift together the rice, tapioca and buckwheat flours, the baking soda, xanthan gum, ginger, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and salt. Whisk until well blended, and set aside.<br> In a large bowl, use an electric mixer on medium speed to cream the butter with the brown sugar until the mixture is light, airy and pale tan, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and mix again on medium until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add the molasses and vanilla, and mix again at medium speed for another minute. Add half the dry ingredients and mix on low until incorporated. Add the second half of the dry ingredients and mix on low until the dough comes together in small clumps. (The dough will resemble thick brownie batter.) If the dough is too wet and not clumpy, add another tablespoon or two of rice flour. Using your hands, bring the dough together into a ball and knead for 1 minute, or until you can make a smooth ball of dough. Shape the dough into a disk and place in a resealable plastic bag, removing excess air. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. (If the dough chills much longer than an hour, let it sit on the counter for about 10 minutes to soften before proceeding.)<br> When ready to make the cookies, adjust oven racks to the top and bottom thirds and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment.<br> Divide the dough in 3 equal portions. Refrigerate two portions while you work on the first. Roll the dough out to a 1/8-inch thickness. (Best method for GF cookies is to use parchment paper barely dusted with rice flour on the top and bottom of the dough - this avoids needing to use a lot of extra bench flour to keep the dough from sticking to the counter). Use cookie cutters to cut out gingerbread men. You should be able to cut out 5 to 6 gingerbread men from each third of the dough, assuming they are 3 inches tall. Gather and re-roll the scraps. (Don&#39;t worry about overworking the dough, there isn&#39;t any gluten.)<br> Arrange the gingerbread men on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart and bake until the edges just begin to take on golden color, 8 to 10 minutes. (For softer cookies, cook a minute or 2 less.) Let the cookies cool for a minute on the cookie sheet, and then remove and place on a cooling rack to cool completely. Let the baking sheets cool completely.<br> Repeat the process for the remaining dough portions.<br> Once completely cooled, decorate the cookies with colored Easy Royal Icing, along with candies, nuts and sprinkles. In a medium bowl, use an electric mixer on low speed to mix the egg whites until frothy, about 2 minutes. Add the orange juice and vanilla and mix again until blended. Sift in the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 cup at a time, and then mix on low speed until incorporated. After the third cup of sugar is added, keep mixing until the icing is smooth, thick and shiny, about 2 more minutes. (Add an extra tablespoon or 2 of confectioners&#39; sugar if the icing seems runnier, like a glaze.) Divide into 2 or 3 portions, add desired amount of food coloring and mix well.<br> Fill a few tablespoons of royal icing in the corner of a resealable plastic bag, snip the tip and draw (or spread the icing with a paintbrush) onto the cookies (thin with a drop or 2 of extra juice). Chill the cookies in the refrigerator for a few minutes to harden the icing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20309,&quot;Pico de Gallo 3 yellow or red onions 12 Roma tomatoes (slightly under ripe is fine) 2 cups fresh cilantro leaves 2 to 3 jalapenos 1 lime Salt Instructions: Dice up equal quantities of onion and tomato. Roughly chop the cilantro. Now, slice 1 or 2 jalapenos in half. With a spoon, scrape out the seeds. (If you like things spicy, leave in some of the white membranes.) Dice the jalapenos very finely; you want a hint of heat and jalapeno flavor, but you don&#39;t want to cause any fires. Now dump the four ingredients into a bowl. Slice the lime in half and squeeze the juice from half a lime the bowl. Sprinkle with salt, and stir together until combined. Be sure to taste the pico de gallo and adjust the seasonings, adding salt or more diced jalapeno if needed. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20310,&quot;Raspberry Marshmallows 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup light corn syrup 4 egg whites 2 tablespoons powdered gelatin 4 tablespoons cold water 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 tablespoons powdered dried raspberries (see Note) 1 box cornstarch, as needed Wooden skewers, as needed Serving suggestion: Your favorite dessert fondue Instructions: Combine the sugar, water, and corn syrup in a saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Bring to a boil and cook to \soft ball\ stage, about 235 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the 2 tablespoons water and let dissolve. When the syrup reaches 235 degrees F, remove it from the heat, add the gelatin, and mix. Pour the syrup into the whipped egg whites. Add the vanilla and continue whipping until stiff. Add the powdered dried raspberries to turn it pink. Spread the mixture onto a parchment-lined 8-inch square cake pan that&#39;s been lightly dusted with cornstarch. The parchment paper should come all the way up the sides of the pan. The marshmallow layer should be about 1-inch thick. Let cool, then cut into 1-inch squares, dipping your knife in cornstarch, if necessary, and toss in cornstarch lightly to keep them from sticking to each other. Skewer them and dip into your favorite dessert fondue. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 20311,&quot;Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffins 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 3/4 cup milk 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips Serving suggestions: strawberry jam Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the muffin tin with paper liners and lightly coat with cooking spray. (This may seem like overkill, but otherwise the muffins will stick.) Whisk the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, lightly whisk the eggs, then whisk in the butter, brown sugar, milk, oil and vanilla. Quickly fold the wet ingredients into the dry with a rubber spatula. Just before the batter comes together, fold in the chocolate chips?don?t mix the batter too much or the muffins will be tough. Divide the batter among the muffin cups (1/4 cup of batter per muffin). Bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Turn the muffins out of the tins, cool on a rack. Serve slightly warm with jam. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Pinotage]&quot; 20312,&quot;Cowboy Caviar 3 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 tablespoons finely chopped pickled jalapeno plus 1 tablespoon brine 1 teaspoon honey Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil One 15-ounce can black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained One 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained 1 cup frozen corn, thawed 1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro 4 scallions, chopped 2 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped 1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped Tortilla chips, for serving Instructions: Whisk together the vinegar, pickled jalapeno brine, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a large bowl.

Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the meat and the Six Pepper Spice to the skillet, and cook until desired degree of doneness. Add more pepper, as desired. Remove from heat. In a medium bowl, combine the meat with the cooled Fruit Relish. Add the pine nuts, and stir until just combined. Spread 1 grape leaf out on flat surface, vein side up. Place about 1/4 cup meat mixture on each leaf, and roll it up like a small burrito or a 3-inch cigar. Repeat with remaining grape leaves. Place the stuffed grape leaves in a steamer, and steam for 3 to 5 minutes, or until completely heated through. Meanwhile, add the yogurt, strawberries, figs, and honey to a blender or food processor. Blend until combined, adding more honey to taste, as desired. Set aside. Serve the steamed grapes leaves with the yogurt dipping sauce, if desired. Combine all ingredients in a small non-reactive saucepan. Add 1/4 cup water, and cook over medium heat until fruit softens. Taste for seasoning, and add more vinegar, sugar, or water, as necessary. The relish should be dry. Remove from heat and let cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20316,&quot;Corn, Cilantro and Black Bean Soup 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped (1 cup) 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 cups chicken broth 4 cups water 1 large bunch fresh cilantro, rinsed 1 package (10 ounces) thawed frozen corn kernels 1 can (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained 1 to 2 tablespoons lime juice Salt and cayenne pepper 1/4 cup sour cream, regular or low fat, optional 2 tablespoons pimento, cut into thin strips Instructions: Heat olive oil in a saucepan. When hot, add the onion, cover and cook over low heat for 5 minutes or until tender. Add the garlic and cumin and saute for 10 seconds to release their aroma. Add the broth and water and bring to a simmer. While the liquid is coming to a simmer, with a knife separate the cilantro leaves from the stems. If you wish, wrap the stems well with string and add to the broth to infuse the liquid with more cilantro flavor. When the liquid is at a simmer, add the corn and beans and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes just to heat the ingredients well. Meanwhile chop the cilantro leaves you need anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped leaves. Add the cilantro leaves and immediately remove the soup from the heat. Discard the cilantro stems. Add the lime juice and season to taste with salt and cayenne pepper. Ladle the soup out and garnish each portion with sour cream and garnish the sour cream with pimento. Variation: to turn this into a main course soup, add 12 ounces of strips of raw chicken when you add the beans and corn. Or add 12 ounces chopped cleaned shrimp after you have added the beans and corn and cook for 2 minutes to cook through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 20317,&quot;Angel&#39;s Food Cupcakes Cooking spray 1/2 cup cake flour (not self-rising) 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Fine salt 5 large egg whites, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest 1 large piece crystallized ginger Scant 1/4 cup white candy coating, such as Wilton Candy Melts 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Fine salt Instructions: For the cupcakes: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners, and lightly coat with cooking spray. Sift the flour, confectioners&#39; sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt through a fine sieve into a medium bowl; set aside. Combine the egg whites in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until frothy, about 2 minutes. Add the cream of tartar, and beat until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the granulated sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Increase the speed to medium-high, and continue beating until the peaks are stiff and very shiny, about 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla and lemon zest. Remove the bowl from the stand. Sprinkle 1/4 of the flour mixture on top of the eggs, and gently fold in with a rubber spatula. Evenly fold in the remaining flour mixture in 3 additions. Divide the batter evenly among the lined muffin cups in messy mounds taller than the liners, and bake until the cupcakes spring back when gently pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 14 to 16 minutes. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. For the halo decorations: Cut 12 sticks 1 inch long and about 1/8 inch thick out of the crystallized ginger. Trim the ends so they are straight across. Trace 12 circles on a piece of parchment with a 1-inch round cookie cutter. Turn the paper over; set aside. Fit one of the pastry bags with the tip. Microwave the candy coating in a small bowl, uncovered, at 40 percent power in 30-second increments, stirring in between, until melted and completely smooth. Transfer the candy coating to the pastry bag, and pipe it into 12 circles, using the parchment template as a guide. Set aside to let harden slightly. Pipe 1 small dollop of the candy coating directly onto each circle, and push a ginger stick into each so it is standing straight up. Let the halos harden completely. For the frosting: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a stand mixer&#39;s heatproof bowl above the water (or a large heatproof bowl if using a handheld mixer). Whisk the egg whites, granulated sugar, cream of tartar and a pinch of salt together in the bowl; set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat the egg white mixture with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until it is cool and forms stiff peaks, about 5 minutes. Decorate the cupcakes: Transfer the frosting to the remaining pastry bag, and pipe generous swirls on top of each cupcake, lifting the bag up quickly to make a peak. Push the ginger stem of a halo into each, and serve right away. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20318,&quot;Passion Fruit Sangria 2 bottles dry white wine 3/4 cup brandy 1/2 cup Triple Sec 3/4 cup simple syrup (equal amounts sugar and water heated until sugar dissolves and cooled) 3/4 cup passion fruit puree 2 cups fresh orange juice 3 oranges, sliced into thin rounds 3 green apples, cored and sliced thinly 2 lemons, sliced into thin rounds 1 cup blackberries, washed and sliced in 1/2 Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a large pitcher.

Make 8 (1-inch) deep incisions on the top of the roast. Insert 1 piece of ginger into each incision. Season entire roast with salt and pepper and place in a roasting pan. Roast for 15 minutes then lower the heat to 350 degrees F. Roast the beef to an internal temperature of 130 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, for medium-rare, about 45 minutes. Remove the beef from the pan, tent it with foil and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Pour or spoon out most of the oil from the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat. Pour in the beef stock and the soy sauce. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula to release the browned bits. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. To serve, slice the beef thinly and spoon warm sauce over top. Note: A boneless rib roast is an excellent cut of beef for roasting. If you prefer to use a less expensive cut, you could substitute a sirloin tip or bottom round rump roast. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 20320,&quot;Moors and Christians Rice (White Rice and Black Beans): Moros y Cristianos 1/2 pound black beans 12 cups water 1 medium Spanish onion, peeled 1 medium green pepper, cored and seeded 6 cachucha peppers (available in Hispanic markets) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 pound slab bacon, finely diced 3 garlic cloves, finely minced 1 medium Spanish onion, finely chopped 1 medium green bell pepper, finely chopped 1 teaspoon cumin powder 1 teaspoon oregano 1 bay leaf 2 cups long grain rice 4 cups reserved liquid 1 tablespoon vinegar 1 tablespoon dry sherry 2 teaspoons salt Instructions: Cooking the beans: Wash the beans and cook in a large kettle with the peeled whole onion, the cachucha peppers, and the cored and seeded green pepper.

Get in the habit of always tasting your flour; once it coats the veal it is harder to adjust the seasoning. Dredge the veal shanks in the seasoned flour and then tap off the excess (extra flour will burn and make the dish off-tasting). Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat and hit it with a 3-count drizzle of oil. Add the butter and swirl it around the pan to melt. Sear the veal shanks, turning carefully with tongs, until all sides are a rich brown caramel color. Drizzle with a little more oil, if needed. (Do this in batches if the shanks are big and look crowded in the pot.) Remove the browned veal shanks to a side plate. There will be a lot of flavor left over in the bottom of the pot. You&#39;re going to use that to create your sauce. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Using the same pot, saute the onion, celery, carrots, lemon zest, garlic, bay leaves, and parsley over medium heat. Cook the vegetables down until they start to get some color and develop a deep, rich aroma. Season with salt and pepper; add a little oil if needed. Nestle the veal shanks back in the pot. Pour in the wine and let it simmer down for 20 minutes, until the wine has reduced by half. Reducing is key for intense flavor. Add the beef broth and tomatoes and stir everything together. Cover the pot and put it in the oven. Braise for 1 and a 1/2 hours. Then remove the cover and continue to cook for another 30 minutes. The sauce should be thick and the veal tender and nearly falling off the bone. Remove bay leaves. For the gremolata: Finely chop the pine nuts, dried cranberries and combine. Combine this with the garlic together in a mini chopper or with a mortar and pestle. Fold that into the orange zest and parsley. Scatter the gremolata over the Osso Bucco before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 20341,&quot;No Mess or Stress Stuffed Shells 1 box uncooked jumbo pasta shells 1 (26-ounce) jar chunky tomato sauce with onion and garlic 1 (28-ounce) can peeled whole tomatoes 1 package (8) uncooked pre-seasoned meatballs 1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1/2 cup shredded provolone cheese 1 egg 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning 1 (8-ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese (whole milk) Special equipment: 1 (13 by 9-inch) baking dish or 1 (10-inch) round baking dish Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Carefully turn out the pizza dough onto a floured countertop. Flatten into a disk without folding the edges, making sure the dough is round and all bubbles are pressed out. Roll to about 14 inches in diameter. Grease a 12-inch pizza pan with the olive oil, making sure to coat the sides. Carefully lift the dough into the pan. Add the mozzarella to the dough, pressing it into the corners and flattening it out evenly. Follow with the pepperoni, red onions, green peppers and mushrooms. Finally, sprinkle with pieces of sausage no larger than a nickel. Spoon sauce onto the toppings, smoothing over until it is about 1/2-inch from the edge of the dough. Finish the pizza with an even sprinkling of Parmesan, and pop it onto the center rack of oven. Start checking the pizza after 15 minutes. Bake until the dough is nicely browned and the cheese is toasty at the edges, 15 to 30 minutes. Allow the pizza to cool slightly, then transfer to a plate or pan. Wait a few more minutes before cutting into 8 wedges. Serve with more grated cheese and crushed red pepper flakes. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water and allow to proof for about 10 minutes. Mix together the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture to the flour and stir until ingredients are roughly combined. Add the oil and mix together. If you&#39;re using a stand mixer, mix about 4 minutes until the dough ball starts to become smooth, adding a little flour if it isn&#39;t pulling away from the sides. If you&#39;re kneading by hand, turn the dough out onto a cutting board and knead until fairly smooth, adding flour if dough is overly sticky. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a large bowl greased with a small amount of oil. Sprinkle the top with some flour and then cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise slowly in the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours, or allow it to rise in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours. The cold-rise method yields a better product with a finer texture and flavor, but sometimes you just want to eat a pizza!

Toss the peaches with the brown sugar and lemon juice and set aside. Place the flour and confectioners&#39; sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Turn to low speed and add the butter a few pats at a time. Once all the butter has been added, beat until the flour, sugar and butter begin to form a dough and it holds its shape when pressed together with your fingers. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and gently knead and bring together to form a ball. Pat the dough into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Place into the fridge to chill for 30 minutes. Spray eight 4-inch tart pans with nonstick cooking spray. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and flatten into a disc. Press the dough into each tart shell, using your fingers to press the dough up the sides of the tart shell. Trim any excess dough that overhangs from the top. Dock the dough with a fork. Place the tart shells into the fridge to chill for 5 minutes. Line the inside of the tart shells with parchment paper and fill with baking beans. Transfer the shells into the oven and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and baking beans, then put back into the oven for another 5 minutes. Allow to cool before filling. For the pastry cream: Add the egg yolks, granulated sugar and cornstarch to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-high until the yolks are pale yellow and peaks begin to form, a few minutes. Scrape down the edges of the bowl with a spatula and beat again to ensure the ingredients are fully incorporated. Set up an ice bath in a large bowl and set aside. Add the coconut milk, kosher salt and vanilla beans with the pods to a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high and bring to a gentle boil. Remove from the heat and gradually, very little at a time, add the heated coconut milk into the whipped egg yolk mixture with the stand mixer turned down to low speed. It&#39;s important to add it very gradually to temper the eggs so they will not scramble. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan that the coconut milk was heated in and turn the heat to medium-low. Whisking constantly, cook until the pastry cream has thickened and reaches the consistency of pudding, about 5 minutes. Transfer the thickened pastry cream back into the stand mixer bowl and whisk on medium speed. Add the butter, one pat at a time. Beat for 1 to 2 minutes to cool it down. Spread the pastry cream onto a quarter sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap, pressing down onto the pastry cream itself to avoid a skin from forming on the top. Place into the fridge to chill for 25 to 30 minutes. Once the tart shells have cooled, place a tablespoon or so of pastry cream to cover the bottom. Then top with 1 1/2 tablespoons of macerated peach filling in each tart. Spoon some more pastry cream to cover the top of the tarts and spread with a spatula to flatten it down. For the caramel: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, add the brown sugar and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring for 2 to 3 minutes. Then remove from the heat and add the vanilla and sea salt (be careful it&#39;s hot!!). To finish the tarts, lay a peach slice on top of each tart. Garnish with a dollop of whipped cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20355,&quot;Mashed Sweet Potatoes 3 large sweet potatoes, scrubbed 1/4 to 1/2 cup lowfat chicken broth Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Hang dry and rest for at least 2 hours. Hang duck in smoking oven with hook on the upper neck. Place the camphor wood, brown sugar, tea twigs, if available, on a pan at the base of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees F. Some recipes call for tea leaves but tea leaves in the sugar/camphor mixture does not add that much tea flavor to the ducks. Roast the duck for approximately 40 minutes, but depends on size of duck, type of oven, etc. For best results for a crispy skin, the last 5 to 10 minutes should be at 400 degrees F, with a final basting of sesame/vegetable oil on the skin of the duck. Duck can be flashed in hot oil to finish, if timing for service is critical.

Turn the blender on and stream in the olive oil. Puree the mixture until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning. If the consistency is too thick, add water or more vinegar if you like, to adjust the thickness. Place the gazpacho into the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours to allow flavors to marry with one another. Serve the gazpacho in glasses, like they do in Spain, or you can serve it in bowls if you prefer. Cook&#39;s Notes: To make your gazpacho spicier, add some of the ribs and seeds from the jalapeno. You can adjust the oil and vinegar in this recipe to make it tangier if you like!

Add the celery, onion, carrots, leek and thyme. Cook for about 30 minutes, until very soft and brown. Stir occasionally and keep the heat low to prevent the vegetables from burning. Add the bay leaves, peppercorns, and stock, increase the heat and bring the liquid to a boil. Immediately reduce the heat to very low and simmer, covered for 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the stock into a clean pan, pressing down on the solids to extract all their flavor. Discard the solids. Add the large bunch of thyme to the broth and simmer actively for 15 minutes. Strain again and add the roasted garlic cloves, cream, salt and pepper. Taste for seasoning and serve in heated cream soup bowls. Sprinkle the toasted croutes with a little Parmesan. Top each bowl with a toasted croute and a sprig of thyme. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. With a sharp knife, slice off the very top of the garlic, just to expose most of the cloves (this will make them easier to squeeze out after cooking). Make a doubled layer of aluminum foil about 6 by 6 inches square. Place the garlic in the center and bring up the sides a little to form a cup. Drizzle over the olive oil and add the oregano, salt and pepper. Bring the sides all the way up and twist together to make a firm seal. Place in the oven and roast for 20 to 25 minutes. Open the top so the garlic will stop cooking and set aside until cool enough to handle. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and discard the skins. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20396,&quot;Strawberry Cream Milkshake 1 cup vanilla ice cream 1/2 cup all-natural strawberry jam 1 ounce cream cheese 1 shot raspberry liqueur 2 tablespoons milk Whipped cream, crushed graham crackers and/or sliced strawberries, for garnish Instructions: Blend the ice cream, jam, cream cheese, liqueur, milk and 3 ice cubes in a blender on medium speed until thick and smooth.

Add 2 teaspoons salt and the nutmeg and reduce the heat to the medium. Add the polenta gradually, whisking constantly. Continue to whisk for 5 minutes as the mixture bubbles. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to come away from the sides of the pan, about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon thyme and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and stir to combine thoroughly. Invert a rimmed baking sheet on a countertop and cover the surface with parchment paper. Spread the polenta out with a spatula into a smooth, even layer. Cover the polenta with another sheet of parchment paper. Place another baking sheet, right side up, on top of the parchment. With 2 hands, press down evenly on the top baking sheet until the polenta is 1/4 inch thick. The idea is to sandwich the polenta between 2 flat surfaces. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Invert the baking sheets together. Remove the top baking sheet and the top layer of parchment paper. The smoother side of the polenta will be facing up. Cut the polenta into triangle about 2 inches long by 1 1/2 inches wide. Transfer the triangles to 1 or more baking sheets, spacing them 1/2-inch apart. Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of the remaining Parmesan cheese and the remaining thyme on top of triangles.

Add the boiling water and mix it in with a spatula, then incorporate with your hands until you have a mealy, shaggy mixture. Mix in the cold water and bring everything together into a dough, then turn it out onto a work surface and knead, adding additional flour if it gets too sticky to work with, until you have a smooth and slightly sticky dough, 7 to 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel for 30 minutes while you make the filling. For the soup: Heat the chicken stock, then add the soy sauce and gelatin powder. Whisk to combine. Pour into a shallow dish and chill until set, around 1 hour. Break up the gelatin by fluffing with a fork. Set aside.<br> For the filling: Put the pork in a large bowl and sprinkle on the salt, then add the soy sauce, ginger, sambal oelek, sesame oil, rice vinegar and scallions. Mix everything together with your hands (don&#39;t overmix), then set up your dumpling folding station.<br> Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and dust with flour. To assemble the dumplings, divide the dough into 32 balls and keep them covered when you&#39;re not working with them. Roll them out into 3 1/2- to 4-inch circles, flouring the surface as needed. Place 1/2 tablespoon pork filling in the center of each circle and 1/2 tablespoon soup gelatin on top of the filling. Fold up the edges of the dumpling and pinch everything in the center. Repeat with the remaining dumpling wrappers and filling and place on the lined sheet pan. To steam the dumplings, line a bamboo steamer with cabbage leaves or parchment paper with a few holes cut out. Place the dumplings in the steamer, leaving a little bit of room between them, then set the steamer over a pot of boiling water. Steam in batches until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Alternately, line a plate with cabbage leaves or parchment paper. Place in a pot of boiling water, making sure the water doesn&#39;t cover the plate (you will need about 1/2 to 3/4 cup). Cook 8 to 10 minutes.

Put it in a pastry bag and reserve until ready to use.<br> To roll the pasta:<br> Set the pasta roller on the widest setting. Start with half the pasta dough. Using your hands flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller dusting it twice with flour in between rolls if it feels sticky. Fold it into thirds, turn it 90 degrees and run it through the pasta machine 2 to 3 times. Continue to run the pasta through the machine reducing the setting in between each run, stop when you get to the second to last setting. Always hold the pasta on the tops of your hands-palms down! If you hold it with fingers up you will create stretch marks - and those are never good.<br> To assemble the ravioli:<br> Brush the lower half of the pasta (the part that is closest to you) lightly with water. This is the \glue\ that will hold the ravioli together. Use the water sparingly, if you use too much it will slide and not stick. Pipe 1 inch balls of filling onto the pasta that has been brushed with water, leaving about 2 inches in between each filling ball. Fold the top half of the pasta over the pasta balls to meet the bottom edge. Using your two index fingers poke around each filling ball to seal the ravioli shut, make sure there are no air bubbles. Using a fluted round cutter cut out each ravioli. Transfer to a sheet tray coated with semolina or polenta. Reserve until ready to use.<br> To make the sauce:<br> Coat a large saute pan with extra virgin olive oil. Add the pancetta and garlic and bring to medium high heat. When the garlic is light brown and aromatic remove it from the pan and discard it. When the pancetta is crispy add the mushrooms, season with salt and saute until they are soft and wilted. Add the chicken stock, season with salt and cook until it has reduced by half. Add the butter, shake the pan frequently and cook until the saute thickens and looks velvety. Taste for seasoning and add salt if needed.<br> Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. Add the ravioli and cook for 3-4 minutes. Carefully remove the ravioli from the water and immediately put in the saute pan with the sauce. Bring to a boil shaking the pan frequently. Reserve about two tablespoons of grated parmigiano and sprinkle the rest into the sauce, stirring to combine.<br> Plate the ravioli, sprinkle with a little more grated parm and the chopped chives.<br> Mangia bene!! To make the pasta dough: In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook*, combine the flour and salt. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix. Drizzle in 1 tablespoons of the olive oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. *Alternatively if you don&#39;t have an electric mixer: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Continue as directed above. Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it.). Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed. Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue. Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tins of a fork to make a tight seal. Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest. Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they&#39;ll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Bath the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gaja Barbaresco]&quot; 20405,&quot;Root Beer Float 2 large scoops vanilla ice cream 1 bottle very cold root beer<br> Instructions: Run a glass mug under cold water and immediately chill in the freezer until it forms a frost.

Place over a saucepan of boiling water and whisk continuously until the mixture is opaque and ribbony and sugar is completely dissolved, about 10 minutes. (Feel some between your fingers; if it feels smooth without granules, you\u2019re good. You can also test readiness by the temperature. The mixture should be around 140 degrees F.) Attach the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip the egg white mixture until the bowl has cooled off and the whites are stiff glossy peaks, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the powdered sugar and cider vinegar and combine thoroughly. Preheat the oven to 210 degrees F and prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. Plop the egg white mixture onto the center of the prepared baking sheet and spread into a 9-inch circle with a well-defined cavity for filling. Bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, then turn off the oven and allow to sit in there for another 2 hours. Remove the meringue from the oven and reserve at room temperature in a dry place. Place the meringue on a serving dish. Fill the cavity with the Curd, then top with the sliced apple, grapes, pomegranate seeds and candied nuts. Combine the orange juice, pomegranate juice, powdered sugar, eggs, egg yolks and salt in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat and whisk continuously (not too vigorously, though, just gently) until mixture has thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the stove and add the butter, a chunk at a time, whisking until it is fully melted and combined. Add food the coloring and stir it in. Transfer the curd to a dish or container, leaving behind any curdled bits that may have formed on the bottom of the saucepan. Cover the surface of the curd with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20415,&quot;Swedish Cole-Slaw with Fennel 1 whole fennel 1 carrot 1 clove of garlic 2 tablespoons dried cranberries 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Finely slice the fennel.

Wash the jars and lids in hot soapy water; rinse well. Place a wire rack or empty tuna cans in the pot to keep the jars from touching the bottom. Fill the pot halfway with water and bring to a simmer (do not boil). Submerge the jars in the water and let simmer until you&#39;re ready to fill. Sterilize the lids in a separate small pot of simmering water. Make the brine. Combine the chiles, bay leaves, coriander and cumin seeds, cinnamon sticks, cloves, mace, peppercorns, garlic, vinegar, honey, salt and 1 cup water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil; cook for 3 minutes. Cool slightly. Remove the chiles and bay leaves with a slotted spoon Pack the tomatoes. Slice the tomatoes into wedges using a sterilized knife and cutting board. Remove the jars and lids from the simmering water with a jar lifter or tongs; fill with the tomatoes and some chiles and bay leaves Fill and close. Pour the warm pickling liquid over the tomatoes in each jar, stopping 1/2 inch from the top. Slide a clean rubber spatula around the inside of each jar to remove air bubbles. Wipe the rims with a clean towel, then position the sterilized lids on top. Screw the lids shut, being careful not to overtighten. Boil the jars. Return the pot of water to a simmer; add the jars, making sure water covers them by a few inches. Cover and boil for 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, uncover and leave them in the water for 10 minutes Remove and let cool. Transfer the jars to a kitchen towel. Let sit, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. A vacuum seal will form as the jars cool Label your pickles. Write the date on each jar and store for up to 1 year at room temperature; refrigerate after opening. The tomatoes will be at their prime about 3 months after canning. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 20417,&quot;Chopped Caprese Salad 2 pounds grape tomatoes, halved 2 romaine hearts, quartered lengthwise and chopped<br> 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves<br> 1/4 cup Kalamata olives, chopped<br> 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cubed<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br> Salt and pepper Instructions: Add the tomatoes, romaine, basil, olives, mozzarella, olive oil and garlic to a large salad bowl.

Put the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse until fine crumbs, about 2 1/2 cups. Brush a 10-inch spring form pan with some of the butter. Add the graham cracker crumbs the remaining butter, 1/4 cup of the sugar and a pinch of salt to a medium bowl and stir to combine. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of the pan. Use the back of a measuring cup or drinking glass to pack the crust firmly and evenly in to the edges of the pan. Bake until the crust is lightly crisp and set, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely, then set the pan on top of a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap the foil around the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Place the springform in a roasting pan. For the filling: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Whip the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until smooth. Add the remaining sugar and beat until just light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle attachment as needed, about 2 minutes. Add the sweet potato puree, sour cream, eggs, vanilla, ground cinnamon and salt and beat until just combined. Scrape the filling into the cooled crust. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan so that it goes half-way up the sides of the springform pan, being careful not to get any of the water in the springform pan. Bake until the edges of the cheesecake are set but the center still jiggles when the pan is tapped, about 2 hours. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for 1 minute to let out some heat. Close the oven door and leave the cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour more. Carefully remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan, remove the foil and cool on a wire rack. Run a thin knife or spatula around the edges of the cake to release it from the sides, (this also helps reduce cracks in the top of the cake as it chills). Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate the cheesecake 8 hours or overnight. For the s&#39;more topping: Once the cheesecake has chilled completely, put the semi-sweet chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just comes to a simmer, about 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips and let stand for 1 minute, then stir the cream and chocolate together until completely smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the broiler to high. Pile the miniature marshmallows on top of the cheesecake in as even of a layer as possible (it&#39;s okay if some marshmallows overlap). Place the cheesecake on a baking sheet, then broil until the tops of the marshmallows are lightly golden brown, about 1 minute. Keep the oven door slightly open and rotate the pan as needed to get even browning. Run a thin knife or spatula between the cake and the pan to release it from the sides. Unlock the pan and remove the ring. Spray both sides of a sharp knife with non-stick cooking spray and slice the cake into 10 even slices, spraying the knife between each slice to keep the gooey marshmallows from sticking to the knife. Drizzle each piece of cheesecake with the cooled chocolate sauce and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20419,&quot;Shredded Chicken and Tomatillo Tacos with Queso Fresco 6 tomatillos, husked, washed, and grilled until blackened 1 serrano, grilled until blackened Olive oil 1/2 small red onion, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1 lime, juiced 2 tablespoons honey 1 1/2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken 8 blue corn tortillas 1 cup crumbled queso fresco Instructions: Preheat the grill to medium.

In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, combine 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar and the butter and mix until light and fluffy. Add the peppermint extract and mix to combine. Next, slowly add the flour and salt, mixing until just combined. In a separate mixing bowl, combine remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar and the peppermint candies. Roll the dough into twenty-four 1 1/2-inch balls. Insert 1 chocolate morsel into each ball and re-roll to ensure that the cookie dough encases the chocolate. Next, transfer to the bowl with the powdered sugar and crushed candies rolling each to coat. Place the balls on an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them about 1-inch apart. Bake until they start to turn golden brown on the bottom, about 20 minutes. Remove and transfer to wire cooling rack. Cool until they are just cool enough to handle, 5 minutes. Return the cookies to the bowl with the powdered sugar and crushed candies and toss gently until each cookie is coated.

Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners and spray the liners with nonstick cooking spray. For the cake: Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the almond milk, brown sugar, oil and vanilla in another medium bowl. Add the almond milk mixture to the flour mixture and gently fold until just combined (it&#39;s OK if there are lumps). Divide the batter evenly among the prepared liners. Bake the cupcakes until they are golden brown and bounce back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Beat the margarine on medium-high in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer) until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, almond milk and vanilla and beat on low until the frosting comes together and is smooth, about 1 minute.

Toss the onion slices with the olive oil and broil them until charred, about 8 minutes on each side. Put the onions and all the remaining ingredients in a deep heavy nonreactive pot. Simmer uncovered over low heat for about 3 hours, stirring every 15 minutes to break up the tomatoes and to keep the ketchup from sticking to the bottom of the pot. The mixture will thicken. Puree the ketchup in batches in a food processor or blender. If the puree seems too thin, return it to the pot and simmer until it is as thick as you like it. This ketchup keeps well refrigerated for up to 4 weeks. Heat a skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the cumin seeds and toss occasionally until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate to cool, and repeat with the coriander seeds and then the mustard seeds. Be careful that the spices don&#39;t burn. You&#39;ll know that they&#39;re done when a toasty, nutty aroma rises out of the pan. When the seeds are cool, coarsely grind them together in a spice grinder or in a mortar with pestle. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 20424,&quot;Cake Petit Fours 1 store-bought pound cake 1 small jar seedless strawberry jam 1 pint strawberries, sliced 1 (1-pound) container vanilla frosting Red, green, and brown food coloring 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup milk Ice cream (any flavor you desire), frozen hard Instructions: Slice cake into 1/4-inch thick slices. Spread jam on the cake slices and then top with sliced strawberries. Cut cake slices into 1-inch circles and stars and set aside. Separate the frosting into 3 bowls and add food coloring to reach desired colors (1 to 2 drops of red to make pink, 1 to 2 drops of green to make seafoam and 1 to 2 drops of brown to make cream).

Mix lightly with your fingers until the dough forms pea-sized pieces. Stir in iced water and lightly knead until dough forms a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours or overnight. To make filling: Heat olive oil in a frying pan and add diced onion, salt and pepper. Cook over moderate heat until onions are soft and begin to turn lightly golden. Add chard stems and cook a minute or two then add the chard leaves and cook until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Mix cooled cooked chard with grated cheeses and taste, adjust seasoning.: To assemble empanadas: On a lightly floured board, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness and cut 6 circles about 5 inches each or 12 smaller circles. Place filling onto half of circle of dough leaving a border and wet the edges of the dough with the egg wash, then fold the dough over to enclose the filling. Seal the edges by pressing the top to the bottom with the tines of a fork. Chill at least 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place empanadas on a baking sheet and brush tops with egg wash and sprinkle with freshly cracked pepper. With a sharp knife, cut small slits in the top of each empanada to allow steam to escape. Bake 30 minutes or until dough is golden. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 20434,&quot;Ravioli Dough 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 4 eggs 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 yolk, for egg wash Instructions: In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine flour and salt. Add eggs 1 at a time and continue to mix. Drizzle in oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead the dough until elastic and smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with flour. Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through the pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at its widest setting. Guide the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. *Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue until the machine is at its narrowest setting. The dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick. Dust the counter and dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta. Brush the top surface of dough with egg wash. Drop 1 tablespoon of cooled filling about 2-inches apart on half the sheet of pasta. Fold the unfilled half over the filling. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling and form a seal. Use a crimper to cut each pillow into squares. Check to make sure the crimped edges are well sealed before cooking. If making ravioli in advance, dust with cornmeal to prevent them from sticking. Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 10 to15 minutes. Ravioli will float to the top when cooked so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Plate the pasta, top with sauce and grated cheese before serving. Garnish plate with chopped herbs and toasted pine nuts. *For Herb-Patterned Pasta: Follow the standard recipe given above and roll it out to a medium-thick sheet. Next, take well-washed leafy herbs such as, basil, flat-leaf parsley and tarragon, pinch away the stems so only the leaves remain. Hand press the fresh herbs on the dough&#39;s surface at 1-inch intervals. Fold the dough over itself and run the \sandwich\ through the pasta machine at a thin setting. The leaves will stretch and pattern the pasta. Continue making ravioli as indicated in the procedure. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 20435,&quot;Fried Rice 4 ounces firm tofu 2 teaspoons sesame oil 1 pint cold cooked rice, preferably takeout 4 ounces shelled edamame, thawed if frozen 2 scallions, sliced 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons cl paste, such as sambal oelek 1 cup fresh basil leaves, shredded Instructions: Cut the tofu into 1/2-inch slices and wrap in three layers of paper towels. Then, sandwich the bundle between two plates, set a 28-ounce can of tomatoes on top and leave at room temperature for 30 minutes. Unwrap and cube. Heat the wok as hot as you can get it. If you turn off the lights, the bottom should glow\u2026I am not kidding. When the wok is very hot, add the sesame oil (there will be smoke) and swirl to coat the pan. Immediately add the cold rice, edamame and scallions and fry, moving constantly, for 2 minutes, or until the scallions wilt. Add the soy sauce, cl paste and basil and fry for 1 minute more. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 20436,&quot;Creamed Spinach 4 large bunches spinach, leaves only, well washed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups hot milk 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 medium onions, finely diced 1/2 cup grated anejo cheese Instructions: Heat a very large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add all the spinach with the water still clinging to its leaves, even if you have to firmly pack it in. Cover the pan tightly (weight the lid down, if necessary). Leave the spinach to cook for about 2 minutes, then turn it over so that the wilted leaves are on the top. Cover and repeat the process 2 or 3 times more, until all the spinach is nicely wilted. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Squeeze the spinach dry with your hands a little at a time, squeezing as much liquid as possible from the leaves. Chop the spinach leaves coarsely and set aside. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon, to make a loose paste. Cook for about 2 minutes, until foamy, but do not let it brown. Remove from the heat. As soon as the paste has stopped foaming, whisk in the hot milk all at once and continue whisking until thoroughly blended. Return to the heat and stir slowly, reaching into all the corners of the pan, until the sauce comes to a simmer. Simmer for about 2 minutes, still stirring, until the sauce has thickened, then add the cream, salt, and pepper, and stir for 1 minute more. Remove the pan from the heat and stir it every minute or two while you finish the dish to prevent a skin from forming. In the same skillet where the spinach was cooked, well dried, heat the olive oil over mediumlow heat. Add the onion and saute, stirring occasionally, for 7 to 8 minutes or until translucent. Add the cooked spinach and the white sauce to the pan and stir together over medium heat until well mixed and heated through. Finally, stir in the cheese, taste for seasoning, and transfer to a heated and covered serving dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 20437,&quot;Fluffy Boiled Icing 1 1/2 cups sugar 2/3 cup water 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 3 egg whites Pinch salt 1 teaspoon vanilla Instructions: In a heavy saucepan combine sugar, water and cream of tartar. Slowly bring mixture to a boil, stirring sides of the saucepan with a brush dipped in water to remove any sugar crystals. Cover and boil for about 3 minutes or until a candy thermometer registers 245 degrees. Beat egg whites with pinch of salt until glossy and peaked. Slowly pour in syrup as you continue to beat the whites. Beat until cool and frosting is soft and fluffy.

Put the flour in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook. Whisk together the eggs, and then add the milk, vanilla extract, vanilla seeds and honey in a large bowl. Add the mixture to the flour and mix for 1 minute. Add the yeast and continue to mix until the dough becomes smooth, about 5 minutes. Begin adding the butter, at low speed, piece by piece and continue mixing until it&#39;s incorporated into the dough. Add the salt, increase the speed to high and continue mixing until the dough becomes a shiny solid mass and totally pulls away from the bottom and sides of the bowl, 10 to 15 minutes. The dough needs to be very elastic, you shouldn&#39;t be able to break the dough when pulled. Add the sugar and mix until it is just incorporated, about 1 minute. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 48 even pieces, roll into balls, place on the parchment, cover with clean cotton towels and let rise in a warm area until almost tripled in size, anywhere from 1 1/2 to 3 hours. Heat the waffle iron to 400 degrees F. Lightly spray the waffle iron with nonstick spray or brush with melted butter. Cook the waffles until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 20439,&quot;Garlicky Green Beans 1 pound frozen green beans 1 tablespoon water 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 6 cloves peeled garlic, thinly sliced 4 strips pre-cooked bacon Salt and pepper Instructions: In a microwave safe bowl, add green beans and 1 tablespoon water.

If I make lots of these before Christmas, I freeze them raw and then cook them on the day. Cooked mince pies can be stored in a biscuit tin or airtight box and warmed through gently before serving. They are perfect with a glass of spicy mulled wine or a cup of coffee for a festive snack. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C/Gas mark 6. Brush the tin with melted butter.<br> On a floured work surface, roll out the pastry to 1/8-inch/3 mm thick and, using the 2 1/2-inches/6 cm cutter, cut out 24 circles for the bases. Then use the smaller plain/fluted cutter or star cutter to cut-out 24 circles/stars for the lids. Re-roll the trimmings, if necessary.<br> Line the holes of the cake tin with the larger pastry rounds. Fill each base with a teaspoon mincemeat and top with one of the smaller rounds or stars. Brush the tops of the mince pies with the beaten egg.<br> Bake in the oven for 10 to 13 minutes until pale golden. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from the tin and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Dust with icing sugar (confectioners&#39;) to serve. This basic pastry is used in many popular recipes, from mince pies to quiches; it&#39;s also one of the easiest pastries to start with. The uncooked dough can be frozen or kept in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Shortcrust Pastry:<br> Put the flour, salt and butter in a food processor and whiz briefly. Add half the beaten egg and continue to whiz. You might add a little more egg, but not too much as the mixture should be just moist enough to come together. If making by hand, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs then, using your hands, add just enough egg to bring it together. With your hands, flatten out the ball of dough until it is about 3/4-inch/2 cm thick, then wrap in cling film or place in a plastic bag and leave in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or, if you are pushed for time, in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes. Variations: Sweet Shortcrust Pastry: In place of the pinch of salt, use 1 tablespoon icing sugar (confectioners&#39;). Soured cream shortcrust pastry: Replace the egg with 2 tablespoons sour cream or creme fraiche, adding just enough to bring it together. This delicious mincemeat will keep happily in a cool dark place for at least a year. If you are making your own suet (the fat that surrounds the beef kidney), make sure that every trace of blood has been removed before you whiz it in the food processor, otherwise it will cause the mincemeat to go off. Mincemeat:<br> Put the apple chunks in a small saucepan with 1 teaspoon water, cover and cook over low heat for about 8 to 10 minutes until the apples are cooked down to a pulp. Allow to cool.<br> Mix the apples with the orange zest, orange juice, lemon zest, lemon juice, suet, raisins, sultanas, currants, candied peel, dark brown sugar, almonds, mixed spice, and whiskey in a large bowl and put into sterilized jars.* Leave to mature, if possible for at least 2 weeks before using. Cut the fruit in 1/2 and squeeze out the juice. (Reserve the juice for another use, perhaps home-made lemonade.) Put the peel into a large bowl, add the salt and cover with cold water. Leave to soak for 24 hours.<br> Next day, throw away the soaking water; put the peel in a large saucepan and cover with fresh cold water. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer very gently for about 3 hours or until the peel is soft.<br> Remove the peel from the pan and discard the water. Scrape out any remaining flesh and membrane from inside the cut fruit, using a teaspoon, leaving the white pith and rind intact.<br> In a clean large saucepan, dissolve the sugar in 1 3/4 pints/1 litre of water, then bring to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the peel and simmer gently for 30 to 60 minutes until it looks translucent (shiny and &#39;candied&#39;) and the syrup forms a thread when the last drop falls off a metal spoon. Remove from the heat and allow to stand for 20 to 30 minutes to slightly cool.<br> Put the candied peel into sterilized glass jars* and pour the syrup over. Cover and store in a cold place or in the refrigerator. It should keep, stored like this, for at least 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20444,&quot;Congril Habanero con Basmati Rice 4 slices bacon 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 large onion, small dice 1 can black beans or 1/2 pound dry black beans soaked overnight and cooked in water until tender 2 cups Basmati rice 2 cups water 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/2 tablespoon salt and pepper 1 large green bell pepper, small dice Instructions: In a large casserole pot or Dutch oven fry bacon until crisp, add the chopped garlic and onion. Next, add tender black beans and mix for a while, add 2 cups of rice that has been washed and drained, 2 cups water, olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add the green pepper and mix until all is well incorporated. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, cover the pot and cook until rice and beans are cooked, approximately 30 minutes. Fluff with a big fork when done. If using canned softened beans the water in the can is enough, but if you&#39;re using dry beans then add 1/2 cup water to mixture. It is important to have a ratio of 2 cups rice to 2 1/2 cups water. It is important to use the water the beans were boiled in or the water that came in the canned beans. This gives the Congri the black-gray color that is typical of this dish. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 20445,&quot;Muscovado Cocoa Chip Cookies 1 1/3 cups (6 ounces) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled 1/3 cup (1 ounce) unsweetened natural cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup (7 5/8 ounces) dark muscovado sugar 1 large egg, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/3 cup (2 ounces) chopped bittersweet chocolate (60- to 70-percent cacao) Instructions: Line a 12-by-17-inch baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Into a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy.

Reduce the speed to low and gradually stir in the flour mixture just until combined (avoid over-mixing or the cookies will be dry!). Stir in the chocolate.<br> Use a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon to portion the dough onto the prepared baking sheets- 12 cookies per sheet, evenly spaced (the cookies won&#39;t spread too much during baking). Freeze until the dough is solid, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, position a rack to the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Roll the dough balls in the remaining 1/3 cup sugar to coat completely.<br> Bake the cookies just until they are slightly puffed and the edges can be lifted off the parchment with a fingertip, but the cookies look somewhat underdone and soft towards the center, 10 minutes, being careful not to over-bake.

Set aside until they are 60 degrees, or slightly below room temperature.<br> Pour flour, 1/2 cup granulated sugar and salt into a triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper; set aside. Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 325 degrees. Set nearby a dry, un-greased 10inch tube pan. Such a pan allows the batter to cling to the sides and rise to its full height. Place a long-necked bottle or large metal funnel nearby for inverting the baked cake.<br> Whip egg whites, preferably with a whisk attachment until frothy. Add cream of tartar and whip on medium speed until soft peaks form. Continue whipping and gradually add the 1 cup granulated sugar until whites have thickened and form soft droopy white peaks. Add the vanilla and lemon zest in the final moments of whipping.<br> Sprinkle one-quarter of the flour mixture over the whites, and with a rubber spatula, fold into the whites. Repeat this process with the remaining flour mixture, folding in only one-quarter of the flour mixture at a time. Gently pour the batter into an un-greased tube pan. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the top is light golden, the cake feels spongy and springs back when touched, and a wooden toothpick inserted in the middle comes out free of cake. Invert cake onto the neck of a bottle or funnel. Cool completely before removing from pan.<br> To remove cake from the pan, slip just the tip of a small metal spatula between the cake and pan. Slowly trace the perimeter to release any cake sticking to the pan. Tilt the cake pan on its side, and gently tap the bottom against the counter to loosen the cake. Rotate the cake pan, tapping as you turn it a few more times, until it appears free. Cover the cake with a rack or cardboard round, and at the same time that you invert the cake onto the work surface, tap it firmly onto the surface. Lift the pan from the cake. For the filling: In a 1 1/2 quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk briefly to combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Add the pieces of butter, and place the saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly over the entire bottom. Cook the mixture without boiling until it begins to develop body and thicken. Remove from heat and pour through a stainless steel sieve into a bowl. Cover the surface with plastic wrap, poke a few small slits in the plastic with the tip of a paring blade allowing steam to escape while cooling. Refrigerate (curd will thicken). For the frosting: In a 3-cup saucepan, combine the water and 2/3 cup sugar. Place over low heat to dissolve the sugar, then increase the heat to medium high and boil, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 235 degrees. (Wash down any sugar crystals slinging to the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water.) Near the end of the boiling time, whip the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add the 2 tablespoons sugar, and continue to whip until the whites are stiff but not dry. With the mixer running, pour the syrup onto the whipped whites. Continue to whip on medium speed, about 3 minutes more. Mixture will thicken, cool and form glossy, stiff peaks. Add the vanilla. Cool to room temperature, about 8 to 10 minutes, then frost cake right away.<br> Assembling the dessert: Cut cake into three layers. Spread the lemon filling equally between the two layers; top with remaining layer. Frost top and sides of cake with Italian Meringue Frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20477,&quot;Chifrijo 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1 jalapeno, minced, optional 1 medium white onion, chopped 1 large tomato, chopped Juice of 5 limes or lemons 1/2 teaspoon salt 4 cups vegetable oil One 1-pound slab whole pork belly with skin or one 1-pound slab of unsalted, uncured raw whole bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces 8 to 10 cloves garlic, crushed 2 tablespoons salt 8 ounces black beans, washed and rinsed 2 whole cloves garlic plus 1 clove, minced 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped 1 tablespoon Salsa Lizano 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon cooking oil 1 clove garlic, minced 1/4 cup finely chopped yellow onion 1 cup uncooked white rice, medium or long-grain 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 Hass avocado, quartered, optional Tortilla chips, optional Instructions: For the pico de gallo: Combine the cilantro, jalapeno, if using, onion and tomato in a large mixing bowl. Add the lime juice (there should be enough juice to fill the bowl almost all the way up the mixture). Season with the salt. Mix well, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.<br> For the chicharron: Heat 1 cup of the oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Allow the oil to become very hot. Once the oil is hot, add the pork (you should be able to hear the sizzling fry song). Cook the pork, stirring as often as possible, 20 minutes. Add the garlic and salt and continue to stir until the pork has a lovely golden brown color, 20 to 40 minutes longer.<br> Remove the pork from the heat and allow to fully cool, 1 to 2 hours. Dice the pork into small pieces. Add the remaining 3 cups oil to a medium pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is completely hot, flash-fry the diced pieces of chicharron until they have a deep, rich brown color and a crunchy texture. Set aside until ready to build the chifrijo. (The pork can be cooked a day ahead and refrigerated until ready to fry and use.)<br> For the black beans: Combine 5 cups water, black beans and the 2 whole garlic cloves in a medium pot. Bring the contents to a boil. Combine the oil, minced garlic and yellow onion in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Cook until the onions are a golden color, stirring occasionally, 5 to 8 minutes.<br> Remove the pot from the heat and add the sauteed onions and garlic, Salsa Lizano, cumin, pepper and salt. Return the pot to the heat and reduce from a boil to a simmer. Give one more stir, cover with a lid and allow the beans to cook until tender, 35 to 45 minutes.<br> For the rice: Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and onions, and saute until the onions are translucent. Add the rice, 1 1/2 cups water and salt. Bring the rice up to a boil and then reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy, 25 to 35 minutes.<br> Now that all components have been prepared it&#39;s now time to build the chifrijo. In each small soup bowl, add a spoonful of the black bean liquid, 3 heaping tablespoons of the rice, 4 tablespoons of the black beans and 4 tablespoons of the chicharron. Top the chicharron with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pico de gallo and a quarter of the avocado, if using. Generously drizzle with some extra Salsa Lizano and serve with tortilla chips on the side, if using. Chifrijo is best served with tortilla chips and an ice cold beverage.

Remove the core and slice the head of lettuce in half from top to bottom. Cut each half into 3 wedges. Arrange 6 wedges on a platter. Top each wedge with sliced radishes and halved cherry tomatoes. Drizzle about 1/2 cup of dressing all over the lettuce and veggies. Top with the blue cheese and chives. Place baked onion rings on top. Serve with extra dressing on the side. Add the mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, garlic powder, chives, dill, parsley, onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to a high-powered blender and blend until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Transfer the dressing to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve. Dressing can be kept in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice the onion into 1-inch-thick rings. Separate the rings and save the small inner rings for another use. Add the large rings to a bowl and cover with the water. Let the onions sit while you prepare the dredging stations. Add the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a medium shallow bowl and whisk to combine. Add the panko, garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to a second shallow bowl and whisk to combine. Add the egg whites to a third shallow bowl and whisk vigorously until they are frothy and foamy, but not holding peaks. Remove each onion ring from the water, shaking off any excess, and place immediately into the flour mixture, making sure to toss until it\u2019s fully coated. Next, dip the onion ring into the egg white mixture, flipping to coat thoroughly. Shake off any excess egg white and transfer the onion ring to the panko mixture, gently pressing in the breadcrumbs to adhere. Place the onion ring on the prepared baking sheet and continue the process with the rest of your onion rings. Generously spray the onion rings with non-stick cooking spray. Flip the onion rings and generously spray the other side. Bake until golden brown and crisp, flipping halfway through, about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 20479,&quot;Raspberry and Chocolate Hi-Hat Cupcakes 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup milk<br> 1/2 cup cocoa powder<br> 1 cup sugar 3/4 cup vegetable oil 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg<br> 20 cake ice cream cones One 1.3-ounce bag freeze-dried raspberries 1 1/3 cups sugar 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch of fine salt 8 large egg whites 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 2 tablespoons coconut oil Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.<br> Heat the milk in a saucepan until hot but not boiling. Pour over the cocoa powder in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk the sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla and egg into the cocoa mixture. Whisk in the dry ingredients until smooth.<br> Place the cones upright so they fit snugly in 2 large loaf pans. Divide the batter evenly among the cones, filling them about halfway. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean and the tops spring back when pressed lightly, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely. For the frosting: Put the freeze-dried raspberries in a blender or food processor and grind to a fine dust; set aside.<br> Combine the sugar, cream of tartar, salt and egg whites in a large metal bowl and whisk until smooth. Place over a pan of simmering water (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water) and heat, stirring, until the mixture is warm and the sugar is dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the frosting is cool and forms stiff, glossy peaks, 4 to 6 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Transfer one-third of the frosting to a large piping bag fitted with a 3/4-inch plain tip. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the raspberry powder to the remaining frosting and then put half of that into the piping bag on top of the white frosting. Stir in 2 more tablespoons raspberry powder into the remaining frosting and put into the piping bag.<br> Start by piping a spiral of white frosting onto each cupcake. Once you get to the pinker frosting, pipe a second spiral on each cupcake. When you get to the darker pink frosting, pipe a third spiral on each cupcake, ending with a bit of a peak of the dark frosting on top (The frosting on each cupcake should go from white on the bottom to dark pink on the top and look a bit like soft-serve ice cream.) Refrigerate until the frosting is well chilled, about 1 hour.<br> For the chocolate dip: Meanwhile, combine the chocolate and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until just melted, about 2 minutes. Transfer to medium narrow container (such as a pint-size deli container). Dip the frosting of each cupcake into the melted chocolate, leaving a little of the white frosting visible. Let the excess drip back off, then turn the cone right-side up and let the chocolate set until dry, about 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 20480,&quot;Ginger Pom 1 part pomegranate liqueur 2 parts pomegranate juice 2 parts ginger ale Instructions: What can I say?

Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment. Add the sugar and yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the butter, salt, 1/2 cup milk and half of the flour to the bowl. Mix on medium-high speed just to incorporate. Add the egg and mix until fully incorporated. Add the remaining 1/4 cup milk and remaining flour. Knead with the hook on medium-high speed until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the sides, about 5 minutes (the dough will still be sticky).<br> Lightly spray a large bowl with cooking spray, scrape the dough into the bowl and turn to coat it with the spray. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a slightly warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.<br> Line a baking sheet with parchment and lightly coat with cooking spray. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces with a bench scraper or chef\u2019s knife. Roll each piece of dough into a ball and arrange on the prepared baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between each. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let stand again until puffy and doubled in size, about 45 minutes.<br> Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. For the egg wash: Lightly whisk the milk and egg in a small bowl. Brush the rounds with the egg wash. Bake, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until golden brown, about 24 minutes. Transfer the breads to a rack to cool completely. Reserve the baking sheet with parchment, as it will be used again. Leave the oven on. Once cooled, use a sharp serrated knife to cut each bread into 6 equal wedges partly through, leaving at least 1/4 inch intact on the bottom of each.<br> For the cream cheese filling: Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, scraping down the sides as necessary, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar, gradually increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until the sugar is incorporated and the filling is creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes.<br> Transfer the filling to a large piping bag. Pipe the filling in between the wedges of each bread, working from the outside to the center while holding and separating each wedge with your fingers. Be careful not to break the wedges. Save some filling for the end; set aside.<br> For the garlic butter custard: Whisk together the butter, heavy cream, garlic, parsley, sugar, honey, garlic powder, salt and eggs in a large bowl to combine.<br> Dip the breads one at a time in the garlic butter custard, cut-side down. Separate the wedges while holding each bread down in the custard to coat the inside and outside of each wedge. With two hands, carefully flip each bread upside down and submerge entirely in the custard. Arrange the breads back on the reserved parchment-lined baking sheet. After all of them have been dipped completely in the custard, repeat once more to double dip. Make sure there&#39;s plenty of minced garlic and parsley on the breads. (There will be custard leftover at the end.)<br> Bake until deep golden brown, glossy and crispy on the outside, 13 to 15 minutes (the garlic will start smelling fragrant and the custard drippings will start crisping/browning around the edges). Let cool for 10 minutes, then pipe some of the remaining cream cheese filling in the center of each bread. (The breads will open up slightly as you pipe in the center.) Serve immediately.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20484,&quot;Fresh Cran-Apple Crostata 2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons superfine sugar 2 teaspoons salt 1 cup (1/2 pound or 2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon-size pieces 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 cup ice water, plus additional as needed 4 cups Granny Smith, Pippin, or your favorite apples, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch wedges 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/3 cup cranberry sauce 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, preferably gray salt 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon heavy cream, for egg wash 2 teaspoons coarse sugar Instructions: Make the tart dough: Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse to blend. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture forms coarse crumbs. Add vanilla and water to processor, then slowly add flour and cinnamon sugar. Pulse just until a dough forms, adding a little extra ice water if necessary. Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a 1-inch-thick round. Wrap 1 disk tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour; freeze the other for future use. Put a pizza stone or cookie sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F for 45 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before rolling to soften it slightly. Place the dough round between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll into a 13-inch round (about a 1/4-inch thickness), flouring the round lightly as needed to keep the dough from sticking. Remove the top sheet of parchment. Use the rim of a small round bowl to make 6 individual crostatas. Cut around the edge of the bowl, in the dough, with a sharp knife. Slide a pizza peel or rimless baking sheet under the bottom sheet of parchment, and remove excess dough from crostatas. To make the filling, combine the apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl and toss well. Add cranberry sauce and salt and toss again, briefly. Paint the edges of the crostatas with egg yolk wash. Fill the center of the dough rounds with the apples (about 1/2 cup each) in an even layer, leaving a border of about 1 1/2 inches. Fold the border up and over the apples to make a rim. Brush the rim with egg wash, then sprinkle with coarse sugar. Trim the excess parchment with scissors, and press sides together. Use the pizza peel or baking sheet to transfer the crostatas, still with parchment underneath, to the oven, sliding it, with the paper, directly onto the pizza stone. Bake until the crust is nicely browned and the apples are bubbling, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven with the peel or baking sheet and let cool on a rack for 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm. Note: This can be made hours ahead and reheated before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 20485,&quot;Fried Chicken with Black Pepper Gravy 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons baking powder<br> 1 tablespoon yellow mustard powder<br> 1 tablespoon Hungarian paprika<br> 2 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 2 cups low-fat buttermilk<br> 1/4 cup hot sauce<br> 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar<br> 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 8)<br> One 16-ounce container vegetable shortening<br> 1 quart neutral frying oil<br> 2 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper<br> 4 dashes hot sauce<br> Instructions: For the chicken: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, mustard powder, paprika, garlic and onion powders, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk together the buttermilk, hot sauce and vinegar in a second bowl. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Line a second baking sheet with a cooling rack. Place the chicken on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle both sides generously with salt and pepper. Working with one hand dedicated to the flour mixture and one hand dedicated to the buttermilk, dredge the chicken thoroughly in the flour mixture. Shake each piece individually to make sure it is fully coated and any excess flour is released. Place in the buttermilk mixture and toss gently to coat. Place the chicken back into the flour mixture to dredge again. Remove from the flour mixture and place on the parchment-lined baking sheet. (Reserve flour mixture.) Place a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetable shortening to the skillet and heat until melted. Once all the shortening has turned to liquid, add oil to the skillet until it comes up 1 inch from the rim. Attach a deep-frying thermometer to the skillet and preheat the oil to 350 degrees F. Carefully add half the chicken to the oil. This will cause the temperature to decrease, so adjust the heat to maintain 325 degrees F. Fry the chicken, flipping only once halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat, avoiding bone, registers 170 degrees F, 14 to 18 minutes. Remove the chicken to the cooling rack. Sprinkle with kosher salt and set aside; fry the remaining chicken. For the gravy: Transfer 1/4 cup of the frying oil to another cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the flour mixture used to dredge the chicken. Cook until a smooth paste is formed, 2 to 3 minutes. While whisking continuously, pour in the milk. Simmer until the sauce thickens and can easily coat the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and hot sauce. Pour the gravy over the fried chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]</p><p>&quot; 20486,&quot;Grilled Pineapple with Iced Coconut Cream 1/4 cup shredded coconut, lightly toasted 1 pint coconut pineapple ice cream 1 (11.5-ounce) can pineapple coconut nectar 1 teaspoon dark rum 1 can sliced pineapple Instructions: To toast coconut, place shredded coconut in a frying pan over medium heat.

Add the butter and shortening. Using a pastry cutter, gradually work the butter and shortening into the flour until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. This step should take 3 to 4 minutes. Lightly beat the egg with a fork, then add it to the crust mixture. Next, add the cold water and vinegar. Stir the mixture together until it?s just combined. Divide the dough in half and form into disks. Wrap in plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Make the filling: In a large bowl, toss the apples, cranberries, brown sugar, granulated sugar, flour, salt and lemon juice. Set aside and see how long you can keep from sneaking a slice of apple. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. With a rolling pin, begin rolling out the dough disks into 12-inch rounds on a lightly floured surface, rolling from the center outward. Be gentle and patient; it?ll take a little time to get the dough completely rolled out. If you think the bottom is really sticking to the surface below, use a nice sharp spatula to loosen the dough and sprinkle some extra flour on top. Then flip it over to finish rolling. Loosen the dough with a spatula, lift and carefully place each round on a prepared baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place half the apple-cranberry mixture on 1 dough round and the other half on the other round. Fold in the edges so that the dough covers 2 to 3 inches of the apple-cranberry mixture. No need to be artistic?the more rustic, the better. Freeze the pies 30 minutes. Dot the tops of the pies with the butter chunks. Brush the crust edges with the egg wash. Bake the pies until the filling is golden and bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes. If the crust appears to brown too quickly, cover the edges with foil for the remaining baking time. Let the pies cool slightly, then slice into wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 20491,&quot;Manhattan Jelly Shots 1/3 cup sugar 20 dashes bitters 12 brandied or maraschino cherries, plus 1 tablespoon cherry juice 2/3 cup seltzer water One 1/4-ounce package unflavored gelatin (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) 1/3 cup rye whisky 3 tablespoons sweet vermouth 2 teaspoons orange zest Instructions: Combine the sugar, bitters, cherry juice and 2/3 cup regular water in a medium microwave-safe bowl.

Place the gelatin in a bowl of cold water to bloom; set aside until ready to add to the mixture, about 20 minutes. Grill the cinnamon stick until it starts to unroll and has a nice flavor of smoke, a minute or two; this adds so much depth to the dish. In a mixing bowl set over a simmering double boiler, combine the cream, milk, granulated sugar, nutmeg, salt, pepper, bay leaves and cinnamon stick. Cook, until everything is starting to become warm, then add the pork blood. Bring the mixture to 145 degrees F; it will start to thicken at this point. Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl, then whisk in a thin stream of the hot milk mixture until it&#39;s loose, about the texture of cream. Remove from the heat and whisk the yolk mixture back into the bowl of hot milk and let cool to 140 degrees F. Meanwhile, set up an ice bath and set aside. Add the chocolate to a large metal bowl that will rest on top of the ice bath later. Strain the blood-milk mixture through a chinois or fine mesh sieve over the chocolate, discarding the cinnamon stick and bay leaves. Drain the gelatin, then squeeze it dry and add to the chocolate bowl. Blend the mixture with a stick blender until smooth and all the chocolate is dissolved. Immediately place the metal bowl on the ice bath and stir to cool down quickly. Cover the top with plastic wrap, pressing gently onto the surface of the pudding and gently smoothing it, then chill in the refrigerator until set, about 3 hours. Spoon a large scoop, or quenelle, of the pudding onto each plate. Top each plate with some Chichachurros and serve. Toast the fennel seeds in a dry pan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Remove to a bowl and let cool. Grind finely, then set aside. Sprinkle the pig skin liberally on both sides with the salt and granulated sugar, then lay it in a large saucepan with enough water to cover. In a cheesecloth sachet, wrap the bay leaves, vanilla beans and seeds and lemon being sure to tie it tightly, and place it in the pan. Add the white wine. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the skin is tender, about 2 hours. (Check its doneness by tearing the skin with your hands; it should have just the slightest bit of resistance.) Lay the skin out in a single layer on parchment-lined sheet trays to cool in the fridge until very firm, about 2 hours. Using a bench scraper, remove all the fat from the bottom of the skin. Score the skin, then cut into strips about as long and as thick as a pencil using a serrated pair of scissors or a pasta wheel with serrations. Dehydrate, either in a dehydrator or in the oven with just the pilot light on and the fan running, until dry and brittle, 24 to 36 hours. (At this point, the skin may be stored for weeks in an airtight container at room temperature, with a silica gel pack if available.) Stir together the confectioners&#39; sugar, cocoa powder and ground fennel in a bowl. Preheat a deep-fryer or a large pot with several inches of oil to 375 degrees F. Fry a few pieces of skin at a time, just until puffed. (Be sure not to let them get golden brown, as pure white is what you&#39;re aiming for.) Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels. To finish, dust with the confectioners&#39; sugar mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Grenache]&quot; 20514,&quot;Chocolate Chip Cheesecake with Chocolate Glaze Topping 2 (3 oz.) packages cream cheese, softened 1 (14 oz.) can Eagle Brand?

Beat in the eggs, the equivalent of one at a time, until fully incorporated. (Do not try to add them at once because they can&#39;t be incorporated quickly enough, it makes a total mess, and furthermore you may not need all of them.) After the third addition of egg, add only enough to make dough that will fall, glossy and heavy, from the spoon. Beat in the vanilla. Spoon the dough into a piping bag.<br> Mix a bit of milk into any remaining egg (if no egg left, use only milk). Have at the ready with a pastry brush for glazing. Pipe the dough into evenly-sized (about 1 inch/2.5 cm) balls on a nonstick baking sheet, leaving a good 2 inches/5 cm between them so they have room to expand. Brush the tops with the glaze and press the snouts down with a fingertip. Bake until puffed up, light, dry and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, so they can breathe all around and will keep their shape and not go soggy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 20536,&quot;Orange Creamsicles 1 cup cream 2 egg whites* (See Disclaimer) 1/2 cup honey 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Juice of 3 oranges (1 cup orange juice) Zest of 1 orange Instructions: In a bowl, beat the cream with a whisk until soft peaks form.

Bring large pot of water to a boil and add the baking soda. Drop in the hazelnuts, bring back to a boil, and blanch 10 seconds. Drain hazelnuts in a colander, then spread out on a baking sheet in a single layer. Place in oven and roast 8 to 10 minutes until light brown. Remove from oven, place a kitchen towel over the pan, and allow to cool completely. Rub cooled hazelnuts between your palms; the skins should slip right off. Set aside 50 whole hazelnuts. Grind the rest very fine in a food processor fitted with the metal blade and set aside. Place sugar and heavy cream in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Add the chopped chocolate, let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Whisk in the butter. Pour the ganache into the bowl of an electric mixer and allow to cool until set. Fit the machine with a paddle and beat the set ganache on medium speed until aerated and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the reserved ground hazelnuts and the liqueur if using. Beat well to thoroughly combine. Load mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. Pipe out 1/2-inch balls. On top of each ball, press in one of the reserved whole toasted hazelnuts until it is halfway buried. Place pan in refrigerator to chill completely. To coat, place tempered chocolate in a medium bowl. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Get yourself 2 forks. Place one nut-topped ball on the prongs of one fork, nut up. Lower the fork into the melted chocolate, covering completely. Lift fork up, pause 3 seconds to allow excess chocolate to drip off, then run bottom of fork along top of bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place fork on paperlined pan and use second fork to push off the candy while you withdraw the first fork (it&#39;s easier than it sounds). Keep the nut up at all times. Repeat with remaining centers. If it&#39;s warm out, place the finished candies in the refrigerator to set; otherwise they will set at cool room temperature (65 degrees). Both of these candies make great Christmas presents packed into little boxes or baskets. They are involved but can be done easily in large batches. One day of work can yield many gifts. You can make a double of triple batch of truffle ganache and divide it, beating different flavorings into different parts. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 20540,&quot;Applenog farm-fresh cider (equal parts) store-bought eggnog (equal parts) nutmeg Instructions: Pour equal parts farm-fresh cider and store-bought eggnog into a shaker and give it a good shake.

Meanwhile, cut the head and feet off of the duck and make a slit at the base of the neck to insert the air pump. While holding the rear of the duck tightly sealed, turn on the pump to separate the skin from the meat. The air must travel all the way down the legs. Set blown up ducks aside. Mix the salt and 5-spice together and season the duck inside and out. In a large bowl, mix the oranges, scallions and ginger. Stuff the ducks full of the mix and thread the skewer through the bottom flaps to seal. Hook or tie the ducks by the neck and dip 3 times in the boiling glaze. Hang in the refrigerator or cool place over night (ideally use a rotating fan to keep the air circulating which will more efficiently dry the skin). The next day, pre-heat an oven to 375 degrees and place ducks on a rack (on a sheet tray) and roast for 1 hour, breast side up. A lot of fat will render off so be careful when removing. Carve up ducks and serve with pancakes, scallion brushes and hoisin-lime sauce. PANCAKES: Place the flour in a mixing bowl and quickly add the boiling water and mix as rapidly as possible. Add the oils and work into the dough, Mix for 2 to 3 minutes until the dough is homogenous and pliable. Let rest 5 minutes. Roll out the dough into a long cylinder, 2 inches in diameter. Cut into 8 to 10 pieces. Turn each piece on its flat side and roll out on a floured surface with a rolling pin to about 5 to 6 inches. In a skillet on low-medium, coat lightly with peanut oil and color both sides brown, small bubbles will form. Keep covered with a damp, hot cloth. These may be done in advance, then steamed hot for service. HOISIN-LIME SAUCE: In a skillet on medium heat, add the oil to coat. Add the hoisin and stir, it should sizzle and bubble. Cook for only 1 minute then add the juice and stir. Transfer to a small serving dish.<br> PLATING Lay out carved duck on a platter.

Brine the pork loin in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours. Remove from the brine, rinse under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before grilling. Prepare the charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash) and add to the grill, creating a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, leaving the other half with no coals. Spread the soaked wood chips evenly over the top and the rosemary sprigs or sage leaves, if desired. Put the cooking grate in place and open the grill lid vents halfway. Let the grate heat for 5 minutes. Use a grill brush to scrape the cooking grate clean. Brush the entire loin with the olive oil and sprinkle with pepper. Place the pork on the opposite side of the coals but close to the fire. Cover with the lid and turn the lid so that the vents are opposite the fire to draw smoke through the grill. Use a grill thermometer and make sure the heat inside the grill is at 400 degrees F. Grill the pork, covered, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the pork registers about 135 degrees F. This will take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes, depending the thickness of the loin. Transfer the loin to a cutting board, tent loosely with foil and let rest 15 minutes before cutting into thick slices. Serve with the Agrodolce Grilled Peaches and drizzle some of the reduced peach glaze over the meat. Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the broth, salt, honey, sugar, peppercorns, rosemary and garlic, stirring to dissolve the salt. Remove from the heat and add the ice cubes to cool quickly to room temperature. Bring the vinegar, honey, nectar and some salt and pepper to a simmer in a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced to a syrupy consistency, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Brush the cut side of the peaches with the canola oil, season with salt and pepper and place cut-side down on the grill over medium-high heat. Grill until lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, cook 1 to 2 minutes then brush with the glaze and cook another minute or so. The peaches should be tender but hold their shape. Transfer the peaches to a platter and drizzle with some of the glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 20564,&quot;Turkey Cutlets with Sausage and Zucchini and Tipsy Gravy 1 1/2 pounds turkey breast cutlets Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 large eggs, beaten 1 cup bread crumbs 1/2 cup cornmeal 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 orange, zested 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves finely chopped Olive oil or vegetable oil 1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage or 3 short links removed from casing 1 medium onion, chopped 1 red bell pepper, chopped 2 large cloves garlic, crushed 2 small to medium zucchini, cut into bite-size chunks 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup red wine (recommended: Pinot Noir) 2 cups turkey or chicken stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Season the turkey cutlets with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.

Stir over medium heat to blend. Whisk in coconut milk and applesauce. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Set aside and keep warm. Crispy Spinach: Heat oil in heavy large pot or wok over medium-high heat until oil registers 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, carefully add spinach to oil and cook until spinach is crisp and translucent, about 30 seconds. Be careful as oil may spit and splatter a bit due to the water content of the spinach. Using a skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer crispy spinach to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle spinach with salt. Set aside and keep warm. Lobster Tails and Rice: Prepare rice according to package instructions. Set aside and keep warm. Meanwhile, sprinkle lobster tails with seafood seasoning. Melt butter and oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add lobster tails. Cover and cook until lobsters are just cooked through, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes. Presentation: Spoon 1 cup of rice onto center of each of 4 dinner plates. Slice lobster tails crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick medallions. Fan lobster medallions atop rice. Place crispy spinach alongside. Drizzle curry sauce over and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 20580,&quot;Piri Piri Sauce 1/3 cup dried African bird&#39;s eye chiles, seeded 1 cup oil (olive or other vegetable oil) 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons coriander 1 tablespoon chopped fresh Thai basil 1 tablespoon cumin 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger (can substitute ginger powder) 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 preserved lemon 4 cloves garlic 1 whole roasted red bell pepper, seeds removed Salt Instructions: Soak the chiles overnight, then transfer to a blender along with the oil, cilantro, lemon juice, coriander, basil, cumin, dill, ginger, smoked paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, preserved lemon, garlic, bell pepper and salt. Blend until smooth. Use as a stand-alone hot sauce or marinade for grilling chicken wings. (Makes enough to marinate about 4 pounds of chicken wings.) &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinotage]&quot; 20581,&quot;Satanic Fudge Brownies 1 pound 1-ounce chopped 70 percent bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled slightly 10 ounces finely chopped 70 percent bittersweet chocolate 13 ounces soft butter 1 pound 4 ounces granulated sugar 6 extra large eggs 8 ounces all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350-degrees F. Spray 9 by 13-inch pan with non-stick spray and place 1 piece of parchment paper to line the bottom of the pan. Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer. Scrape down both sides. Then add the eggs 1 by 1. Add the salt and flour and mix until smooth. Remove the bowl from mixer and pour in cooled melted chocolate, mix well with a spatula. Add chopped chocolate last, fold quickly, then put in the prepared pan. Level out batter in pan. Place in preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until skewer comes out clean. Cool completely before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Malbec, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah]&quot; 20582,&quot;Atomic Hash Browns 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled, coarsely grated on a box grater and squeezed dry in a kitchen towel 1 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon cayenne Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.<br> Toss the potatoes with the granulated garlic, paprika, cayenne and some salt and pepper in a medium bowl.<br> Add half of the butter and half of the oil to the skillet. Let melt, and then add the potatoes, pressing them down with a spatula. Cook until crisp and golden brown on one side, 5 to 7 minutes.<br> Set a baking sheet or a large plate over the skillet and carefully invert the potatoes onto the baking sheet. Add the remaining butter and oil to the skillet and slide the potatoes back in, un-cooked side down, and cook until golden and crispy on the second side as well, 4 to 5 minutes.<br> Slide onto a cutting board and cut into wedges to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 20583,&quot;Over-Stuffed Carbonara Baked Potatoes 4 medium russet potatoes, scrubbed and dried thoroughly (about 3 pounds) 4 strips bacon 3/4 cup half-and-half Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 scallions, thinly sliced (white and dark green parts kept separate) 3 ounces Parmesan, finely grated (about 3 cups) 4 large eggs, at room temperature Instructions: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pierce the potatoes all over with a fork and microwave on high for 15 to 20 minutes, rotating each potato a few times. The potatoes are done once a toothpick or skewer easily pierces the flesh. Allow the potatoes to cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, lay the bacon in a large nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat, turning once, until golden and crispy, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain (reserve the drippings in the skillet), then finely chop. Return the skillet with the bacon drippings to medium heat and stir in the half-and-half, a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is hot and steaming; remove from the heat. Use a sharp paring knife to cut a lengthwise slit in the center of each potato. Carefully remove enough flesh to leave about a 1/2-inch-thick wall around the inside. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the potato flesh for another use, then add the remaining flesh to a mixing bowl along with the half-and-half mixture, scallion whites, half of the bacon, a large pinch of salt and 2 1/2 cups of the Parmesan. Mash with a potato masher until mostly smooth. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Put the potato-skin shells on a baking sheet. Divide the mashed potato mixture evenly among the skins. Make a large well in each potato deep enough to hold an egg and crack an egg into the well. Bake the potatoes until the eggs are just starting to set, about 10 minutes. Remove the potatoes and cover the eggs with the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Switch the oven to broil and broil, checking frequently, until the eggs no longer wiggle when you shake the baking sheet, 3 to 5 minutes. To serve, top each potato with the scallion greens and remaining bacon and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20584,&quot;Summer Mediterranean Sardine Salad 1 16-ounce can tomatoes, drained and de-seeded 1 can sardines, left whole 1 can artichoke hearts 1 can hearts of palm Italian dressing to taste Box croutons Instructions: In a medium-sized bowl, toss the tomatoes, sardines, artichoke hearts, and the hearts of palm together. Add Italian dressing to taste and top with croutons. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o]&quot; 20585,&quot;Curry-Topped Black Cod with Cumin-Scented Warm Savoy Slaw 1 cup soy-based mayonnaise, such as Vegenaise, or reduced-fat mayonnaise 2 tablespoons curry powder blend Four 6 to 7-ounce center-cut fillets black cod or other sustainable white thick-fillet fish Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, or seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay Lime wedges<br> Cumin-Scented Warm Savoy Slaw, for serving, recipe follows Coconut-Ginger Rice with Chickpeas and Chilies, for serving, recipe follows 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 1 head savoy cabbage, shredded Juice of 1 lime Kosher salt 2 tablespoons butter 1 Fresno cl, sliced One 2-inch piece ginger, grated 1 bunch scallions, whites and greens thinly sliced 2 cups chicken stock<br> 1 cup white rice 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut Zest and juice of 1 lime<br> 1 can chickpeas, drained 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Heat the broiler and place the rack in the upper third of the oven.<br> Mix the mayonnaise with the curry powder blend in a small bowl. Place the fish on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper or seafood seasoning if using. Slather the fish evenly with the curry mayonnaise. Place under broiler until the fish is firm and the top is very brown, 10 to 12 minutes. (Keep an eye on the fish while broiling and move to a lower rack in the oven if it&#39;s starting to brown before it&#39;s cooked through.) Serve the broiled fish with lime wedges, Cumin-Scented Warm Savoy Slaw and Coconut-Ginger Rice with Chickpeas and Chiles. Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the cumin seeds and stir, 1 minute. Add the cabbage and wilt. Finish the slaw with the lime juice and season with salt. Heat the butter in a saucepot over medium heat. Add the chiles, ginger and whites of the scallions and stir 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock, rice, coconut and lime zest. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cover. Cook 17 to 18 minutes. Add in the chickpeas in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Finish the rice by stirring in the lime juice, the greens of the scallions and cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 20586,&quot;Prawn and Chive Potstickers 8 ounces large shrimp, peeled, deveined and minced 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Chinese chives (or scallions) 1/8 cup canned water chestnuts, finely diced (about 4 whole) 1 tablespoon oyster sauce 1 tablespoon Shaohsing rice wine Sea salt Freshly ground white pepper 2 tablespoons light soy sauce 2 tablespoons clear rice vinegar 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil Small handful fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped Cornstarch, for dusting 30 gyoza dumpling wrappers 2 tablespoons peanut oil Instructions: For the filling: Mix the shrimp, chives, water chestnuts, oyster sauce and rice wine into a bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. With clean hands, squeeze the filling through your fingers so that all the flavors are combined well. Wash your hands and dry well. For the dipping sauce: In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and cilantro and set aside.<br> For the potstickers: Sprinkle a baking sheet or plate with some cornstarch. Then place a dumpling wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place a heaping teaspoon of the filling in the middle of the dumpling skin. Then dip your finger into a water bowl and brush around the rim. Fold in half so you have a half moon shape, pressing down on the edges to make sure the dumpling wrapper sticks together well. Pleat the edges of the potsticker 4 times, pinching well to secure. Place the potstickers on the prepared baking sheet until ready to cook. (You could make ahead to this point and freeze in an airtight container, then cook from frozen when desired.) Heat a wok over medium heat. Cook the potstickers in two batches, so you don&#39;t over-crowd the pan. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and arrange half the potstickers standing up in the oil. Cook, uncovered, until the bottoms are pale golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water around the edges of the wok, then cover and cook until the liquid has evaporated and the bottoms of the potstickers are crisp and golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Repeat with the next batch. Serve alongside the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 20587,&quot;Shiitake Fondue 1 large clove garlic, split in half 1 small ginger root 1 tablespoon butter 2 cups sliced shiitakes 2 minced shallots Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/4 cups white wine 1/2 pound shredded Gruyere 1/2 pound shredded Emmenthal 1 tablespoon cornstarch 2 sprigs fresh thyme 1 country boule or baguette Instructions: In a medium size saucepan, rub the inside with the garlic clove. Repeat with the ginger. On medium heat, melt the butter and sweat the shiitakes and shallots. Season and add the wine. Bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, have the cheese and cornstarch already tossed together in a resealable plastic bag. Add the cheese mix to the wine, and stir to incorporate. Add the thyme and taste. Break bread, dip, chew, swallow, yum-yum. Wash down with wine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 20588,&quot;Veal Osso Buco Olive oil Salt and pepper 4 veal shanks (14 ounces each) 1 pound mirepoix (onion, carrot, and celery), diced 1/4-inch 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 anchovy fillets 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 cup Barolo wine 2 quarts brown veal stock 4 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped 1/4-inch 1 bunch Italian parsley, washed and chopped fine Gremolata, recipe follows Instructions: First season the meat with olive oil, salt and fresh ground black pepper, then in a smoking hot cast iron pan sear both sides of the shank. Remove the veal and set aside. Add in the mirepoix, garlic, anchovy and tomato paste, caramelize all the ingredients together, add the Barolo to the pan to deglaze. Add the veal stock to the pan and reduce by 1/4. When reduced, pour the simmering liquid over the 4 veal shanks in a roasting pan, add the diced tomato and parsley. Cover first with plastic wrap then with aluminum foil, place in a 325 degree oven for 3 1/2 hours. Check for fork tenderness. Garnish with the gremolata and shaved, roasted parsnips and carrots. Gremolata: Chopped parsley, lemon zest, bread crumbs, anchovy For the Sauce: Reduce braising liquid by 1/4, season and pour over shanks. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Nebbiolo, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 20589,&quot;Chicken Club Ranch Roll 1 pound sliced bacon 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons chopped chives 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder A few dashes Worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 large egg, beaten with a splash of water 1 cup panko<br> 1/2 pound chicken tenders Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 square or rectangular flatbreads, such as lavash 2 leaves green-leaf lettuce, halved lengthwise Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Lay the bacon slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. (It&#39;s OK if they overlap a little.) Bake until browned but still pliable, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer the bacon with tongs to a paper towel-lined plate. Meanwhile, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, chives, garlic powder, onion powder and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl until combined; set aside. Set up a breading station with the flour in 1 medium bowl, the beaten egg in another medium bowl and the panko in a third. Generously season the chicken tenders with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Dredge the tenders in the flour a few pieces at a time. Tap off the excess flour before dipping the tenders into the egg. Allow the excess egg to drip off, then coat the tenders in the panko. Set the breaded chicken on a plate. Repeat until all the tenders have been coated. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the chicken in a single layer. Cook until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes, then flip. Cook until the chicken is cooked through and browned on the other side, 3 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate. Lay out a flatbread with the shorter side facing you. (If your flatbread seems dry, moisten it slightly with a damp paper towel.) Spread half the ranch dressing on the bottom third. Line the wrap with half the bacon strips, then add half the chicken crosswise. Top the chicken with 2 pieces of lettuce, also crosswise. Starting from the bottom, roll everything up into as tight a spiral as possible without ripping the wrap, leaving the seam on the bottom. Place toothpicks into the roll at 1-inch intervals all the way through to the bottom to secure everything in place. Cut, in between the toothpicks, into even slices. Repeat with the remaining flatbread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 20590,&quot;Healthy Sweet Potato Salad 4 large sweet potatoes<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt<br> 1/2 cup diced scallions (about 6)<br> 1 red pepper, finely diced<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives 2 teaspoons orange zest<br> 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco<br> Salt and pepper Instructions: Peel and cube the sweet potatoes and put them in a large pot.
