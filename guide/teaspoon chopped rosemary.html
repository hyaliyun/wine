For the marinade: Mix all ingredients together. Marinate steak and scraps for 24 hours refrigerated. Remove steaks from marinade. Strain and reserve juices. Skim off oil and discard. Saute scraps, vegetables and spices to brown. Drain fat. Add marinade and reduce to half. Add 2 cups cold water and bring to boil. Simmer minimum 30 minutes, skimming impurities from top. For the finished dish: In the olive oil, saute seasoned hanger steaks over high heat. Brown steaks and turn over. Add shallots and cook steaks to desired temperature (rare to medium rare) and remove. Add shiitakes, season and saute with shallots for 2 minutes. Deglaze pan with port wine and reduce to half. Add strained stock. Simmer and reduce to desired consistency. Finish with butter, rosemary and season. Slice steak 1/4-inch thick, against the grain, and on the bias. Top with sauce and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 21866,&quot;Chicken Skewers with Espagnole Sauce 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 scallions, chopped 1 tablespoon chopped celery 1 tablespoon chopped carrot 1 small clove garlic, crushed 1 tablespoon dry red wine 2 cups rich brown beef, veal or chicken stock, hot 1 tablespoon toasted instant flour (recommended: Wondra) 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon tomato paste A sachet d&#39;epices containing: 1 sprig parsley, 1 sprig thyme, 1 bay leaf, 1 black peppercorn 1 liter vegetable or canola oil (if deep-frying) 2 teaspoons chili powder 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon garlic powder 2/3 cup all-purpose flour (if deep-frying) 6 boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks Instructions: Special equipment: bamboo skewers For the sauce: Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, and saute scallions, celery, carrot, and garlic over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until the vegetables have caramelized lightly. Add the red wine and beef stock and bring to a simmer. In a stainless steel mixing bowl, whisk together the toasted flour and butter, add the tomato paste, then gradually ladle in the hot stock, whisking as you go to make a smooth sauce. Add the sachet d&#39;epices of parsley, thyme, bay leaf, and peppercorn, reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 50 minutes. Skim any impurities off the surface. Heat oil to 350 degrees F in a deep-fryer. Mix the chili powder, salt and garlic powder in a shallow bowl and stir in flour. Skewer chunks of chicken using bamboo skewers which have been pre-soaked in water, and dip chicken into warm water, then coat with seasoned flour. Fry until cooked through (about 6 minutes) and serve with Espagnole sauce. (Alternatively, these can be grilled by eliminating the flour and dipping the moistened skewered chicken into the mixed seasonings, then grilling until cooked through.) &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 21867,&quot;Mashed Sweet Potatoes and Carrots 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled, cubed 4 large carrots, peeled, sliced 2 garlic cloves, peeled 1/4 cup whipping cream 2 tablespoons butter Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Cook potatoes, carrots and garlic in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender.

Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Scatter the turnips, radishes and celeriac on a baking sheet. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and drizzle over the vegetables. Sprinkle with the cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and some pepper and toss to coat the vegetables.<br> Roast, stirring once halfway through, until the vegetables are just tender and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.<br> Meanwhile, add the chorizo to a large skillet over medium heat and cook, using a wooden spoon to break up any chunks, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to the prepared baking dish with a slotted spoon and spread in an even layer, leaving the fat from the chorizo in the skillet.<br> Return the skillet to medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and cook, scraping up any browned chorizo bits from the bottom of the skillet, until the onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> Scatter the onions on top of the chorizo in the baking dish and sprinkle half of the Monterey Jack over the onions. Add the spinach in an even layer on top of the cheese, then distribute the roasted vegetables on top of the spinach.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the cream, eggs, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper. Pour the egg mixture over top of everything in the baking dish. Top with the remaining cheese. Bake until set in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Top with sour cream before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 21870,&quot;Chocolate-Orange Truffles 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped (not chips) 1/3 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons honey Finely grated zest of 2 oranges 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/3 cup turbinado sugar Instructions: Bring about 1 inch of water to a very slow simmer in a medium saucepan. Put the chocolate in a medium heat-safe bowl that can sit on top of the pan without touching the water. Put the bowl over the water and let the chocolate melt, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, bring the heavy cream, honey and half of the orange zest to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the honey. Strain the cream mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl and then gradually whisk into the chocolate until smooth and shiny. Whisk in the butter until melted. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool spot until slightly firm, about 1 hour. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Rub together the sugar and remaining orange zest in a small bowl until combined. Transfer the truffle mixture to a piping bag or resealable bag fitted with a plain 1/4-inch tip. Holding the bag about 1/4-inch over the baking sheet, pipe 3/4-inch truffles. Sprinkle with the orange sugar. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 21871,&quot;PB &amp; J Bark 4 peanut butter pumpkins or cups, such a Reese\u2019s 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 12 each milk chocolate nuggets, such as Hersey Chopped peanut butter cups, peanut M&amp;M&#39;s, and fruit gummies snacks to garnish<br> Instructions: Line a quarter baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Cut in the shortening using a pastry blender or your hands or a stand mixer fixed with a dough hook until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center and add 1 cup buttermilk. Using your hands, quickly fold the dry ingredients into the buttermilk until a sticky dough forms. You may need to add more buttermilk. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Gently fold the dough over itself 3 or 4 times to create layers. Press the dough out to 1 1/2-inches thick and cut with a floured 3-inch biscuit cutter. Lay the biscuits on an ungreased cookie sheet and brush the tops with buttermilk. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until risen and golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21873,&quot;Toasted Coconut and Orange Icebox Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons packed orange zest 1/2 teaspoon table salt 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus extra for rolling cookies 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 large egg, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup toasted sweetened coconut 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped Instructions: Heat oven to 350 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle. Combine the flour, zest, and salt in a large bowl and whisk until evenly combined. Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment beat together butter and sugars over high speed until light and airy, about 2 minutes. Add the sugars and beat until fluffy and the mixture looks like wet sand, about 2 more minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and mix until just combined. Reduce the speed to medium and add the flour mixture and coconut and beat until just evenly combined. Lay 2 large pieces of plastic wrap on a clean work surface and put half of the dough along the center of each piece. Shape the dough into 2 logs measuring about 1 1/2-inches in diameter and 10-inches long. Roll logs up in the plastic and secure tightly. Refrigerate the logs for 1 hour or up to several weeks. Cut the logs into 1/2-inch slices. Roll the cookies in sugar to coat and shake off excess. Arrange on a baking sheet, leaving 1/2-inch between the cookies. Bake until set and golden on the edges, about 15 to 18 minutes. Remove to cooling racks to cool completely. When cookies are cool, melt the chocolate in a small pan over medium-low heat until smooth. Dip half of each cookie into the chocolate, scrape off excess, and set on a cooling rack. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes to set up before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 21874,&quot;Fish Stick Tacos 48 frozen fish sticks Homemade Tortillas, recipe follows Cabbage Pantry Slaw, recipe follows 1 cup jarred salsa<br> 1 cup jarred salsa verde<br> 1 1/2 cups grated Colby Jack cheese<br> Jarred sliced jalapenos, for topping<br> 3 limes, cut into wedges<br> 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 1 cup very hot water 1/2 head green cabbage, finely shredded 1 cup store-bought salad dressing, such as Thousand Island or Southwest flavor<br> 2 tablespoons jarred jalapenos, chopped, plus 3 tablespoons liquid from the jar One 4-ounce can diced pimentos, drained<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cook the fish sticks according to the package directions.

I&#39;ve got an excuse with this one, too: the whole point of this risotto is that it&#39;s black, tinted by the squid ink (the squink of my title) and I had no desire to lessen its impact with some pallid white wine. But it&#39;s not just a question of colour: the squid ink is so richly, headily flavored that nothing less than a robust red would stand up to it. As strange as it might sound for so exotic a dish, this may even pass muster as a storecupboard standby. The rice, the broth and the squid ink (it comes in sachets, from a good fishmonger or Italian deli, or online source) can be kept easily. I have marked the squid-ring topping as optional, but even that can live in the freezer for a few months. While I am more than happy to eat it plain black, I can&#39;t help feeling cheered by the jaunty tricolore adornment provided by the squid rings, red cl pepper and parsley. Not that I&#39;m being cheered is altogether the point of such a beautiful, sombre dish, the perfect date meal for Goths. Cut the squid (if using) into thin rings and set aside while you get on with the risotto. Heat the broth until almost boiling, and keep the broth warm in a saucepan on the lowest heat Warm the 2 tablespoons oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan and soften the sliced scallions for 2 minutes on a low heat. Keep stirring and don&#39;t let them burn. Grate in the garlic and turn up the heat. Toss in the rice and turn it in the oil and so it is slicked and shiny. Pour in the red wine and let it bubble up over the rice. Wearing disposable vinyl gloves, snip in the squid ink and carefully dunk the squeezed out sachets into the separate pan of hot broth to get out any remaining ink. Then add and keep adding ladlefuls of hot broth to the rice, letting one ladleful be absorbed before adding the next, stirring all the while. When the rice has had 15 minutes, you can be less assiduous on the stirring front and get on with the squid, if you&#39;re using this. In a frying pan, heat 2 teaspoons olive oil and the cl, until sizzling, then add the squid rings and cook, stirring or shaking the pan a little, for 3 minutes. Season with ground pepper, to taste. By this time, the black risotto should be ready, so divide it between warmed shallow bowls or plates, top with cl and squid, if using, and scatter with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 21888,&quot;Portobello Mushroom, Hot and Sweet Pepper Ragu with Pappardelle 2 Italian red cherry peppers or 2 large Fresno cl peppers 1 large or 2 medium red bell peppers 1/4 cup EVOO 1/4 pound pancetta or guanciale, chopped into batons 4 to 5 portobello mushroom caps, gills scraped, sliced 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh sage 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme 1/2 tablespoon fresh marjoram or oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried 4 large cloves garlic, sliced 1 large or 2 medium onions, chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 1/2 cups dry red wine One 32-ounce can whole D.O.P.

Add the flour, potato starch and baking powder and whisk until just incorporated -- avoid overmixing; some lumps are okay. Add the cabbage and scallions and gently fold into the batter. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Spoon in about 1/2 cup of the batter. Use a spatula to very lightly pat down the surface and to form a round about 3 inches wide and 1/2 inch high. Repeat until the skillet is full, but not overcrowded. Top each round with 2 pieces of pork belly, overlapping them slightly. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the rounds over, keeping the pork belly in place as much as possible and reducing the heat slightly if the pork belly browns too quickly, and cook until the pork belly has rendered its fat and the okonomiyaki are cooked through and golden brown, about 4 minutes more. Transfer to plates and repeat with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, batter and pork belly, leaving behind any liquid that\u2019s settled at the bottom of the batter. (If your pork is very fatty, you might not need to add more oil to the skillet.) Serve hot, pork-side-up. Drizzle with okonomi sauce and mayonnaise in zigzag lines, then sprinkle with beni shoga, aonori and/or katsuobushi (if using). Combine the kombu and 3 cups cold water in a medium saucepan and let sit for about 30 minutes. (You can skip this step if you\u2019re short on time, but it does lend a little extra flavor.) Heat over medium heat until the water comes to a near boil, but doesn\u2019t actually boil, about 5 minutes. Discard the kombu. Add the katsuobushi evenly over the water, bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately remove from the heat. Let steep for about 10 minutes without stirring. Pour the dashi through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl or quart-size measuring cup. Do not press down on the katsuobushi, which can make the dashi cloudy and/or bitter.

Season both sides of the pork chops with salt and toasted spice rub. Heat the oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat and sear the pork chops until golden brown, about 4 minutes on 1side and 1 minute on the other side. Place pork chops on baking sheet. Remove excess oil from skillet. Bake the chops until just cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a serving platter. Over medium heat, add the wine to the skillet, stir, and reduce to 1 to 2 tablespoons; add the apple sauce and bring to a simmer. Spoon over each chop. Toasted Spice Rub 1/4 cup fennel seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon peppercorns 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 cup pure California chili powder 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel begins to turn light brown, add the red pepper flakes, and toss several times. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. Note: If you have an exhaust fan over your stove, turn it on before you start toasting the spices.

Cool completely, remove the cinnamon stick and stir in the pecans. For the pancake batter: Mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the milk, butter, vanilla and eggs in a separate bowl. Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and pour the milk mixture into the well. Gently whisk until combined, but do not overmix, as it will make your pancakes chewy. Let the batter rest for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, chop 1 cup of the pecans and set the remaining 1/2 cup aside. Heat a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet and coat with about 2 tablespoons butter. Add a scant 1/2 cup batter per pancake to your pan, leaving space between each. Sprinkle a handful of the chopped pecans in each. Cook until you see bubbles on the sides and in the center of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the pan to a flat surface to cool a few minutes. Cook the rest of the pancakes in butter in batches. Hold a pancake flat and use a paring knife to make a 1/2-inch horizontal cut in the top. Slip the knife in horizontally and move it back and forth while turning the pancake to make a pocket. Repeat with all the pancakes. Spoon some sauce inside each pocket. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Make stacks of stuffed pancakes on a serving platter.

For the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the penne and cook until al dente according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside. For the pureed greens: Meanwhile, add the spinach, arugula, basil, mint, parsley, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and garlic to a food processor. With the machine running, drizzle in the olive oil and puree. Stop before the mixture is completely smooth; you want a bit of texture. Set aside. For the cheese sauce: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour and mustard powder, whisking to combine. Cook, whisking constantly, for a minute or so. Pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Cook the sauce until thick and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in the half-and-half, salt and pepper. Add the Cheddar, fontina and Monterey Jack. Stir until the cheese all melts. For the assembly: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Combine the melted butter, breadcrumbs and parsley in a small bowl. Add the cooked penne to the cheese sauce, making sure every noodle is covered in sauce. Next, stir in the pureed greens until barely combined. Pour the pasta mixture into the buttered baking pan and top evenly with the breadcrumbs. Bake until bubbly and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. If you are serving later, top the assembled casserole with aluminum foil and pop in the freezer. When you are ready to serve, allow it to thaw in the fridge overnight and bake the following day at 350 degrees F until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 hour covered and an additional 15 minutes uncovered. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti]&quot; 21978,&quot;Kung Pao Chicken 1 tablespoon rice wine 1 tablespoon peanut oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon cornstarch 8 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons light soy sauce 2 tablespoons rice wine 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce 2 tablespoons peanut oil 4 dried red chiles remove stems and cut in halves 1/2-inch piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced, smashed 1 garlic, smashed 1 green onion, cut the white part into 1/2 -inch pieces, julienne the green parts 1/4 cup deep-fried peanuts 2 tablespoons chicken stock plus 1 tablespoon cornstarch, mixed together to make slurry Instructions: Marinade: In a non-reactive bowl, prepare the marinade.

Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the parsnips until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the parsnips, saving the milk. Put the parsnips in a food processor with the honey and puree. Add some milk to adjust the consistency (you&#39;ll need 1 to 2 cups of the liquid). Season with salt and pepper. For the roasted tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut the ends off of each tomato and then cut each tomato into 3 slices. In a bowl, toss the tomato slices with the oil, salt and pepper. Arrange the tomato slices on a baking sheet and roast until tender and the edges are brown, 10 to 15 minutes. For the asparagus: Add 1 gallon of water and 2 tablespoons kosher salt to a large pot and bring to a rolling boil. Set up an ice bath for shocking the asparagus after blanching. Blanch the Asparagus in batches in the boiling water for 45 seconds to a minute, and then transfer to the ice bath. Dry off the asparagus with a towel and set aside. For the steak: Heat a skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Depending on the size of the skillet (and how many batches you&#39;ll cook), add 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons grapeseed oil. Salt and pepper the steaks and sear on each side (the teres major is a triangle shape) for 3 to 4 minutes. Once all of the steaks are cooked, put them all into a pan and add the butter. Allow the steaks to rest for 10 minutes, basting with the butter occasionally. To finish the asparagus, heat a saute pan over high heat, add the grapeseed oil and saute the asparagus for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. For plating: Divide the parsnip puree among 6 plates and drag it from one side of the plate to the other. Shingle 3 slices of tomato across the parsnip puree. Slice each steak into 5 slices and shingle over the top of the tomatoes. Pour 2 to 3 ounces of the Demi-Glace over and around each plate. Lean 5 pieces of asparagus up on the side of each steak. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Pour the oil into a metal roasting pan and put it in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes to heat up the pan and condition it with the oil. Spread the bones out on the roasting pan and cook until browned, 30 to 45 minutes, turning the bones occasionally so they brown evenly. Transfer the bones to a large-enough stockpot to accommodate the bones, 6 quarts ice water and more. Use tongs to transfer the bones so you do not pour any fat into the stockpot. Add the ice water to the stockpot and bring to a simmer. Allow the stock to cook for 4 hours at a slow simmer. Skim the surface of the stock occasionally to remove any fat or impurities. While the stock is simmering, discard all but about 1/4 cup of the fat from the roasting pan. Bring the pan back up to temperature over high heat on the stovetop. Add the onions and carrots and cook until golden brown and caramelized. Add the celery and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme and bay leaf and cook, stirring regularly, until the tomato paste gets a brick red color, about 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the red wine and stir it into the mirepoix (vegetable) mixture. Add the mirepoix mixture to the stock after the 4-hour simmering time. Bring the stock back up to a simmer and continue to cook it for another 2 hours. In a separate pot, bring the remaining 7 cups red wine to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. When the stock has simmered for 6 hours, strain it through a chinois and combine the strained stock with the reduced red wine. Bring the stock to a boil, lower the heat to a hard simmer and reduce the stock until it has a consistency that coats the back of spoon and is about 2 quarts (8 cups) in volume, up to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper and then strain the sauce though a chinois again.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 21981,&quot;Orecchiette with Turkey Sausage and Broccoli Rabe 2 bunches broccoli rabe, stems trimmed 1 pound orecchiette pasta 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound turkey Italian-style sausage, casings removed 3 garlic cloves, minced Pinch dried crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 stalk celery, chopped 1 carrot, chopped 2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes 4 to 6 basil leaves 2 dried bay leaves Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional Instructions: Cook the broccoli rabe in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp tender, about 1 minute. Transfer the broccoli rabe to a large bowl of ice water to cool, saving the cooking water. Bring the reserved cooking water back to a boil. Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up into pieces with a spoon, until browned and juices form, about 12 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, and saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, when the reserved cooking water is boiling, add the orecchiette and cook until al dente, tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Strain the broccoli rabe and add it to the pan with the sausage mixture and toss to coat with the juices. Add the pasta to the skillet. Stir in the Parmesan and serve immediately. In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add celery and carrot and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and simmer for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and taste for seasoning. If sauce tastes too acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, to round out the flavor. Pour half the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce. If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and then pour 1 to 2 cup portions into plastic freezer bags. Freeze for up to 6 months.

Roll out the pate sucre to a circle about 1/4 inch thick and large enough to slightly overlap a 9-inch metal tart pan. Fit the dough into the pan and trim the edges. Line the bottom and sides of the shell with parchment, or coffee filter papers, or aluminum foil. Fill the lining with dried beans, rice or aluminum beans, and bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool and remove the beans and the lining. Return the shell to the oven and bake until golden, 5 to 10 minutes longer. In a large metal bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, 1 cup sugar, lemon and lime juice, and zests. Set over simmering water and continue to whisk until the mixture is very thick, about 10 minutes. Turn off the flame and whisk in the butter, a few pieces at a time. (You don&#39;t want the mixture to cool down before all the butter is incorporated.) Strain the filling into a bowl. Scrape into the baked tart shell and smooth with a metal spatula. Cool and then refrigerate until firm, 3 to 4 hours, up to overnight. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar evenly over the top of the filling. With a propane blowtorch, caramelize the sugar. (This can also be done under the broiler. Place the tart on the broiler tray directly under the flame, watching carefully to prevent burning). Refrigerate the tart for at least 30 minutes. Or, if desired, eliminate the 2 tablespoons of sugar and arrange circles of raspberries on top of the tart. Sift a little powdered sugar over the berries just before serving. Cut into slices and serve. If you have caramelized the sugar, serve the tart with fresh strawberries or raspberries. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour and sugar. Add the butter and process until the texture resembles fine meal. In a small bowl, whisk together the yolks and 1 tablespoon of the cream. Scrape into the machine and process until a ball begins to form, using the additional tablespoon of cream, if necessary. Remove the dough from the machine, and on a lightly floured surface, press down into a circle.

Drizzle the oil in a heavy, rimmed half-sheet pan and turn to coat the bottom. Add the dough and press and stretch to the corners with your fingers. (If the dough doesn&#39;t go all the way to the corners, let it rest for 5 minutes, then once it has relaxed a bit, stretch again.) Combine 1/2 cup each marinara and barbecue sauce in a small bowl. Put the chicken in another small bowl and add the remaining tablespoon each of marinara and barbecue sauce. Toss to coat the chicken in the sauce. Spread the BBQ marinara mixture on the pizza crust, leaving about 1/2-inch border around the edge. Sprinkle with 1 cup each Cheddar and pepper jack. For the meat side, top with the chicken, ham, bacon and pepperoni. For the vegetable side, top with the bell pepper, zucchini and tomato. Scatter the red onion over both sides. Sprinkle both sides with the remaining 1/4 cup each Cheddar and pepper jack.

If it begins to bubble, the heat is too high, so lower the heat to cook the eggs properly. (Slow and low like BBQ is the way to go with eggs.) Meanwhile, in a large bowl, add the eggs and 1 teaspoon cold water. Vigorously whisk until frothy and smooth. Swirl the pan around to coat the butter on the bottom and up the sides. Pour the eggs into the pan and let sit for a few seconds. When the eggs begin to lightly set on the bottom, use the whisk to gently beat the eggs, then allow them to sit for just a few seconds between beating them again. Curds will begin to form and increase throughout the cooking time. Repeat this process of whisking then resting the eggs for a few seconds until about 50 percent of the eggs are set and the rest are still wet. At this point, sprinkle the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper and continue to whisk and rest alternately. Once the eggs are 75 percent done, add the cheese and from this moment, continue to whisk the eggs until done. This entire process from pouring in the eggs to them being finished should take 8 to 12 minutes; this isn&#39;t a race, only a journey to the best scrambled eggs ever. Remove from the heat and continue to scramble in the last seconds.

Beat in the sugar. When smooth, beat in the almond and sugar powder. Beat in 1 egg white with the wooden spatula. Then beat in the remaining egg whites, 1 at a time, with a wire whisk. Whisk in the vanilla. Sift the flour over the batter and mix it in with the wooden spatula. Cover the batter airtight and refrigerate overnight or for up to 1 week. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Scoop the batter into the pastry bag, and pipe the batter in domes 1-inch wide, arranging them on the baking sheets in staggered rows and separating them by 2 to 3 inches. (Do not pipe more than 12 or 13 cookies on each baking sheet or you won&#39;t be able to roll them before they cool.) Or, spoon the batter in 1 teaspoon domes using the ice cream scoop. Let rest at room temperature for about 5 minutes before baking. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the cookies are golden brown around the edges but still pale in the center, about 4 to 7 minutes. While the cookies are baking, place a folded kitchen towel (a smooth, untextured towel, no terry cloth) on your countertop. One at a time, lift each cookie off the baking sheet using a metal spatula and place it upside down on the towel. Roll it around a wooden dowel or metal rod to form a cigarette. As you finish rolling the cigarette, press down firmly on the dowel to prevent the cigarette from unrolling, then slide it off the dowel onto a plate. Work quickly because if the cookies cool they will become brittle. If they do cool and start to crack as you roll them, return the baking sheet to the oven briefly to reheat them. Storage: Covered airtight in a cookie jar or tin cookie bowl for up to 1 week. Pipe the filling into both ends of the each cigarette to fill the entire length. Dip 1 end of each cigarette in the chocolate, clean off the excess on the edge of the pot, and place the cigarette on a sheet of waxed paper until the chocolate sets. Then dip the other end of each cigarette in the chocolate, clean off the excess on the edge of the pot, and return to the sheet of waxed paper until the chocolate on both ends has set. Serve on a serving platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21997,&quot;Salt and Vinegar Potato Galette 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large onion, thinly sliced Kosher salt Neutral oil, for frying<br> 2 medium potatoes (about 1 pound), thinly sliced (1/8 inch thick)<br> 2 tablespoons chopped chives<br> 3 tablespoons white vinegar Freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces your favorite pie dough<br> 1 large egg<br> 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan Flaky salt, for topping Instructions: In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, fry the potatoes, flipping once, until just tender and beginning to brown around the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain, then remove the paper towel. Sprinkle the potatoes with the chives, 2 tablespoons of the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Toss gently to combine. Roll your pie dough out into a 13-inch circle and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Whisk the egg with a splash of water in a small bowl and brush it onto the dough, leaving a 2-inch perimeter. In the center of the dough, layer up the toppings in this order: half the onions, half the Parmesan cheese and then half of the potatoes, in a fanned even layer. Top with the remaining onions, remaining cheese, the other half of the potatoes and any additional chives or black pepper from the bottom of the pan. Brush the edges of the crust with egg and then fold them up around the potatoes. Brush the outside edges with egg and sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the pie crust edges are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle the top of the galette with the remaining tablespoon of vinegar before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 21998,&quot;Red cl Glaze 12 dried New Mexico red cl pods 3 cups boiling water 2 cups honey 2 tablespoons red cl powder 2 tablespoons cumin Instructions: Deseed the chiles, and place in a bowl.

In a second bowl, beat the eggs with the water. In another bowl, combine the bread crumbs with the Parmigiana, remaining tablespoon Essence, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add enough vegetable oil to come halfway up the sides of a medium pot and heat to 360 degrees F. Preheat the oven to broil. Meanwhile, 1 at a time, dredge the shrimp first in the flour, then in the egg wash, and then in the seasoned bread crumbs, tossing to coat evening and shaking to remove any excess. Place on a plate until ready to cook. Add the shrimp in batches to the hot oil, turning occasionally, and cook until golden brown and the shrimp float to the top, about 2 minutes. Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Transfer the shrimp to a lightly greased baking dish. Spoon about 1 3/4 cups of the marinara sauce over the shrimp and sprinkle the mozzarella over the top. Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the spaghetti with the remaining marinara sauce and warm gently. To serve, spoon the spaghetti into a large serving bowl and using a spatula, transfer the shrimp to the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately.

Shake and squeeze the contents of the bag to dissolve the honey and the brown sugar. Add the chicken drumsticks to the bag and seal with as little air as possible in the bag. Place in the refrigerator and marinate for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the chicken drumsticks on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until the skin is caramelized and very dark in spots, about 30 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, place the marinade in a small saucepan. Bring the marinade to a boil (in order to kill bacteria). Reduce the heat to simmer and cook over low heat until thick, about 15 minutes. Reserve. Use a pastry brush to brush some of the cooked marinade on the cooked chicken. Place the chicken on a serving platter. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and the chopped parsley. Cook&#39;s note: I like the rosemary and garlic flavors in the background. Brushing the cooked drumettes with the reduced marinade helps the flavors along. Also, re-moistening helps the parsley and the seeds to adhere. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 22034,&quot;Bacon-Apple-Jalapeno Pop &#39;Ems One 8-ounce package light cream cheese, at room temperature 3 large scallions, roots sliced off, green and white partsminced finely 1 large Granny Smith apple, cored and minced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 20 jalapenos 20 strips thin-sliced bacon, chopped in half Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment. In a large bowl, stir and break down the cream cheese until smooth. Add the scallions and apples, plus as much salt and freshly ground black pepper as you like. Don a pair of plastic gloves so you don&#39;t burn your fingers or your eyes like I did. Slice each jalapeno in half lengthwise, and then either slice out the membranes or use a measuring spoon to scoop them out. Discard the seeds. Either using a teaspoon or a small icing spatula, fill each jalapeno half with the cream cheese mixture; fill until just over the rim of the jalapeno. Wrap each pepper with a bacon half and secure with a toothpick. Line up the pop &#39;ems on the prepared baking sheet and pop into the oven until bacon has browned on the bottom, about 30 minutes.

Combine all of the ingredients, except the coffee extract, in a clean, dry small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer and bring to a boil over high heat. Without stirring, cook until the mixture reaches 305 degrees or \hard crack\ stage on the candy thermometer. (While the syrup is cooking, occasionally wash down the sides of the pan with a clean brush dipped in water, to prevent crystallization.) Half-fill a large bowl with ice water. When the mixture is done, remove the pot from the heat and dip it into the ice bath for 15 seconds to stop the cooking. Remove the pot from the ice bath and swirl in the coffee extract. To avoid air bubbles in the finished lollipops, stir the mixture gently in both directions, and be careful not to over mix. Pour the syrup into the molds, filling them 2/3 full or just pour the slightly cooled (so it&#39;s a little thickened) syrup in coin shapes at the ends of the cinnamon sticks. Cool at least 20 minutes, until hard. Remove from molds or from silpat. Store in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 22036,&quot;Mendiants 1 cup assorted nuts, chopped 1/4 cup light corn syrup 11 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered 1 cup cocoa nibs 1/3 cup assorted candied fruit, diced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the nuts and corn syrup in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over low heat to liquify the corn syrup. Heat the mixture until the corn syrup is thin enough to coat the nuts evenly, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Using a large slotted spoon, allow the excess corn syrup to drain as you scoop the coated nuts onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Be sure to spread them in an even layer so they will roast evenly in the oven. Bake until they are evenly caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. To test for doneness, you can also break a nut in half and check to see if it is light brown on the inside. Keep an eye on the nuts because the sugar will burn very soon after it caramelizes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place on a wire rack. When the nuts are completely cooled, break apart any that are clustered together. Fill a cornet halfway with bittersweet chocolate. Pipe a chocolate circle 1 1/2 inches in diameter onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. If you do not have a cornet, you can use a spoon; drop a spoonful of the chocolate onto the parchment paper and spread it into a 1 1/2-inch diameter circle with the back of the spoon. In either case, keep the thickness of the circle as even as possible. Make about 10 circles, then create your own design as you top each circle with the cocoa nibs, roasted nuts, and candied fruit. Work quickly, or the chocolate will set before you&#39;ve accomplished this. If the nuts and fruit do not stick to the chocolate, lightly dip them in the bowl of tempered chocolate and \glue\ them to the top of the disk. Repeat the process until you have used all of the bittersweet chocolate, nuts, and candied fruit. Set the Mendiants aside to harden until ready to serve. Serve side by side rather than in a pile. Store the Mendiants in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. How to Make a Cornet(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations. Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of one hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the two corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be one point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Pinot Noir]&quot; 22037,&quot;Mini Egg Salad Sandwiches 1 dozen large eggs 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> 2 tablespoons yellow mustard<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 10 slices white country bread<br> Instructions: In a large stockpot, cover the eggs with water so they are completely submerged and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat, cover and let the eggs cook in the water for 20 minutes. Pour the hot water off the eggs and replace with cold water. Let the eggs sit for 5 minutes. Crack and peel the eggs, place them in a plastic bag and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours or overnight. Using an egg slicer or a knife, finely chop the boiled eggs. Add to a large bowl. Add the mayonnaise, chives, mustard, salt and pepper and mix until blended. Spread the egg mixture on the bread and make sandwiches. Cut each sandwich into 3 wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22038,&quot;Gluten-Free Gravy 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Neck and giblets from a whole turkey (discard the liver; see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 stalks celery, each cut into 3 pieces 1 medium onion, sliced in half 1 large carrot, cut into 2-inch pieces 4 cups low-sodium chicken or turkey broth 4 sprigs fresh thyme 4 sprigs fresh parsley 1 sprig fresh rosemary 1 sprig fresh sage 1 dried bay leaf Turkey pan drippings from a roasted turkey (still in roasting pan) 1/2 cup sweet rice flour 1/2 cup dry white wine 1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the neck and giblets and cook until each side is deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Add the celery, onion and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the broth, thyme, parsley, rosemary, sage and bay leaf, then cover and reduce the heat to medium low. Simmer gently until the broth has reduced slightly and taken on more flavor, about 2 hours (this can be done while your turkey roasts). Use a slotted spoon to remove the neck, giblets, vegetables and herbs from the broth; discard the solids and reserve the broth. Pour the turkey pan drippings from the roasting pan into a liquid measuring cup or degreasing cup. Set aside to let the fat separate from the darker pan juices. This should take about 5 minutes. (Or put the measuring cup in the freezer to help the fat separate more quickly.) Once the drippings have separated, ladle off 1/2 cup of the fat from the top of the drippings and transfer to a small bowl; set aside. Skim off and discard any excess fat from the remaining drippings; reserve the drippings. Place the roasting pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Add the wine and cook, using a wooden spoon to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan, until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Pour the wine mixture into the hot broth. Return the roasting pan to medium-high heat and add the reserved fat to the pan. Scatter the rice flour evenly over the fat and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the flour browns slightly and smells toasty, about 4 minutes. Switch to a whisk; gradually and carefully ladle the hot broth mixture into the flour mixture while whisking constantly. The flour mixture will seize and become lumpy at first, but will even out as you continue to cook and whisk. Bring the gravy to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and add the reserved pan drippings to the gravy. Continue to simmer, whisking occasionally, until the gravy is thickened, about 5 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add the Worcestershire and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22039,&quot;Brioche 5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) One 1/4-ounce packet instant yeast 1/4 cup sugar 5 teaspoons kosher salt 1 cup whole milk 7 large eggs 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cubed and at room temperature, plus more for greasing<br> Instructions: Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook and mix on low speed to combine. Add the milk and 6 eggs and mix on low until well combined. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough starts to pull away from the sides, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium and start adding the butter, a little at a time and waiting until it is completely incorporated to add more, about 5 minutes. Return the mixer to medium-high and continue to mix until the dough is glossy and slightly tacky but not sticky, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, then cover with plastic and refrigerate 8 hours and up to overnight.<br> Generously butter two 9-by-5-inch nonstick loaf pans and divide the dough between them. Generously butter two pieces of plastic wrap large enough to cover the pans and place them butter-side down loosely over the pans. Let the dough rise until it comes to 1 inch above the rims of the pans, about 3 hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water. Remove the plastic wrap and brush the top of each loaf with the egg wash, then place the pans on the middle rack of the oven. Bake, rotating halfway through, until golden brown and the internal temperature of each loaf is 190 degrees F, about 30 minutes. Remove the pans to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes. Run a knife around the sides of the loaves to loosen and remove the loaves from the pan. Let cool completely on the rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22040,&quot;One-Pot Sausage Stew 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided 8 good-quality sausages (Italian style if possible) 1 onion, sliced into thin half-moons 1 carrot, finely chopped 1 stick celery, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, finely chopped 8 new potatoes, halved or quartered, skin on One 28-ounce can peeled plum tomatoes Two 15-ounce cans butter beans, drained and rinsed Sugar, to taste Crushed red pepper flakes, to taste One 5-ounce bag baby spinach 10 fresh basil leaves, cut into chiffonade Zest of 1 lemon Rosemary and Cheddar Soda Breads, recipe follows, for serving Neutral oil, for oiling the baking sheet, optional 1 1/4 cups whole-wheat flour 1 1/4 cups self-rising flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 packed cup grated Cheddar (grated on the large holes of a box grater) 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1 1/4 cups buttermilk Instructions: In a large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausages and sear on all sides until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside. Add the rest of the olive oil to the pot, turn the heat down to medium and add in the onions, carrots and celery. Add a pinch of salt, which will help draw some moisture out of the vegetables and keep them from browning too much. Cook gently, stirring often, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, being sure to scrape up all the caramelized sausage bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the garlic and rosemary and continue to sweat until the garlic is fragrant and translucent, about 5 minutes more. If the vegetables begin to brown, turn down the heat. Add in the sausages, potatoes and plum tomatoes, breaking apart the tomatoes with a wooden spoon or your hands as they go into the pot. Fill the empty tomato can halfway with water, then add this water to the pot. Stir well and let simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through, adding a few tablespoons of water if the sauce begins to look dry. Add in the butter beans and stir gently so as not to break up the beans. Taste the casserole and add salt, pepper, sugar and red pepper flakes to taste. Just before serving, add in the spinach and stir until just wilted. Plate into individual bowls and garnish with basil and lemon zest. Serve with the Rosemary and Cheddar Soda Breads. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or line with parchment paper. Sift the flours, baking soda and salt together in a bowl. Stir in the Cheddar and chopped rosemary. Make a well in the middle. Add the buttermilk and, using a fork, mix until just combined. This will give you a soft, sticky dough, which makes a nice moist loaf. With floured hands, divide the dough into 4, scrape each one onto the prepared baking sheet and pat into a light round. Using a chef&#39;s knife, deeply score each soda bread with a cross on top (this will allow the heat to penetrate the center of the dough). Bake until the breads are dark golden all over and sound hollow when you tap the bottoms, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 22041,&quot;Really Raspberry Sorbet Cocktail 1/2 pint raspberry sorbet 1/2 pint vanilla frozen yogurt 1/2 cup cran-raspberry juice 1 pint fresh raspberries 1/2 cup vodka, optional Instructions: Put all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.

Measure 5 inches across the top of the cake and cut down through the layers, creating 2 layered pieces that are slightly different sizes. Place the larger piece of cake cut-side down on a large platter or cake board. If using a rectangular cake board, place the larger piece so that the long edges are parallel with the long edges of the board. This is the body of the bunny. Cut the smaller piece of cake in half crosswise, so you have 2 layered wedges. Place one wedge in front of the body, with one flat side on the board and the other flat side against the body. The curved side will be on top. Take a serrated knife and round off the sharp edges on top of the head. Cut the tip off (the nose) at a 45-degree angle. Reserve all scraps in a bowl. Separate the layers of the remaining wedge of cake. These will be the back legs. Round the sharp edges of the cake wedges with your knife and add to the scrap bowl. Place one piece on each side of the bunny, with one flat side down and the other flat side facing forward (the round side towards the back of the bunny), about 1 inch from the end of the bunny&#39;s body. Mix the cake scraps in the bowl with a fork until mashed and then pack into a ball with your hands. Place the ball behind the bunny&#39;s body and adhere with a dab of frosting. This is the bunny&#39;s tail. Frost the entire bunny, tail and all, using 2 to 3 cups of the frosting, keeping some definition with the bunny parts and frosting more generously around any sharp edges to give a rounded look to the bunny parts. Sprinkle the bunny with the coconut to fully cover. Gently pat to adhere. Insert the biscotti between the head and body, pressing into the cake to secure them. These are the ears. Place the base of the ears close together at the center of the head and angle them out. Frost the front of each biscotti with some frosting. Then, using the pink decorating icing, frost a smaller strip in the center of each biscotti, going down to where the ears meet the head but not going all the way to the top. To make the face, press a black jelly bean into each side of the head for the eyes. Cut one of the marshmallows into 3 circles, discard the middle piece and press the 2 end circles, cut-sides in, into the front of the face for the bunny cheeks. Push the white jelly bean halves into the face below the cheeks, round-sides out, for the teeth. Place the pink jelly bean above for the nose. Unroll the licorice wheel and cut 2 pieces, each about 1 1/2 inches long. For each piece, peel the strips apart halfway down and then cut each separated strip in half lengthwise so you end up with a piece looking a bit like a broom. Repeat with the second piece of licorice. Tuck each piece, with a dab of frosting, behind a marshmallow cheek, with the cut ends facing out for the whiskers. Cut the second marshmallow in half lengthwise. Make 3 slits in each half, going about halfway through (these are the toes), and place in front of the legs for the bunny&#39;s feet. Adhere the bottom of the feet with frosting if necessary. Combine the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium-high and mix until smooth. Adjust the consistency with milk as desired. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two 10-inch round cake pans with baking spray. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes. While you are beating your butter, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a separate bowl. Beat the eggs into the butter mixture, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to medium low; beat in half the flour mixture, then all of the milk, then the remaining flour mixture until just combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Transfer the pans to a rack and let cool 10 minutes, then invert the cake layers onto a wire rack and cool completely before decorating. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22044,&quot;Spaghetti and No-Meat Balls 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3/4 cup finely diced onion Pinch sea salt, plus 1/2 teaspoon and more to taste 2 cups thinly sliced mushrooms, about 4 ounces 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 (14-ounce) package extra firm tofu, drained and crumbled 1 large egg 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley leaves Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Simple and Quick Tomato Sauce, to serve, recipe follows Spaghetti, to serve 1 (28-ounce) can organic plum tomatoes with juice 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano Freshly ground black pepper 1 small clove garlic, peeled and crushed 6 large basil leaves Instructions: In a medium skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook until softened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Raise the heat to high and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms have given off their juices and are lightly caramelized, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to the work bowl of a food processor. Add the tofu, egg and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pulse to combine. Add the bread crumbs and parsley and pulse to combine again. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and season with plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Spread the flour on a plate. Moisten your hands with water and form the tofu mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Lightly coat the balls in flour and put them onto a baking sheet or large plate. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add the balls and cook them until browned all over, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Add the tomato sauce to the pan and simmer until the balls are firm and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Serve with your favorite pasta. Put all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor and pulse to form a rough puree with flecks of basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 22045,&quot;Vietnamese Hot Dog 1 to 1 1/2 pounds ground meat (chicken, turkey, pork or beef) 2 tablespoons fish sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon spicy chili powder Instructions: Mix the ground meat, fish sauce, olive oil, cornstarch, sugar, and chili, if using, together. Mix well and freeze for 1 hour to marinate. Then pour into a mixer. Blend well until smooth. Using a tablespoon, scoop out a spoonful of mixture and place on a small piece of plastic wrap. Roll to cover, shaping into a \hotdog\ and twisting at the ends to close. Place plastic covered hot dog onto a small piece of foil, rolling again to cover the plastic completely. Tie the ends closed with kitchen string or cooking plastic wrap. Repeat until all the ground meat mixture is rolled.

Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack 5 eggs into the hole and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil and salt. Using the fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture; be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading, it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let it rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately, do not refrigerate. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the onion, a pinch of crushed red pepper and kosher salt to taste. Saute the onion until translucent, 5 minutes. Add the sausage and break it up with a spoon. Cook, stirring occasionally, 7 to 8 minutes or until the sausage is browned. Add the sage and stir to combine, then deglaze the pan with the white wine and reduce until the wine has cooked off, 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it cool down slightly. Add the ricotta, 1 cup of Parmesan and the remaining egg into a large bowl. Mix well to combine. Add the sausage mixture into the ricotta and mix to combine. Scoop the ricotta and sausage mixture into a pastry bag and set aside. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a large saute pan and turn on the heat to low. Add the pancetta and gently cook to slowly render the fat, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is crispy and most of the fat has rendered out, 10 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes, 1/2 cup of chicken stock, a pinch of crushed red pepper and kosher salt to taste. Cook on a gentle simmer until the cherry tomatoes have softened and burst and the sauce has reduced, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of chicken stock and continue to cook until the sauce has slightly thickened, another 5 or so minutes. Unwrap the pasta dough and cut off one third, keeping the larger piece covered. Using your hands, flatten the dough and sprinkle it with a little flour. Pass the dough through the pasta roller on the widest setting (mine is #1), then fold each end towards the center in thirds, like an envelope. Dust with more flour, then pass through the machine again. Repeat this process 3 to 4 times, folding the dough and flouring each time. Decrease the width to #2 and pass through the machine. Fold again and dust with flour. Continue to #3 and repeat, just folding and flouring once until you\u2019ve reached #5. Lay the pasta sheet onto your board and arrange some basil leaves on one half of the sheet. Fold the dough in half to cover the basil leaves, dust with more flour, then pass through the machine one more time on the thinnest setting (mine is #6), so the basil leaves become part of the pasta dough sheet. Set aside and cover. Repeat with the remaining dough and basil leaves. Place the sheets of dough onto a floured surface. Lightly brush the lower half of each strip (the part closest to you) with water. Snip the corner off the pastry bag. Pipe 1-inch mounds of filling, 1 inch apart, onto the middle to lower half of each strip. Fold the dough over the filling to meet the bottom edge that\u2019s brushed with water. Press around each ball of filling with your index fingers, making sure there are no air bubbles. Cut out the agnolotti using a fluted pasta wheel. Transfer to a baking sheet dusted with semolina. Set up a large pot of boiling water and generously season with kosher salt. It should be as salty as the sea. Add the agnolotti and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cooked agnolotti directly from the boiling water into the sauce along with 1/4 cup of the pasta water. Toss to combine until the pasta is nicely coated. Add 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, most of the sliced basil (leave a bit for garnish) and a big fat drizzle of nice extra-virgin olive oil and toss to combine. Plate, then garnish with more Parmesan and sliced basil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 22048,&quot;Italian Braised Beef with Root Vegetables 1/4 cup olive oil 1 large Spanish onion, finely diced<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt, or more as needed<br> 6 cloves garlic, sliced<br> Two 28-ounce cans San Marzano tomatoes, with their juice<br> 2 pounds meaty beef bones<br> 1 cup dry white wine<br> 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves<br> 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 3 pounds rump roast Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 carrot, cut into 1-inch chunks<br> 1 small celery root, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks<br> 1 onion, coarsely chopped<br> 2 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 1 cup red wine<br> 2 cups Yia Yia&#39;s Sunday Sauce 2 bay leaves, preferably fresh<br> 1 1/2 pounds dried rigatoni, for serving<br> Instructions: For Yia Yia&#39;s Sunday sauce: Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan or large Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown the beef bones. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 2 minutes. Add the salt and garlic and cook until everything is soft but not browned, about 3 minutes. Squeeze the tomatoes one by one into the pan, pulverizing them by hand, and pour in their juice, too. Add the wine, oregano, red pepper flakes, if using, black pepper and bay leaf. Bring the sauce to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to its lowest possible setting, and continue to cook for 8 hours. The sauce should reduce by about one-third. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary. Remove the bones and bay leaf. Set aside 2 cups. If not using the remaining sauce right away, let it cool, then cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. Yield: 8 cups. For the braised beef with root vegetables: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Sprinkle the meat liberally with salt and pepper as much as 1 day in advance. (Cover and refrigerate it if doing so and take the meat out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.) Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. When the oil is on the verge of smoking, sear the meat for about 2 minutes per side. Move the meat to the side (or remove it from the pot altogether if necessary), and add the carrots, celery root and onions. Brown the vegetables for about 3 minutes, and then add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer. Pour in the wine and deglaze the pot, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom. Add Yia Yia&#39;s Sunday Sauce, 1 cup water and the bay leaves (and the pot roast if you removed it). Bring the liquid to a simmer and taste for seasoning. Add more salt if necessary. Cover the pot and place it in the oven for 3 hours, basting the meat occasionally during cooking time. When almost ready to serve, make the rigatoni, if using. Boil in salted water according to package directions until al dente. Discard the bay leaves before serving. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and slice into bite-size pieces, or shred with 2 forks. Return the meat to the pot of sauce along with the drained rigatoni. Toss to coat, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 22049,&quot;Turkey Cutlets: Chuletas de Pavo 2 cups finely chopped red onion 1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1 cup olive oil 1 (6 pound) turkey breast Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the onions, cilantro, parsley, red wine vinegar, and olive oil.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites on medium speed with the whisk attachment until the whites become foamy. Add the cream of tartar and turn up the speed to medium, beating until just fluffy. Add the sugar gradually, while whisking, so it incorporates into the whites slowly without collapsing them. Once all the sugar has been added, add the vanilla and increase the speed to high, whisking until the meringue is firm and glossy, 5 to 7 minutes. Place the meringue into a piping bag with a medium-size round tip attached. Pipe 48 bite-size tear-drop-shaped meringues onto the sheets and place in the oven. Bake for 1 hour undisturbed, and then turn off the heat and leave in the oven overnight to really dry out. Melt the chocolate over a double-boiler or in the microwave on medium power for 30 seconds. Holding each meringue by the peak, dip the bases in chocolate so the bottom half of the meringue is coated. Let any excess chocolate drip off before placing on a baking sheet lined with wax paper.

You can also use a traditional steamer that has 2 layers. Add the ginger, lime leaves, citrus zest, cilantro, scallions, white wine, jalapeno, and peanut oil. Season well with salt. Bring back to a boil and cook for 10 minutes for the flavors to combine. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Place the first layer of the bamboo steamer over the pot. Line the steamer with the cabbage leaves, making sure that the surface is not completely covered so the steam can get through. Lay the fish, skin-side up, on the cabbage leaves. Cover and steam for 1 minute. Place the bok choy on the second layer of the bamboo steamer in 1 layer. Uncover the steamer and place the bok choy layer on top of the fish. Cover and steam for about 5 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked through and the bok choy is tender, but still has some crispness. Check the fish for doneness by gently inserting a fork into it. If the fork slides easily in, the fish is done. If the fork resists sliding in, it is not quite done. Remove the fish and bok choy and keep warm while you make the sauce. Heat a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the peanut oil and heat. When the oil is hot, add the ginger, garlic, and jalapeno and saute until just translucent, about 3 minutes. Do not allow the vegetables to brown. Add 4 ounces of the steaming liquid and the soy sauce and boil for 2 minutes. Do not season with salt as the soy sauce is salty. Add the sugar and boil for 1 minute, or until the sugar is completely dissolved. Lower the heat and whisk in the butter. Add the scallion whites, stir, and remove from the heat.

The butter should be very hot, but not sizzling (between 165 and 180 degrees F). Add the tails to the pan, meat side down - shell side up, and poach until the lobster is opaque. Remove to a utility platter and let cool. (Pour the melted butter into a bowl for use in other elements in this recipe.) Return 2 tablespoons of the reserved melted butter to the same saute pan and saute shallots and shiitake mushrooms until tender. Add crabmeat and scallions and heat for a few minutes, trying to avoid breaking up lumps. Set aside. Return to the lobster tails, loosen them from the shell. Reserve the shells for use in the sauce. Slice the tail meat lengthwise down the middle and into 4 slices crosswise. For the wrappers: Steam the cabbage leaves until tender but not mushy. Remember, the leaves will still have to be firm enough support the lobster filling. To begin the sauce: Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves, nutmeg, and lobster shells in a heavy-gauge, non-corrosive saucepan over medium heat. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the reserved melted butter (from poaching the lobster) into a separate heat resistant bowl and create a slurry with the cornstarch, then whisk in 1/4 cup Parmesan. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the slurry, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, add cognac, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf, cloves and lobster shells. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Gently fold the lobster and crabmeat together with just enough of the sauce to bind it. (Reserve the rest of the sauce for service.) If the filling seems loose, add more Parmesan to bind it. (You don&#39;t want the filling to be too runny.) Lay the cabbage leaves out and remove stiff ribs/spines of leaves being sure to leave enough of the leaf in a shape that can be filled and rolled shut. Into each leaf, spoon 3 or 4 tablespoons of the lobster/crabmeat mixture, add a few chunks of avocado, fold in sides of leaf, and roll up. Place in an oven-proof dish layered on the bottom with a little of the sauce, sprinkle with a little Parmesan. Bake for 10 minutes to melt cheese. Serve garnished with fresh dill and with remaining lobster sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 22078,&quot;Shrimp Cocktail with Rocoto cl Dipping Sauce 1 1/2 cups prepared chili sauce (store bought) 1 1/2 cups ketchup 1 lemon, juiced, plus 2 lemons, halved 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup prepared horseradish 2 tablespoon rocoto Peruvian cl paste 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro 4 tablespoons pickling spices 2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce Salt and freshly ground black pepper 10 (jumbo or U-10 size) shrimp, peeled and deveined, with tail still attached Instructions: Prepare the cocktail sauce in a large bowl.

Allow to cool. Prepare the buttercream and equally divide into two bowls. Add the yellow food coloring to one bowl and mix until fully combined; set aside. Take the other bowl and equally divide again (into two bowls of frosting). One bowl should be tinted orange; the other should remain white. When ready to assemble, place the frostings into plastic disposable pastry bags (or resealable plastic bags). Starting with the yellow frosting, cut about 2 inches from the tip of the bag and pipe out a circle on top of a cupcake. Fill in any holes so that the frosting is even and level. Do this to all of the cupcakes. Next, grab your orange frosting and cut off approximately 2 inches from the tip of the bag. Pipe out a smaller circle on top of the yellow frosting. Repeat on all cupcakes. You should now have the yellow and orange layers done. Finally, grab your white frosting and cut off approximately 2 inches from the tip of the bag. Pipe a dollop of frosting and then pull your hand up quickly and release pressure. This should create a nice pointed tip at the top of your cupcake. Repeat this on the remaining cupcakes. Put the cupcakes in the fridge for about an hour, or until they have had a chance to set. After the cupcakes have chilled, prepare your chocolate coating: Place the chocolate and shortening in a microwave-safe bowl and set in the microwave for one minute, then remove and stir. If the chocolate is not completely melted, place back in the microwave for 15 seconds. Remove and stir until melted and smooth. Pour the chocolate into a drinking glass, one with a mouth wide enough for you to invert the cupcakes into. Let cool about 15 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the fridge. Pick up one cupcake and dip it frosting-side down into the chocolate, going all the way to the top of the cupcake liner. Lift up and let the excess drip off, then set the cupcake on a cookie sheet. Repeat this with the remaining cupcakes. Allow the chocolate to harden, which only takes a few minutes. Serve and enjoy the excited faces of the lucky recipients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 22083,&quot;Quinoa Dessert Pudding 1/2 cup raisins 1/2 cup dark rum 2 cups quinoa, rinsed, well drained 2 cups whole milk 11/3 cups whipping cream 11/3 cups sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 3 large egg yolks Additional ground cinnamon (for garnish) Instructions: Combine raisins and rum in pot.

Add crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer about 20 minutes, checking periodically to make sure the sauce doesn&#39;t burn.<br> Boil the lasagne noodles until al dente, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Toss with olive oil so the noodles don&#39;t stick together. Let cool.<br> This lasagne will have 4 layers but 2 different types of cheese layers. One cheese layer will consist of mascarpone, ricotta, Parmesan and egg to bind. Combine these 4 ingredients in a bowl and set aside briefly. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Layer 4 to 5 lasagne noodles lengthwise side by side in an ovenproof lasagne dish with edges overlapping. Top with half of the mascarpone/ricotta cheese mixture. (It is easiest to drop evenly spaced spoonfuls of this over the noodles, and then spread it out.) Distribute half of the fresh basil and half of the fresh oregano over the cheese, then layer another 4 or 5 lasagne noodles over the cheese in the same fashion as the first layer of noodles.<br> The second layer of cheese will consist of provolone and mozzarella. Spread half of the provolone cheese slices over the second layer of noodles and sprinkle with half of the mozzarella. Repeat the process with the noodles, remaining mascarpone/ricotta and noodles for the third layer. For the last layer, spread out the remaining noodles, top with remaining provolone, but then ladle the tomato sauce over and finish with the remaining mozzarella.<br> Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, remove and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Chianti]&quot; 22096,&quot;Grilled Mustard Barbecue Chicken Wings 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar 2 teaspoons paprika 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon garlic powder 2 1/2 pounds chicken wings, split, tips removed Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for the grill 1/2 cup mustard barbecue sauce Coleslaw, cornbread and/or watermelon, for serving Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium.

Add the limes cut-side down and cook until deeply charred, 5 to 8 minutes. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil, rice vinegar, honey, grated ginger, soy sauce and fish sauce. Season with salt and pepper, then set aside. Add the frying oil to a cast-iron skillet large enough so the oil comes no more than halfway up the skillet sides. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the jalapeno and 2-inch piece ginger to the oil. Place the fish on a cutting board and pat dry with paper towels. Make slashes crosswise on a diagonal along the body of the fish every 2 inches on both sides, cutting all the way down to the bone. Season the fish generously inside and out with salt. Mix together the rice flour, coriander, lime zest and 1 tablespoon salt in a shallow bowl. Dredge the fish in the seasoned rice flour. When the oil is 350 degrees F, grip a fish firmly by the tail and carefully lower head-first into the skillet, making sure to lay it down away from you. Repeat with the other fish. Fry until the flesh on the bottom side is cooked through and the skin is deeply browned and crisp, about 4 minutes. While the fish are frying, baste the inside of the heads with hot oil periodically. Use tongs and a fish spatula to carefully turn both fish over. Fry until the flesh on the second side is cooked through and the skin is deeply browned and crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and season both sides with more salt. To serve: Place both fish on a platter. Spoon the ginger vinaigrette over the top and around the fish. Garnish with cilantro and scallions and place the grilled limes around the edges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 22100,&quot;Slow-Cooker Pork Chops 4 boneless pork loin chops (about 1 inch thick) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup whole-grain mustard 2 tablespoons honey 1 small shallot 1 large Pink Lady or Fuji apple Cooked grits or buttered rice, for serving, optional Instructions: Lay the pork chops on a rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle both sides of each chop with salt and pepper.

In a food processor blend nuts, sugar, cayenne pepper, salt, lime zest and juice and rosemary. Evenly spread this mixture over the pastry sheets. Starting from each end roll the pastry towards the center creating 2 spirals that touch in the center. Repeat with second pastry sheet. Wrap both in plastic wrap and place in freezer until ready to cook. (These can be stored in the freezer for weeks.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and set the racks in the upper and lower parts of the oven. Cut the palmiers into 3/4-inch slices and place on 2 parchment lined baking sheets. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown, switching pans halfway through. Remove from oven and let cool a few minutes before removing to racks to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22104,&quot;Toffee Chip Bars 2 1/4 cups flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 sticks butter, softened 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 cups crushed chocolate coated toffee bars (heath bars) 1 cup chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cover the glass with a shaker, shake well, and then let rest in the shaker. Prepare Bloody Mary mix (but with no garnish). Drop one raw oyster into a shot glass. Fill the glass half way with Bloody Mary mix. Add a splash of vodka on top. Chill glasses on crusted ice. Serve immediately. Rinse the peppers with cold water and dry them with a paper towel. Remove the stems and chop them coarsely. Place the chopped peppers in a stainless bowl, sprinkle the salt on top, stir, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a cool, dry area for 2 days, stirring every 12 hours. All that salt is there mostly to promote ripening of the peppers. Add the vinegar, and puree with a hand blender or in a food processor. Place in a sterilized glass jar with a fresh, sterilized lid, and refrigerate. As time goes by, whenever you have an excess of ripe peppers, remove stems, chop and add to the jar. (The salting step isn&#39;t necessary for these additions.) When the jar is filled, remove the sauce, puree if you wish, place it in a clean jar, and age it until it reaches the desired flavor ? at least 2 months, or longer. Use as the hot sauce in many recipes. Note: Use rubber gloves when handling hot peppers, or wash your hands thoroughly before touching your eyes or skin.

Then transfer to a thick-bottomed saucepot over medium-low heat. Allow the sauce to warm, and mix over the heat for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring throughout the time. Then remove and cool until usage. For the spice rub: In a bowl, mix the salt, ground mustard, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, white pepper, seafood seasoning and cumin together with a spoon. After mixing, keep dry and covered. To prep the ribs, remove the silver skin from the bottom side of the ribs. Then evenly rub each rack with 1/4 cup of the spice rub on top and bottom. Wrap each rack in plastic wrap and keep overnight in the refrigerator or cooler. To smoke the ribs, heat a smoker with pecan or other fruit wood, bringing the smoker or pit to 165 degrees F and maintaining temperature. Once the temperature is obtained, remove the plastic and place the ribs in the smoker for 4 hours, keeping for doneness at this point. The ribs should be cooked, but not falling off the bone.<br> To glaze the ribs, remove them from the pit and glaze each rack with 1/2 cup of the BBQ sauce. Then return to the pit for 30 to 40 minutes. Again, remove and glaze with additional 1/2 cup sauce and finish for a final 20 minutes in the pit. After the second glaze and final cooking, remove the ribs from the pit. Allow to rest for 5 minutes, and then cut into single or double bone sections and serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 22111,&quot;Peppers with Feta and Almonds 8 red or yellow peppers, or a mixture of both 4 ounces feta cheese Couple squeezes lemon juice 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 cup blanched or sliced almonds 2 tablespoons freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Peeling peppers is a time-consuming and fiddly job, but it isn&#39;t difficult - and this is a distinction that&#39;s important to remember. Like most tasks of this order, culinary or otherwise, the space it takes up in your head is greater than the actual demands of the activity, but if the idea of charring and then peeling 8 peppers really appalls, then don&#39;t do it. The world is not going to fall apart if you buy a jar of ready-peeled and oil-softened peppers, nor do you lose the right to occupy your own kitchen if you ignore my suggestion altogether. Make a tomato salad; buy some tabbouleh from the deli. But meanwhile at stately Wayne mansion, preheat the broiler as hot as you can get it, and then sit the peppers on a rack below. When the skin turns black and blistery, turn them; you want to char them on every side. You can do this also, if you&#39;ve got a gas stove, just by holding them with a long fork over the burner, but it can get tiresome to say the least. When the peppers are black and charred, remove them (trying not to burn yourself) to a large bowl and cover immediately with plastic wrap. Leave for 10 to 20 minutes. Then uncover and, 1 by 1, peel and remove the seeds. Don&#39;t get worried if the odd bit of skin (or indeed seed) remains. Cut or tear into wider chunks/strips (I don&#39;t like this too dinky) and arrange on a large plate. Crumble over the feta, then squeeze over lemon juice and drizzle with oil. Scatter over the almonds and sprinkle on the parsley - and that, frankly, is it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 22112,&quot;Grilled Lamb and Feta Burgers 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb 2 cloves garlic, finely minced 1/2 pound feta cheese, crumbled 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/3 cup fresh parsley leaves, coarsely chopped Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 4 to 6 rolls or buns Easy Tzatziki, recipe follows 1 cup Greek whole milk yogurt 1 English cucumber, seeded, finely grated and drained 2 cloves garlic, finely minced 1 teaspoon lemon zest plus 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the lamb, garlic, feta, allspice, parsley, salt and pepper, making sure not to overwork the mixture. Form the lamb mixture into 4 to 6 patties. Heat a grill pan over moderately-high heat and cook the lamb burgers until a nice crust forms, about 4 minutes. Turn the burgers over and let cook another 4 minutes. Let the burgers rest 10 minutes. Serve topped with Easy Tzatziki on a roll or bun. In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and dill. Season with salt and pepper. Chill. What Really Makes This Recipe Sing: Allspice is one of those secret weapons in savory foods. You can&#39;t put your finger on it, but you know it is there. It was named by the English, because they thought it contained cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Shh, it is also the secret ingredient in Cincinnati-style chili. What to toss in if you have it: Feel free to add some chopped fresh mint to this as well. Having a cocktail party? BYOC and makes these into mini&#39;s.

Puree cottage cheese in food processor until very smooth. Add the cream cheese and sugar and cream together. Combine egg, egg whites, vanilla, lemon juice, and salt in a separate bowl. Slowly add to the cheese mixture and continue processing, being careful not to over mix. Fold in the chocolate chips. Mix together the graham cracker crumbs and butter in a bowl. Press crumb mixture into a 10-inch springform pan. Carefully spoon the batter on top of the crust and place the pan in a water bath. Bake until the cheesecake has set and is firm to the touch, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until chilled through, at least 4 hours. Once the cake cools, slice into 20 wedges and top each wedge with a dollop of low-fat crme anglaise. Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl. Heat a small saucepan filled halfway with water over medium heat. Place the bowl with the ingredients on top of the pan to create a double boiler. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until thickened, whisking occasionally. When the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon without running off, then it is finished.

Meanwhile, cook pasta until it is just barely tender, a little less cooked than it would be to serve it. Drain, reserving some cooking water. Add pasta to vegetables and continue to cook, adding water as necessary to keep mixture moist. Taste, and add more lavender to taste; it should be distinctive but not too strong. When pasta and vegetables are tender but not mushy, adjust seasoning for salt and pepper, garnish with a couple of lavender flowers if you have them, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 22119,&quot;No-Yeast Peanut Butter Bread Nonstick cooking spray or softened butter, for greasing 1 1/3 cups milk<br> 1/2 cup peanut butter<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup peanut butter chips<br> Three 1.55-ounce chocolate bars, such as Hershey&#39;s Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper and grease with nonstick cooking spray. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the cake mix, oil, vanilla liquor, espresso powder, vanilla extract, salt, eggs and 1 cup water. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, and then on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl with a spatula occasionally. Pour the batter evenly into the cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 28 to 30 minutes. Cool the cakes for 20 minutes in the pans, then turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. For the caramel glass: Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Place the granulated sugar and vanilla liquor in a small saucepan and cook, without stirring, until the mixture is a deep amber color, about 5 minutes. Pour the caramel onto the prepared baking sheet and allow to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, break into shards. For the Tuscan buttercream: Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment until light and smooth, about 1 minute. Add the powdered sugar, vanilla liquor, vanilla extract and salt and beat on low until combined, about 30 seconds; increase the speed to medium and beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Assembly: Place one of the cakes flat-side up on a cake stand, leveling the top of the cake with a serrated knife if necessary. Using a spatula, spread 1/4 cup of the buttercream evenly over the cake, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Place the other cake layer on top and frost the entire cake with the remaining buttercream, using the tip of the spatula to make decorative swirls in the buttercream. Press the chopped espresso beans around the outside of the cake and garnish the top with caramel glass. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Dolcetto, Montepulciano]&quot; 22122,&quot;Chicken and Andouille Smoked Sausage Gumbo (Creole Stew) 1 cup finely chopped onion 1 cup finely chopped green bell pepper 2 pounds okra, chopped 3/4 cup finely chopped celery 1 1/4 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper Vegetable oil 1 1/2 quarts chicken stock 1 cup chopped tomatoes 2 cups tomato juice 1 tablespoon file powder 1/2 pound andouille sausage 1 teaspoon minced garlic Cooked rice, for serving Instructions: In a bowl, combine the onions, bell peppers, okra and celery; set aside. Combine all but 1/2 cup of the flour, the salt, garlic powder, and red pepper in a plastic bag, add the chicken pieces and shake until chicken is well coated. In large heavy skillet heat 1 1/2-inches of oil until very hot (375 degrees F.) Fry the chicken until the crust is brown on both sides and meat is cooked, about 5 to 8 minutes per side; drain on paper towels. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the hot oil into a cup, leaving as many brown particles in the pan as possible. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any stuck particles, then return 1/2 cup of the hot oil to the pan. Place the pan over high heat. Using a long handled whisk, gradually stir in remaining flour. Cook, whisking constantly, until a roux is formed and is a dark red-brown. Remove from heat and add the reserved vegetable mixture, stirring constantly until the roux stops getting darker. Return to a low heat and cook until the vegetables are soft. In a separate large pot, bring the chicken stock to a boil. Add the roux by spoonfuls to the boiling stock, stirring between each addition. Reduce to a simmer and add the andouille and remaining ingredients, except file powder. Simmer for 45 minutes. While gumbo is simmering, bone the cooked chicken and cut meat into 1/2-inch dice. Add to the gumbo. Add file powder 5 minutes before serving and continue to simmer for 5 minutes.

To make the rub, put the garlic in the food processor and pulse to get it started. Add the oregano, parsley, thyme, sage, anchovies, and giardiniera, salt and pepper, lemon zest and juice. Pulse together. Add the oil and pulse some more until it forms a paste. To butterfly your pork, place the meat fat cap side down on your cutting board. Using a super sharp knife, slice the pork lengthwise parallel to the counter, starting about an inch above the fat cap. Slice along the meat so that it unrolls as you cut along. Try to cut it so that the meat touching the counter as it unrolls is uniformly thick. Make smaller slashes in any thicker spots. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Rub the herb-anchovy mixture all over the inside of the pork. Roll it up and, using butcher&#39;s twine, tie it very tightly about every two inches. Score any visible fat in a crosshatch pattern and season the outside with salt and pepper. Place the pork onto a roasting rack in a roasting pan, fat cap side facing up. Pour 1 cup of water in the bottom of the pan to keep the drippings from burning. Roast until super fork tender and \pullable\ and the internal temp registers 200 degrees F, about 4 1/2 to 5 hours. Take out and let rest for at least 20 minutes. Pour the liquid and renderings from the roasting pan into a small saucepan and simmer over medium heat until slightly reduced. Season to taste.

In a medium oven-proof frying pan over high heat, add the oil and butter and stir to combine. Add garlic and thyme and cook until the butter is slightly browned. Add the chicken, skin side, down and let it sit in the pan so the skin becomes crispy and golden. While the skin is crisping up, spoon the hot butter/oil over the thighs. Once the skin is crisp, about 5 minutes, and releases from the pan easily, turn the chicken over. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes to sear the meat. Put in the oven and roast for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Depending on how large the thighs are, check for doneness.<br> Potatoes:<br> Have an ice bath ready before beginning. Bring a medium stockpot of salted water to boil over medium heat. Blanch each of the varieties of potatoes and carrots; starting with the fingerlings, Yukon gold, carrots and purple Peruvians last. Cook each batch until tender, but still with a little bite. After blanching each set of vegetables, use a strainer remove all of the vegetables out of the water and dunk them in the ice water bath. Once they are cold to the touch, drain and set aside. Right before serving, get a medium fry pan heated over high heat, add the a little oil and some butter.

When the butter has melted, add the onions, garlic and shallots. Cook slowly to soften and bring out the flavors. Do not burn the garlic. Reduce the heat to low if the mixture starts to brown. Stir in the Sauvignon Blanc and allow it to reduce by half. Add the chicken stock and continue cooking at a simmer to reduce again by half. Taste the jus and if it seems a bit too tart and sharp, add more butter to smooth it out. (If you want to make the jus into a thicker sauce, you can add some heavy cream.) Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. When the jus is ready, add the 1/4 cup parsley and 1/2 cup chives right before serving to maintain the bright green color.<br> Assembly:<br> Put a large serving spoon of heated, seasoned potatoes and carrots in the center of each serving plate, letting some of them spill to the edges.

Add the tomato puree to the warm mashed potatoes and over low heat, stir with a wooden spoon until the tomatoes are completely incorporated and the mixture is piping hot. Serve. Place the potatoes in a 2-quart saucepan with 1 teaspoon of the salt and cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer, covered, until completely tender, about 30 minutes. Test the potatoes by piercing them with a paring knife -- there should be no resistance. Place in a colander and allow to drain well for several minutes. Combine the butter, heavy cream and milk in another saucepan and heat gently until the butter has melted. Keep warm. Working with the saucepan used to cook the potatoes, pass the potatoes through a food mill or a potato ricer. If you have any difficulty, add a little of the hot milk and butter to the potatoes. To serve, place the potatoes over a low fame and begin adding the warm milk mixture. Whip the potatoes with a wooden spoon or spatula while heating. When all the liquid is absorbed, season with the remaining salt and white pepper. Serve piping hot. Mashed potatoes are best served immediately, but if you are unable to do so, or need them for another recipe, keep the potatoes hot for up to 1 hour by placing them in the top of a double boiler, covered, and held over barely simmering water. Place the tomatoes cut side up on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with the salt and let sit for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Roast the tomatoes for 5 to 6 hours. The tomatoes are done when they are dried but still slightly plump, they should definitely not be leathery, nor as dry as commercial sun-dried tomatoes. Allow the tomatoes to cool to room temperature, then transfer them to a jar or bowl. Stir in the olive oil, herbs, and garlic, cover tightly and refrigerate. The tomatoes will improve if marinated 2 to 3 days before using. They will keep for up to 2 weeks stored in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22163,&quot;Pepper Steak Skewers 2 pounds flank steak 2 tablespoons Montreal steak seasoning 1 12-ounce jar roasted red peppers, halved 1 cup shredded pepper jack cheese 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning 1/2 cup plain yogurt 1/2 tablespoon hot sauce 1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium.

Cut into 3 equal rectangles.<br> Lay out each steak rectangle. Season with 1 tablespoon steak seasoning. Lay a piece of the roasted red pepper along the bottom edge of each. Sprinkle each with 1/3 cup cheese. Starting at the bottom edge, roll each rectangle into a tight log. Place the 3 rolls parallel to one another. Pierce the 3 rolls with 6 evenly spaced skewers so each skewer goes through the center of all rolls. Slice the rolls between the skewers to make 6 skewers with 3 pieces on each.

Add the sriracha, a little at a time, adding more to your taste. For the pickle mix: Stir together the chopped pickles and grainy mustard. Set aside. For the burgers: Put the meat in a large bowl and spread it all over the bottom and a little up the sides. This will help distribute the seasoning evenly throughout the meat. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Stir in the mayonnaise.<br> Test the seasoning by taking a tiny piece of the meat mixture and forming it into a patty. Set a small skillet over medium heat, add a touch of oil and sear the patty on each side. Let cool slightly and taste. If it needs more salt and pepper, add it to the raw mixture. Repeat the test as needed.<br> Divide the meat into 8 equal patties (3 ounces each) and roll each into a ball. Place the balls on a clean surface and use the palm of your hand to gently flatten to 3/4-inch thick and 2 to 3 inches in diameter. Alternatively, use a round cookie cutter to mold the burgers into uniform \rounds\ by pressing the meat into the mold and making the burgers one by one. Make an indent in the middle of each patty (as the meat cooks the center of the patty will puff up; this will keep the thickness even).<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat and add just enough canola oil to coat the bottom. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, add the burgers in a single layer with space in between each, cooking in batches if needed. Press the patties down with a metal spatula so they are fairly thin and cook, undisturbed, until the edges brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip using a metal spatula and place a slice of cheese on top of each to melt as the burgers finish cooking. Cook to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes longer.<br> Place the bun halves on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until light brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Place a dollop of spicy mayonnaise on the bottom halves but don&#39;t spread it around. Top with the hamburgers followed by pickle mix, more spicy mayo, and another hamburger. Finish with more pickle mix, spicy mayo and the top buns.

Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-sized bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture.<br> Alternatively, make the dough in a food processor. With the machine fitted with the metal blade, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-sized bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand.<br> Form the dough into a disk, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.<br> On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough with a rolling pin into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan and trim the edges, leaving about an extra inch hanging over the edge. Tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to form a thick edge that is even with the rim. Flute the edge as desired. Freeze the pie shell for 30 minutes.<br> Set separate racks in the center and lower third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Put a piece of parchment paper or foil over the pie shell and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on a baking sheet on the center rack until the dough is set, about 20 minutes.

With a sturdy wooden spoon, stir until the mixture is combined and has a silky-smooth texture without any lumps. Place the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring continuously with the wooden spoon, until the mixture starts to solidify and thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Once it thickens, use the spoon to knead the fufu in the pot until it starts to pull away from the sides of the pot and becomes one mass, about 2 minutes Add 1/3 cup water to the fufu, cover with a lid or aluminum foil and bring the water to a boil. Remove the lid and use the wooden spoon to continuously knead the fufu in the pot until the water cooks off. Continue to knead for 1 minute more. Repeat the process of adding water and kneading 2 more times. To test for doneness, dip the wooden spoon in water and gently touch it to the fufu. The fufu should have a glossy appearance and should not stick to the spoon. If it is still sticky, make another addition of water and knead it until the water is absorbed. Then test the fufu with a wet spoon again. Line a medium plate with plastic wrap and sprinkle it with cold water. Dip the wooden spoon in water, then use it to scoop the fufu onto the plastic wrap. Mold the fufu into a ball by twisting the 4 ends of the plastic wrap together clockwise, then untwist the ends counterclockwise to release the fufu. Transfer the fufu to a small bowl and serve with the soup or stew of your choice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22200,&quot;Sweet Cinnamon Crispy Pancakes 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 88 grams (.7 cups) Italian \00\ flour 65 grams (4.4 tablespoons) boiling water 255 grams (1.08 cups) room temperature water 440 grams (3.52 cups) Italian \00\ flour, plus more for dusting 9 grams (1.5 teaspoons) kosher salt 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon cocoa powder Maple syrup, for serving 1 cup neutral-flavored oil, such as rice bran or canola Instructions: For the roux: Cook the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until light golden brown. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking constantly, for another 2 minutes. For the first dough: Mix the flour and boiling water together in a small bowl until a dough forms. Knead for a minute or two to make sure that everything comes together. Set aside. For the second dough: Meanwhile, pour the room temperature water into the bowl of a stand mixer and top with flour and salt. Mix with the dough hook on medium-low speed until dough starts to come together. While dough is in the beginning phase of mixing, add in the hot water dough in small chunks. Knead on medium-low speed until the dough comes together and leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a work surface (oiled so the dough does not stick) and knead by hand until smooth and one consistent temperature; be careful not to overwork. Wrap tightly in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For rolling out: Divide dough into 65-gram portions and cover with plastic wrap. (The dough dries out very quickly before it is rolled out, so be sure to keep it covered if you are not working with it.) Whisk together the sugar, cinnamon and cocoa powder in a bowl and set aside. Squeeze a tablespoon or so of oil onto a very clean marble, stone or metal countertop and spread around. Place one dough ball in the center of the oiled surface and sprinkle with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the cinnamon-sugar/cocoa mixture. Gently but using force, roll dough ball with a floured rolling pin until very thin and slightly translucent. The rolled dough will be oddly shaped and that is okay. If the dough rips, that&#39;s also ok--it&#39;s still usable. Once dough is rolled to translucent point, brush with a layer of roux. Working from the bottom end of the rolled dough (the end closest to your body), begin gently rolling dough up like a cigar. The end result will be a long \snake. Twist the snake into a coil. Smash the coil down with your palm and roll this into a 1/4-inch thick and 4-inch-wide pancake. Repeat until all your pancakes are complete. Store pancakes in the refrigerator between layers of parchment paper greased with oil until you&#39;re ready to cook. Heat a pan over medium-low heat. Add a small amount of oil and a cold pancake to the pan. Cover with a lid and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, before flipping and covering again. Cook for another 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to a plate.

The next day, drain the water and put the white beans, salt, carrot, celery, thyme, bay leaf, onion and 6 cups water in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to a simmer and skim any foam that forms on top. Simmer gently so as not to break the beans, until they are soft in the middle, about 2 hours. Take the pot off the heat and let the beans cool in the liquid. Drain, reserving the bean cooking liquid. For the fish stock: Put the olive oil, fennel, leek and onion in a 1-gallon stock pot and cook over medium heat to soften without browning, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and lemon juice. While that is going, wash the fish bones in cold water and then add to the pot with the bay leaf and 8 cups cold water. Bring the stock up to a rolling boil, then lower the heat and simmer, skimming off any foam that forms on top, for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and let steep for 30 minutes. Strain the stock and cool in an ice bath. (Makes about 6 cups; leftover fish stock can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for 2 months.)<br> For the white bean stew: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over low heat, add the garlic and let it brown slowly. Once it starts smelling of cooked garlic, whisk in the flour so it dissolves into the oil to make a roux. Whisk in the wine and 2 cups of the fish stock until smooth. Increase the heat to medium high, bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the sauce gets too thick, add up to 1 cup of the reserved bean cooking liquid. Add the white beans and simmer for another 10 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and 2 teaspoons Calabrian cl flakes-add more if you prefer spicy. Add a little lemon zest and juice. Keep the stew warm while you cook the clams and halibut. Just before serving add the parsley to keep it as green and fresh as possible. For clams: Put the clams in a pot and with wine to cover. Cover the pot and bring the wine to a boil over high heat, to gently open the clams. As soon as the clams start to open, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate. For the fish: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the halibut on both sides with salt and pepper. Sear the fish skin-side down until the first layer of fish starts to turn white, about 3 minutes. Flip, and cook until sides of the filets have turned white and the fish feels firm in the middle when you push down on the tops, another 2 minutes. To serve: Stir the parsley into the white bean stew. Divide the stew and clams among 4 bowls and top each with a piece of halibut, skin-side up.

Set the watermelon in a bowl to stabilize it and catch any drips/overflow. Using an immersion blender (but not turning it on yet), press it gently into the top of the watermelon and twist to score the rind. Then twist and push harder, working in a circle to pop out the top \plug\ of rind. If your immersion blender head is not sharp, you may have to use a knife to help get the \plug\ out. Now for the fun part: Press the immersion blender into the flesh and pulse to start liquefying it. Make sure to scrape down the sides and be careful not to go through the bottom. The process can be a little messy, so wear an apron. Once the flesh is mostly liquid, top it off with lemonade and a shot of vodka or rum if desired.

Lightly grease an 8-inch baking dish. Mix together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, buttermilk and melted butter. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the cornmeal mixture and fold together until there are no dry spots (the batter will still be lumpy). Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake until the top is golden brown and a tester inserted into the middle of the cornbread comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the cornbread from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before serving. For the fried chicken: Combine the buttermilk and sriracha with a fork in a large bowl and season with salt and black pepper. Add the chicken and let soak. Mix the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and cayenne until well blended in a large shallow platter. Season generously with salt and pepper. Remove the chicken and dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture, then into the buttermilk and finishing in the seasoned flour. Set aside and let the chicken rest while the oil comes to temp. This also allows the breading to develop. Put about 3 inches of oil into a large deep pot; it should not come up more than halfway. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil registers 350 to 365 degrees F on a clip-on deep-fry thermometers. Once the oil has reached 350 to 365 degrees F, working in batches, carefully add the chicken pieces 3 or 4 at a time. Fry, turning the pieces once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 12 minutes. Total cooking time should be about 30 minutes per batch. When the chicken is done, take a big skimmer and remove the chicken pieces from the pot, shaking off as much oil as you can, and lay it on a tea towel or brown paper bag to soak up the oil. Sprinkle all over with more salt and a dusting of black pepper. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. For the dipping sauce: Combine the buttermilk, mayonnaise, sour cream, sriracha, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and lemon juice together in a small bowl. Once all the chicken is fried, serve hot with lemon wedges, cornbread and buttermilk sriracha dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22230,&quot;Bud and Alley&#39;s Barbequed Shrimp 1 tablespoon all-purpose seasoning, such as Everglades seasoning 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon celery salt 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/4 cup sliced andouille sausage 6 large head-on shrimp, peeled, head and tail left on 2 cloves garlic, sliced 1 sprig fresh rosemary 1 cup white wine 3 ounces unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 teaspoon BBQ seasoning Grilled Tuscan bread, for serving Instructions: For the seasoning: Mix together the all-purpose seasoning, cayenne pepper and celery salt.

Fold the dough over to cover the mounds, and cut around each mound of filling using a 3-inch cookie cutter, press the edges firmly to seal and pressing to release as much of the trapped air as possible. Crimp the edges, if desired. Place the ravioli on a baking sheet or large plate, covered with plastic wrap or a lightly damp towel, and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to overnight. Fill a large pot with water and add salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Add the ravioli and cook until they float to the surface, about 3 minutes. Drain briefly on paper towels, then transfer to shallow bowls and serve, with a heaping 1/4 cup of the warmed tomato sauce spooned over the top and garnished with chopped basil and Parmesan. Place all the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until a ball is formed. Continue to pulse for 1 minute and remove from the processor.

Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, cover and let sit for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the stock and set aside to rest. Meanwhile, in another saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat and add in the onion, carrots, celery and fennel. Season with salt and pepper and cook until lightly golden, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and turmeric and cook for 30 seconds before carefully pouring in the hot chicken stock. Turn the heat up to high, bring to a boil and cook until the vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. Add in the egg noodles and cook according to the package directions, or until tender. Just before serving, use two forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces and add to the soup along with the greens, lemon juice and herbs and a final seasoning of salt and pepper. On a sturdy work surface using a sharp knife, break down the chicken by removing the wings and legs at their joints and splitting the legs into thighs and drumsticks. Carefully remove the breast meat from the carcass and wrap and set aside in the fridge or freezer for later use. Place the broken-down chicken bones, wings, thighs and drumsticks into a large stockpot. Roughly chop the celery and carrots into large chunks and add them to the pot. Leave the onion unpeeled, cut it in half, and place in the pot along with the garlic, parsley stalks, thyme, bay, peppercorns and salt. Pour 4 liters of water (about 1 gallon) on top, adding more if the veg and chicken are not fully covered. Place the pot over high heat, bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low to maintain a low simmer. Simmer the stock for at least 4 hours, occasionally skimming any frothy foam that floats to the surface. When the stock is flavourful and the chicken bones fall apart easily when pressed, scoop out as much of the chicken and veg as possible, then strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve. Allow the stock to cool to room temperature before transferring to resealable containers and storing in the fridge for up to one week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22252,&quot;Mint Julep 12 to 15 fresh spearmint leaves (no stems), plus a sprig for garnish 1 teaspoon superfine sugar 2 fluid ounces Bourbon Ice cubes 1 fluid ounce club soda Instructions: Put the mint, sugar, and a touch of the bourbon in a chilled silver cup or glass mug.

Season with salt and pepper and add a handful of chopped herbs. Allow to cool completely. Herb phyllo crisp: Working with phyllo can be tricky for a first time user, but if you&#39;ll remember a few simple steps you will always have success.<br> a. Never buy just one box, since some sheets are torn or matted together.<br> b. Make sure the box is completely thawed out before attempting any dish.<br> c. Always cover sheets not being used with a damp cloth towel; phyllo will dry out and turn to cracker mill right before your eyes.<br> Unfold phyllo sheets out of the box and cover with a wet cloth. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place chopped herbs in a workable container, pour melted butter into a workable container, have your paint brush ready, then clean your work space. The idea is to layer melted butter and chopped herbs in between layers of phyllo, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with chopped herbs and repeat for 3 layers. With a sharp knife, cut 6 even strips going vertically and then cut 4 even strips horizontally, making 24 even squares.<br> Carefully mold each square into each space of the muffin pan until all are completed.

Brush the inside of the baguette with 1/4 cup of the Caesar dressing and place cut-side down on the grill. Cook until lightly charred and warmed through, about 2 minutes. Cut each piece of baguette in half lengthwise and then crosswise so you have a total of 8 large breadsticks. Divide the grilled romaine among 4 large plates. Scatter an equal amount of shrimp on each plate. Thin out the remaining dressing with 2 teaspoons water and drizzle over the grilled romaine and shrimp. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan and serve with the grilled bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22270,&quot;Chef Dave&#39;s Grilled Strawberry and Goat Cheese Dessert Pizza 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1 pound fresh strawberries, rinsed and patted dry, hulled, and thinly sliced 1/4 cup orange liqueur 2 tablespoons sugar 8 ounces goat cheese, at room temperature 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons honey 1 tablespoon Armagnac or brandy 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 8 fresh mint leaves, torn into pieces 3/4 cup warm water 1 (1/4-ounce) packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast Instructions: To make the crusts, in a medium bowl, combine the yeast, water, and 1 tablespoon of the flour. Whisk to blend. Let sit until the mixture becomes slightly foamy, about 5 minutes. Combine the remaining flour and salt in a large bowl and stir to blend. Add the yeast mixture, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and the cream. Stir well with a heavy wooden spoon until it begins to come together and pull away from the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 4 to 5 minutes into a smooth, but slightly sticky dough. Oil a clean bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil and turn the dough in the oil to lightly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rise until doubled in size in a warm, draft-free place, about 40 minutes. Lightly grease a baking sheet with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and form into balls. Place on the greased sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until doubled in volume, about 2 hours. Combine the strawberries, orange liqueur, and sugar in a medium bowl, and toss to coat evenly. Clean a grill very well with a brush, and lightly grease with vegetable oil. Preheat the grill to medium heat. Combine the goat cheese and 3 tablespoons honey in a bowl and mash with a fork until smooth. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll each ball into a 10-inch round on a lightly floured pizza paddle or large chopping board. Transfer to the grill and cook on 1 side until golden brown, turning with a spatula to mark evenly, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the grill and place, cooked side up on, on a pizza paddle or large chopping board. Spread half of the goat cheese mixture across each piece of crust using a rubber spatula. Spread half of the berries across the top, leaving the liquid in the bottom of the bowl. Transfer the pizzas to the grill, cover, and cook until golden brown, rotating with a spatula to keep from burning, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to serving plates, sprinkle each with a pinch of black pepper and half of the mint leaves. Drizzle each pizza with 1 teaspoon of the remaining honey and serve. Alternately, place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll out into a 10-inch round on a lightly floured pizza paddle or large chopping board. Make \dimples\ with your fingertips on the top of the dough. Spread half of the goat cheese mixture across the pizza using a rubber spatula. Spread half of the berries across the top of the pizza, leaving the liquid in the bottom of the bowl. Repeat with the remaining dough, goat cheese, and strawberries. Transfer to the pizza stone (or 2 heavy baking sheets) and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to serving plates. Sprinkle a pinch of the black pepper and half of the mint leaves over the top of each pizza, and drizzle each with 1 teaspoon of the remaining honey. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22271,&quot;Pastitsio Kosher salt 1 pound ziti 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 1 pound ground beef or lamb (or a combination) 1 onion, chopped 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 15 -ounce can tomato sauce Freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 2 cups grated kefalotyri or parmesan cheese (about 6 ounces) 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 3 cups plain 2 percent Greek yogurt 2 large eggs, lightly beaten Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs. Meanwhile, make the filling: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and cinnamon and cook until the onion is soft, about 5 more minutes. Add the Worcestershire sauce and wine and cook until the wine starts to evaporate, about 2 more minutes. Add the tomato sauce, 2 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and bring to a simmer. Stir in the parsley and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs and remove from the heat. When the pasta is done, drain and return to the pot off the heat; stir in the butter, then the beaten eggs and 1 cup cheese until the pasta is coated. Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with olive oil. Spread half of the pasta in the dish, then top with the meat filling and the remaining pasta. Make the bechamel: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking, 1 minute. (Do not let the flour brown.)

Transfer the squash to a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the amaretti, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper and blend until smooth. Flour a large cutting board or work surface. Place 2 cups of the flour and the salt on the board and make a wide well in it. Place the eggs and egg yolks in the well. With a fork, follow the perimeter of the well, bringing in small amounts of flour and continuing all the way around, until gradually most of the four is absorbed. If necessary, add up to 1/2 cup of the remaining flour. Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Put the dough through a pasta machine, folding into halves each time and reinserting 15 to 20 times, to knead it. Continue until the pasta is paper-thin. Lay out the sheets of dough and cut them into 4-inch squares; you should have about 40 to 42 squares. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling on one corner of each square. Fold over the filled portion, press down around the filling, and place on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper and sprinkled with semolina. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook until it begins to foam and brown, about 4 minutes. Add the sage, salt and pepper. Bring a large pot of water, salted if desired, to a boil over high heat. Add the tortelli and cook until they are tender, about 3 minutes.

Add the breadcrumbs, chipotle adobo sauce, lime juice, salt, pepper and garlic and mix to blend the ingredients. Use a 1/2-cup measure to scoop and shape the shrimp mixture into 4 burgers. They will be sticky. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. For the avocado aioli: Add the mayonnaise, lime juice, garlic, avocado and some salt and pepper to a food processor and blend until smooth. Coat the bottom of a large saute pan with the oil and place it over medium-high heat. Once it&#39;s very hot, saute the shrimp burgers until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. They should be golden brown. Add about 1 tablespoon of the avocado aioli to each half of the toasted buns. Add a burger to each, followed by a couple of tomato slices and a piece of lettuce. Close the burgers and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 22291,&quot;Pina Colada Cupcakes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup canned unsweetened coconut milk 1/2 cup vegetable oil (or 1/4 cup each vegetable oil and coconut oil) 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon coconut extract 1 tablespoon dark rum 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 1 cup pineapple juice 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar Pinch of salt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon coconut extract 1 tablespoon dark rum 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut Maraschino cherries and cocktail umbrellas, for decorating Instructions: Make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the eggs, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, the brown sugar, coconut milk, vegetable oil and vanilla and coconut extracts in a large bowl. Add the flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about three-quarters of the way. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes are golden and spring back when gently pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the rum, lime juice and the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. When the cupcakes are done, poke them all over with a toothpick and brush with the rum syrup while still warm. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Bring the pineapple juice to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until syrupy and reduced to 2 to 3 tablespoons, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate until completely cool. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and coconut extracts and beat 1 minute, then add the rum and the reduced pineapple juice and beat to combine. Spread the frosting on the cupcakes and top with the shredded coconut.

Butter a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking pan. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a small bowl and set aside. Place the eggs, 1 cup of granulated sugar and the vanilla extract in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed for 10 minutes (really!) until light yellow and fluffy. Reduce the speed to low and slowly add half the flour mixture, then the milk and finally the remaining flour mixture. Mix with a rubber spatula to be sure the batter is well mixed. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and bake for 25 minutes, until the cake springs back when touched lightly in the middle and a cake tester comes out clean. Set aside to cool in the pan for 30 minutes. In a 4-cup liquid measuring cup, whisk together the heavy cream, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, almond extract and vanilla seeds. Using a bamboo skewer, poke holes all over the cooled cake and slowly pour the cream mixture over the cake, allowing it to be absorbed completely before continuing to pour on more of the mixture. Cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours. To serve, toss the strawberries with the 5 tablespoons of granulated sugar. Dust the cake with confectioners&#39; sugar, cut in squares and place on dessert plates. Surround the cake with the strawberries, put a dollop of whipped cream on top and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 22296,&quot;Garbanzo Minestrone 4 cups dried garbanzo beans, soaked in water with 1 teaspoon baking soda for 24 hours and drained 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon 2 tablespoons flour 1/2 pound pork rind, boiled for 20 minutes and cut into thin strips Approximately 10 cups water 1/4 cup olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 3 fresh sage leaves, chopped 1 branch rosemary, chopped Leaves from 2 stalks of celery, hold ribs aside 1 baking potato, peeled and cut in half 2 carrots, peeled and sliced 1/2 cup broccoli rabe, chopped 2 leeks, white part only, sliced 5 cabbage leaves, chiffonade Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Put beans in a stock pot.

Put the banana chunks and vanilla bean seeds or extract in a food processor and process. Hang on, your food processor may jolt in the very beginning! The bananas will look crumbly at first, then gooey and eventually light and creamy- just like ice cream. Stop the food processor frequently to scrape down the sides of the bowl and break up any clumps. Serve right away or scrape into a container and freeze until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Vinho Verde]&quot; 22298,&quot;Cake Pop Brains 4 cups crumbled red velvet cake (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3 tablespoons vanilla frosting, plus more if needed<br> 8 ounces lime green, purple or orange candy melting wafers or ruby chocolate, finely chopped<br> 1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam<br> Red food coloring, for the jam Instructions: Combine the cake and frosting in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and holds together when pressed in your fingers. (Add more frosting a teaspoon or so at a time, if needed, to reach the desired consistency.) Set aside. Put about two-thirds of the candy melting wafers or ruby chocolate in a double boiler. Heat, stirring, until almost melted (a few remaining chunks is okay). Add the remaining candy melting wafers or chocolate in 2 or 3 additions, stirring to melt. (For ruby chocolate, the melted chocolate should read 110 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, then cool to 80 degrees F once the last third of the chocolate is stirred in.) Divide about two-thirds of the melted candy mixture among eight 2-inch-wide silicone brain molds and use a small brush to evenly coat each mold, making sure the sides and bottoms are well covered and no part of the mold shows through. Pop into the refrigerator for a few minutes for faster setting (don\u2019t refrigerate for too long or they can crack when unmolding).<br> Combine the jam and a few drops of red food coloring, just to intensify the color, in a small bowl. Stir in a few drops of water, if needed, so the jam is fluid but not runny.<br> When the shells are set, divide the jam among the cavities. Mold the cake mixture into balls and press into the molds. Use a sharp paring knife to shave the cake so it\u2019s flush with the top of the molds. Smooth the remaining melted candy mixture over top to cover the cake completely. Let set at room temperature, at least 40 minutes (or refrigerate for a few minutes for faster setting).<br> Gently press the brains out of the molds and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22299,&quot;Spicy Orange-Glazed Scallops 1/2 cup finely diced shallots 1 large or 2 medium oranges, zested Olive oil 3/4 cup orange juice 1 3/4 cups chicken broth 2/3 cup dry white wine 2 habanero peppers, cut into quarters, stems and veins removed 1/4 cup orange liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) 9 large sea scallops rinsed and dried Salt and freshly ground black pepper Chopped chives and orange slices, for garnish Instructions: Cook shallots and zest in 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until they begin to brown.

On the day you plan to prepare the dish, change the water and soak again for about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 9 mini loaf pans with olive oil spray. Fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Add the fish and boil for 20 minutes to remove any bones. Allow to cool. In a separate bowl, mix the fish, ackees, mayonnaise, and scallions. Using the various seasonings, incorporate into the mixture according to your taste. Add the breadcrumbs a little at a time, tasting as you do this to make sure you don&#39;t lose the flavor of the fish or the ackees. Once you achieve the flavor that suits you, add the hot sauce. Once again, use caution when adding hot sauce so you don&#39;t make the fish too spicy. Evenly divide and press the fish mixture into each loaf pan and bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until browned. Remove the loaves from the oven.

Add the ghee or oil and mix in with your fingers until the dough looks crumbly. Begin by adding 3 tablespoons of cold water, then add more water a little a time to make a stiff dough. Try to knead the dough as little as possible (think flaky pie crust). Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes. For the spice blend: To roast the spices, heat a small cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add the whole spices: coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, peppercorns, clove, cardamom and cinnamon and roast, shaking the skillet often, until the mixture darkens slightly and becomes toasty and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a small bowl to cool. Add the amchur powder, red cl powder and turmeric. Once cool, transfer to a grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to a medium-fine grind.<br> For the filling: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds and let sizzle until they darken slightly, about 30 seconds Add the peanuts if using and cook until crunchy, about 2 minutes. Add the chiles and ginger and cook, stirring often, until the raw aroma of the ginger goes away, about 1 minute.<br> Add the potatoes, peas, roasted spice blend and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and cook until the peas soften and the mixture is well mixed and seasoned, about 3 minutes. Add the cilantro if using. Add salt to taste, amchur for additional tang and red cl powder for spice.<br> To assemble and fry the samosas: Pour enough oil into a large Dutch oven or wide heavy-bottomed pot to come up the sides about 3 inches. Place over medium heat and heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil registers 340 degrees F.<br> While the oil is heating, divide the dough into 6 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball (a kitchen scale is helpful here but not necessary). For smaller samosas, you can divide the dough into 8 balls. Cover all but 1 ball with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Flatten the uncovered ball into an oval patty. Lightly brush with oil and roll the patty into a thin oval (8 to 9 inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide). Cut in half widthwise into 2 semicircles.<br> Set a small bowl of water beside you. Working with one semicircle at a time, fold over one end of the straight edge halfway toward the rounded edge. Using a fingertip, lightly wet the outside edge with a little water as well as the inner edge of the other half of the straight side. Then fold the other half up and overlapping the wet sides, about 1/4 inch, to form a cone. Press the edges together to form a seal. Hold the cone in one hand, pinch the seam again to make sure it\u2019s sealed and fill it with 2 tablespoons of the potato filling. Make a little pleat opposite of the sealed edge by pinching it over about 1/4 inch. This is the backbone of the samosa and will help it stand. Wet the inside of the rounded edge and fold it over the filling to enclose it. Press the edges together to seal. Repeat with a second dough ball and some of the filling to make 4 samosas.<br> Double-check that the oil temperature is 340 degrees F (it&#39;s important for the oil to be medium hot; if it&#39;s too hot, the outside of the samosas will brown too quickly, while the inside dough will not be cooked enough and the samosas won&#39;t crisp up). Gently slip in the 4 samosas and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes. If the samosas haven&#39;t browned by then, increase the temperature to 360 degrees F and cook, turning over as needed, until golden brown. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.<br> While the samosas are frying, shape and fill 4 more samosas, then repeat until all the samosas are shaped, filled and fried. Serve immediately with Tamarind\u2013Date Chutney.<br> Stir together the seedless tamarind, date paste, jaggery, cumin powder, red cl powder, ginger powder, fennel powder, black salt, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium low so the sauce is simmering. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes; when you dip a spoon into the sauce and run your finger across the back of it, it should hold a line. Taste and add more salt or jaggery if needed. Remove from the heat and strain. Allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer to an airtight glass jar and refrigerate. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 22309,&quot;Pumpkin Tartuffo Sundae 1 pint soy milk 1 pint non-dairy whipped topping 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 1 cup pureed canned pumpkin 1 cup sugar substitute 8 egg whites Instructions: Heat soy milk and non-dairy topping with vanilla bean.

Pour the mixture into flutes leaving about a 2-inch space from the top. Then top each glass with a little Prosecco and serve immediately. &quot;,[Prosecco] 22314,&quot;Passion Fruit Sponge 6 ounces all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 2 tablespoons cornstarch 4 eggs, at room temperature 7 ounces caster sugar (superfine) 1/3 cup boiling water 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed 7 ounces whipped cream 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 1/2 tablespoons passion fruit pulp Instructions: To make the sponge: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and line 2 (8-inch) cake pans with parchment. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking powder with the cornstarch and sift the ingredients together twice. Beat the eggs with the sugar for about 7 to 8 minutes or until the mixture is pale and thick. Gently fold the flour mixture into the beaten eggs. Mix the butter with the boiling water, and then add it to the sponge batter, stirring gently. Divide the mixture between the prepared cake pans, and bake for 20 minutes or until the cakes are golden brown and separating from the tins. Remove the pans from the oven. Cool the sponges in the pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. To make the icing: While the cakes cook and cool, beat together the sugar, butter and passion fruit pulp until a spreading consistency is reached. To serve, place 1 of the cakes on a serving plate and spread it with the whipped cream. Layer on the remaining cake and spread that with the passion fruit icing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 22315,&quot;Perfect Pie Crust 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) very cold unsalted butter 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/3 cup very cold vegetable shortening, such as Crisco 1/2 cup ice water Instructions: Cut the butter in 1/2-inch dice and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out onto a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle at least 1 inch larger than the pie pan, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough so it doesn?t stick to the board. (You should see bits of butter in the dough.) Fold the dough in half, ease it into the pie pan without stretching at all, and unfold to fit the pan. With a small sharp paring knife, cut the dough 1 inch larger around than the pan. Fold the edge under and crimp the edge with either your fingers or the tines of a fork.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22316,&quot;Beef Stew 1 1/2 pounds beef top sirloin steak, cut into 1-inch cubes 4 cloves garlic, peeled 1/2 medium white onion, quartered Kosher salt<br> 6 baby red potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch cubes<br> 3 ears corn, cut into thirds<br> 2 carrots, cut into 1-inch rounds<br> 1 stalk celery, cut into 2-inch pieces<br> 1 zucchini, cut into 2-inch chunks<br> 3 kale leaves, stems discarded, leaves torn<br> Lime wedges, for serving<br> Hot sauce, for serving<br> Warm corn tortillas, for serving Bread, for serving<br> Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish<br> Instructions: Combine the beef, garlic, onions and 12 cups of water in a large pot. Sprinkle with salt and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Uncover the pot and skim off the foam and grease. Add the potatoes, corn, carrots, celery and zucchini. Cover and continue simmering for 30 more minutes. Add the kale and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and serve with lime wedges, hot sauce, warm corn tortillas and bread. Garnish with chopped cilantro and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 22317,&quot;Bianco Rosso Verde Arancini 4 cups fresh basil leaves 4 cloves garlic 1/4 cup olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground pepper 8 ounces mozzarella, shredded 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup grated Pecorino 6 cups vegetable stock 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon sea salt 2 1/2 cups Arborio rice 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 cup grated Pecorino 8 ounces cherry tomatoes, cut in half and salted 1 1/2 cups flour Salt 2 cups plain breadcrumbs Canola oil, for frying Instructions: For the pesto: Combine the basil and garlic in a food processor and mix while slowly adding the olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Continue this process until all the basil has been used. Reserve 1/4 cup of the pesto to mix into the rice. Transfer the remaining pesto to a bowl and mix with the shredded cheeses. Cover with plastic wrap and set in refrigerator. For the rice: In a medium saucepot over high heat, add the beef stock, butter and salt. When the stock reaches a boil, add the rice and stir it a bit to prevent sticking. Let it come to a rolling boil and lower the heat a bit to medium. Stir the rice once in a while, you want the rice to absorb all of the liquid; it should take 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the rice; it should be slightly al dente but creamy. Remove the pot from the heat, add the cheeses and add the 1/4 cup reserved pesto to the rice and stir thoroughly. Pour the rice onto a baking sheet and spread into a thin layer. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool, preferably overnight in the fridge. For the filling and assembly: Portion out the cooled rice into identical portions. We weigh ours to 1.6 ounces. Take one portion and form it into a semi-circle in the palm of your hand, making a cup-like shape to place the pesto and cherry tomato. Scoop about 1 tablespoons of the pesto-cheese mixture into the half ball and then 2 tomato halves. Take another portion of rice and flatten it into a disk shape. Place that disk over the half ball to enclose the pesto and tomatoes in the center. Have a bowl of warm water nearby to dip your hands into; it&#39;ll make the process easier and less sticky. Roll the ball around to enclose all the ingredients in the center and shape into a perfectly round ball. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. For the batter and breading: Place the flour and 1 1/2 cups cold water into a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Mix with a whisk until smooth and about the consistency of eggnog. Place the breadcrumbs in a large bowl or baking dish. Roll each ball in batter and shake off excess batter. Then roll each ball in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with all the balls. Use a heavy duty pot with enough canola oil to submerge the balls in. Make sure the oil isn&#39;t near the top of the pot because it will overflow when you drop your balls in. Bring the oil to 350 degrees F, using a high temp thermometer if you have one. If not you can throw a small piece of white bread in to test; it should brown quickly and float when the oil is hot enough. Use a slotted spoon or wire basket to lower your balls into the hot oil. Don&#39;t overcrowd the balls - maybe 2 or 3 at a time. Fry in batches until they are golden like arancini (\little oranges), about 5 minutes. Remove and place on paper towels to drain. Eat hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 22318,&quot;Buttercream Mousseline/Cookies and Cream 2 cups sugar 2 tablespoons meringue powder 5 egg whites 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 1/4 cups butter, room temperature 3/4 cup shortening 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped 10 chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed (recommended: Oreo) Instructions: Combine the sugar and meringue powder in a stainless steel bowl and whisk to combine. Mix egg whites and corn syrup. Combine the egg white mixture with the sugar mixture and whisk vigorously. Heat mixture over a hot water bath, stirring occasionally. The meringue is ready when the sugar is dissolved. Whip in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment for 10 to 15 minutes. Slowly add the cool, room temperature butter and shortening. Add the vanilla seeds and then fold in the crushed cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 22319,&quot;Mashed Parsnips and Celery Root - Pho Poi 1 large or 2 small parsnips, peeled and chopped 1 celery root, peeled and chopped 3 cups milk 1 tablespoon butter Salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: Put the celery root and parsnips into a medium pot and cover them with the milk. Bring to a simmer and let cook until the parsnips and celery root are tender and cooked through, about 30 minutes. Strain the vegetables from the pot, making sure to reserve 1 cup of the milk before discarding the remainder. Return the parsnips and celery root to the pot, add the butter and mash the ingredients with a potato masher. If you want a smoother texture, then blend in a food processor. Add in some of the reserved milk to lighten the consistency. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper and stir until well incorporated. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 22320,&quot;Chocolate Caramel Crunch Pie 9 whole graham crackers 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 28 ounces store-bought dulce de leche, preferably Trader Joes<br> 1 1/2 cups chopped toasted walnuts<br> 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chunks, such as Scharffen Berger 70-percent 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest<br> 1/2 teaspoon flake salt, such as Maldon 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Unsweetened chocolate, to grate for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt in a medium bowl. Put the cocoa powder in a large bowl. Warm the milk in a small saucepan or in the microwave until just about to simmer. Pour the milk over the cocoa powder and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the granulated sugar, vegetable oil, egg and vanilla. Whisk in the flour mixture until just combined. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each three-quarters of the way. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pan, then remove the cupcakes to the rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Microwave the chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth; let cool slightly. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; add the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt and beat until combined, then increase the speed to high and beat until creamy, about 3 more minutes. Reduce the speed to medium; add the heavy cream and vanilla and beat until fluffy, about 1 minute. Remove about one-third of the frosting to a small bowl and stir in the melted chocolate and cocoa powder until smooth; set aside. Tint the remaining frosting bright orange with food coloring. Transfer the orange frosting to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Cut a small cone-shaped chunk out of the center of each cupcake with a paring knife, cutting about halfway into the cupcake. Crumble the chunks of cake into a bowl. Spread the chocolate frosting in a thin layer on the cupcakes, leaving the carved-out holes open. Pat the cupcake crumbs on the chocolate frosting to look like dirt. Pipe the orange frosting into each hole, mounding it above the surface to look a like carrot. Stick a few sour apple laces into the orange frosting to look like carrot tops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22323,&quot;Pumpkin Cheesecake Tarts with Gingersnap Crust 4 cups finely crushed gingersnaps 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger 1 pound cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch of grated nutmeg Pinch of ground allspice Pinch of ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup fresh or canned pumpkin puree 2 large eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. To make the crust, combine the gingersnap crumbs with the melted butter and toss together until the mixture holds together when pressed. Add an additional tablespoon of melted butter if necessary.

Combine all the sauce ingredients in a nonmetallic bowl and mix well. It does not matter in which order the ingredients are combined. Cover and refrigerate until time to use. Next, make the filling. Combine all the ingredients in a nonmetallic bowl and mix very well using your hands. Again, it does not matter in which order the filling ingredients are added. Once the filling is made, set it aside. Now it&#39;s time to fill the dumplings. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper and dust the paper heavily with the cornstarch. Take a gyoza wrapper and put a generous 1 teaspoon, almost 1 tablespoon, dollop of filling in the middle of the gyoza wrapper. Now start pinching in the wrapper all the way around the dumpling to close it up, like a fold/pleat - approximately 4 folds. Then give it a little twist around the dumpling&#39;s \waist.\ Arrange the finished dumplings on the cornstarch coated cookie sheet. When all 40 dumplings are finished, cover and refrigerate for 1/2 an hour. Final cooking steps: Add the canola oil to a large 12-inch nonstick skillet. Start adding the dumplings to the pan and turn the heat to medium-high. Brown the bottom of the dumplings, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, add the sauce, cover the pan and steam for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, uncover the pan and turn over all the dumplings to coat with the sauce.

Strain and serve over ice with a squeeze of lime juice. &quot;,&quot;[Viognier, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 22329,&quot;Special Everyday Rice (Chelo) 2 1/2 cups basmati rice 1/4 cup salt Water 1/4 cup vegetable oil or 4 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons plain yogurt 1 large egg 1 teaspoon saffron threads, dry-roasted, crumbled to a powder, and dissolved in 3 tablespoons warm water (optional) Instructions: Wash the rice thoroughly, then place in a large pot with 3 tablespoons of the salt and enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. Let soak for 2 to 3 hours. Drain well in a fine sieve. In the same pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a vigorous boil. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon salt, then gradually sprinkle in the rice. Stir gently to prevent sticking, and bring back to a boil. After the rice has been boiling for 2 minutes, test for doneness. The rice is ready when the outside is tender but there remains a slight uncooked resistance at the core of the grain. If the core of the grain is brittle, it&#39;s not done enough. Continue to check the rice until done, usually about 4 minutes, then drain in the sieve and rinse with tepid to cool water (to prevent cooking any more). Place the pot back over high heat and add the oil or butter and 1 tablespoon water. In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt and egg. Stir in about 1/2 cup rice, then place in the sizzling oil and spread over the bottom of the pot. Gradually add the remaining rice, sprinkling it in to form a mound. Use the handle of a wooden spoon to make three or four holes through the mound to the bottom, then cover the pot with a lid wrapped in a tea towel. (The towel helps seal the lid and absorbs moisture from the rising steam.) Heat over medium-high heat until steam builds up, 1 to 2 minutes, then lower heat to medium-low and cook for about 30 minutes. When it is done, the rice will be tender and fluffy with a flavorful crust, the tahdig, on the bottom. The tahdig comes off more easily if, before removing the lid, you place the pot in an inch of cold water (in the sink) for a minute. Then remove the lid and, if you&#39;re using saffron, gently spoon about 1 cup rice into the saffron water mixture; stir to blend. Mound the remaining rice on a platter. Sprinkle on the saffron rice, if you have it. Place chunks of the crust on top or on a separate plate; it&#39;s a big treat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 22330,&quot;Warm Langostinos (Prawns) 2 cups dry white wine 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 2 carrots, chopped 2 onions, chopped 2 ribs celery, chopped 6 sprigs parsley 10 peppercorns, crushed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup hazelnut oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives Salt and freshly ground black pepper 18-24 langostinos (prawns), deveined Lemon wedges, for garnish Instructions: Prepare the court bouillon by combining all the ingredients in a large pot, along with 1 quart of water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer 30 minutes. Strain the liquid, return to pot and bring back to a simmer. Meanwhile, combine the hazelnut oil, parsley, thyme, chives, salt, and pepper, and set aside. Add the langostinos to the court bouillon, and poach until just cooked, 3 to 4 minutes.

To make the Yorkshire Pudding batter, in a bowl, combine the flour and salt. In another bowl, beat the eggs. Add the milk and gradually add to the flour, mixing to make a thin, smooth batter, being careful not to over mix. Let rest for at least 1 hour at room temperature, or for several hours in the refrigerator (bringing to room temperature before cooking). Put the roast in a small roasting pan, bone side down. With a small sharp knife, make sixteen 1/2-inch-deep slits in the meaty side of the roast. Insert 1 garlic clove into each slit, pressing into the meat. Pinch with your thumb and index finger to close the openings. Combine the chopped thyme, salt, Essence, and pepper in a small bowl. Slowly stir in the oil to make a paste. Rub the paste on both sides of the roast, and place the thyme sprigs under the roast. Roast for 1 hour. Remove the pan from the oven and turn the roast for even browning. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast reads 125 to 130 degrees F for medium-rare, about 45 minutes, or 140 degrees F for medium, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let the roast stand for 15 minutes before carving. While the roast is resting, make the Yorkshire Pudding in the same roasting pan. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the hot pan drippings, adding hot melted butter as necessary to make the correct measure. Place the pan in the oven to stay hot while the oven comes to temperature. Pour the prepared batter into the dish and bake, without opening the oven door, until risen and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve immediately with the carved rib roast.

Place the slices in a large nonstick or stainless-steel pot, add 4 cups water, and bring to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and add the sugar, stirring well until the sugar is dissolved. Cover the pan and refrigerate overnight. The following day, bring back to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 2 hours. Turn up the heat a little and boil gently for another 30 minutes. Place a candy thermometer in the marmalade and cook until it reaches the jelly stage (220 degrees F). For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with nonstick baking spray. Melt the butter and chocolate in an 8-cup microwave-safe container. Whisk in the sugar and then the cocoa powder until fully incorporated. Slowly add the hot coffee in three increments, whisking until smooth. Add the vanilla, then add the eggs, one at a time. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; mix until combined. With the mixer on low speed, gradually pour in the chocolate mixture; beat on medium-high speed for 1 minute. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and beat until smooth, another 30 seconds. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on a baking rack. For the buttercream: Set a clean stand-mixer bowl over a double-boiler and add the egg whites and sugar. Whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and beat with the whisk attachment until stiff and glossy. Piece by piece, gradually incorporate the butter--the mixture will start to look curdled but will come together once fully incorporated. Add the melted chocolate, cocoa powder, orange zest and vanilla; beat until incorporated. To assemble: Level the cooled cake layers and lightly brush with the orange liqueur. Spread the top of each layer with a thin layer of marmalade and then, using an offset spatula, with the buttercream cream. Stack the cake layers. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 22345,&quot;Bobby Flay&#39;s Margherita Pizza 1 store-bought pizza dough Olive oil, for brushing and drizzling Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound fresh mozzarella, sliced 1/4-inch thick 3 Roma tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick Handful fresh basil leaves Instructions: Prepare the grill for direct and indirect cooking.<br> Once the grill is hot (you can hold your hands an inch over the grates for no more than 2 seconds), stretch and shape the dough into a 12-inch round on a flat surface. Brush the top with oil, salt and pepper and toss on the grill, oil-side down. Cook until the bottom is golden brown, 1 minute. Check the bottom of the dough to see if it is getting browned. If it is on one part, but not the other, use a spatula or tongs to rotate the dough 90 degrees and cook for another minute. If it is still not beginning to brown, cover the grill and continue to cook a minute at a time until the bottom has browned evenly. (It should only take a couple minutes if you have a hot grill.) The top of the pizza dough will also start bubbling up with air pockets.<br> Once the pizza dough has browned on the bottom, flip over and grill until golden brown and the dough is just firm, another minute or so. Remove to a sheet pan. Cover the grill so it retains the heat for the next step.<br> Drizzle the top with more olive oil. Put the mozzarella and tomato slices on top and season with salt and pepper. Return the pizza to the grill on the sheet pan, cover the grill and cook for 3 or 4 minutes to melt the cheese. Remove from the grill and tear the basil leaves over the top.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Add the butter to same pan, followed by the onions. Cook until the onions begin to caramelize, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the wine, vinegar and cabbage. Cover, reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking for 30 minutes. Remove the lid from the cabbage and continue cooking until all the liquid has evaporated. Stir the crisped bacon into the cabbage and season with salt and pepper. For the arctic char: The secret to crispy skin is lack of moisture. Leave your fish uncovered in the fridge 10 to 15 minutes to dry out. Then dry the fish with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium-high heat. Add enough oil to coat. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, place the fillets skin-side down in the pan, cooking in batches if needed. Using the back of a spatula, press down hard on the fillets for at least 20 seconds to ensure that the entire skin has full contact with the bottom of the pan. This will help to achieve the crispiest skin possible. Continue cooking until the flesh cooks and there is only a bit of pink left, 5 to 6 minutes. The skin should be pulling away from the bottom of the pan. If necessary, use a spatula to loosen the skin before flipping. Flip the fish and continue cooking for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute before transferring to a plate to rest. Gently remove the fish skin with a paring knife and place the skin back into the pan, flesh-side down. Fry another 1 to 2 minutes over medium-high heat. Transfer to a wire rack or a paper towel-lined plate, at which point it will harden like a super-crispy fish chip. Serve the crisp arctic char over the butter-braised cabbage and top with the crispy fish skin. Cook&#39;s Note: Removing your fried fish skin to a wire rack will help it harden by letting the air circulate around it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 22355,&quot;Keyk Sharbat Zaferan 1/2 teaspoon ground saffron (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 cubes ice 1 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/4 cup rosewater Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 1 cup milk 2 tablespoons lemon juice 3/4 cup vegetable oil 3/4 cup sugar 4 large eggs 2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 3 tablespoons desiccated coconut 2 tablespoons ground pistachio 2 tablespoons dried rose petals Instructions: For the saffron syrup: Sprinkle the saffron on the ice cubes and set aside to melt. This will be your bloomed saffron. Put the sugar and 1 cup water in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add the cardamom and simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Add the rosewater and bloomed saffron and simmer for another minute.

Saute the mushrooms without butter for a few minutes until tender. Set all the vegetables aside until almost ready to serve. Place the lobsters in a tight-fitting heatproof container. Cover with cold water. Drain off the water, measure it, and place the water into a large pot. Bring the water to a boil and add 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar per 8 quarts water. Pour the boiling liquid over the lobsters and let them steep for 2 minutes if using 1 1/2-pound lobsters and 3 minutes if using 2-pound lobsters. Remove the lobsters from the hot water. Using a towel or rubber gloves, hold the lobster body, and remove the lobster tail by twisting it and detaching from the body by lightly pulling on it. Remove the claws the same way, and place the claws back into the hot water. Set the body on a plate. Repeat with the other lobster. Hold each piece of tail meat flat and twist the tail fan from one side, pull off and discard. Using your fingers, gently push the meat through the tail and pull the meat out through the large opening at the other end. Discard the shell or keep it for stocks and bisques. Lay the tail meat on the rounded side and halve it lengthwise through the middle. Remove the vein that runs through the top of the meat. Lay the meat on a paper towel-lined plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Remove the claws from the water. Twist off each knuckle and reserve. Hold each claw and pull down on the smaller portion of the claw to loosen it and remove it from the larger part of the claw, keeping the meat intact and attached. Still holding the claw, crack the top of the shell with the heel of the knife where the knuckle was attached. Go through the shell but not deep enough to damage the meat. Wiggle the knife to crack the shell. If the shell does not pop off, it may be necessary to turn the claw over and repeat the procedure. Shake the claw meat to remove the meat (if it doesn&#39;t fall out, cut off the very tip of the shell and blow through the hole to release the meat). Place claw meat on the plate with the tail meat. Repeat with remaining claws. Cut off the top joint of each knuckle, the one that was attached to the lobster&#39;s body. Use scissors to cut away the shell along the smooth outside edge of the knuckle. Use your fingers to pry open the shell and remove the meat. Place the knuckle meat on the plate with the tail meat. For the lobsters, bring the lobsters to room temperature. Place them in 1 layer in a large saucepan with the melted butter. Over low heat, poach the lobster meat for 5 to 6 minutes. Slice the lobster pieces into thick slices all about the same size. In a saucepan, heat 1 teaspoon of the poaching butter and add the shallots. Add the vinegar and reduce to almost dry. Add the wine and reduce by 3/4. Add the cream and reduce by 2/3. Add the lobster pieces to the pan and saute for 1 minute. Add the Cognac to the pan and keep the pan warm. Adjust seasonings, if necessary. In a large saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the poaching butter. Saute the cooked vegetables with salt and pepper until just heated through and divide the vegetables evenly between 4 plates. Remove the lobster pieces from the Cognac sauce and plate on top of the vegetables, divided evenly. Strain the sauce over the lobster and vegetables.

Rub the turkey breast with the butter and sprinkle with salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme. Place the turkey skin-side-up in a large roasting pan and cover with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil. Bake until an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 165 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours or about 15 minutes per pound. Let rest for 10 minutes. Cut the breast into thick slices and set aside. Pour the pan juices into a measuring cup and skim off the fat (use the fat for gravy). You&#39;ll need 2 to 3 cups of liquid for the dressing; supplement with chicken stock as needed. In a very large bowl, mix together the crumbled cornbread, torn white bread and the cranberries. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan. Add the celery, carrots and onion and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of the turkey pan juices and continue cooking until the vegetables are translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the cooked vegetables to the bread mixture. Pour in the orange juice and 1 cup of the pan juices and mix well, using a sturdy spoon or your hands. Continue adding pan juices (or chicken stock) until the mixture is very moist, almost soupy.

When it begins to simmer, add the Brussels sprouts. Cook until the sprouts are just soft, about 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. In a large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, buttermilk, lemon juice, sugar, mustard, celery salt, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a dash of pepper. Whisk until blended and smooth. Add the Brussels sprouts and toss to coat. Refrigerate at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. For the pulled pork sliders: In a medium bowl, whisk together the paprika, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt. Massage the mixture into the pork, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. When ready to cook, put the onions in the bottom of a 6-quart slow cooker insert. Unwrap the seasoned pork and put it fat-side up on top of the onions. Pour the barbecue sauce and chicken broth over the pork. Cover and cook 9 to 11 hours on low or 5 to 7 hours on high. The meat is done when you can easily pierce it with a fork and it slips away from the bone. Gently transfer the cooked pork to a large baking dish and cover loosely with foil. Pour the cooking liquid from the slow cooker into a gravy separator and allow the fat to rise (or use a large spoon to skim the fat from the cooking liquid). Pour the defatted liquid into a high-sided bowl or saucepan and add the onions from the slow cooker. Using an immersion blender, puree the onions and liquid until you have a smooth, thick sauce. Season the sauce with brown sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. When the meat is cool enough to handle, use 2 forks or your fingers to shred the meat. To use 2 forks, hold 1 in each hand, place the tines back-to-back in the meat and pull in opposite directions, breaking the meat apart as you pull. Discard any bones, visible fat and gristle. Add sauce to your desired level of moistness and toss to combine. Arrange the buns on a dry work surface, placing the tops and bottoms side-by-side with the insides facing up. Place about 2 ounces of pork on the bottom half of each bun, top with about 1 tablespoon of the Brussels sprouts slaw and cover with the top of the bun. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]&quot; 22378,&quot;Vegan Cheddar Wheel 1 cup raw cashews Vegetable oil, for the ramekin<br> 3 cups vegetable broth<br> 1 cup diced peeled and cooked sweet potatoes (about 5 ounces)<br> 1/4 cup tahini<br> 1/4 cup nutritional yeast<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 2 teaspoons red miso paste<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons yellow mustard<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon turmeric<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 tablespoon agar powder<br> Instructions: Put the cashews in a medium bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water.

This will be the bloomed saffron. Put the chicken, turmeric, garlic, cinnamon stick and onion in a pot and cover with 4 cups of water. Cover with a lid, turn the heat to medium high and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and simmer, covered, until the chicken is fully cooked, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the heat. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the bones and shred the meat into smaller chunks. Set aside. For the jeweled rice: Meanwhile, peel the oranges, making sure not to include any of the bitter white parts, and slice the peel into very thin strips. Fill a small bowl with water, add the orange peels and rinse. Drain in a colander, add fresh water to the bowl and rinse the peels again. Repeat the process twice more to remove any bitterness from the peels. Put the sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and bring it to a simmer. Add the orange peel and carrots, lower the heat to medium low and simmer until slightly softened and glazed, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Rinse the rice a few times until the water runs clear. Transfer the rice to a pot, fill the pot with water to cover the rice by about 1 inch and add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Bring the rice to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to medium low and let it simmer until the water has almost evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes. Wrap the lid in a kitchen towel and place it over the rice. Continue to cook until the grains are tender, another 12 to 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes, then fluff the rice with a fork. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the turmeric and cook until the onions are very tender and golden, another 10 minutes. Set aside. Drain the orange peel and carrots in a colander. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the orange peel and carrots and cook until crisp-tender and warmed through, about 3 minutes. Set aside. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add the barberries and cook until shimmery, watching them carefully so they don&#39;t burn, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Melt another 1 tablespoon butter in the same pan. Add the raisins and cook until softened and warmed through, about 3 minutes; transfer to the plate. Melt another 1 tablespoon of butter, add the pistachios and cook until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes; transfer to the plate. Melt the last tablespoon of butter and cook the almonds until toasted, about 3 minutes. To finish the chicken: Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat, add the chicken and sear for 2 minutes.

Stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved and then increase the heat so that the liquid is simmering. Add the pears and poach them for 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally so that they are evenly covered by the syrup. The pears should be tender enough so that they can be easily pierced with a toothpick, and the cooking time will depend on their ripeness. Let cool, and refrigerate. In a food processor, process the almonds and the sugar with an electric mixer until smooth and flatly ground. Do not overprocess. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy. Sift the almond powder and the flour over the top and combine to beat until smooth and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing the first one in thoroughly before adding the second. Add the rum and mix in thoroughly. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and lightly oil a large baking sheet. Halve the poached pears and scoop out the cores. Slice each half pear thinly lengthwise and set aside, keeping together in their original shape. Unroll the phyllo and cut it into 4-inch wide stacks. Separate the leaves of pastry and lay one single strip on the counter. Brush it with melted butter, and continue until you have a stack of 6 strips, buttering each one. Repeat until you have 6 stacks of buttered phyllo strips. Using a spatula, spread a layer of almond cream 1/4-inch thick on the top layer of each phyllo stack. Slightly fan out a pear half on one end of each stack and roll the stack over about 1 1/2 times to form a flat strudel package. Brush the outside of the strudel with butter, and repeat with the remaining 5 pear halves and phyllo stacks. Transfer the strudels to the baking sheet. (at this point the strudels could be refrigerated for up to 12 hours before cooking) Bake the strudels for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden and crispy.

Rub the spice mixture into the meat and put it in the oven for 4 hours.<br> Arrange the potatoes around and under the meat and put it back into the oven for 1 hour.<br> Now add the garlic, shallots and carrots around the pork. If your roasting pan is not large enough to accommodate all the vegetables, place them in a separate roasting pan. Cook for 30 minutes, then add the pears. They don&#39;t need much cooking time and will disintegrate if cooked too long. Cook for another 30 minutes When the meat is tender and flakes with a fork, remove it and the vegetables and keep warm. This will give the pork time to rest and become more tender. If the pork rind is not crispy, put it under the broiler for a few minutes until it is really crunchy and crispy.<br> To make the gravy, pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the roasting pan. Stir the flour into the roasting pan, add the wine, put the roasting pan onto a burner over medium-high heat and cook until the wine is reduced by half. If not using the wine, do this with the stock. Now add the stock and scrape off any bits of meat and vegetable on the bottom of the pan. Taste and add any seasoning if you think it needs it.<br> If the gravy is too thin, make a paste in a bowl with 1 tablespoon and 1 tablespoon flour. Add some of the hot gravy to the small bowl and stir. Add this to the hot stock, stirring constantly and bring to a boil. The gravy will thicken slightly.<br> If your gravy is too thick, just add a touch more stock. Serve the meat and vegetables with the gravy.<br> This dish struggles to make it to the table as the family descends upon it while I am trying to finish the gravy!

Salt the water, cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking, cook the peas in a separate saucepan of salted water. Simmer until just tender, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a sieve and cool on a baking sheet. When the potatoes are done, drain well, scatter on a baking sheet, and let cool for several minutes. In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the cream until it reaches a boil then simmer for a few minutes. Add the cream to a blender with the cooked peas and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until the butter stops foaming and turns a light brown. Add the garlic and cook quickly until pale gold. Add remaining cream, season, to taste, with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Press the cooled potatoes through a ricer or food mill into the butter and garlic mixture, tossing to coat. Reduce the heat to low. Add the remaining butter by tablespoonfuls, stirring vigorously after each addition. In this way, the butter does not melt into a golden puddle. Instead, it forms an emulsion with the potatoes, creating a very smooth puree. Fold the pea puree into the mashed potatoes and adjust seasoning, as necessary. Instead of salt, the puree can be seasoned with a little grated Parmesan, if desired.

To make the crust, combine the graham crackers, sugar, and melted butter until moistened. Pour into a 9-inch springform pan. With your hands, press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan and about 1-inch up the sides. Bake for 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Raise the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. To make the filling, cream the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed of the mixer to medium and add the eggs and egg yolks, 2 at a time, mixing well. Scrape down the bowl and beater, as necessary. With the mixer on low, add the sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla. Mix thoroughly and pour into the cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the oven temperature down to 225 degrees F and bake for another 1 hour and 15 minutes. Turn the oven off and open the door wide. The cake will not be completely set in the center. Allow the cake to sit in the oven with the door open for 30 minutes. Take the cake out of the oven and allow it to sit at room temperature for another 2 to 3 hours, until completely cooled. Wrap and refrigerate overnight. Remove the cake from the springform pan by carefully running a hot knife around the outside of the cake. Leave the cake on the bottom of the springform pan for serving. To make the topping, melt the jelly in a small pan over low heat. In a bowl, toss the raspberries and the warm jelly gently until well mixed. Arrange the berries on top of the cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Note: Measure your springform pan. The bottom of mine measures 9 inches, but it says 9 1/2. I put the springform pan on a sheet pan before putting it in the oven to catch any leaks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 22450,&quot;Vanilla-Banana Pudding 4 1/2 cups whole milk 1 cup sugar 1/3 cup cornstarch Kosher salt 5 large egg yolks, beaten 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 4 ripe bananas, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds 3 ounces vanilla wafer cookies, lightly crushed (about 24) Instructions: Heat 4 cups of the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat until steaming. Whisk the sugar, cornstarch and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup milk. Whisk half of the hot milk into the egg mixture until smooth, then gradually whisk the egg-milk mixture into the pan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils. Continue to whisk until it has thickened to a puddinglike consistency, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Cool slightly, stirring a few times to prevent a skin from forming. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding and refrigerate until completely cooled and thickened, about 4 hours. One hour before serving, whisk the pudding vigorously until smooth and creamy. Gently fold in 3/4 of the sliced bananas. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

If you do not have a barbecue, you can use an indoor grill pan set to medium high heat. Lightly oil the grill. Grill the pineapple slices until heated through and beginning to brown, about 3 minutes per side. It&#39;s important to leave the pineapples on the grill, untouched so that you can create the grill marks. While the pineapples are cooking, whisk the mascarpone and vanilla in a small bowl to blend. Set aside. Combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small bowl and stir to combine. Place in a microwave on high for about 2 minutes, stirring every 20 seconds to blend well. Alternatively, you can combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small saucepan, set over low heat, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly.

Add the fusilli and cook for 1 to 2 minutes less than the package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water, then drain and set aside. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and remove all but 2 tablespoons of the grease from the skillet. Add the thyme, onion and garlic to the skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook until mostly evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cream and heat until bubbly, 30 seconds. Gradually add the fontina, Cheddar, Romano and Gruyre in handfuls, letting each combine with the cream before adding the next. Add the pasta to the skillet along with a good pinch of salt and pepper.

Slowly add the flour mixture and beat on low until the dough is just combined; do not overwork.<br> Transfer the dough to the prepared pan, spreading it out as evenly as possible with a spatula. Cover with plastic wrap, then use your hands to press and flatten the dough into a smooth even layer. Remove the plastic and cut the dough with a sharp knife into approximately 1-by-3-inch bars. Use a fork to prick a decorative pattern into the tops.<br> Bake, rotating the pan from front to back halfway through, until golden, 60 to 70 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes in the pan, then re-cut the bars along the previous cuts. Carefully lift the bars off the parchment with a small spatula and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper. Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl until foamy. Spread the flour and bread crumbs out in 2 separate shallow bowls. Dredge a chop in the flour to coat all sides. Tap off any excess flour. Coat the chop with egg and let it drain for a second or so over the bowl. Lay it in the bread crumbs and turn a couple of times, patting the crumbs onto the chop to adhere. Set the chop on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining chops. Pour 1/2-inch of canola oil into a large, wide skillet. Heat over medium heat until the tip of the handle of a wooden spoon gives off a lively sizzle (about 375 degrees F). Add half the pork chops to the oil and cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer to an 11 by 15-inch baking dish or any baking dish that holds all the chops snugly, overlapping them along 1 side of the pan. Repeat with the remaining chops. Spoon as much of the onions and peppers from the vinegar as you like (about 1/2 cup works for me) over the chops. Drizzle vinegar over the chops and bake until no trace of pink remains near the bone, about 25 minutes. Serve right away. Cut the tops off the pineapples and discard. With a large knife, cut the rind off the pineapples leaving as little pineapple attached as possible. Put the rinds in a pot large enough to hold them comfortably and pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over low to medium heat and cook until the pineapple peel is very tender, about 30 minutes. Add water, if necessary, to keep the rinds submerged. Meanwhile, put the onions, oregano, peppercorns, garlic, habanero or other cl pepper, vinegar, and salt in a large jar with a tight-fitting lid. Strain the pineapple liquid into the jar. If there is not enough liquid to cover the ingredients, add more water to the pineapple and boil for 20 minutes. Taste and add a little more salt and/or a little vinegar, if you think it needs it. You can use it as soon as it cools, but it will get better as it sits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]&quot; 22475,&quot;Extra Crispy Korean-Style Chicken Wings Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup sriracha 1/4 cup soy sauce 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 tablespoon orange juice 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1 cup cornstarch 1 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds split chicken wings, tips removed 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds 2 scallions, thinly sliced Lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and set aside. Attach a deep fry thermometer to the side of a large Dutch oven or pot and fill halfway with oil, heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, combine the honey, sriracha, soy sauce, lime juice, orange juice and sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil.

Stir to dissolve the salt and add the rib roast. If the liquid does not cover all of the meat, flip the roast halfway through the marinating time. Or, consider pouring the marinade into a large plastic bag, adding the rib roast, and then sealing tightly so that the roast is completely surrounded by the brine. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. For the rub: In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, sage, paprika, parsley, garlic powder, white pepper, bread crumbs, coffee grounds, salt, and a nice grind or two of freshly ground black pepper. Remove the roast from the refrigerator and discard the brining liquid. Pat the roast dry with a paper towel. Using your hands, coat the roast on all sides with the rub, gently massaging it into the flesh. Let it rest on the counter to come to room temperature, about 1 hour. Place in a roasting pan and put it in the oven. Cook until medium-rare, 125 degrees F, about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover lightly with aluminum foil while the meat rests, 15 minutes. Slice between the ribs and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 22481,&quot;Indian Lamb Samosas with Fresh Mint Dipping Sauce 1 1/4 teaspoons garam masala 1 1/4 teaspoons cumin seeds 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 1/3 pounds ground lamb 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves, divided 3 cups fresh mint leaves 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice Oil, for frying 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 3/4 teaspoons salt, divided 6 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter or oil, divided Cold water as needed, usually about 10 tablespoons 1 cup minced onion, divided 4 teaspoons minced fresh ginger, divided 1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon minced fresh garlic, divided 3 hot green chiles, such as serrano, seeded and finely minced, divided 1 1/4 teaspoons ground coriander Instructions: Make the pastry by combining the flour and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and then rubbing 4 tablespoons of the ghee into the flour until well combined and mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the pastry comes together to form a ball, about 10 tablespoons. Knead the dough lightly and then form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 1 hour. While the dough is resting, make the filling. Heat the remaining ghee in a medium skillet and add 3/4 cup of the onion. Cook until the onion is lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the ginger, 1 tablespoon of the garlic, 1 of the chiles, coriander, garam masala, cumin seeds, turmeric, and cinnamon and cook until the spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the meat, 1 1/4 teaspoons of the remaining salt, 1/8 teaspoon of pepper and 1/4 cup hot water, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is very tender and the water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons of the cilantro and set aside to cool completely. While the filling is cooking, make the dipping sauce by combining the mint, remaining cilantro, remaining chopped onion, remaining ginger, remaining 1/4 teaspoon garlic, remaining green chiles, remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt, sugar, lemon juice, and 3 to 4 tablespoons water in the bowl of a processor and process until a fine, smooth puree is formed. (Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.) Set aside, refrigerated, until ready to serve the samosas. (Taste and season with additional salt and sugar, to taste, if necessary.) Divide the samosa dough into 10 portions and roll each piece of dough into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll each ball of dough into a circle about 5 inches in diameter (use a small bowl or the rim of a saucer and a sharp paring knife to trim the edges of the dough to form neat circles.) Cut each circle in half. Lightly moisten half of the straight edge of each half circle then bring the edges together to form a cone shape and press together to seal. Carefully spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling into the dough cone and push downward to compress the filling. Moisten the top edges with a bit of water and press together to seal. Repeat with the remaining portions of dough and filling. When you are ready to fry the samosas, heat a deep-fryer or a large saucepan filled with at least 2 inches of oil to about 340 degrees F. Fry the samosas, a few at a time and stirring to promote even cooking, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. (Note: these will float to the surface of the oil long before they are ready to be removed - make certain to cook them until the pastry is crispy and golden brown.) Remove using a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper-lined plate to drain. Repeat until all samosas have been fried. Serve immediately, with the fresh mint dippng sauce and/or your favorite chutney. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 22482,&quot;Creamy Oatmeal 1 cup steel-cut oats 4 cups milk Pinch kosher salt Two 3-inch-long cinnamon sticks 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/3 cup dried currants 3 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar Honey sugar maple syrup milk buttermilk yogurt or cream Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the oats and milk.

If you prefer, you could, fattoush-style, replace the tortilla chips with pita bread, which you split, toast, then break into shards. People can be awfully tiresome about anchovies (not that the rusty strips of something salty left to die on pizzas are what anchovies can truly taste of) and, anyway, they are not actually part of the original Caesar, so I haven&#39;t listed them below. However, in the interests of transparency I should tell you that I do add them to my own Quick Caesar when ransacking the kitchen to assemble this. I either mush one or two pinky brown fillets up in the dressing, or if I have some of those silvery marinated anchovies, like slim sardines, I just toss them in with the chicken.<br> Crack the egg into a bowl and whisk well, as you add the oils, Parmesan and lemon juice. If you&#39;re not going to add an anchovy or two, whisk in the salt. Break the crisp lettuce into bite-sized pieces and add to a salad bowl. Drop in the shredded cold chicken and mix to combine. Season with pepper, to taste. Toast the tortilla chips for a couple of minutes in an oil-less frying pan over medium heat. Give the dressing another whisk, pour it over the salad, and toss to mix. Add the tortilla chips (and some anchovies if you like) and toss again before wolfing down. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 22492,&quot;Shredded Lamb Sandwich with Dijon-Sambal Aioli and Spicy Potato Chips 2 cups shredded lamb shank meat 4 tablespoon Dijon-sambal aioli 4 sourdough rolls, or bread of your choice, toasted 1 tomato sliced 2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce Salt and black pepper to taste Kosher pickle spears (optional) 2 egg yolks* (See Disclaimer) 1 tablespoon sambal oelek 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 cups canola oil 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/2 tablespoon garlic, finely chopped Salt and black pepper, to taste Fryer with canola oil 4 large kennebeck or russet potatoes, sliced thinly and stored in ice water Chili Salt (3:1:1 kosher salt, sugar, chili powder) Instructions: In a large bowl, combine lamb with aioli and check for seasoning.
