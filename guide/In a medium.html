Spoon the mixture over the spaghetti squash. Pour the olive brine in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 8 hours or on HIGH for 3 to 4 hours. When ready to serve, using a fork, \loosen\ the squash slightly, creating spaghetti-like strands. Spoon the tomato sauce over the squash, top each piece with some tuna, string cheese, and basil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 54953,&quot;Snapper \Sandyport<br> 1 whole snapper Pinch salt and pepper Lemon juice 2 leaves spinach 2 shrimp, shelled 2 scallops 1 small onion, sliced 1/2 cup white wine 1/2 butter Pinch chopped parsley Teaspoon lemon juice Pinch white pepper Instructions: To prepare the snapper: De-bone and fillet the snapper and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Lay the fillets on a work surface. Place 1 spinach leaf on each fillet and top with onion, shrimp and scallop. Roll and secure with toothpicks. Cook with white wine in baking pan for 20 minutes and serve with lemon butter sauce. Lemon Butter Sauce: Mix all ingredients together and heat in a saucepan, then pour over. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54954,&quot;Cuban Sandwich with Plantain Chips 1 (1 1/2-pound) pork rib loin end roast Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large French baguette, halved lengthwise and cut in quarters 1/4 cup spicy brown mustard 1/3 pound thinly sliced deli ham 1 large dill pickle, thinly sliced lengthwise 1/4 pound thinly sliced Swiss cheese 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 cups canola oil, for frying 2 large green plantains Kosher salt Instructions: For the sandwich: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Have the pork at room temperature. Season it with salt and pepper. Put the roast into a baking pan and roast until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F, 40 to 45 minutes. Cover the pork with foil and let it rest for 15 minutes. If not using right away, the roast can be wrapped and refrigerated for up to 2 days. When you are ready to make the sandwich, thinly slice about three-quarters of the pork roast (reserve the remaining one-quarter for Round 2 Recipe Black Bean and Pork Stew). Heat a grill pan over medium heat. Spread a thin layer of mustard on both sides of the bread pieces. Place 2 slices ham on the bottom half of each. Top with the sliced pork roast, then the pickles, and then the Swiss cheese. Place the top half of the baguette on top. Brush the grill with canola oil and place the sandwiches, cheese side down, onto the grill. Set a baking sheet on top of the sandwich and weigh it down with a heavy skillet or pot. Cook until the bottom is crisp and the cheese is starting to melt, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the sandwich over, replace the baking sheet and weight, and cook another 3 to 4 minutes. For the plantain chips: In a 2-inch deep cast iron skillet, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Peel the plantains by slicing off about 1-inch from the top and bottom of each. With a paring knife, make a slice on each side the length of the plantain, making sure to go just deep enough to cut through the skin but not cut into the flesh. Peel the skin off to expose the flesh. If you have trouble peeling the skin then cut it off in strips with the knife. Cut each plantain in half and, using the slicing side of a box grater, slice the halves into thin chips. Cook the plantain slices in batches until they crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on brown paper or paper towels and season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 54955,&quot;Waffled Turnover 1 package (2 sheets) frozen puff pastry, thawed 1 1/2 cups apple pie filling, coarsely chopped<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the waffle iron Instructions: Preheat a large square Belgian waffle iron.

Place 3 tablespoons apple pie filling in the center and fold the pastry over to form a triangular pocket. Use a fork to crimp the edges. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry squares and apple filling. Spray the waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray. Place 1 turnover into each of the 4 square areas on the waffle iron. Close the top and cook for 4 1/2 to 5 minutes; the pastry will be golden brown and toasted.

Pulse the chocolate wafers, sugar and orange zest in a food processor until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse to combine. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the side of the prepared plate. Bake until set, 15 to 20 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Combine the chocolate and heavy cream in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until smooth. Pour into the cooled crust and spread over the bottom and up the side; set aside until the chocolate sets, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Sprinkle the gelatin over 3 tablespoons water in a large bowl; let sit 5 minutes. Combine the milk, 2/3 cup sugar, the egg yolks, pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger and salt in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until the mixture bubbles, 6 to 8 minutes.

Check it after about 10 minutes; it should be a medium-brown color (not too light, not too burned). Once it reaches that color, take it off the heat and let it cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cooled brown butter and brown sugar until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix, scraping the sides of the bowl. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix until combined. Fold in the walnuts and white chocolate chips. Press the mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Bake the blondies for about 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few crumbs stuck to it (I like these blondies gooey, so I go with a little less time). Let cool completely on a wire rack, then cut them and wrap individually in plastic wrap so the sides don&#39;t dry out. Store in the freezer or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 54967,&quot;Top Sirloin in Shiitake Beef Broth 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 ounces sliced shiitake mushroom caps 5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced One 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped 4 cups beef broth 3 tablespoons soy sauce Kosher salt and finely ground black pepper 12 ounces top sirloin steak, very thinly sliced by a butcher 2 cups cooked short grain rice 1 Persian cucumber, thinly sliced 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced 1 small hot red cl, thinly sliced Kimchi, as needed Lime wedges, for serving Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until hot.

Grease three 8-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Combine the hot water, chocolate and coffee powder and whisk to dissolve. Set aside to cool for a few minutes. Sift the granulated sugar, cocoa powder, flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the buttermilk and oil to the chocolate mixture. Add the chocolate mixture, eggs and vanilla to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Beat with an electric mixer on low until the dry ingredients are moistened, about 30 seconds. Give the bowl a scrape with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat the batter for 2 minutes. Divide the batter equally among the 3 prepared pans, about 1 pound of batter per pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out almost clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 12 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely. Wrap the cake layers in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour before assembling. For the peanut butter buttercream: Beat the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until it is glossy and creamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Working in batches, slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar, allowing each addition to be incorporated. Once all the confectioners&#39; sugar has been added, scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula and then beat the mixture on medium speed until no lumps remain and the mixture is smooth and thick, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the milk, vanilla and salt and mix on low speed to combine. Give the bowl and the paddle another scrape, then increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for about 5 minutes. Add the peanut butter and beat until combined. If the icing appears to be too thick, thin it by adding more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time. To assemble the cake: Place one of your refrigerated cake layers on a cake circle or serving dish and spread about 1 cup of peanut butter buttercream evenly across the cake. Place a second layer on top, press down slightly and spread another 1 cup buttercream evenly over the top of the cake. Top with the third layer. Give the cake a crumb coat by placing a large dollop of buttercream on top of the cake and spreading it to the edges of the cake and down the sides to seal in any crumbs. Refrigerate the 3-layer cake for about 20 minutes. Use the remaining buttercream to frost the top and sides of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Merlot]&quot; 54969,&quot;Asian Chicken and Rice Salad 1 container Minute?

Wash the potatoes, prick them with a fork and place them on a sheet pan. Bake them until very soft, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Resist roasting them at a higher temperature to speed up the process--you want the skin and flesh just inside the skin to become crusty.) Cool them slightly and scoop out the insides. Rice the scooped potato with a ricer, or mash them with a fork. Place them in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth to retain their heat. The potatoes must be used while they are still very warm. Beat the eggs and yolk lightly together in a small bowl. Add them to the potatoes along with the flour, rosemary, salt, a few grinds of freshly ground black pepper. Mix gently with your hands until all the ingredients are well incorporated and the dough is smooth. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured flat surface. Lightly knead and add a little more flour if the dough is overly sticky. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, uncovered. Roll the dough into thin 1/2-inch thick logs and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Using a generous amount of flour, press each piece against your thumb tip to make a dent or roll it over the back and off the tip of a floured fork tines to make the traditional ridged shape. Place the finished gnocchi on a lightly floured sheet pan. Cook them as soon as possible in boiling salted water. (For every 5 quarts of water add 2 tablespoons of kosher salt.) Add the gnocchi to the boiling water. When they rise to the top, let them cook for a minute or two and then remove them with a slotted spoon.

Spray two 8-inch cake pans with nonstick cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment. Spray the parchment and dust with flour. Whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Beat together the butter and sugar in a stand mixer until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs one at time and beat until incorporated. Add the sour cream and continue to beat until fully incorporated. Then add the vanilla. Stir together the instant espresso powder with the hot water in a spouted measuring cup. With the mixer running, add the dry ingredients in two additions, alternating with the espresso. Divide the batter between the cake pans and bake until a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a rack for 10 minutes, then remove the cakes to the rack to cool completely. Slice a thin layer from the top of each cooled cake with a serrated knife to remove the domed top. With a serrated knife, slice the layers in half horizontally to make 4 layers. Spread buttercream on the cut side of a layer and sandwich another layer on top. Repeat with the remaining frosting and layers, leaving the last top layer unfrosted. Apply a thin crumb-coat of frosting to the entire cake and chill in the refrigerator at least 15 minutes to set. Use the remaining frosting to generously frost the cake. Put the egg whites and sugar into a large bowl set over a double boiler. Whisk constantly until the sugar melts and the mixture is very thin and warm. Pour the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Turn to low speed and continue beating until cool, about 10 minutes. Turn the mixer to medium speed and whisk in the butter in small pieces. (The mixture may look curdled before it comes together.) Add the vanilla extract.

Pulse together, then add the egg yolks and blend. With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil to ensure the dressing is emulsified. Add the Parmesan, salt and pepper and blend again. For the salad: Wash and dry the hearts of romaine. Slice them across in 1-inch pieces and place them in a large bowl. Drizzle about half of the dressing over. Use a vegetable peeler to shave off a handful of large, thin slices of Parmesan. Add them to the lettuce. Give it a good initial toss, just so you can evaluate how much more dressing you need. Add more dressing and Parmesan to taste. Tip onto a serving platter. Place the Not-Knots on top and shave over more Parmesan. For the foolproof pizza dough: Sprinkle the yeast over 1 1/2 cups of warm (not lukewarm) water. Let stand for a few minutes. Combine the flour and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Turn the mixer on low speed and drizzle in the oil until combined with the flour. Next, pour in the yeast mixture and mix until just combined and the dough comes together in a sticky mass. Coat a separate mixing bowl with a light drizzle of olive oil and form the dough into a ball. Toss to coat the dough in the oil, then cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set it aside for at least 1 or up to 2 hours at room temperature, or store in the fridge until you need it, up to 4 days ahead. Bring the refrigerated dough to room temperature before using. For the garlic butter: Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat, then add the garlic and salt. Cook for a couple of minutes to release the flavor, but don&#39;t let the garlic brown. For the not-knots: Grease a baking sheet with olive oil. Pinch off balls of the dough about 1 inch in diameter and roll into round balls, then place the balls on the oiled baking sheet. Cover and let rise for 2 hours. Meanwhile, combine the garlic butter and Parmesan in a pan and stir together over medium-low heat until melted. Pour into a metal bowl large enough to toss the balls in. Heat a deep pan of oil to 350 degrees F and fry the balls, stirring them so they cook evenly, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.

Tie the parsley stems, peppercorns, and thyme in a piece of cheesecloth and add to the pot. Bring to a boil over high heat and immediately lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, about 12 minutes. Drain; discard the herb bundle and transfer the potatoes to a bowl. While the potatoes are cooking make the dressing. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, parsley, shallots, the remaining 2 teaspoons of the salt and pepper. Gradually whisk in the oil to make a dressing. Toss the warm potatoes with the dressing gently so as not to break up the potatoes. Allow the salad to sit at room temperature for 1 hour to marinate, tossing several times to coat the potatoes.

Cut the potatoes in quarters lengthwise. Using a paring knife and plenty of patience, cut each quarter into 1 or 2 torpedo- or oval-shaped pieces. Place in a large bowl of cold water while you finish the rest. Add the potatoes to the boiling water and blanch for just under 4 minutes. (This really depends on the size of your potatoes, but be sure to not cook them for potato salad; this is just to get them slightly tender--you shouldn&#39;t be able to get a fork through them. The oven will do the rest.) Remove the potatoes from the water to a paper towel-lined plate until slightly cooled. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Pour the potatoes into a large bowl and drizzle over enough olive oil to coat all sides. On a large baking sheet with sides, add the thyme and rosemary (whole) to make a bed of sorts. Pour out the potatoes onto the sheet and space them evenly so the air can circulate as they roast. Season the entire sheet with a pinch of salt. Roast the potatoes until golden brown on the edges and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 55012,&quot;Sweet Angel Hair Vermicelli 1/2 cup heavy cream 3 teaspoons sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons orange zest 3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) 1 tablespoon flaked (blanched and sliced) almonds, plus extra, for garnish 2 teaspoons raisins or sultanas (golden raisins) 4 1/2 ounces very thin vermicelli, also known as seviyan* 4 1/2 ounces sugar 10 1/2 ounces water, plus more, if necessary Instructions: For the orange cream: Whisk together heavy cream, sugar, and orange zest in a bowl until the mixture is well combined and soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Chill the whipped cream in the refrigerator until ready to use.<br> For the vermicelli: Heat the ghee in pan over a medium heat. Add the flaked almonds and raisins or sultanas, and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the almonds are golden brown. Add the vermicelli, and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Add the sugar, reduce the heat to low, and stir well until it has dissolved.<br> Add the water, and stir well, then cover the pan with a lid, and simmer on the lowest heat for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the vermicelli strands are soft. Add water as necessary to stop the mixture from drying out. Turn off the heat and steam the vermicelli mixture over the residual heat for 3 to 4 minutes. When cooked through, separate the vermicelli strands with a fork and gently fluff them.<br> To serve the dish, divide the sweet angel hair vermicelli among 4 serving dishes.

Place meat and bone in a pressure cooker and cover with water. Pressure cook for 45 minutes. Release pressure, then clean and chop meat and strain broth. This can be divided into 4 portions of starter. Freeze 3 of the portions for future use and set the remaining portion aside. For the glace: Put flour and salt in food processor. While it&#39;s running, stream in the eggs. Mix thoroughly. Put bench flour on a table, then dump dough out and knead to combine. Let rest 20 minutes. Flour table again and roll to about 1/4-inch thick, then cut into small squares with a pizza cutter. Make sure there&#39;s enough flour so the dumplings don&#39;t stick together. Rough them up in your hands to make them rustic looking. Put into a dry strainer and shake off excess flour. For the soup: Combine the reserved ham starter, ham base, green beans and their juice and potatoes in a pot. Add water to fill about three-quarters of the way. Bring it all to a boil. Add the glace directly to the pot and cook until they float. Combine the evaporated milk, sour cream and heavy cream in a separate bowl. Add some hot broth and whisk until completely smooth. Add the tempered cream mixture to the soup. Add salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. Let simmer together for 45 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55015,&quot;Eggs Over Easy 2 eggs (the fresher the better) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat a small non-stick skillet over low heat and add butter. As soon as the butter stops foaming, crack the eggs into the pan. Lift the handle about an inch so that the eggs pool in the far corner of the pan. Hold for 30 seconds or until the whites start to set, then lower the handle and give the pan a jiggle just to make sure there&#39;s no sticking. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and continue to cook over low heat until the whites become opaque. Jiggle to loosen the eggs, then lift the pan, holding it about a foot above the heat. Now, flip the eggs over by pushing the pan away and snapping upward simultaneously. Once the eggs start their somersault, raise the pan to meet them so that the exposed yolks experience the softest landing possible. The goal of course is to avoid breaking the yolks. If you succeed, count to 10 slowly then flip the eggs again, slide them onto a plate and serve. If the yolks do break, act like you meant them to, fry for another minute and serve. They&#39;ll still taste great. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 55016,&quot;Asparagus Salad 3 cups balsamic vinegar 1 head radicchio, julienned 1 bunch fresh spinach, cleaned and chopped 2 heads endive, julienned 1 bunch watercress 1 bunch arugula, cleaned and stems cut back 6 shallots, diced 24 spears pencil asparagus, blanched and refreshed 3 plum tomatoes, quartered 1/4 tablespoon olive oil 1 carrot, peeled and shaved into strips with peeler Instructions: In a saucepan reduce balsamic vinegar until thick and malty.

Allow it to stand until foamy, about 8 minutes. Using a standing mixer with a paddle attachment or an electric mixer, mix the remaining sugar, butter, milk powder, and salt until well blended. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. Mix in the remaining 1 cup of warm water, and the yeast mixture, then 3 cups flour, 1 cup at a time. Using a rubber spatula, mix in another 1 cup of flour, scraping down the sides of the bowl frequently (dough will be soft and sticky). Sprinkle 1/4 cup of flour onto a work surface and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if sticky, about 8 minutes. Butter a large bowl, add the dough, and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm area until doubled, about 2 1/2 hours. Glaze: Butter 2 (10-inch) round cake pans with 2-inch high sides. Beat the brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, honey, corn syrup, and water in a medium bowl to blend. Spread half of the glaze in the bottom of each prepared pan. Equally divide the pecans into each pan. Punch the dough down and divide it in half. Roll each piece of dough out on a floured work surface to a 12 by 10-inch rectangle. Brush any excess flour off the dough. In a small bowl mix the sugar, and cinnamon. Brush the melted butter over the dough rectangles and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar, dividing equally. Starting at 1 long side, tightly roll up each rectangle into a log. Cut each log into 12 rounds. Arrange the 12 rounds, cut side down, in each prepared pan, spacing evenly. Cover with plastic wrap. At this point the buns can be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated. Let the buns rise in a warm area until almost doubled, about 1 hour (or 1 hour 25 minutes if refrigerated). Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the buns until deep golden brown, about 30 minutes. Run a small knife around the pan sides to loosen the sticky buns. Turn the hot buns out onto a platter. Cool about 30 minutes and then drizzle with royal icing. In the bowl of a stand mixer (or with a hand mixer), beat the egg whites with the lemon juice until they are combined. Add the sifted confectioners&#39; sugar and beat on low speed until smooth. The icing needs to be used immediately or transferred to an airtight container. Royal icing hardens when it is exposed to air. *RAW EGG WARNING: Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.

Grease an 8-inch square baking pan. Combine sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Beat in the eggs until smooth, and then work in the heavy cream. Add the vanilla, stir to combine, and then the bread cubes. Let stand so that bread soaks up custard. Place the raisins in the greased pan. Top with the bread mixture, which prevents the raisins from burning. Bake for approximately 25 to 30 minutes or until the pudding has a golden brown color and is firm to the touch. If a toothpick inserted in the pudding comes out clean, it is done. The mixture should be moist, not runny or dry. Cool to room temperature. Make the whiskey sauce: Place cream in a small saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Whisk cornstarch and water together, and add to cream while whisking. Bring to a boil. Whisk and let simmer for a few seconds, taking care not to burn the mixture on the bottom. Remove from heat. Stir in the sugar and the bourbon. Taste to make sure the sauce has a thick consistency, a sufficiently sweet taste, and a good bourbon flavor. Cool to room temperature. Make the meringue: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 6 (6-ounce) ramekins and set aside. Make certain that the bowl and whisk are completely clean. The egg whites should be completely free of yolk, and they will whip better if they are at room temperature. This dish needs a good, stiff meringue. In the bowl of an electric mixer (or in a large bowl with a hand mixer), whip egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy. Add the sugar gradually, and continue whipping until shiny and thick. Test with a clean spoon. If the whites stand up stiff, like shaving cream when you pull out the spoon, the meringue is ready. Do not over-whip, or the whites will break down and the souffle will not work. In a large bowl, break half of the bread pudding into pieces using your hands or a spoon. Gently fold in 1/4 of the meringue, being careful not to lose the air in the whites. Add a portion of this base to each of the ramekins. Place the remaining bread pudding in the bowl, break into pieces, and carefully fold in the rest of the meringue. Top off the souffles with this lighter mixture. Smooth and shape tops with a spoon into a dome over the ramekin rim. Bake immediately for approximately 20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve immediately. Using a spoon, at the table, poke a hole in the top of each souffle, and pour the room temperature whiskey sauce inside the souffle. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 55025,&quot;Ginger Soy Sauce 1 tablespoons ginger root, minced or grated 1 garlic clove, finely minced 1/3 cup chicken stock 1/4 cup lite soy sauce 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon sugar Freshly ground black pepper to taste Instructions: In a bowl, combine all ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55026,&quot;Caramallow Campbanana Crunchies 1 recipe rice cereal treats (recommended: Rice Krispies Treats) prepared according to instructions on the box 1 cup milk 1/2 cup sugar 3 to 6 tablespoons instant flour (recommended: Wondra) or enough as needed to adjust the thickness of the sauce 1 1/2 cups (1 12-ounce jar) caramel ice cream topping 3 or 4 bananas 1 cup mini marshmallows 1 quart vanilla ice cream Instructions: Press the rice cereal treat mixture evenly into a 13 by 9 by 2-inch pan coated with cooking spray.

Place the sugar and water in a heavy-bottomed saucepot over low heat. Let the sugar dissolve. Carefully brush the walls of the pot with a little water to prevent the sugar from crystallizing on the sides. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil until the syrup turns golden brown. Remove from the heat promptly and carefully divide the hot caramel among the 6 ramekins. Let cool for at least 2 minutes. In a medium saucepan, bring the milk and cream to just below a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, mix together the egg yolks, caster sugar, and vanilla in a large mixing bowl. Place the mixing bowl on top of a towel to keep it from wobbling while whisking in the hot liquid. Gently whisk 2 tablespoons of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Slowly whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture 1/3 at a time, trying to prevent excess bubbles. Strain though a sieve. Place 6 ramekins evenly spaced in a paper towel-lined baking dish to prevent the ramekins from sliding. Pour 6 ounces into each caramel-coated ramekin. Place on the extended middle rack of the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the baking dish until 2/3 of the way up the sides of the ramekins. (Be careful not to get any water on the custard mixture.) Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and very gently slide it towards the center of the rack. Bake for about 35 minutes, or until the custards are almost fully set. Remove from the oven. Use tongs to remove the ramekins from the hot water bath. Let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes, then refrigerate until well chilled. To serve, dip the ramekin in very hot water for 15 to 20 seconds. Run a sharp knife around the sides of the ramekin. Invert the custards onto serving plates.

Add half of the butter and pulse until combined. Add the remaining butter; pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add 5 tablespoons ice water; pulse a few more times until the dough just holds together when pinched (add up to 1 more tablespoon ice water if needed). Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and gather together using the plastic wrap. Transfer about one-sixth of the dough to another piece of plastic wrap and pat into a disk. Pat the remaining dough into a larger disk; wrap both in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out the larger disk of dough into a 12-inch round (about ? inch thick) on a lightly floured surface. Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate; fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edge with your fingers. Refrigerate until firm, 15 to 30 minutes. Roll out the smaller disk of dough until about 1/4 inch thick; cut out shapes using 2-inch cookie cutters. Place the cutouts on a small parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, 15 to 30 minutes. Line the crust with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until the edge is lightly golden, about 20 minutes; remove the foil and beans and continue baking until the crust is dry and golden on the bottom, about 15 more minutes. Meanwhile, brush the cutouts with water and sprinkle with sanding sugar; bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Let the crust and cutouts cool completely. While the crust cools, make the filling: Prick the sweet potatoes all over with a fork. Bake until very soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool slightly, then peel and puree the flesh in a food processor until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl; add the half-and-half, granulated sugar, eggs, brandy, vanilla, cinnamon and salt and whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled crust. Bake until the filling just starts setting, 30 to 35 minutes. Arrange the cutouts on the pie and continue baking until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set and puffed in the center, about 30 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely, about 4 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55063,&quot;Smashed Hamburgers with Caramelized Onions Canola or grapeseed oil 4 cups (1/4-inch) sliced red onions (2 medium) 1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon good red wine vinegar 1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard powder, such as Colman\u2019s Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/4 pounds ground beef with 20% fat 1 1/4 cups grated Gruyre cheese (4 ounces) 4 sandwich potato rolls, such as Martin\u2019s Ketchup, for serving Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large (12-inch) saut pan over medium heat, add the onions, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender and starting to brown.

Smear the tomato paste over the bones with a spoon. Add the carrots, celery, onion, leeks, and garlic. Return to oven and roast for 1 additional hour. Into a large stockpot, add the roasted bones, roasted vegetables, thyme, rosemary, and parsley and 16 cups of water. Discard fat from roasting pan. Place roasting pan directly onto stovetop and heat on medium for 1 minute. Remove from heat and immediately add 1/2 cup to 1 cup of water to the roasting pan, scraping up the brown bits. Add the deglazed liquid to the stockpot. Bring the liquid to a tremble (190 degrees F), and simmer for 8 hours, skimming and discarding the froth frequently during the first hour. Pour the stock in batches through a large fine sieve and discard the solids. Skim off the fat. (Alternatively, cool the stock, uncovered, and chill, covered. Scrape away and discard congealed fat from the chilled stock.) Gently simmer the stock, skimming the froth occasionally, until it is reduced to about 4 cups, about 1 hour. Before storing the stock cool it completely, about 1 hour, uncovered. Stock keeps, 1 week when covered and chilled or, 3 months when frozen in airtight containers, Cook&#39;s Note: If desired, pour the cooled stock into ice-cube trays and freeze. Frozen cubes keep 3 months in heavy-duty resealable plastic bags. Stocks are key to any restaurant as they are the base of so many recipes. When you go to cooking school, learning how to make stocks is one of the first things you do. Although this might seem laborious when you can just go to the grocery store and get one out of a box, there is nothing better than a homemade stock to add that extra depth to anything you might be making, whether it&#39;s a soup, a sauce, a braise or a roast. Just pick a rainy day when you have some stuff to do around the house, get your ingredients and go for it! You won&#39;t regret it. The best part about this is that you can freeze it in containers and use it for up to three months. Time very well spent. Not to say that grocery store stocks are bad, they do the job and if you really don&#39;t have the time, it&#39;s a great alternative. When roasting the bones, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s time to add the vegetables when they&#39;re an irresistible golden brown color, almost caramelized by the glistening fat. You can&#39;t get any better than that! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55069,&quot;Chorizo 15 pounds pork butt, freshly ground 5 ounces salt 12 ounces sugar 6 ounces paprika 3 ounces red pepper 3 ounces garlic powder 2 1/2 ounces oregano 2 1/2 ounces black pepper 8 ounces water 12 ounces vinegar Instructions: Mix all ingredients well and cook over medium high heat in skillet until cooked through and flavorful. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 55070,&quot;Sweet and Crunchy Low-Fat Cookie 3/4 cup brown sugar 3/8 cup margarine 2 egg whites 2 1/2 cups whole grain wheat flour 1 cup part skim milk ricotta cheese 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1 dash ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 4 cups sorbet 25 fresh mint leaves Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the yolks with the vanilla. Whisk in half the sugar and continue to beat until very light and frothy, about 5 minutes, either by hand, with a hand mixer set at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip. Combine the flour and cornstarch and sift once to aerate. In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt until they hold a very soft peak, either by hand, with a hand mixer set at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip. Beating faster, add the remaining sugar in a very slow stream, beating until the egg whites hold a firm peak. Fold the yolk mixture into the whites with a rubber spatula. Sift the flour and cornstarch over the eggs in 3 additions, folding them in gradually. Do not overmix the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes, until it is well risen and feels firm when pressed gently with the palm of your hand. Immediately loosen the layer from the side of the pan with a small knife or spatula. Invert the layer onto a rack and leave the paper stuck to it. Turn the layer right side up and cool it on a rack.

Allow to sit for 30 minutes. Set up a dredging station by placing 1 cup of the flour into one dish, the eggs into a second and the cornmeal mixed with the remaining 1/4 cup flour into a third. Pat the green tomatoes dry on both sides. Season with more kosher salt, then dip a slice into the flour first, shaking off any excess, then into the egg and finally the cornmeal. Place onto a sheet tray lined with a rack and repeat with the remaining tomato slices. Make sure to pat the cornmeal onto the tomato firmly to ensure it\u2019s tightly coated. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a large, high sided saute pan and turn on the heat to low. Add the pancetta and smashed garlic and gently cook to slowly render the fat, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is crispy and most of the fat has rendered out, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the pancetta with a slotted spoon onto a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle the lobster tails with kosher salt. Add into the pan, cut side down, and sear for 2 to 3 minutes, until they begin to turn pink. Add the white wine and cover the pan to steam the lobster for another 1 to 2 minutes to finish cooking. Remove the lobster tails onto a sheet tray and allow to cool slightly. Add the cherry tomatoes and crushed red pepper and season with kosher salt. Cook until the cherry tomatoes begin to burst, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the chicken stock and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced and slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard the smashed garlic. Season with kosher salt if needed. Carefully remove the meat from lobster shells and discard the shells. Toss the lobster meat into the sauce to quickly warm. Heat a large saute pan with the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil over medium heat. Add half of the breaded green tomatoes (you want to cook these in two batches) and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until crispy on the underside. Carefully flip, then cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove onto a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil, then transfer to a sheet tray lined with a rack so they remain crispy. Season immediately with kosher salt. Set up a fryer with vegetable oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry the basil leaves until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Be careful because as they will pop in the oil. Remove the basil leaves onto a paper-towel-lined sheet tray. To serve, plate 2 fried green tomatoes and top with 2 lobster halves. Spoon the burst cherry tomato and pancetta sauce around the green tomatoes, making sure not to smother them so the fried tomatoes don\u2019t get soggy.

Pull out a length of plastic wrap for the brisket and drizzle some oil where you plan to place the brisket. Place the brisket on top and drizzle the top with oil. Wrap tightly and rest at room temperature for 2 hours. If you are making this ahead of time, you can refrigerate, then rest on the counter for 2 hours before braising. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to swirl, add the brisket and sear on all sides until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate. Add the onions, carrots and potatoes to the pot and cook for a few minutes to coat them in the fat and get a bit of color. Make the contents of the pot as level as possible, toss in the garlic, then place the seared brisket on top of the vegetables. Stir together the BBQ sauce and stock in a medium bowl. Add to the pot around the brisket, being careful to only fill halfway up the brisket, leaving a bit of the seared meat above the liquid line (you may not use all the liquid). Raise to a boil and lower to a low simmer. Cook, covered, for 2 to 3 hours without peeking, until the brisket is tender! Remove the brisket from the pot to a plate and cover gently with aluminum foil. Remove the vegetables from the pot with a slotted spoon and place in a food processor. Blitz until smooth, adding liquid from the pot if needed for texture. Use the remaining liquid as a sauce for the brisket, if desired. Transfer the mash to a bowl and fold in the parsley.

Mix in the cold butter with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Work in egg yolks and 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water until the dough holds together without being too sticky. If it&#39;s still crumbly, add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Form into a ball, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. On a floured surface, roll the dough into an 11 to 12-inch circle with a floured rolling pin. Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie pan, pressing firmly into the bottom and sides. Trim the excess dough, then pinch the edges. Refrigerate until ready to fill. Filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Split the pumpkins down the middle and scoop out the seeds. Arrange on a roasting tray, cut side up, and roast for 20 minutes. Remove the pumpkins from the oven and lay bananas (in their skins) around and between the pumpkin halves. Return to the oven and roast for another 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool slightly before handling, about 5 minutes. Scoop out the pumpkin flesh and add to a food processor. Peel the bananas and add the flesh to food processor as well. Add the 3 eggs, sugar, cinnamon, 2 tablespoons butter, nutmeg, heavy cream and salt. Puree until smooth. Put a baking sheet on the bottom oven rack and preheat to 375 degrees F. Pour the filing into the prepared pie shell. Lightly beat the egg white. Brush the pastry edges with the egg white and sprinkle with a bit of sugar. Carefully arrange the pie on the preheated baking sheet, lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and bake it until the pie is set but still jiggles slightly, about 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely. Topping: Beat the egg whites, powdered sugar, cream of tartar, and a pinch salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until glossy medium peaks form, being careful not to over beat. Spread the meringue mixture over the top of the pie, covering right to the edges. Using the back of a spoon press lightly into the meringue and pull up on the spoon to form peaks all over the surface of the meringue (alternatively you can use a piping bag with a large star tip if you choose). To cook the meringue, preheat the broiler with the rack in the highest position. Put the pie under the broiler and broil until the meringue is set and golden brown, about 7 minutes, watching carefully to avoid burning, as it cooks quickly. Remove from the broiler and cool before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 55104,&quot;Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies 2 1/4 cups flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 sticks butter, softened 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup packed brown sugar 2 large eggs, beaten 1 tablespoon vanilla 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa 2 cups chocolate chips, 2 Hershey&#39;s chocolate bars, chopped or M&amp;M&#39;S 1 cup chopped walnuts (optional) Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. Drain well and pat livers dry. In a large skillet cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crisp and all of the fat is rendered, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the bacon and transfer to paper towels to drain. Set bacon aside. Reserve the bacon drippings. Add the livers and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add the shallots, garlic, thyme, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, and the pepper and cook until the livers are just slightly pink and the shallots are soft, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add the cognac and cook until the liquid has evaporated and the livers are cooked through but still tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large shallow bowl to cool. Once cooled, place the liver mixture together with any drippings in the bowl of a food processor and add the cream cheese and 1/2 pound butter and process until smooth. Add salt to taste if necessary. Spoon the mixture into small ramekins or serving bowls and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 4 to 6 hours. While the mousse is chilling, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat in a large skillet and add the onions. Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and the sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are very soft and caramelized, about 20 minutes. If the onions begin to toughen or get too dark around the edges before they are soft and caramelized, add a bit of water, as necessary. Season the onions with salt and pepper, to taste, transfer to a small bowl and set aside until ready to serve the mousse. Crumble the crisp-cooked bacon into a small bowl. To serve the mousse, place the ramekins on a plate and serve with the toasted croutons. The caramelized onions and crumbled bacon should be nearby in small bowls for guests to garnish their mousse-spread croutons. (Alternatively, spread the mousse on the croutons and garnish with the onions and crumbled bacon and pass the assembled hors d&#39;oeuvres on a platter.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55113,&quot;Warm Chocolate Pudding with Whipped Cream and Chocolate Shavings 1/4 cup sugar, or to taste 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 large egg yolks 2 cups milk 6 ounces good quality dark, sweet chocolate, melted 1/2 teaspoon vanilla Whipped cream Chocolate shavings Cigarette cookies to garnish Instructions: In a saucepan combine the sugar, cornstarch, salt, egg yolks and whisk the mixture until combined.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Whisk the eggs, milk, Worcestershire sauce and 2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl until completely combined. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender and lightly golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.<br> Add 3 tablespoons of the ketchup and cook until most of the moisture has evaporated and the mixture is thick and brick red colored, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the onions cool slightly. Then add them to the beaten eggs and mix to combine.<br> Add the beef to the egg and onion mixture. Break up the meat with a fork or wooden spoon, and then mix to thoroughly combine; you don&#39;t want to see any lumps of raw beef. Add the panko and mix to combine. Stir the meat vigorously with a wooden spoon for about 7 seconds; it will become more homogenous and tackier.<br> Transfer the meat to the prepared baking sheet and shape into a 9-by-5-inch loaf. Smooth the top and evenly spread the remaining ketchup over top. Bake for 5 minutes, and then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, spread the farro in a medium skillet and set over medium heat. Cook the farro, stirring with a wooden spoon, until lightly toasted, about 6 minutes. (The farro will darken a shade and smell nutty and fragrant.) Add the farro to the boiling water and simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the grains are cooked through but still somewhat chewy, 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the type of farro. Drain well and discard the bay leaves.<br> Transfer to a serving bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add the olive oil or butter and toss to combine.

Add a third of the butter and process until combined. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal, about 3 times. Add the vinegar and pulse again twice. Gradually pour in 1/3 cup ice water, pulsing about 4 times until combined. Turn onto a clean surface and press into a cohesive dough without overworking (you should see bits of butter). Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and press into a 1-inch-thick disk. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before rolling out. For the filling: Simmer 3 cups of the blueberries with 1/2 cup of the light brown sugar and 2 tablespoons water until the mixture reduces by half, about 20 minutes. Pour into a bowl and stir in the remaining 4 cups blueberries, the remaining 1/2 cup light brown sugar, the tapioca, sambuca, lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Let cool completely. For the assembly: Divide the chilled dough in half and put 1 piece back in the refrigerator. Roll the other piece into a 12-inch-round, 1/8-inch-thick circle on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough onto a rolling pin, then unroll it into a 9-inch glass pie plate, letting it hang over the edge. Add the filling and dot the top with the butter. Roll out the other piece of dough and place over the filling. Press the crust edges together and trim, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Roll up or pinch the overhang to seal. Wrap an oiled, wide band of foil around the pie edge to protect the crust. Make 5 small slashes in the top of the crust from the center out, to make a star (similar to a star anise). Chill for 30 minutes. Place a foil-lined baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. When the pie is chilled, reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F, put the pie on the baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil band and continue to bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool completely before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55122,&quot;Roast Chicken and Vegetables with Gremolata Butter 1 (5-pound) roasting chicken Essence, recipe follows 4 baking potatoes 1 large sweet onion 18 baby carrots Olive oil 2 lemons 6 garlic cloves 1 bunch fresh parsley 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Thoroughly season the inside and outside of the chicken with Essence. Cover the bird and return to the refrigerator for 1 hour to marinate. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the chicken on the center column of an angel food cake pan with the legs touching the bottom of the pan. Place the cake pan on top of a pizza pan or other flat pan with a small rim to catch any fat or juices which might escape. Roast the chicken for 2 to 2 1/2 hours (depending on your oven) until it&#39;s a beautiful coppery brown. Meanwhile, cut the potatoes in half widthwise. Place flat side down and have your child cut the halves in half. Repeat so that each potato is cut into 8 wedges. Place in a casserole dish. Repeat the process with the onion. Add the baby carrots. Drizzle veggies with some olive oil and Essence and toss. Cover and place in the oven after the chicken has been cooking for 1 hour. When chicken is done, remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Gremolata Butter: Using a damp washcloth on the counter, set a large bowl on top of cloth to keep bowl from moving around. Place a grater inside the bowl (I use a rubber topped grater with rubber feet for safety). Have your child grate the zest of 2 lemons using the medium holes of the grater. Explain to them that you only want the yellow skin. Have them grate 4 or 5 strokes and turn the lemon. (No matter how careful they will be, some of the pith will get into the bowl. This is not a big deal! It won&#39;t ruin the taste. Besides, all you will taste is the love!) Clean off all the zest into the bowl and remove the grater. Next, take a garlic press and have your child press the garlic cloves into the bowl. There is no need to remove the skin from the garlic. Place the bunch of parsley on a cutting board. Using a mezzaluna or crescent knife with handles, help your child roughly chop the parsley. Gather the parsley up in a pile and turn the cutting board so they can continue chopping until it&#39;s finely chopped. Place the chopped parsley into the bowl. Add the room temperature butter. Mix well and set aside. If making gremolata butter ahead of time, refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve chicken and vegetables with a spoonful of gremolata butter on top.

Arrange the pears, cut sides up, on a baking sheet and dot with butter. Put the baking sheet in the oven and bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pears are just tender. Let cool. Increase the oven heat to 450 degrees F. Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour. Roll the dough out to a 14-inch round, about 1/4-inch thick. It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect. Transfer the dough to the back of a lightly floured baking sheet. Slice the pears and arrange them on the dough round by overlapping the slices in a spiral fashion, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Drizzle with the honey, scatter blue cheese over the top, and sprinkle with the almonds. Brush the border with the egg wash. Bring the edge of crust over onto the filling, leaving the fruit exposed in center. Gently fold and pinch the dough to seal any cracks. Brush the crust with the remaining egg wash and sprinkle with the sugar. Put the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the fruit is tender. Slide a knife under the crostata to loosen it from the pan. Then cut into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, and lemon zest in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and ice water and work that in with your hands. (Or do the whole thing in a food processor, pulsing a couple of times to combine the dry ingredients, then pulsing in the butter, and then the egg.) Check the consistency of the dough by squeezing a small amount together between thumb and forefingers: You want there to be just enough moisture to bind the dough so that it holds together without being too wet or sticky. If it&#39;s still crumbly, add a little more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time. When you get it to the right consistency, shape the dough into a disk and wrap it in plastic. Put it in the refrigerator and chill for at least 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 55124,&quot;Mango-Cucumber Rice Salad Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups rice blend 1/4 cup quinoa, rinsed Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime 2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil 1 teaspoon sugar Freshly ground pepper 1 cup chopped mango 1 cucumber, peeled, seeded and diced 1 red jalapeno, seeded and thinly sliced 2 scallions, thinly sliced 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1/3 cup chopped salted roasted peanuts Instructions: Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the rice and cook, stirring until tender, 25 to 35 minutes (depending on the rice blend). Meanwhile, bring a separate saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the quinoa and cook until tender, about 12 minutes. Drain the grains and rinse under cold water until cool; shake off the excess water.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Add the zest and juice of the lemon and 1 teaspoon of thyme leaves to the butter mixture. Set aside. Take the giblets out of the turkey and wash the turkey inside and out. Remove any excess fat and leftover pinfeathers and pat the outside dry. Place the turkey in a large roasting pan. Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the turkey cavity. Stuff the cavity with the bunch of thyme, halved lemon, quartered onion, and the garlic. Brush the outside of the turkey with the butter mixture and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the turkey. Roast the turkey about 2 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when you cut between the leg and the thigh. Remove the turkey to a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil; let rest for 20 minutes.

Place the almonds on a cookie sheet and toast them in the oven for about 8 to 10 minutes, then transfer to a wide ceramic platter to cool off. Do not leave them on the cookie sheet or they will continue to cook and burn. Turn oven up to 350 degrees F. In a stand mixer using a paddle attachment, beat 2 eggs, 2 yolks, melted butter, and 10 1/2 ounces sugar on medium speed. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, package of Lievito Pane degu Angeli, orange zest, and pinch of salt then slowly, one spoonful at the time, add the dry ingredients to the egg and sugar mixture and work until the dough forms and starts coming away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: The dough should not be too wet. If the dough crumbles, add an extra egg yolk to bind the ingredients. Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the almonds; do this final step by hand as the almonds would break if added into the mixer. Butter 2 cookie sheets and, using your hands, separate the dough in two equal parts that you will roll into cylinders approximately 2-inches thick by 8-inches long. In a small bowl mix 2 tablespoons sugar and one egg, then with a pastry brush glaze the cookie dough evenly and place the sheets in the oven. Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes, until the top has reached a nice golden brown color. Remove from the oven and rest on a cooling rack for about 1 hour, then using a bread knife, slice the cookies about 3/4-inch thick. To ensure a proper crunchiness, leave the cookies to rest uncovered through the night, and then toast them in the oven at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes on each side the day after.

Place the leeks in the pan and cook slowly, stirring to prevent browning, until soft and wilted, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Meanwhile, bring the remaining 1 1/4 cups olive oil to a simmer in a small saucepot; add the garlic. Reduce heat to low and cook until garlic is soft but still white, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside. Preheat the oven to its highest temperature with a pizza stone inside; at least 450 degrees F. Once the dough is at room temperature, it should be soft and pliable and shouldn&#39;t shrink back when you press it. Flatten a ball into a disc. (It is okay if the flattened disc isn&#39;t perfectly round at this point.) Place disc on a well-floured work surface and stretch the dough by hand into an 8- to 9-inch round that is 1/4-inch-thick, not pressing out the air bubbles. Place on a pizza peel or dry cutting board layered with a sprinkle of semolina flour. To assemble the pizza, spread the garlic oil evenly over the dough with a 1-ounce ladle. Add 3/4 cup leeks over the garlic oil and spread evenly. Place a soft-shell crab in the center of the pizza. Transfer the pizza to the oven using a smooth, quick motion to slide the pizza from the peel or cutting board to the stone. Bake until crust is browned evenly, crab is crispy and juices are bubbling, 9 to 16 minutes. Remove from the stone with a pizza peel. Cut into slices and garnish with a sprinkle of seafood seasoning, fresh shaved Parmesan and parsley and serve with lemon wedges. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 1 more pizza.

Heat the mixture over the simmering water for another 4 to 5 minutes, until it begins to thicken, stirring constantly. You don&#39;t want the eggs to scramble. Remove from the heat. Dissolve the gelatin in 1/4 cup cold water. Add the dissolved gelatin, banana and orange zest to the pumpkin mixture and mix well. Set aside to cool. Whip the heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until soft peaks form. Add the sugar and continue to whisk until you have firm peaks. Carefully fold the whipped cream into the pumpkin mixture and pour it into the cooled tart shell. Chill for 2 hours or overnight. For the decoration, whip the heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form. Add the sugar and vanilla and continue to whisk until you have firm peaks. Pipe or spoon the whipped cream decoratively on the tart and sprinkle, if desired, with orange zest. Serve chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 55132,&quot;Snowshoe Naan 2 1/2 cups warm water 1 teaspoon dry yeast 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour 4 to 5 cups unbleached hard white or all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon Nigella (black onion seed) Instructions: You will need a large bowl, and unglazed quarry tiles or a baking stone for the next-to-bottom rack of your oven. Place water in a large bread bowl, add yeast, and stir. Add whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour and stir well, then stir 100 times in the same direction to develop the gluten (one minute). Let this sponge stand for 1/2 hour to 3 hours, covered. Sprinkle salt over the sponge, then add another cup flour and stir. Continue adding flour and stirring until you can stir no longer. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead thoroughly, about ten minutes, until dough is smooth and easy to handle. Clean out bowl, oil lightly, and return dough to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a convenient place for 2 to 3 hours. When the dough has more than doubled in volume, push down gently and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and shape each into a flat oval shape, approximately 4 inches wide by 8 inches long. Leave these flat disks out on the work surface and cover with plastic wrap to let rise for approximately 20 minutes. Place quarry tiles or large baking stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven, leaving a 1 inch space between the tiles and the oven wall to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Five minutes after the oven has preheated, begin shaping the first bread. Place a small bowl full of cold water by the edge of your work surface. Using your fingertips, first dip them in the water and then, beginning at one end of the disk of dough, make tightly spaced indentations all over the surface of the dough, so that it looks pitted, though not pierced through. Now stretch the dough gently into a long oval strip by draping it over both hands and pulling them apart gently. The dough should stretch and give, and after several tries will extend to make a long oval about 12 inches long with attractive stretch marks along it from the stretched indentations (hence, the name \snowshoe bread). Place the bread back on the work surface, sprinkle with a pinch (less than 1/8 teaspoon) of black onion seeds, then using both hands, place the bread directly on heated quarry tiles or stone. While the bread bakes, begin to shape the next bread. Cooking time for each bread is approximately 4 minutes. You will soon develop a rhythm so that you can bake two breads side by side across your oven, one going in when the other is half done. When done, breads will have golden patches on top and a crusty browned bottom surface. To keep breads warm and soft, wrap them in a cotton cloth five minutes after they come out of the oven. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55133,&quot;SMOKY BBQ WINGS 3 to 4 pounds chicken wings 2 cups ketchup 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup orange juice 1/4 cup TABASCO? brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce 4 cloves garlic, grated 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Remove tips from chicken wings and discard.

Add the egg white and beat again until it incorporates into the butter and sugar, about 2 minutes. Sift the flour into the mixing bowl and beat on low speed until just combined. Add the 2 food colors and mix until a consistent orange-red is achieved. Transfer the paste to a disposable piping bag and snip a tiny hole in the end using scissors. Cut a sheet of parchment paper to fit inside a 15-by-10-inch jelly roll pan. Draw horizontal lines onto the paper using a pencil or pen in 1-inch increments. Flip the paper over so that the side with the drawn lines is touching the pan. You should be able to see the lines through the paper. Pipe lines of the cake decorating paste over the lines. Place the pan in the freezer while the sponge cake batter is prepared. For the whipped egg whites: In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the egg whites and granulated sugar together to stiff peaks. Set aside. For the sponge batter: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the almond flour, confectioners&#39; sugar, all-purpose flour, whole eggs and egg yolk until combined, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the orange gel food color and mix until incorporated. With a large rubber spatula, gently fold in the whipped egg whites, being careful to not deflate the batter. Remove the jelly roll pan from the freezer and pour the sponge batter on top. Smooth the batter gently using an offset spatula. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the cake springs back when pressed in the center. Remove from the oven and loosen the edges with a small knife. Turn the cake out onto a parchment sheet and peel away the lined parchment paper on top of the cake.<br> Sprinkle a tea towel with about 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar. Turn the sponge cake onto the tea towel striped-side down. Roll the cake into the tea towel from a short end. Fold the ends of the towel under and let the cake rest at room temperature while the pumpkin spice ganache is prepared. For the pumpkin spice ganache: Combine the heavy cream, pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice and orange food color in a large microwave-safe bowl. Whisk together until the ingredients are incorporated. Heat in the microwave at 30-second intervals until the mixture is hot and steaming but not boiling (about 1 minute). Immediately add the white chocolate to the steaming mixture and let stand 1 minute. Stir using a whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until set, about 1 1/2 hours. The mixture can also be poured into a shallow 13-by-9-inch baking dish to speed setting. For the buttercream: In a medium bowl, beat together the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and food color. Beat again until a consistent green color is achieved. Transfer half of the buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a leaf decorator piping tip (leaf tip #70). Transfer the other half to a piping bag with a tiny hole snipped in the end. For the assembly: Carefully unroll the cake and remove it from the tea towel. Allow the tightly curled end of the cake to remain curled. Spread the inside of the cake evenly with the chilled pumpkin spice ganache. Roll the cake up jelly roll style.<br> Combine the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 30-second intervals until the sugar is dissolved. Let cool slightly. Gently coat the outside of the cake roll with the sugar syrup using a pastry brush. Use just enough to remove the confectioners&#39; sugar appearance on the cake&#39;s exterior. You may not have to use all of the syrup.<br> Cut the cake evenly into 4 pieces using a serrated knife. Stand each piece upright on a large serving platter (or 4 small plates) so that the stripes are vertical. Break each wafer cookie in half and insert them upright into the centers of the cakes to create pumpkin stems.<br> Use the piping bag of green buttercream fitted with the leaf tip to pipe leaves next to the wafer stems.

Add the remaining potatoes, corned beef, cooking liquid, onion, garlic, mustard, parsley, thyme, and nutmeg. Season generously with pepper and mix well. Store in the refrigerator overnight or at least 3 hours. Set up for poaching the eggs: Combine the water, vinegar, and salt in a large skillet and bring to a gentle simmer. Preheat a large well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 cup of the butter and heat. When the foaming subsides, add the hash mixture and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Using a spatula, press the mixture down into a cake the size of the skillet. Cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the hash begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking, shaking the skillet to loosen the hash occasionally, until the underside is browned and crusty, about 6 minutes more. To flip the hash, set a plate the size of the skillet on top of the pan. Invert the pan so the hash falls on to the plate as an intact cake. Return the skillet to the medium-high heat; add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. When the foaming subsides, slide the hash into the skillet cooked-side up. Cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, for 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the underside is browned and crispy, about 5 minutes more. While the corned beef hash is cooking, crack an egg into a cup and carefully slide it into the hot poaching liquid. Quickly repeat with all the eggs.

You will end up with about 2 1/2 packed cups. Wrap the yuca in a cheesecloth or jelly strainer bag and wring out all the liquid to yield about 1 3/4 cups yuca resembling damp pre-grated Cheddar cheese; discard the liquid. The yuca should be damp enough to form a tight ball when squeezed. Wringing out the liquid is a very important step to achieve crisp casabitos. Place the yuca in a large bowl. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and work thoroughly into the yuca with your hands. Let this dough rest for 5 minutes. For the mamba: Meanwhile, combine the peanuts, oil, coconut sugar, paprika, cayenne and cumin in a blender. Blend for about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides as necessary, until the sauce is mostly smooth with some visible pieces of peanuts. Set aside until ready to serve. Continue making the casabitos: Divide the dough into 14 to 18 balls, each 25 to 27 grams (0.9 ounces; the size of a small-medium meatball). Grab a sheet of parchment paper, place 1 ball in the center and fold the parchment over it. Press down with your palm to flatten the ball, then roll it about 1/4 inch thick with a rolling pin. Open the parchment and cut the dough with a 3-inch pastry ring or biscuit cutter. Scrape away the excess dough and place the disk on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining balls. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium to high heat. Once it&#39;s hot, add 4 or 5 casabitos to the dry skillet without overcrowding. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then flip and cook, watching the casabitos carefully and adjusting the heat to avoid burning, until browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip once more and cook until the other side is browned, about 1 more minute. The casabitos will have a frosted white look to them with some charred spots. Transfer the casabitos to a baking sheet lined with a wire rack after they cook, so they can crisp as they cool. (Alternatively, bake the casabitos for 10 minutes in an oven preheated to 415 degrees F, flipping them halfway through. I prefer the stovetop method because the casabitos will last longer.) For the fudge sauce: Combine the cacao powder, coconut oil, coconut sugar, maple syrup, oat milk, vanilla extract and salt in a small saucepan over low to medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes until it reaches your desired consistency and is thick enough to coat the casabitos. Remove from the heat. For finishing: Dip each casabito into the fudge sauce to coat just one half, leaving the other half uncoated. Transfer to a wire rack. Transfer the mamba to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with a tip snipped off. Pipe dots or 2 or 3 lines of mamba onto the top side of the fudge coating on each casabito. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Serve immediately and enjoy the casabitos for breakfast or a snack. Store any remaining casabitos in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 55202,&quot;Individual Turkey Shepherd&#39;s Pie 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 carrot, finely diced 1 small onion, chopped 8 ounces ground turkey 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme 2 tablespoons ketchup 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth or stock 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound red-skinned potatoes, cubed 1/2 cup warm 2% milk 1/3 cup shredded sharp Cheddar 1 scallion, chopped Freshly ground black pepper<br> Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Brush the exposed flesh with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Lay the eggplant halves cut side down on a cookie sheet and roast in a 350 degree oven for about 35 minutes, until the fleshside of the eggplant is nicely browned and the eggplant has softened and fully cooked. Remove from the oven, and cool. When cool, use a large spoon to scoop the pulp away from the skin. Discard the skin. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet and saute the onion and red pepper until translucent. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another minute. Do not allow the garlic to brown. Add the eggplant pulp to this mixture and cook for another 6 to 7 minutes until all the flavors have mingled and the eggplant has begun to brown in the saute pan. Add the cayenne, cumin, salt, pepper, cilantro leaves and bread crumbs and mix well. Set aside to cool. Using 3 phyllo pastry leaves at a time, brush each leaf very lightly with melted butter and layer the sheets together. Cut the stack in half. Place 3 tablespoons of the eggplant mixture in a long thin strip in the center of each stack, so the phyllo can be rolled around it to form a cigar or firecracker shape. Roll the phyllo tightly, crimping the ends shut to seal in the filling. Repeat until all of the eggplant has been used. This will yield approximately 10 to 12 eggplant firecrackers. At this point, they can be held for up to 2 days, covered and refrigerated. To cook the firecrackers, saute in olive oil or lay them on a nonstick baking pan, and bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly browned, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. Unfold the sheets of puff pastry and cut each sheet into quarters. Place the pastry pieces on the prepared sheet pans and refrigerate while you prepare the apples. Peel the apples and cut them in half through the stems. Remove the stems and cores with a sharp knife and a melon baler. Slice the apples crosswise in 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place overlapping slices of apples diagonally across each piece of pastry and place a slice of apple on each side. Sprinkle the full 3/4 cup of sugar over all the pastry pieces and dot with the butter. Bake for 40 minutes, until the pastry is browned and the edges of the apples start to brown. Rotate the pan once during cooking. If the pastry puffs up in one area, cut a little slit with a knife to let the air out. Don&#39;t worry! The apple juices will burn in the pan but the galettes will be fine!

Heat a large nonstick saute pan over low heat. Add the butter and allow it to melt and start to froth a bit. Add the egg mixture.<br> Using a heat-resistant spatula, continually stir the eggs until super soft curds form. One of my new favorite kitchen tools is a heat-proof silicon spatula. It fits perrrrrfectly for these eggs, neatly and gently scraping - that&#39;s not the right word - grazing, the sides of your pan. Never stop doing this kind motion: allllll around the pan in a circular scrape, followed by a push push push of the eggs from the outside toward the center. Repeat it all until done! Everything keeps moving.<br> This process could take anywhere between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your stovetop, so take your time. Once the curds form and the eggs are cooked, garnish with chopped herbs and serve immediately. Oh, and serve with my one true love, bacon, if you so choose and why wouldn&#39;t you? &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55225,&quot;Grilled Meats and Vegetables over Saffron Orzo 5 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup fresh lemon juice, from about 5 lemons 2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons smoked salt, or kosher salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs 1/2 pound medium shrimp, shelled and deveined 2 ears corn, husked and cut into thirds 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, wiped clean 1 red bell pepper, halved and cored 1 yellow bell pepper, halved and cored 1 orange bell pepper, halved and cored Saffron Orzo, recipe follows 4 cups chicken stock 1 teaspoon saffron threads 1 pound dried orzo 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the marinade ingredients.<br> In a large bowl, combine half the marinade with the chicken breasts, chicken thighs, and shrimp.

Cook the shallots for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently. Toss the chicken livers into the pan, stir to combine and cook for 2 minutes. Toss in the mushrooms, stir to combine and season with salt. Cook the mushrooms until they are soft and wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushroom mixture is almost dry. Remove from the heat and let cool. Transfer the cooled mushroom mixture to a medium bowl, add the goat cheese and chives and mix until it is a homogeneous mixture. Put the mushroom mixture in a disposable piping bag and reserve. Using a paring knife or boning knife, make an incision in the thick end of each chicken breast. Insert the knife all the way into the chicken breast and slide it back and forth to create a pocket. Try not to poke the knife through the top or bottom of the chicken. Squeeze the mushroom filling into each chicken breast. In 3 separate wide, shallow containers, set up a standard breading procedure: one container of flour, one with the beaten egg mixture and one with the panko. Season the chicken breasts with salt. Using one hand for wet things and one hand for dry things, dredge each chicken breast in the flour. Dip in the egg wash and then pack panko onto each chicken breast. Lay the chicken breasts on a sheet tray and let them rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Set up a tray lined with paper towels. Take the chicken breasts out of the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Work in batches if all the chicken breasts do not fit in the pan at the same time. Cook the chicken until well browned on both sides, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove the browned chicken and blot it on the paper towels; season with salt immediately. Repeat with the remaining chicken. When all the chicken has been browned and blotted, place the chicken breasts on a wire rack set over a sheet tray and continue to cook for 10 to 15 minutes more in the oven. For the sauce: Meanwhile, ditch the fat from the pan and add the wine. Reduce the wine by half. Add half the chicken stock and reduce that by half. Add the remaining chicken stock and reduce that by half also (this will take a little time so be patient). Taste the reduced stock and season with salt if needed. Remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the butter.

For the mushroom hay: Separate the enoki mushrooms and place on a lined baking sheet in an even layer. Place in the oven to dry out, around 1 hour. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F in a large Dutch oven or high-sided pot. Using a slotted spoon, quickly fry the enoki mushrooms for just a few seconds. Remove and drain on paper towels. Season with salt. For the mustard sauce: Mix together the mustard and soy sauce in a small bowl. Place a dollop in the center of a serving dish. Place a crepe on a flat surface. Spread about 3 tablespoons filling down the middle. Fold the sides around the filling (like folding a letter). Flip over and place on top of the mustard sauce, seam-side down. Garnish with the mushroom hay, chervil and more dots of mustard sauce on the plate. Serve.

Spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Prepare the cake according to the package directions and bake in the prepared pan until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes in the pan, release the clasp on the collar and remove the cake to a cooling rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Cut the cake in half horizontally so you have two 9-inch round cakes. Place the bottom half back in the springform pan and close the clasp on the collar. Wrap the other half in plastic wrap and set aside to use later.<br> Meanwhile, make the mousse: Add the gelatin to a small bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup warm water and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk the sugar, egg yolks and 1/2 cup heavy cream in a large heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Cook, whisking constantly, until pale yellow and thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the gelatin and whisk until completely dissolved. Add 1 cup chocolate chips and whisk until melted. Remove the pan from the heat.<br> Beat 1 cup heavy cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold into the chocolate mixture and pour over the top of the cake in the springform pan. Refrigerate until the mousse is set, 2 hours and up to overnight.<br> Microwave the remaining 1/4 cup heavy cream in a small microwave-safe bowl until hot and bubbling, 1 minute 30 seconds. Place the remaining 3/4 cup chocolate chips in a medium heatproof bowl and pour the hot cream over the top. Let sit for 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Reserve 1/4 cup of the ganache and pour the rest over the top of the mousse. Smooth out with a silicone spatula and refrigerate until hardened, about 15 minutes. Top with the second cake.<br> Cut 1 inch off each Twix bar, then cut the 1-inch pieces in half crosswise and set aside. Remove the cake from the pan and place on a cake stand or plate. Re-melt the reserved ganache in 30-second intervals in the microwave if needed (you want it to be thick and spreadable). Spread the backs of the large Twix pieces with 2 tablespoons of the ganache and attach them around the outside of the cake like a fence. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons ganache over the tops of the Twix pieces on the cake. Refrigerate until the ganache is hard and the bars are set, about 15 minutes.<br> Spread the dulce de leche on top of the cake and arrange the shortbread and remaining Twix pieces in a bulls-eye pattern. Refrigerate until ready to serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55246,&quot;Grilled Chicken with Blanched Garlic 2 whole chickens, about 2 pounds each 2 small heads garlic, separated into cloves and peeled 1/4 cup Italian parsley leaves Kosher salt Freshly ground white pepper 2 tablespoons (1-ounce) unsalted butter 1 large lemon, juiced Instructions: Halve and bone the chickens completely, leaving the first wing joint intact.

To pop corn properly, place the kernels in a heavy-bottomed large pot and cover them with oil. Put the lid on and cook on high until you hear the first pop. Immediately take it off the heat and let it sit 1 minute. Then return it to the heat and finish popping, shaking the pan the whole time.

Grease and line a 9-inch square baking pan with parchment paper. Cut enough so there are wings hanging over the sides of the pan for when it&#39;s time to remove the bars! In a food processor, combine the flour, almond flour, granulated sugar and salt and pulse to combine. Add the butter, egg white and rosewater, if using. Pulse until the mixture clumps together into small to medium clumps of dough. Pour the dough out into the prepared pan and press evenly all around the bottom with a measuring cup or the back of a spatula until smooth. Bake until the crust is just set and the edges are light golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. For the filling: Combine the rhubarb in a medium saucepan with water just to cover (about 1 1/2 cups water) and 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Scrape in the vanilla bean seeds and add the pod. Simmer until the rhubarb is falling apart, about 10 minutes. Cool, then strain and discard the solids. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Add 1/4 cup of the reserved rhubarb juice to a small mixing bowl. Add the cornstarch. Use a small whisk or fork to combine until smooth and there are no cornstarch lumps. Add the rhubarb slurry to the saucepan with an additional 1/2 cup of the reserved rhubarb juice. (See Cook&#39;s Note for uses for any extra juice).

Coat the loins with the dry rub, put them into a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for 2 hours. Puree the soy sauce, white wine, orange juice, ketchup, ginger, garlic and sugar in a blender until smooth. Add the marinade to the tenderloins, and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours. Remove the tenderloins from the marinade and allow them to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Combine all the ingredients in a nonstick saucepan over medium heat and simmer hard, stirring often, until the mango breaks down and thickens to a jam. Transfer the marinade to a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the mango jam and the sweet chili sauce, and bring to a hard simmer. Reduce the mixture by 1/2 the volume, stirring occasionally, as the sugars can settle and burn. Remove 1/2 of the marinade to a small bowl and set aside for service. Sweet Ginger Rice: Cook the rice according to package directions. Coat the inside of an 8 by 8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Transfer 2 cups of the warm cooked rice to a mixing bowl. Add the pickled ginger, fish sauce and chili garlic sauce and gently combine. Press the mixture into the baking dish, cover and refrigerate until cooled and set, about 1 hour. (When the pork loins have been put on the grill) gently turn the set rice cake out onto a cutting board. Cut the cake corner to corner to make 4 triangles. Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully add the 4 rice cakes. If a part of the cake breaks away, gently press it back into shape. Saute on the first side until the cakes have caramelized, about 15 minutes. Carefully turn the cakes over, add 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Saute the second side until you can hear the caramelized cakes gently scratching the bottom when the pan is jiggled, about 10 to 15 minutes. Grilled Pineapple: Cut the pineapple lengthwise into logs or wedges, then cut in half and put them into a large bowl. Combine the rum, sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and pour it over the pineapple. Allow it to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. When the tenderloins have been removed from the grill to rest, grill the pineapple on medium-high heat for a couple minutes per side turning and basting with the rum sauce to achieve caramelized grill marks. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill with 1 side medium-high heat and 1 side medium-low heat. Sear the loins on all 4 sides on medium-high for 3 minutes per side. Move the loins to the medium-low heat side. Baste with the marinade, close grill and cook, basting every 5 minutes, until the loins reach medium-rare or to desired doneness. Remove the loins to a cutting board and cover loosely with foil. Let rest for 15 minutes before carving on the diagonal into 1/4-inch medallions. Transfer the medallions to a serving platter and serve with sweet ginger rice, grilled pineapple and reserved marinade. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Grenache]&quot; 55321,&quot;I.C. Salmon with Dill-Yogurt Sauce 4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, 3/4- to 1-inch thick, preferably wild-caught, thawed if frozen (see Chef\u2019s Note) 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 lemon<br> 1 cup (260 grams) whole milk yogurt (not Greek-style)<br> 1/2 cup (23 grams) chopped fresh dill fronds<br> 2 teaspoons stone-ground mustard<br> 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish<br> 3 grinds black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola<br> Instructions: Place the salmon on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Rub the fillets with 2 teaspoons of the salt, then refrigerate for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, set your immersion circulator bath for 124 degrees F (51 degrees C). Pat the salmon dry with paper towels, then divide between two gallon-size vacuum-seal or high-quality freezer zip-top bags. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the olive oil to each bag, then gently rub the fish to coat. Use a peeler to harvest eight strips of lemon peel and place two strips, pith-side up, on top of each fillet. Halve and juice the lemon; set the juice aside to use in the sauce. If using vacuum-seal bags, use the \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201cmoist\u201d setting to seal the bags. Transfer the fillet bags to the water bath. If using zip-top bags, let the salmon sink, forcing the air out of the bag via displacement. Right before the mouth of the bag goes into the water, seal the bag. Leave the salmon to cook for 45 minutes. (If one of the bags floats, carefully reopen and try the sink-and-seal method again.) While the salmon cooks, make the sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, dill, mustard, horseradish, and pepper. Stir in the remaining teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Stir well, then season to taste with additional salt, pepper, and lemon juice, if desired. Set aside until ready to serve. When the salmon is finished, remove it from the water bath. Open the bags and very carefully remove the fish to a paper towel-lined sheet pan. Pat the fish as dry as possible with additional paper towels. Brush the skin side lightly with some of the neutral oil. Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat for 3 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil and swirl the pan to coat. When the oil starts to smoke, add two of the salmon fillets, skin-side down. Brush the flesh side lightly with additional oil. Cook until the skin is browned and crisp, about 1 minute. Carefully flip with a narrow metal spatula or \u201cfish turner\u201d and cook on the second side just until just brown, about 30 seconds. Carefully transfer to a serving platter and repeat with the remaining oil and fillets. Serve with the dill-yogurt sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55322,&quot;Marinated Flank Steak with Blue Cheese Sauce 1 1/4 pounds beef flank steak 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon brown sugar 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese 2 tablespoons lowfat buttermilk Dash Worcestershire sauce 1 medium red onion 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 12 radicchio leaves 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Place the steak pieces between 2 pieces of plastic wrap or parchment and pound to 1/4- inch thickness.

But it&#39;s no hardship to eat straight off. Whichever, serve sprinkled with dill and with some buttered noodles, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 55330,&quot;Grilled Tomato Soup with Grilled Cheese Toasts Extra-virgin olive oil, for oiling the grill grates and drizzling 3 pounds plum tomatoes, halved through the stem ends Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 medium onion, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds 1 tablespoon unsalted butter plus 2 tablespoons melted 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, minced 6 large fresh basil leaves 1/3 cup heavy cream Sugar, for seasoning, optional Four 1/2-inch-thick slices crusty bread 8 slices Havarti cheese Instructions: Preheat a grill for cooking over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates. Drizzle the cut-sides of the tomato halves with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place them on the grill cut-side down until they have very dark grill marks, about 8 minutes. Gently flip and grill on the skin-side to char, about 2 minutes. Lightly drizzle some olive oil on a sheet of aluminum foil. Arrange the onion rounds in one layer on the foil. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the foil sheet on the grill grates. Grill until the onions develop dark char on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Turn the grill down to medium for the grilled cheese toast. Heat the 1 tablespoon butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the grilled onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme; stir for about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and all their juices and mash down the tomatoes with a wooden spoon to break them up a bit. Add 2 cups water, 2 teaspoons salt and some more black pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook, about 15 minutes. Take the soup off the heat, and stir in the basil leaves. Very carefully puree the soup in a blender or with a handheld stick blender. When ready to serve, bring the soup back to a simmer, and add the heavy cream. Taste for seasoning. Add more salt, if necessary. If the tomatoes are too acidic, add a little sugar to taste. Meanwhile, make the grilled cheese toast: brush the melted butter on both sides of each bread slice. Place the slices on the grill; cook until nicely toasted on the underside, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the bread and top each with 2 slices of cheese. Cover and cook to melt the cheese and toast the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Grind a little pepper on each cheese toast. Serve immediately with the soup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 55331,&quot;Crispy Rack of Lamb with Honey and Mascarpone 3 (1 to 1 1/2 pounds each) racks of lamb, trimmed, with 1/4-inch of fat left on meat 1/4 cup olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons herbs de Provence 1/2 cup creme fraiche 3 tablespoons honey 3/4 tablespoon ground cumin 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves 1/2 cup mascarpone cheese, at room temperature Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the lamb: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.

Place a 12-inch cast-iron skillet in the oven to preheat for 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in another large cast-iron skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat until it bubbles. Add the onions and saute?, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Stretch the pizza dough out into a 12-inch round. In the preheated cast-iron skillet, drizzle some oil, then add the dough round. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Spread the ricotta on top and season with salt and pepper. Bake until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. When the pizza comes out, mix the melted butter, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Brush it along the crust of the pizza. Tear the prosciutto into small pieces or strips and place on top. Top with the arugula and caramelized onions. Drizzle with olive oil and balsamic glaze, then top with shaved Parmesan cheese. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 8 slices to serve. In a small bowl, stir together the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the flour to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Sprinkle the salt over the flour and mix on low speed for 15 seconds to distribute the salt. Add the olive oil, room-temperature water, and yeast mixture and mix on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes, then increase the speed to medium and mix until a ball of dough forms, about 5 minutes. Spray a medium bowl lightly with cooking spray. Shape the dough into a ball and set it in the bowl seam side down. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour. When the dough is almost risen, place a cast-iron pizza stone on the center rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500F. When the dough has risen, remove the plastic wrap and push down on the dough to release the gases and bubbles. Shape it into a ball. (If using the dough later, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. The dough will slowly proof during that time. Once you\u2019re ready to use it, set it out for 30 minutes to come to room temperature.) Spread a piece of parchment paper about 1 1/2-feet long on a work surface. Stretch the dough into a 14-inch round on the parchment. Top with your favorite toppings. Carefully pull the oven rack with the pizza stone halfway out of the oven and transfer the parchment and pizza dough to the stone. Bake until the crust is golden, 13 to 15 minutes.

Mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, and zest. Combine the flour with the liquids and allow batter to rest, refrigerated, for at least 30 minutes before cooking. Peel, core, and cut the apples into 1/2-inch thick slices. In a separate pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter, add the apple slices and saute over medium heat until they turn a rich golden color, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and carefully add the maple syrup, Port, cinnamon, and lemon juice. Cook slowly until the apples are tender at the center of each slice, but not soft and mushy, about 2 minutes. Heat a non-stick 7-inch omelet pan over low heat until hot. Add 1 or 2 teaspoons of butter, melted, using either a brush or a tiny ladle, to coat the surface lightly. As soon as the butter has started to bubble, lift the pan off the heat and pour 1/2 cup of batter into the pan, tilting to spread the batter evenly across the bottom. Return the pan to heat, spoon in 1/4 of the apples and cook on low until golden on the underside. When the top is bubbly, flip and brown the second side. As each pancake is completed, place on an oven-proof platter set in a 200 degree oven. There should be enough batter to make at least 4 skillet cakes. Serve each cake warm with a dollop of currant jelly and some clotted cream or creme fraiche. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 55350,&quot;Arroz Blanco con PlATanos Fritos White Rice with Fried Plantains 3 tablespoons sunflower or vegetable oil 1/2 cup chopped white onion 1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 2 cups white rice 4 cups chicken stock, heated 2 sprigs fresh hierbabuena or 2 tablespoons mint leaves Salt and pepper 1 pound ripe plantains, peeled 1 cup sunflower or vegetable oil Instructions: In a heavy 4-quart stockpot, heat the oil over low heat.

(This is to prevent the jars from directly touching the surface.) Set aside. Sterilize\u202feight 1/2-pint canning jars and lids. To sterilize jars using a boiling water canner or a large pot, place a rack (or often I will use a clean kitchen towel) on the bottom of the canner. Place the jars right-side-up on\u202fthe\u202frack and fill the jars and canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch. Bring the water to a boil, then boil for 10 minutes (at altitudes less than 1,000 feet elevation; see Cook&#39;s Note). Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner one at a time, carefully pouring the water from the jars back into the canner. Let the jars air-dry\u202fupside-down\u202fon the prepared rack\u202for towel\u202fand sit undisturbed until you&#39;re ready to fill them. The rings and rubber-lined lids must be sterilized, too. Place the new lids in a small saucepan, cover with water and bring to a gentle simmer. Very gently simmer for 10 minutes (taking care not to boil). Turn off the heat and keep the lids in the water until ready to use.\u202f<br> Combine the strawberries, lemon juice and sugar in a heavy 6- to 8-quart non-reactive pot and stir well. Place over high heat and, stirring constantly, bring to a full boil with bubbles over the entire surface. Boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and stir in the liquid pectin.<br> For each jar, insert a canning funnel and carefully ladle in the jam, allowing at least 1/4 inch of headroom. Clean the rims of the jars with a clean, damp towel and tightly secure the lids.<br> Place the canning rack in the canner and fill the pot with water; bring to a boil over high heat.<br> Using tongs, place the jars on the rack in the canner. The water should cover the jars by at least 1 inch. Cover the canner. Return the water to a boil and boil gently for 5 minutes (at altitudes less than 1,000 feet elevation; see Cook&#39;s Note). Using tongs, transfer the jars to a towel to cool. If the seal works and fits properly, the metal lid will be slightly concave within 24 hours of processing. Store the unopened jars of jam at room temperature for up to 1 year. Once the jam is opened, store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55396,&quot;\Egg\Straordinary Scramble 5 egg whites 2 tablespoons water Salt and pepper 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 cup broccoli, chopped 1 green pepper, chopped 1 bunch green onions, chopped 2 tomatoes, chopped 2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 teaspoon red cl pepper flakes Italian seasoning mix Chopped parsley, for garnish Red rose petals, for garnish 1/2 cup cooked ham 1/2 cup cooked crumbled bacon Instructions: Combine the egg whites with water, salt, and pepper, and beat lightly.

(I do this by hand, but if you use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a handheld mixer, beat on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes, and then scrape down the sides of the bowl before continuing.) Add the egg, vanilla and salt and stir just until combined. Sift in the flour, baking soda and baking powder and stir gently just until combined. Add the chocolate and nuts if using and stir just until evenly distributed throughout the dough. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Position the racks in the upper third and lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop up 1-inch balls of the dough with a spoon or mini scoop and set them 2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Bake the cookies, rotating the pans after 7 to 9 minutes, for 13 to 17 minutes until the cookies are golden brown. If you like a very soft cookie, bake them for 13 minutes. If you like a crisp cookie, bake them for 17 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool. I think these cookies are best the day they are baked, but they will keep in an airtight cookie jar for up to 4 days-if they last that long. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 55420,&quot;Classic Green Bean Casserole 1 large red onion, thinly sliced lengthwise 1 cup buttermilk Vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup panko breadcrumbs 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley Kosher salt Kosher salt 2 pounds green beans, trimmed and halved 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 pound white button mushrooms, quartered 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons fresh thyme 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth Pinch of cayenne pepper 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 1 ounce) Instructions: Make the topping: Separate the onion strips and soak in the buttermilk at least 10 minutes. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F. Combine the flour, panko, parsley and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Working in batches, remove the onion strips from the buttermilk, dip in the flour mixture and fry until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; season with salt. Make the casserole: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans; cook until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water and blot dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme; cook 1 minute. Add the flour and stir to coat, 1 minute. Whisk in the half-and-half, chicken broth, cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parmesan and green beans. Transfer to a 3-quart baking dish. (You can refrigerate the casserole, covered, for up to 4 hours; keep the topping at room temperature.) Bake the casserole until bubbling, about 15 minutes. Stir, then sprinkle with the topping; bake until warmed through, 5 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 55421,&quot;Strawberry Shortcake 1 3/4 cups sugar 1 cup cake flour<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 12 large egg whites, at room temperature<br> 1/3 cup warm water<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 10 medium strawberries, quartered, plus 5 strawberries, sliced, for decorating 1 cup water<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/4 cup sugar 3 cups heavy whipping cream<br> 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Instructions: For the angel food cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the sugar in a food processor and process for 2 minutes, until very fine. In a bowl, sift together the cake flour, salt and half of the fine sugar. Set aside. Combine the egg whites, warm water, cream of tartar and vanilla in large bowl. Whisk by hand for 2 minutes, until well combined. At this point, switch to a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat the egg white mixture until medium peaks form, gradually adding the remaining fine sugar. Sprinkle one-third of the flour mixture over the egg white mixture and gently stir it in. Repeat until all of the flour mixture has been evenly incorporated. Spoon the cake batter into an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Bake until the cake is golden brown and cooked through, 30 minutes. Invert the baking dish onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely in the dish upside down. Once cooled, carefully scrape the edges of the baking dish to release the cake. For the strawberry reduction: Combine the quartered strawberries, water and sugar in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Raise the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauces thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely. For the whipped cream: Place a metal mixing bowl and a metal whisk in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes. Place the sugar in the mixing bowl, then add the whipping cream and vanilla. Whisk until the cream just reaches stiff peaks. To assemble: Slice the cake horizontally into two equal layers. Place the first cake layer on a cake board. Pour over a thin layer of strawberry reduction and then add a layer of whipped cream. Stack the second cake layer on top. Top off the cake with swirls of whipped cream, using a piping bag fitted with a No.1M large tip. Add a strawberry slice to each swirl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 55422,&quot;Pan-Seared Pork Chops with Warm Cajun Grain Salad 3/4 cup spelt 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 small green bell pepper, cut into thin 1-inch strips<br> 4 scallions, cut into 1/2-inch-long pieces, white and green parts separated 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced 2 ounces Canadian bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved 1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley Kosher salt 4 bone-in pork chops, each about 3/4-inch-thick and 8 ounces Lemon wedges and Louisiana-style hot sauce for serving, optional Instructions: Combine the spelt with 1 1/2 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer until most of the water is absorbed and the grains are tender but still chewy, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Let cool completely. (The spelt can be cooked up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated.) Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell pepper, scallion whites, celery and Canadian bacon and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are crisp-tender and the ham is lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of the Cajun seasoning and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the spelt, tomatoes, scallion greens, parsley and salt to taste. Cook, stirring, until the spelt and tomatoes are warmed through, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, transfer to a medium bowl and cover to keep warm. Wipe out the skillet. Sprinkle the pork chops all over with the remaining 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning and 1 teaspoon salt. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the empty skillet over medium-high heat. Nestle the pork chops in the skillet snuggly. Cook until nicely browned on both sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each registers 140 degrees F, about 4 minutes per side. Divide the pork chops among four plates. Serve with the warm grain salad, and with wedges of lemon and hot sauce on the side if using. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</li></ol><p>&quot; 55423,&quot;Pimento Mac and Cheese with Chicken Sausage Kosher salt 8 ounces elbow macaroni 1 bunch broccolini (about 8 ounces), chopped 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 links sweet Italian chicken sausage (about 2 1/2 ounces each), casings removed 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 3/4 cups milk 3 ounces cream cheese 1 3/4 cups shredded cheddar cheese (about 7 ounces) 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 4-ounce jar chopped pimentos, drained 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Remove the sausage to a plate using a slotted spoon. Add the flour to the drippings in the skillet; cook, stirring, until incorporated, 1 minute. Whisk in the milk. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in the cream cheese until smooth, then stir in the cheddar, cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon salt until melted and smooth, about 1 minute. Stir in the pasta and broccolini, sausage and pimentos. Preheat the broiler. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the microwave; stir in the panko and sprinkle the mixture over the pasta. Broil until golden brown, about 3 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 55424,&quot;Plantain Walnut Pancakes with Walnut Coconut Yogurt 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon double acting baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 eggs, separated, whites at room temperature 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 very ripe plantain, mashed 1 1/3 cups buttermilk 1/2 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped Instructions: In a large bowl, mix together the flours, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil, plantain, and buttermilk. Add the liquid mixture to the dry mixture, along with the walnuts, and stir until batter is just mixed. There will be lumps in the batter. In another bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks and fold them into the batter. Heat a griddle over low heat and brush with some of the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Drop the batter onto the griddle by tablespoons and cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bubbles form on top and bottom is golden. Flip pancakes and cook for another minute or until undersides are golden. Using a spatula, transfer pancakes to a platter and keep warm until all of the pancakes are cooked, repeating the process with the remaining oil for brushing the grill. Serve pancakes with the Walnut Coconut Yogurt and maple syrup, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 55425,&quot;Jade&#39;s Home Fries 2 small russet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch sticks or wedges 2 small sweet potatoes or yams, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch wedges<br> 1/4 cup olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons seafood seasoning 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Over a double boiler, whisk 3 egg yolks and sugar to a thick, ribbon-like texture. In a separate pot, combine the heavy cream and split vanilla bean, and bring to a boil. Temper the egg yolk mixture into the cream, by whisking a little of the hot cream into the eggs, while constantly whisking, and then whisk the yolk mixture back into the hot cream. Return to the heat and, while whisking continually, finish cooking to a custard stage, approximately 1 or 2 minutes. For the second part of the creme brulee, whisk the remaining 3 egg yolks for 1 minute. Add the condensed milk and whisk for another minute. Add the key lime juice gradually and whisk for 1 minute. Combine the creme brulee filling with the key lime filling and chill in the refrigerator until needed. To make the crust, roll out a sheet of puff pastry very thin, 20 by 10-inches. Cut 6 (4-inch diameter) circles out of the puff pastry to line 6 (3-inch) tart pans. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Line the pastry rings with the pastry dough and trim the excess dough flush to the edge of the ring. Place a piece of parchment paper on each tart shell and fill with beans and bake until golden, about 10 minutes. The shells should be very thin and even. To assemble, fill the shells with the key lime filling and level the tops with a spatula. Dust the tops of the desserts with sugar and using a torch caramelize the tops. Place the desserts on a plate and serve with fruit puree, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 55427,&quot;Pet Recipe: Beef and Oat Cookie Dog Treats 3 cups oat flour, plus more for dusting 1 cup oat bran 1/2 cup packed ground beef 1 large egg 3/4 cup water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350?

Remove the saucepan from the heat and let cool. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with two kitchen towels stacked on top of each other and place in the oven. This will keep your cooked pancakes warm. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the milk, melted butter and eggs together in another bowl. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and whisk until ingredients are just incorporated and batter is thick (it&#39;s okay if there are some lumps). Gently stir in 1/2 teaspoon pepper and all but 2 tablespoons of the herbs. Let the batter rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the ricotta, lemon zest, lemon juice and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper together in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Ladle a heaping 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet, spreading it into a 4 1/2-inch round; repeat to make a second pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden on the bottom and bubbly on top, about 1 minute. Flip the pancakes and cook until the second side is golden and batter is cooked through, about 45 seconds more. Transfer the pancakes to the baking sheet in the oven, tucking them between the kitchen towels. Repeat with the remaining batter to make more pancakes.

Lightly coat two 9-inch round cake pans with oil and dust with flour. Whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a small bowl; set aside. Microwave the chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl on high power for 45 seconds; remove and stir. Microwave again at high power in 30-second increments, stirring in between, until the chocolate has melted completely; set aside. Beat the granulated sugar, oil and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Beat in the melted chocolate. Alternate beating in the flour mixture and the milk, adding the flour in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just incorporated. Add half the milk, and mix until just incorporated. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture and milk, making sure not to overmix. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, run a thin spatula around the edges and then turn the cakes out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. (They will have a sugary \crust\ on the top. This is from the melted chocolate and is not a problem. It will soften once the cake is assembled or if the layers are baked the day before.) For the filling: While the cakes cool, spread the pecans on a baking sheet and bake, tossing once, until toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Finely chop. Whisk together the milk and egg yolks in a medium saucepan until smooth. Add the brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt, and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 6 minutes. (It will be similar to the thickness of eggnog.) Pour the mixture into a large bowl. (Don&#39;t worry if it seems thin. The coconut and nuts will bind it.) Stir in the coconut and pecans; set aside to cool. For the frosting: Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat 1 cup of the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming but not boiling, and pour over the chocolate. Let stand a few minutes, and then whisk until smooth; let stand at room temperature (or put in the refrigerator if your kitchen is hot) until thick but not set, 20 minutes to 1 hour. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream to the chocolate mixture, and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until lightened in color and fluffy, about 1 minute (do not overbeat, or it will become hard and grainy). The frosting should hold medium peaks and will continue to firm up a bit as it stands. Spoon about 1 cup frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. To assemble: Put one cake layer right-side up on a serving plate, and top with half the filling. Top with the second cake layer and the remaining filling, spreading it to about 1/2 inch from the edge. Frost the sides, and decorate around the top edge of the cake with the frosting in the pastry bag. Loosely cover the cake with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature overnight. Unwrap and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 55434,&quot;Grilled Breakfast Pizza with Sausage Gravy 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for the pizzas and grill grates 1 pound bulk breakfast sausage 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 1/2 cups whole milk Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound frozen pizza dough, thawed 8 ounces sharp white Cheddar, shredded (about 3 heaping cups) 4 large eggs 2 scallions, thinly sliced Hot sauce, for serving Instructions: Prepare an outdoor grill for medium heat. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage, and cook, stirring and breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, and use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a plate. Reserving 2 tablespoons of drippings in the skillet (drain or add oil as needed), return it to medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour, and cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture becomes loose and turns a light tan color, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Simmer, whisking frequently, until the sauce has thickened to the consistency of thin gravy, 6 to 8 minutes. Return the cooked sausage to the skillet, and stir. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside. Divide the pizza dough into 4 balls. Dust a clean flat work surface with flour, and roll each ball into an 8-inch circle. Transfer the dough circles to the prepared baking sheet, and brush both sides with oil. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the crusts until they start to puff and distinct grill marks appear on the underside, about 1 minute. Flip. Evenly divide the Cheddar among the crusts, leaving a small well in the center of each. Immediately crack 1 egg into each well. Grill, covered, until the whites have completely set and the Cheddar has melted, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, reheat the sausage gravy if needed. Remove the pizzas from the grill, and drizzle each with a couple spoonfuls of warm gravy. Garnish with the scallions. Serve immediately with hot sauce and any remaining gravy served on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 55435,&quot;Fried Dill Pickles 1 cup buttermilk 2 eggs 2 cups all-purpose flour Salt, to taste Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Canola oil, for frying (about 10 cups for a 4-quart Dutch oven) 4 large kosher dill pickles, sliced thin on the diagonal Instructions: Mix the buttermilk and eggs together in one bowl, and the flour, salt, and pepper in another. Heat 2 to 3 inches of oil in a Dutch oven until it reaches 325 to 350 degrees on a deep-fry thermometer. Line a baking sheet with a brown paper bag or paper towels. Dip the pickle slices in the buttermilk mixture and then into the seasoned flour. Using tongs, drop the coated pickles, one by one, into the hot oil; fry about 2 pickles worth of slices in each batch. Be sure to regulate the heat so that the oil stays between 325 and 350 degrees. When the pickles are a light golden color (this should take 7 to 9 minutes), remove them with tongs or a slotted spoon and drain them on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pickles. Sprinkle a little salt on them (remember, pickles are pretty salty) and serve as you would French fries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 55436,&quot;Texas Fried Sea Bass with a Raspberry Honey Soy Glaze 3 cups canola oil 1 jalapeno, seeded and sliced into thin rings 4 (4-ounce) seabass fillets 4 strips par cooked bacon 1 cup Beer Batter, recipe follows 1 cup Raspberry, Honey, Soy Glaze, recipe follows 2 teaspoons orange liqueur (recommended: Cointreau) 1 orange, zest cut into, long, thin, curled pieces 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 eggs 8 ounces light lager (recommended: Amstel Light) 1 teaspoon blackening seasoning 1 cup soy sauce 1 cup honey 1/2 cup fresh raspberries 1/4 cup sugar Instructions: In a large high-sided saute pan, heat canola oil to 375 degrees F.

(If you have a mandoline, this will be quite fast.) Discard any seeds. Place the sliced fruit and their juices into a stainless-steel pot. Add 8 cups water and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar until it dissolves. Cover and allow to stand overnight at room temperature. The next day, bring the mixture back to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for about 2 hours. Turn the heat up to medium and boil gently, stirring often, for another 30 minutes. Skim off any foam that forms on the top. Cook the marmalade until it reaches 220 degrees F on a candy thermometer. If you want to be doubly sure it&#39;s ready, place a small amount on a plate and refrigerate it until it&#39;s cool but not cold. If it&#39;s firm -- neither runny nor too hard -- it&#39;s done. It will be a golden orange color. (If the marmalade is runny, continue cooking it and if it&#39;s too hard, add more water.) Pour the marmalade into clean, hot Mason jars; wipe the rims thoroughly with a clean damp paper towel, and seal with the lids.

Blend, stopping and scraping down the sides of the carafe with a rubber spatula as needed, until very smooth, about 1 minute. It&#39;s ok if there are some specks from the almond butter and dates, but it should be smooth and similar in texture to a thick milkshake. Meanwhile, combine the baking chips and coconut oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high, stirring occasionally, until completely melted and smooth, about 1 minute.<br> Pour a third of the chickpea mixture into a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan, then drizzle over a third of the chocolate mixture, making sure to go all the way to the edges.

To make caramel: combine the sugar and the water in a medium saucepan. Be sure all the sugar granules are washed down from the sides of the pan (use a wet pastry brush). Cook over moderate heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until the color is golden brown and the mixture smells like caramel. This will take about 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the caramel into a 9 inch round cake pan and, holding the pan with an oven glove, swirl it around to generously coat the bottom and sides. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, gently whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla, and 2 cups of the half and half, without whisking in any air. Bring the remaining half and half and the port to a simmer in a small saucepan and begin whisking this into the egg mixture a little at a time, whisking constantly until it is all incorporated. Pour through a strainer into the prepared cake pan. Place the pan inside a large roasting pan and pour very hot tap water into the pan so that it comes halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Bake for about 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until the center is slightly jiggly but not wavy. Cool to room temperature and then cover with plastic wrap with the plastic gently touching the top of the flan. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 4 days. To unmold the custard, run a small sharp knife around the inside edges of the dish several times to loosen it. Dip the bottom briefly in a basin of very hot tap water. Invert a round platter over the dish and turn them both over together, shaking the two a little to help release the custard (or rap the bottom of the platter gently on the work surface). The caramel sauce will run out around the edges of the platter. Garnish the top of the flan with violets or other edible flowers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55447,&quot;Wild Mushroom Soup 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small onion, thinly sliced<br> 12 ounces mixed mushrooms, such as cremini, shiitake and oyster, stemmed and chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 cups chicken broth<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons Marsala, optional<br> About 1/4 cup creme fraiche, for serving<br> 1 tablespoon sliced chives (1/2-inch pieces) Olive oil, for drizzling<br> Instructions: Melt the butter in a small Dutch oven over medium heat.

For the Cedar Planks: I use UNTREATED 1 by 8 construction grade cedar cut to the length of the amount of salmon you wish to cook. (I cut mine in 10-inch lengths for 2 (8- ounce fillets) Soaking the planks: Pre-soak cedar planks for at least 1 hour, preferably longer or overnight. Weigh down planks with heavy cans or stones to completely submerge the wood in water. Lightly coat the salmon with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place salmon on cedar plank skin-side down. Turn on your gas grill to high heat. Place planks (loaded up with salmon) on the grill and close lid. Your grill will now turn into an oven/smoker. Cooking time required will vary depending on the size of the salmon. Be careful when you are lifting the grill lid because the burning plank will produce a lot of smoke. Try to keep the lid closed as much as possible as not to lower the temperature inside the grill. When salmon is cooked, remove fish from plank and plunge wood into a bucket of cold water. Serve the salmon immediately with the Cilantro Pesto. Place first 4 ingredients in blender or small food processor and completely puree. Add lime juice, jalapeno, and salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 55488,&quot;Basic Pizza Dough 1/4 cup lukewarm water 1 tablespoon yeast 3 cups flour plus extra for kneading dough 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 cup lukewarm water 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: Mix yeast and 1/4 cup lukewarm water in a small bowl. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. The yeast will dissolve and become foamy. Put the flour, salt, sugar, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder into the bowl of a food processor. Press the pulse button a few times to mix everything together. Mix the dissolved yeast mixture with 1 cup lukewarm water. Turn the food processor on. Pour the water and yeast into the food processor through the hole in the top. Let the machine run until the dough makes a ball. If the dough is too sticky to make a ball, add a little more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a ball. Take the dough out of the processor and knead on a floured countertop until the dough is very smooth. Pour one tablespoon of olive oil into a medium bowl and swirl it around until the bowl is coated. Place dough ball into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm, draft-free place. The dough should rise (grow) until it is twice as big as when you put it in the bowl. This should take about 1 hour. Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl. Using your fist, press all the air out of the dough. The dough is now ready to roll out and prepare according to the pizza recipe directions. (NOTE: You can wrap your dough in plastic wrap and keep it in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours before making pizza. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 55489,&quot;Zucchini Carbonara 2 large zucchini (or 1 pound fresh zucchini noodles) 8 pieces thick-cut bacon, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/2 medium onion, diced 2 large eggs<br> 2 large egg yolks<br> 3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving<br> 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> Kosher salt and ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed<br> 1/4 cup chopped basil<br> Instructions: Make the zucchini noodles using a spiralizer (if not using pre-made noodles).

To butterfly the flank steak, start with the meat grain running up and down in front of you. With your knife, begin cutting the meat in half. Essentially, you want a thinner, larger flank steak. Continue cutting the flank steak in half until you reach about 1 inch from completely cutting through. Lay the cut flank steak open and even out the middle so there is not a thicker piece in the center. Or just ask the butcher! Spread the flank steak out so that the grain is running left to right. Begin layering the flank steak with salt and pepper, the Asiago, then the spinach, the Gorgonzola and scallions. Begin rolling the flank steak tightly and away from you. Evenly insert the skewers 1 to 2 inches along the seam of the pinwheel to hold it together on the grill. Cut in between each skewer but not against the skewer; you want the same amount of meat on either side of each skewer.

Lightly oil and flour two 8-inch round cake pans, tapping out any excess flour. Whisk the flour, baking powder and baking soda in a medium bowl; set aside. Melt the coconut oil and unsweetened chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally; remove from the heat. Whisk the hot water and cocoa powder in a large bowl until smooth. Drizzle in the melted chocolate mixture, whisking until combined. Whisk in the granulated sugar and salt until smooth. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, then add the vanilla. Whisk in the flour mixture just until smooth. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the tops of the cakes spring back when lightly pressed, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then run a knife around the edges and turn out onto the rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Increase the speed to medium and beat until combined. Add the vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the milk until smooth. Assemble the cake: Trim the domed tops of the cakes using a long serrated knife; transfer the scraps to a bowl. Cut each cake into 2 equal layers (leave the layers stacked). Cut both cakes in half, about 1/2 inch off-center. You will have 4 slightly smaller half moons and 4 slightly larger ones. Stack the 4 larger half-moons, spreading frosting between the layers. Place the stack cut-side down on a piece of parchment paper. Repeat with the smaller half-moons to make another 4-layer stack, then turn the stack cut-side down and attach it to the larger stack using more frosting Trim the sides of the smaller cake sandwiches to make a slightly pointed shape. Transfer the cake scraps to the bowl. Trim the curved top of the cake so that it has an even, rounded shape; add the scraps to the bowl. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons frosting to the bowl of cake scraps and mash with a fork until moistened. Pat the scraps mixture around the top, bottom and sides of the cake to round it out and form an egg shape. Cover the entire cake in a thin layer of frosting (this is the crumb coat; it doesn?t have to be perfect). Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Cover the cake with the remaining frosting, building out the egg shape where needed with more frosting. Cover the cake with rows of coarse sugar, nonpareils and candy-coated chocolates. Refrigerate until set, at least 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55517,&quot;Braised Chicken Curry with Yams Canola oil 2 pounds chicken legs and thighs 2 large white onions, chopped 1 tablespoons minced garlic 1 tablespoons minced ginger 1/3 cup madras curry powder 1 banana 2 bay leaves 4 cups chicken stock 3 large yams, peeled and chopped Salt and black pepper to taste Instructions: In a hot stock pot coated with oil, season the chicken and brown all sides.

Spray 2 (8-inch) cake pans, 2 (10-inch) cake pans and 1 (6-inch) Bundt pan with cooking spray and set aside. Beat cake mix, water, oil, and egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl and beat for 2 minutes on medium speed. Divide batter equally between prepared cake pans. Bake 8-inch cakes and 6-inch Bundt cakes in oven for 35 to 40 minutes and 10-inch cakes for 45 to 50 minutes, or until tester comes out clean. Remove and cool completely. To assemble, use a serrated knife to slice off the tops of the 8 and 10-inch cake so the surface of each cake is flat. Place the cut tops into a large bowl and break up to from large crumbs. The crumbs will be used a \lava rocks\ at the base of the volcano. Slice the bottom off the 6-inch bunt cake so it sits flat. Spread a thin layer of chocolate frosting between the 10-inch cake layers and stack. Spread a thin layer of chocolate frosting between 8-inch cake layers and stack. Place another thin layer of frosting on top of the 8-inch layer cake and place the bunt cake cut side down on top. Place a dollop of frosting on top of the 10-inch cake and carefully, place 8-inch cake on top and center of 10-inch cake. Use a serrated knife to trim edges around the tops of both cakes to create a cone shaped cake. (Make angled cuts downward and leave a round base on top for icing to \flow\ from.) To decorate, frost outside of entire cake with remaining chocolate frosting. Place the cake crumbs around the base of the cake. Pipe green icing around the entire bottom of the cake for \grass. To create \flowing lava\ pipe red icing a quarter from the top of cake in downward strokes to the middle of the cake with ribbon tip. Repeat technique with orange icing, starting almost at top of cake and ending where red icing begins with slight overlap. Repeat technique with yellow icing starting at the very top of cake and overlap orange icing. Drizzle yellow and red gel coloring around the very top of cake. For the smoke effect place a few pieces of dry ice into glass candle votive. Place the votive into the hole of the bunt cake. Pour a small amount of warm water into the votive and watch it smoke. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55529,&quot;Bloody Mary Bar One 64-ounce bottle tomato juice 3 tablespoons prepared horseradish<br> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 teaspoons soy sauce<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> Hot sauce, as needed<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 24 asparagus spears, trimmed 4 tablespoons salted butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 24 peeled and deveined shrimp (U16 size)<br> 12 slices crisp-cooked bacon<br> 12 celery stalks with leaves, bottoms trimmed 24 black olives 1 jar small whole pickles (not gherkins) 1 bottle hot sauce 1 bottle Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 container Montreal steak seasoning<br> One 750-milliliter bottle vodka (2 ounces per drink)<br> Instructions: For the Bloody Mary mix: Mix together the tomato juice, horseradish, Worcestershire, soy sauce, lemon juice, hot sauce as desired and some salt and pepper in a large pitcher.

In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, coriander, cumin and fennel. Drizzle the olive oil over both sides of the racks of lamb, then evenly apply the dry rub all over the lamb. Using a sharp knife, make cuts between each of the rib bones on the back sides of the racks to allow the straight racks to be flexible and formed into a crown. Tie the 2 racks together where they meet. Lift them so that the bare bones point upward and fashion them into a crown, then secure by tying twine around the bottom and midsection. Place the crown roast onto a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the meat (avoid touching bone) registers 110 degrees F, 50 minutes to 1 hour. For the pesto: Into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add the mint, cilantro, almonds, salt, green onions, garlic and cl. Pulse, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as necessary, until finely chopped. With the machine running, add 3/4 cup of the olive oil in a steady stream. Pour the pesto into a bowl. Add the remaining 3/4 cup olive oil and the lemon juice. Season to taste.

Slice the pita bread into 8 triangles and place them on a sheet pan. Place the sheet pan in the oven and toast the bread for 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55575,&quot;Coconut Matcha-Cream Pie 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, diced 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1/2 cup granulated sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon matcha tea powder, such as Kenko or The People&#39;s Republic of Tea, sifted 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cups unsweetened coconut milk 4 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup heavy cream, chilled 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 6 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 1/8 teaspoon matcha tea powder<br> Instructions: For the dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar and salt. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-sized bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to 1 tablespoon more cold water over the mixture. Form the dough into a ball, then flatten into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. On a lightly floured surface, roll the disk with a rolling pin into a 12-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie place, preferably glass, and trim the edges, leaving about 1 extra inch hanging over the edge. Tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to form a thick edge that is even with the rim. Flute the edge as desired. Freeze the pie shell for 30 minutes. Position an oven rack in the center and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put a piece of parchment paper or foil over the pie shell and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on a baking sheet on the center rack until the dough is set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and lift the sides of the parchment paper to remove the beans. Return the shell to the oven and continue baking until the pie shell is lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Cool on a rack. For the filling: Whisk the granulated sugar, cornstarch, matcha and salt together in a small saucepan until evenly combined. Pour in the coconut milk and egg yolks and whisk until smooth. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring steadily with the whisk, until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble, about 7 minutes. Continue cooking the filling, whisking constantly, for 30 seconds.<br> Remove the pan from the heat and, while whisking, stir in one piece of butter at a time, waiting until each piece absorbs into the pudding before adding the next. Whisk in the shredded coconut and vanilla, then scrape the filling into the cooled pie shell, smoothing the top. Press a sheet of plastic wrap on the surface of the filling to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the pie until the filling sets, at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Make the topping: Whisk the cream, vanilla and 6 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Scrape the whipped cream onto the pie and spread it evenly over the top, creating peaks and valleys with a spoon.<br> Combine the matcha and the remaining teaspoon confectioners&#39; sugar in a bowl. Place the matcha sugar in a small sieve and dust some of it over the top of the pie before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55576,&quot;Spinach Salad with Dried Cranberries, Walnuts and Pomegranate Vinaigrette 1/2 cup pomegranate juice 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard Salt and ground black pepper 6 cups baby spinach leaves 1/3 cup dried cranberries 1/3 cup walnut pieces Instructions: In a small container with lid, combine pomegranate juice, vinegar, oil, and Dijon.
