Add 1/3 cup cold water and stir with a spoon until a dough forms. Scrape off all the dough from the spoon and knead by hand until the flour is moistened, about 1 minute. Tear off small (pea-size) pieces of the wheat starch dough. Scatter over the glutinous rice dough and knead in until completely smooth. If the dough feels dry or cracks, knead in 1 tablespoon cold water at a time until the dough stops cracking. Knead for another 30 seconds, transfer the dough to a resealable bag and refrigerate for 1 hour to hydrate the flour. Divide the lotus paste into 8 portions (about 30 g each) and roll each into a ball. Transfer to a plate and refrigerate, covered, until ready to fill the dough balls. Remove the dough from the bag and knead until pliable. If it feels dry and cracks, knead in 1 tablespoon cold water at a time until smooth. Divide the dough into 8 pieces, roll each into a ball and cover with an inverted bowl to prevent it from drying. Working with 1 dough ball at a time, roll into a 4-inch round using a small rolling pin. Place it on your palm and thin out 1/2 inch of the edge all around using the tips of your index finger and thumb. Place a ball of lotus paste in the center, wrap the dough around it, then pinch the dough together and gently press it together to form a ball. Roll in between your palms until the seams disappear and a smooth ball forms. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining balls of dough and lotus paste. For the coating: Pour the sesame seeds onto a fine-mesh strainer, run under cold water to moisten, then drain and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Roll each ball in the sesame seeds until completely coated. For frying: Fill a large wok or deep Dutch oven two-thirds of the way with the neutral oil. Heat over medium-low heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Carefully add all the sesame balls and immediately start moving them along the bottom of the wok with a slotted spoon and spoon. Keep the sesame balls constantly moving to obtain the perfect round shape and fry, without letting the oil exceed 300 degrees F, until the balls expand a bit, the exterior is crisp and becomes light golden, about 10 minutes. Increase the heat to medium and continue frying, stirring constantly, without letting the oil exceed 325 degrees F, until the sesame balls are golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. During this time, submerge the sesame balls in the hot oil and push each ball in between the two spoons to color evenly and maintain the ball shape. Drain the sesame balls on a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool for 10 minutes. Cut each in half with kitchen shears, just like how they are served at dim sum restaurants, and enjoy them while they\u2019re still hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 40580,&quot;Five Spice Lamb Burgers with Pickled Cucumber Relish and Five Spice Aioli 1/2 cup mayonnaise Juice of 1 lime 2 teaspoons five-spice powder 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 red onion, small diced 1 red finger cl, seeded and diced 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 1/4 cup sugar 1 English cucumber, seeded and diced Kosher salt 1/2 bunch fresh mint, stemmed and coarsely chopped 2 pounds ground lamb 1 shallot, minced 1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced 1 clove garlic, minced 1 egg yolk 1 tablespoon five spice powder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 buns, for service 1 ripe tomato, sliced Instructions: For the aioli:<br> In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, lime juice, and five-spice powder. Refrigerate the aioli until ready to use.<br> For the relish:<br> In a saute pan over medium-high heat, toast the coriander seeds until fragrant. Drizzle in the vegetable oil, add the red onion and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent. Stir in the cl and white wine vinegar, and then sprinkle over the sugar, stirring until it dissolves.<br> Add the cucumber to the pan, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes over medium heat, and reduce slightly, achieving a light glaze consistency. Season the relish with salt, and let the mixture cool.<br> Just before serving the relish, stir in the mint, and season with salt, to taste.<br> For the burgers:<br> Put the ground lamb, shallot, fresh ginger, garlic, egg yolk, and five-spice powder in a bowl, and mix well. Season the mixture with salt, and black pepper. Divide and shape the lamb mixture into 4 (8-ounce) burger patties. Place the patties in the refrigerator for 1 hour, to allow the flavors to infuse.<br> Preheat a grill to medium-high and lightly oil the grate. Grill the lamb patties until they are seared on both sides, and cooked through. Remove the patties from the grill, and set aside. Place the buns on the grill, cut-side down, and toast until golden.<br> Put the lamb patties on the toasted buns, slathered with the Five-Spice Aioli, Pickled Cucumber Relish, and sliced tomato. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Barbera, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 40581,&quot;Yogurt Sauce 3 tablespoons peanut oil 2 teaspoons black or yellow mustard seeds 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 2 teaspoons pureed garlic 1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/8 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 pint plain yogurt Instructions: Have ingredients measured and nearby before beginning. Heat oil in a small skillet over high heat. Add mustard seeds. (They will begin popping immediately so have a cover close at hand for escaping seeds.) Cook until popping stops. Lower heat, add cumin seeds, and cook until they turn golden, about 1 minute. Stir in garlic for 10 seconds, then ginger for 10 seconds more, and remove from heat. Stir in turmeric, paprika, pepper flakes, and salt. Mix spices and yogurt in a bowl. Chill before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 40582,&quot;Straccetti di Pesce Spada 5 1/2 ounces swordfish 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/8 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic 1/2 teaspoon roughly chopped cl peppers Pinch salt 1/4 cup white wine 3/4 cup Italian cherry tomatoes 1/3 cup black olives 1 cup fresh arugula Instructions: Slice the swordfish into 1/2 by 2-inch strips. Dust with flour and toss to evenly coat. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil with garlic and cl peppers. Remove the garlic when golden brown. Shake off the excess flour from the swordfish strips and carefully place into hot olive oil. Season with salt and when the fish is golden in color, add the white wine. Let the wine reduce a little and then add the tomatoes. Reduce the tomatoes for approximately 3 minutes and add the black olives. Place on large plate and serve with fresh arugula. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 40583,&quot;Pineapple and Avocado Salsa 1 (14-ounce) can sliced pineapple in juice, drained and juices reserved 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 small jalapeno, seeds removed and diced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 red onion, finely chopped 1 medium avocado, halved, pitted and flesh cubed 2 tablespoons minced cilantro leaves Instructions: In a medium bowl, make the dressing by mixing 2 tablespoons of pineapple juice with the lime juice, honey, oil and jalapeno. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the pineapple and onion. Gently fold in the avocado and cilantro. Let the flavors blend for at least 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 40584,&quot;Pear-Almond Tart 1/2 recipe Almond Pate Sucre, recipe follows 1 cup blanched almonds 1/2 cup sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1 1/2 pounds pears 4 teaspoons crystallized sugar 3/4 cup whole unblanched almonds 3 1/3 cups sifted all-purpose flour 12 ounces (1 1/2 cups) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 cup sugar 1 egg 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. On a floured surface, lightly flour your rolling pin, roll out 1 piece of dough into a 4-inch circle. Repeat with the remaining dough. Place on parchment lined baking sheets. To make almond meal, grind the almonds in a food processor, just until fine, being careful that the meal does not turn to paste. Turn the meal out into a medium bowl and add sugar, eggs, and lemon zest with a wooden spoon. Cut each pear in half and remove the core. Cut each half into 5 or 6 thin wedges. Divide the filling evenly over the tarts, leaving a small border around the edges. Arrange the pears in a circular pattern on the filling. Sprinkle the sugar over the pears. Bake until the pears are lightly caramelized, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spread the nuts on a baking tray and toast until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool and coarsely grind in a food processor. Do not grind too fine. Transfer to a medium bowl and combine with the flour. Set aside. In an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, combine the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and the zest. Add the flour-nut mixture and mix to combine.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the figs and tomatoes skin-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Roast until they start to brown and soften, about 40 minutes. Cool, and then remove the tomato skins. In a food processor, combine the figs, tomatoes, vinegar, sugar, sorghum, chili paste, coriander, cumin and cinnamon and pulse until combined. Put this mixture in a saucepan with the bay leaf and cook over medium-high heat until the mixture begins to boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring often, until it thickens and reduces by a third, about 30 minutes--it will be thick enough so that when you stir it, you&#39;ll be able to see the bottom of the pot. Remove the bay leaf and discard. Season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40593,&quot;Emerilized Eggs Benedict 4 English muffins, split in 1/2 4 tablespoons butter, at room temperature 4 (6-ounce) beef fillets, split in 1/2 Essence, recipe follows 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cups water 1/2 teaspoon white vinegar Salt Pinch cayenne pepper 8 eggs, individually cracked into a cup 4 egg yolks 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon water 1 tablespoon Creole mustard or other whole-grain mustard 1/2 pound butter, melted and warm 2 teaspoons finely chopped parsley leaves 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Preheat a griddle or large skillet. Brush the muffins with the butter. Place the muffins on the hot griddle and pan-fry for 2 minutes on each side. Remove the muffins from the griddle and set aside. Using a sharp knife, split the fillets in half, horizontally. Season the fillets with Essence. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the fillets for 2 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Remove the fillets from the pan and set aside. In a large skillet, combine the water and vinegar. Season the water with salt. Bring the mixture to a boil. Slide 4 of the eggs into the water. When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the eggs are set, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Watch carefully and remove the eggs when the yolks are still soft, and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the eggs with salt and pepper. Return the water to a boil and repeat the process with the remaining eggs. In a stainless steel bowl set over a pot of simmering water over medium heat, whisk the egg yolks with the lemon juice, water, mustard, and parsley. Season with salt and cayenne. Whisk the mixture until pale yellow and slightly thick. Be careful not to let the bowl touch the water. Remove the bowl from the pot and, while whisking vigorously, gradually add the butter, little by little, until all is incorporated. Season, to taste, with salt and cayenne. To assemble, place the steaks on the English muffins. Top the steaks with the poached eggs. Spoon the Hollandaise sauce over the eggs. Garnish the eggs with parsley. Combine all ingredients thoroughly.

For the duck: Rub the duck with the olive oil, season it well with salt and pepper and place in a roasting pan breast-side up. Roast for 15 minutes, then shake the pan to release the duck and roast another 25 minutes. At this point, turn the duck onto the breast so it can baste in its own rendered fat. Roast another 25 minutes, then turn the duck again onto its back and cook for another 15 to 20 minutes. The duck skin should be golden brown and a thermometer placed in the thigh meat should register an internal temperature of 135 degrees F. Remove the duck from the pan, reserving the fat in the pan. Let the duck rest for 10 minutes, then slice into 8 pieces: 2 legs, 2 thighs, 2 wings and 2 breasts. For the Cabernet sauce: In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the duck neck and chicken thighs, skin-side down, and saute until golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, add the butter followed by the onions, garlic and shallots. Saute until translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the cognac and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Cabernet Sauvignon and bring to a simmer. Add the duck neck, chicken thighs, bay leaves, sage, thyme, parsley, chives and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. For the mushroom ragu: In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the mushrooms and cook gently for 7 to 8 minutes; season with sea salt and cracked black pepper. Then add the sherry, garlic, onion and half of the scallions and cook for 4 minutes. Add the ginger, 2 tablespoons butter and the remaining scallions and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside. For the radishes: Put the radishes in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, add salt and cook until the radishes are just tender. Drain. In a separate saucepan over medium heat, add the poached radishes and 1 tablespoon of the rendered duck fat and saute until golden, 7 to 8 minutes. Check for seasoning. For serving: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Reheat the duck meat on a sheet tray until warmed through, about 4 minutes. Place the mushroom ragu and radishes on a platter. Cut each breast into four pieces and place on a platter with the thighs and legs. Top with the Cabernet sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Barolo]&quot; 40598,&quot;Parmesan and Prosciutto Spiced Plums 1/2 cup port wine 1/4 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 3 cloves<br> 3 strips orange zest<br> 1 cinnamon stick<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 20 pitted prunes<br> 4 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano, cut into bite-size pieces 5 thin slices Prosciutto di Parma, sliced into quarters Instructions: In a small saucepan, combine the port, sugar, cider vinegar, cloves, orange zest, cinnamon, salt and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the prunes; simmer until softened and plumped, about 10 minutes. Allow the prunes to cool in the poaching liquid for 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the prunes to a plate and allow to cool completely. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Using a paring knife, make a slit from stem to tip in each of the prunes. Stuff each with a piece of Parmesan and wrap in a quarter slice of prosciutto. Place the wrapped prunes, seam-side down, on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the prosciutto is crispy and the Parmesan is soft and melted, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 40599,&quot;Easter Bonnet, Part Two 1 1/4 cups heavy cream, 10.5 ounces, 300 grams Store-bought pound cake Simple Syrup White chocolate, tempered, 14 ounces, 400 grams Cocoa butter, 14 ounces, 400 grams Instructions: To assemble: Use a pastry brush to coat the bottom half of each petal with a little Simple Syrup or warmed corn syrup. This will act as the \glue\ to adhere the petals to the bud. Wrap the first petal around the base of the bud. Continue adding petals in the same fashion until you have formed the size of flower you would like. Gently squeeze the bottom of the bud so the petals open. You can also gently roll back the tops of the petals to achieve a more realistic appearance. Cut off the bottom of the bud. Place around the brim of the hat and add the leaves as desired. To make the ganache: If using gelatin sheets, place them in a medium-size mixing bowl with enough cold water (about 2 cups) to cover. Let stand for about 5 minutes to allow the gelatin to soften and hydrate. Cold water hydrates the gelatin without letting it absorb too much liquid. Remove the gelatin from the bowl and squeeze out the excess water with your hands. If you use powdered gelatin, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup (1.75 ounces; 50 grams) of cold water. Let the gelatin bloom until it has absorbed all the water, about 1 minute. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Pour the heavy cream in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Remove from the heat and make a ganache by pouring the hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for about 30 seconds to allow the heat to distribute throughout the bowl. Add the hydrated gelatin and gently stir the mixture with a rubber spatula. The hot cream will cause the chocolate and the gelatin to melt. Slowly mixing the heavy cream and chocolate together causes the fats in them to combine to form an emulsion. Stir the ganache until it is smooth and homogenous. Place the mixing bowl in the ice bath and stir the ganache occasionally so it cools evenly. The ganache is ready when it has thickened. Test this by using a rubber spatula to draw a line through it. If the line holds for 10 to 15 seconds, it is ready. If the line fills in immediately, the ganache is too warm. Keep cooling and retest every 30 seconds. The ganache should not cool so much that it begins to harden and set. If this happens, warm it up over a saucepan of simmering water, removing it every 10 seconds and whisking it gently until it is smooth and viscous. To finish the mousse: While the ganache is cooling, pour the heavy cream into another medium-size mixing bowl and beat to soft peaks with an electric mixer on medium speed. Be careful; if you overwhip the heavy cream, it will lose volume and the mousse will not be as light and airy. When the ganache is cool but not cold, fold in the whipped cream in 2 additions until combined. The ganache should not be so cold that it has begun to set and is grainy, yet is should be cool enough that it doesn&#39;t melt the whipped cream. If the mousse begins to seize while you are folding in the whipped cream, warm it up over a saucepan of simmering water 5 seconds at a time until it is smooth again. Do not warm it so much that the whipped cream begins to melt. Then fold in any remaining whipped cream. When all of the whipped cream has been incorporated, the mousse will be loose and pourable. Don&#39;t worry; it will set up in the freezer. Prepare the pound cake: Cut the pound cake into a 4-inch flat circle and a 5 1/2-inch flat circle. You want the larger circle to be just a bit smaller than the diameter of your mold. That way, the mousse will cover the edge and the cake won&#39;t show through the mold. Place the mousse into a pastry bag with a large opening (no tip). Pipe the mousse into the dome mold, filling about two thirds full. Spread the mousse up the sides of the mold with the back of a large spoon. Place the smaller cake circle in the mousse. Soak the cake with the simple syrup. Fill with more mousse until almost full. Top with the larger cake circle and press down slightly. Soak the cake with the simple syrup. Place the mold in the freezer for at least 1 hour to allow the mousse to set. At this stage, the cake will hold in the freezer for up to 1 week. Spread a 1/8-inch thick layer of tempered white chocolate onto a piece of parchment paper. Let the chocolate harden until firm but not set, about 5 minutes. To make the brim of the hat, trace around a 10-inch cardboard cake circle or serving plate to cut a circle from the white chocolate. Place a clean sheet of parchment paper over the chocolate sheet and flip over both. Peel off the parchment paper. Separate the chocolate cutout and place on a cardboard cake circle. To assemble: Unmold by dipping the mold in hot water for 5 seconds. Press against one side of the mousse to slide it out of the dome mold. Place the dome, cake side down, in the center of the white chocolate circle. Prepare the paint sprayer: Place equal amounts of white chocolate and cocoa butter over a double boiler and melt until smooth with no lumps. Assemble the dessert and place in the freezer for about 10 minutes. The surface of the dessert must be chilled so the chocolate coating will harden upon contact, giving it the desired texture. Remove the dessert from the freezer and place on a platter or cake circle. Place the chocolate mixture in a clean paint sprayer and use it to spray the dessert with the chocolate. Cleanup will be much easier if you use a plastic-lined cardboard box as a backdrop to the dessert when you spray it. Add the decorations. Let thaw in the refrigerator for about 1 hour before serving. The Bonnet will hold in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper and then add the beef to the skillet and cook, turning as needed, until browned all over and cooked to medium-rare, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the beef to paper towels to drain, wipe the skillet clean with paper towels and return the skillet to medium heat. Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons oil in the skillet, then add the mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the onions and peppers, then sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until lightly charred and soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl and let cool. Meanwhile, place the cooled beef in the freezer for 20 minutes to firm up. Working quickly, very thinly cut the beef into the thinnest possible slices. (Slices should be almost as thin as deli meat.)<br> On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 20-by-14-inch rectangle. Starting on the shorter end of the dough, arrange the beef slices evenly over half of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Sprinkle both cheeses over the meat, then scatter the cooked vegetables evenly over the cheese. Working from that short side, tightly roll the dough up, jelly roll-style, into a log. Pinch the open seams together to seal, then tuck them underneath the log. Transfer the log to the prepared baking sheet and brush with the egg wash. Bake until the bread is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.<br> Let the bread cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Halve the bread lengthwise, cut each half crosswise into 4 equal pieces and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 40601,&quot;Traditional Potato Latkes One 30-ounce bag frozen shredded potatoes, defrosted (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 sheets unsalted matzo (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 medium red onion, quartered<br> 2 eggs<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> Vegetable oil, for deep-frying Full-fat sour cream or unsweetened applesauce, for serving Instructions: Turn out the shredded potatoes into a large bowl. If you have an exhaust fan in your kitchen, turn it on and place the food processor underneath it--the smell from the processed onion will be very strong. Place the matzo in the food processor and pulse until you have a range of sizes, from 1/4-inch to nearly flour. Dump this onto the potatoes. Put the food processor back together and place the onion and the salt and pepper in the bowl. Process until nearly liquid, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs to the food processor and process until completely incorporated and the mixture turns almost white. Dump this onto the potatoes. Put on a pair of disposable gloves and mix everything together by hand. (If you don&#39;t use gloves, the onion smell will cling to your hands for a very long time.) Form the mixture into latkes: Take enough to fill the palm of your hand, then press your hands together hard, palm-to-palm, squeezing until some liquid comes out. You should end up with a disc that&#39;s thicker in the middle, like a flying saucer. Turn the disc around in your hands while patting the sides to firm it up. Give the latke one last squeeze--it&#39;s ready for the fryer. (When I make them, my latkes average 3 ounces each.) In a deep-fat fryer or heavy medium pot, heat several inches of oil to 375 degrees F. In batches, gently put the latkes into the hot oil and leave them alone to fry until golden brown, turning only once, about 4 minutes. The perfect latke will be golden brown and crispy on the outside, soft and white and warm on the inside. You can expect some shreds of potato to come loose; just scoop them out when the latkes are done. If a latke falls apart while frying, it&#39;s a sign you have to squeeze harder! Using tongs, remove the latkes from the oil; there is no need to drain. Serve hot, with a generous dollop of sour cream or apple sauce for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 40602,&quot;Best Chocolate Brownie Adapted from Marcel Desaulniers, Death By Chocolate) 1/4 cup flour 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 5 ounces bittersweet chocolate (top-quality), broken in 10 pieces 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 eggs 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 cup sour cream 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (top quality), coarsely chopped (about 1/2 cup) Instructions: Heat oven to 325 degrees.

Blend until frothy. Cover and refrigerate for the flavors to marry. To serve, pour the sangrita into 8 straight, tall shot glasses. Pour the tequila into 8 identical shot glasses and place them all on a tray lined with a napkin desired, and serve immediately with lime wedges and salt, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Tequila, Mezcal, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40606,&quot;Lobster Stew 2 lobsters (about 1 1/2 pounds/675 g each) 3 tablespoons butter 1 onion, chopped 1 tablespoon tomato paste 2 tablespoons Cognac 3 cups/750 ml water 12 asparagus tips 12 slices yellow zucchini 6 radishes, halved 1/4 cup freshly shelled peas Salt and freshly ground black pepper Lemon juice, to taste 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chervil Instructions: Fill a large pot with water to come finger deep. Bring to a boil, put the lobsters in head first, and steam 4 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until cool enough to work with. Shell the lobsters, wrapping the meat and refrigerating until ready to use (you should have 4 intact claws and 2 tails which you can halve lengthwise). Reserve 12 lobster legs. Reserve the shells, but discard the body. Chop the shells to pieces with a mallet or in the food processor. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large saute pan and cook the onion until soft. Stir in the tomato paste and add the lobster shells. Pour over the Cognac and flame. When the flames have died down, pour over 3 cups/750 ml water, and cook until the liquid is reduced to 1 1/2 cups/375 ml. Strain, pressing down on the shells to extract all the juices. Return the juices to the saute pan. While the sauce is reducing, cook the vegetables, separately, in a pot of boiling salted water until al dente, 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on the vegetable. When each is done, lift to a strainer with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge into an ice bath to preserve the color. Bring the lobster stock in the saute pan to a simmer, uncovered. Add the lobster and poach gently 3 minutes. Add the vegetables and continue to cook 2 minutes. Arrange half a tail and a whole claw in each of 4 soup plates. Divide the vegetables evenly around the meat. You should have about 1/4 cup/60 ml sauce per dish, so if you have too much boil it down, whisking in the remaining butter at the end. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Ladle over the lobster and vegetables, scatter over chervil, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 40607,&quot;cl-Rubbed Beef Tenderloin with Garlic-Herb Oil 1 tablespoon ancho cl powder 1 tablespoon ground cumin<br> 1 tablespoon paprika<br> 2 teaspoons ground coriander<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> One 3 1/2- to 4-pound beef tenderloin, trimmed and tied<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil Garlic-Herb Oil, recipe follows 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, crushed<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Mix together the ancho cl powder, cumin, paprika, coriander, cayenne, garlic powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Rub the olive oil on the tenderloin, then rub evenly with the spice mixture. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Heat the canola oil in a large ovensafe skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high heat. Sear the tenderloin (bending it to fit in the skillet if necessary) until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the tenderloin reads 130 degrees F (for medium rare), about 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove the string and slice the tenderloin crosswise. Spoon over some of the Garlic-Herb Oil and sprinkle the meat with additional salt. Serve the remaining Garlic-Herb Oil in a bowl on the side. Combine the olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium low and gently poach the garlic for 5 minutes; the oil should be at a very bare simmer but not boiling, otherwise the garlic will burn. Turn off the heat and allow to cool completely. Remove the garlic from the oil and discard; transfer the oil to a bowl. Add the parsley, cilantro, chives, red pepper flakes and salt to taste to the oil and stir to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 40608,&quot;Fresh Lemon Mousse 3 extra-large whole eggs 3 extra-large eggs, separated 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (4 lemons) Kosher salt 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup good bottled lemon curd, at room temperature Sweetened Whipped Cream, recipe follows Sliced lemon, for garnish 1 cup cold heavy cream 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: In a large heat-proof bowl, whisk together the 3 whole eggs, 3 egg yolks, 1 cup sugar, the lemon zest, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt.

Tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. Put the leaves in a large bowl and toss with the olive oil, vinegar and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Prepare the pastry by combining the flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor. Add the butter and combine until coarse crumbs are formed. With the machine running, add ice water, tablespoon by tablespoon, and keep the machine going until the dough rolls off the sides of the container into a ball. Cover the pastry with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Use this time to slice the tomatoes and cheese. Roll out the dough with a little flour into a circle large enough to fit into a 10 inch tart pan or a pie pan. The dough will be about 1/8-inch thick. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Evenly brush the mustard over the bottom of the pastry shell tucking in the edges. Cover the mustard with all the cheese, distributing it evenly.

Stock: If no stock is available, put the bones, carrots, onions, celery and bouquet garni into a saucepan. Cover with cold water and simmer for 3 to 4 hours to make a stock. Strain and set aside. Filling: Cut all the surplus fat away from the meat and then cut the meat into small, neat pieces about the size of a small sugar lump. Render down the scraps of fat in a hot, wide saucepan until the fat renders. Discard the pieces. Cut the vegetables into slightly smaller dice and toss them in the fat, leaving them to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the vegetables and toss the meat in the remaining fat over a high heat until the color turns deep brown. Heat the cumin seed in the oven for a few minutes and crush lightly. Stir the flour and cumin seed into the meat. Cook gently for 2 minutes and add in the stock gradually. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Add back the vegetables, season with salt and freshly ground pepper and leave to simmer, covered. If using young lamb, 30 minutes will be sufficient; an older animal may take up to 1 hour. Pastry: Meanwhile, make the pastry. Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl and make a well in the center. Dice the butter, put it into a saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Pour the liquid all at once into the flour and mix together quickly; beat until smooth. At first the pastry will be too soft to handle but as soon as it cools it may be rolled out to 1/3 to 1/4- inch (2.5 to 5 millimeters) thick, to fit the 2 tins. The pastry may be made into individual pies or 1 large pie. Keep back 1/3 of the pastry for lids. Fill the pastry-lined tins with the meat mixture which should be almost, but not quite cooked and cooled a little. Brush the edges of the pastry with the water and egg wash and put on the pastry lids, pinching them tightly together. Roll out the trimmings to make pastry leaves or twirls to decorate the tops of the pies. Make a hole in the center, brush the lid with egg-wash and then egg-wash the decoration also. Bake the pies for 40 minutes. Serve with a good green salad. &quot;,&quot;[Reds, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah]&quot; 40640,&quot;Onion Frittata Rolls with Bacon and Roasted Red Pepper 2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 cups very thinly sliced onions 4 whole eggs plus 3 egg whites, beaten together with a fork for about 30 seconds 6 soft rolls 12 slices bacon, cooked crisp 2 medium red bell peppers, roasted, peeled and seeded Instructions: Place the butter in a flameproof nonstick skillet, 5 inches in diameter.

Take a cast-iron skillet, fill with approximately 1 to 1 1/2 inches of oil and set over high heat. Once the oil is hot and bubbly, add the garlic slices quickly, and gently stir so they don&#39;t stick together. Cook for approximately 30 seconds. Remove using a slotted spoon or handled strainer once they are light golden brown, and place on the paper towel-lined plate to cool and drain. Work in small batches to avoid the chips over-cooking and sticking together. If the color is still too light and the garlic chips don&#39;t have a small amount of crunch, repeat the process and leave in the oil about 10 to 15 seconds; remove and drain. Make these ahead and keep in an airtight container for up to a week. For the smashed beets and carrots: Wash and scrub the beets and carrots as necessary to remove any dirt; do not peel. Take a large pot and place the beets inside with the olive oil, red wine vinegar and bay leaves. Add cold water to cover the tops of the beets. Place over medium to medium-high heat and cook until the beets are tender when pierced with a fork, 25 to 40 minutes depending on the size of the beets. Drain and set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, press down gently on each beet using the palm of your hand until flattened. Lay the smashed beets on a baking pan, toss with grapeseed oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss the carrots with some grapeseed oil, salt and pepper in a separate bowl. Heat a large griddle or cast-iron pan with some grapeseed oil over medium-high heat. Place the carrots and smashed beets on the griddle, lower the heat to medium and cook until brown on the bottom and the edges caramelize, 15 to 20 minutes. Then flip and repeat until the carrots are tender and the beets are caramelized and brown on the edges. Transfer the carrots and beets to a large bowl. Check for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper as needed. Drizzle with some good-quality olive oil to finish, and toss in the garlic chips and thyme. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40650,&quot;Pimento Cheese Jalapeno Poppers 12 medium jalapenos 3/4 cup Pimento Cheese, recipe follows 1 cup fine herbed breadcrumbs<br> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning<br> 3 eggs, beaten<br> Canola oil, for pan-frying Kosher salt<br> 4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature 2 ounces sharp Cheddar, shredded<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 2 tablespoons chopped roasted red pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Split the jalapenos lengthwise from the stem to tip, then cut crosswise making a shallow \T\ at the top (the stem end). Fold the peppers open and remove the veins and seeds with a paring knife. Put the pimento cheese into a pastry bag or a heavy-duty plastic bag with a corner snipped off.

Set aside. Lay the pasta dough out in long sheets on your counter. Working quickly, place 4 dollops of ricotta mixture along 1 sheet pasta, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Form the ricotta mixture into small \nests\ with sufficient space for a duck egg yolk in each. Carefully transfer the yolks into each ricotta nest. Using a spray bottle filled with water, gently mist the pasta sheet to seal. Lay the second sheet of pasta over the first and use a ring cutter to seal. Seal the pasta gently with fingers. Dust a half sheet tray with flour and transfer the ravioli to the tray. Freeze until needed. When ready to serve: Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and cook the ravioli approximately 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to overcook. For the sauce: Add the butter to a saucepan over high heat; as it begins to melt, add the sage leaves and almonds. Allow the butter to brown. Squeeze in the orange juice and add a ladleful of pasta water. Add the Parmesan cheese. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the ravioli from the water and place directly into sauce, tossing to coat. Transfer the ravioli to plates and finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. To make the pasta dough: Mound the \00\ flour on a cutting board or countertop. Sprinkle the salt over it. Form a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yolks. Add the olive oil and break each yolk. Using a plastic bench scraper or your fingers, draw the flour over the yolks from the perimeter. Continue to mix the flour into the yolks until it&#39;s all incorporated, kneading only enough for it to come together. Shape the dough into a rectangle, about 1/2-inch thick. The mixture should be dense, flaky, and crumbly. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 10 to 30 minutes. Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Take one piece of dough (keeping the others covered) and flatten it with your hands. If the dough feels very dry, dampen the surface with a few drops of water using your fingers or a pastry brush. Starting with the rollers of your pasta machine set to the widest setting, pass the dough through, five or six times, or until the dough begins to become pliable. Do the same for the remaining pieces. Narrow the rollers by one setting and roll each piece through it once. Continue narrowing the rollers and rolling the pasta through each consecutive setting one time until the dough has reached the desired thickness. Proceed to cut the pasta as desired, tossing the finished pasta with the rice flour to prevent sticking. The pasta at this point can sit at room temperature covered with parchment or a dry towel, something that will allow it to breathe but not dry out, for up to half a day. It can also be cut as desired, tossed with rice flour, and frozen in plastic bags for up to a month. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, GSM Blend]</p><p>&quot; 40665,&quot;Double Apple Mojito Small handful fresh mint (about 10 leaves) 1 cup ice cubes Splash simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water, heated until sugar dissolves, cooled) 1/4 cup apple juice 1/3 cup vodka 2 red apple slices, for garnish 2 green apple slices, for garnish Instructions: In a tall glass, crush the mint leaves with a muddler.

Heat a saute pan and add 2 tablespoons of canola oil. Saute the rice cakes until golden brown on both sides. Put in the oven for 10 minutes over to insure the cakes are heated through. Preheat a grill. For the White Truffle Vinaigrette: Put shallots, verjus, and mustard into a glass bowl and stir together. Blend the oils together. Slowly whisk in the oils into the mustard-verjus mixture, constantly stirring to emulsify the dressing. Add the chives, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Reserve at room temperature. Grilled Halibut wrapped with Leeks: Bring a pot of water large enough to hold the leeks to a boil. Add kosher salt. Cook the leek until just tender and immediately plunge into ice water. Drain well and cut into 1/2-inch wide strips at least 12 to 15 inches long. Cut the fish into strips 12 inches long about 1-inch wide and 1/2-inch thick. Roll up in a spiral and wrap with the leek strip. Secure with the skewers in a \x\ fashion. Brush with canola oil and season with salt and pepper then place on a stovetop grill or BBQ and cook until just done about 4 minutes on both sides. Keep warm until service. For the Pea shoots: Heat a large saute pan and add the oil. When the oil just begins to smoke add the shallots and cook for 10 seconds. Add the tendrils and \stir fry\ the pea shoots until they just begin to wilt. Do not over cook, you want them wilted but still crispy. They cook fast, so do this at the last moment. Assembly: Place the tendrils down first on a warm plate or large entree bowl, put the risotto cake in the center. Top with the grilled halibut and spoon the dressing over the pea tendrils and put a little on the fish. You can top the fish with some micro greens, lightly dressed or herb plush or nothing at all. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 40667,&quot;Cranberry Cornbread Bites 2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries 1/3 cup sugar<br> 1 orange, zested<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> Nonstick cooking spray 3/4 cup yellow cornmeal<br> 3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2/3 cup whole milk<br> 1 large egg<br> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives<br> 4 ounces thinly sliced deli ham, each slice quartered<br> Instructions: Special equipment: a 24-cup mini-muffin tin For the cranberry relish: Combine the cranberries, sugar, orange zest, salt and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

Return one piece to the mixer and add 4 to 5 drops red food coloring. Mix on low until evenly colored a vibrant red. Shape into a log and wrap in plastic. Clean the mixer bowl and paddle. Add 3 pieces of the remaining dough to the mixer bowl and add 1 to 2 drops black food coloring. Mix on low until evenly colored light grey. Flatten into a rectangle and wrap in plastic. Leave the remaining 2 pieces of dough uncolored. Flatten them into a rectangle and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate all the dough until they just begin to firm up, about 20 minutes.<br> Cut a piece of pliable cardboard into a 10-inch square and cut a piece of parchment to fit on top. Fold in half to crease the cardboard and parchment. Roll the grey piece of dough on a lightly floured work surface to make a 7-by-8-inch rectangle, making the edges slightly thinner than the center. Center the rolled dough on the crease of the parchment with the 7-inch side closest to you and fold the cardboard to make a deep \V.\ Brush just the crease with egg wash. Place jars or cans on either side to hold the cardboard V in place while you roll the rest of the dough. Roll the plain piece of dough to a 7-by-8-inch rectangle and place on top of the grey rectangle. Brush the entire piece with egg wash. Roll the red log into a 4-inch cylinder. Cut in half lengthwise to make two 4-inch half-moons. Place the red pieces in the crease, rounded-side down, and press gently to adhere. Fold the edges of the plain dough over to completely cover the red and press to adhere. Trim the edges of the grey dough so they are even with the plain dough. Using the cardboard as a guide, gently press the top and side to make the dough into a triangle shape (Don&#39;t press too hard, though). Wrap the dough in the parchment, then plastic. Freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.<br> Cut about 1/2 inch off each end of the cylinder with a very sharp knife to reveal the shark face. Slice the cylinder into about 1/4- to 1/3-inch-thick cookies. Arrange the slices about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. With a paring knife, cut 3 small diagonal slits in the grey part of the cookies for gills, starting about halfway down. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until crisp and just starting to turn brown on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes.<br> While the cookies bake, melt about three-quarters of the white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave on 50-percent power. Stir until smooth. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip a small corner from one end for piping. As soon as the cookies come out of the oven (they should be still hot/warm), press mini chocolate chips points-up around the jawline to make teeth. The chips will adhere as the cookies cool. Pipe 2 small dots of melted white chocolate on each side of the cookies, near the top, and stick mini chocolate chips on for eyes.<br> Once the cookies are cool, pipe the remaining white chocolate in a wave along the bottom of each cookie and dip in the blue sprinkles to make the ocean.

Sprinkling additional spice mixture on the crawfish after draining also will increase the spiciness.<br> Crawfish Crab and Shrimp Boil: There are many manufacturers to choose from. This is a spice blend of salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, lemon juice, and additional spices. Typically a bag of spice mix costs about $5.00. The brand used for the show was Lousiana Fish Fry Products Crawfish Crab and Shrimp Boil.<br> Instructions:<br> Place the cooking pot with its basket on the propane burner and fill with 11 gallons of water, about halfway. This should be about the right amount of water to protect against spillage when the potatoes or crawfish are added later. Add the 2 sticks of butter and 2/3 of the bag of Crawfish Crab and Shrimp Boil, and the 5 pounds of red potatoes. Cover and bring to a boil. Cook potatoes for 15 minutes and, while the potatoes are cooking, rinse the crawfish.<br> Place the bag of crawfish in 1 of the coolers, or, on the ground and hose down the bag until the water runs clear, about 5 minutes. Open the bag and pour the live crawfish into 1 of the coolers. With the drain of the cooler open, continue to rinse the crawfish for 5 minutes or until the water runs clear.<br> After the potatoes have cooked for 15 minutes, add the corn and continue cooking the corn and the potatoes for 15 minutes more. Remove a potato and test for doneness, continuing to cook, if needed. Remove the basket and dump the corn and potatoes into 1 of the coolers. Close the cooler in order to keep the corn and potatoes warm.<br> Pour the crawfish into the cooking basket and lower the basket into the pot. Bring to a boil and cook the crawfish for 15 minutes. Turn the heat off and allow the crawfish to simmer in the liquid for an additional 15 minutes.<br> Remove the crawfish and serve with the potatoes and corn. Traditionally, the crawfish is dumped onto a newspaper covered table (we used a door on 2 sawhorses). Additional spice mix can be sprinkled on the crawfish, if desired.<br> Variation: Some cooks add 1 to 2 pounds of sweet onions, peeled and cut in wedges, and/or the juice from 1 dozen lemons to the cooking liquid.<br> Variation: With proper ventilation, several pounds of shrimp could be cooked with approximately 1/2 to 1 cup of the spice mixture indoors. However, without proper ventilation the spice mixture fumes will overwhelm the typical house. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 40709,&quot;Oaxacan Wedding Cake 3/4 cup/180 ml unsalted butter, softened, plus more for pan 2 cups/500 ml unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons/10 ml baking powder 1/4 teaspoon/1 ml salt 1 1/4 cups/310 ml granulated sugar 3 eggs 3/4 cup/180 ml milk 1 teaspoon/5 ml vanilla extract 3 cups/750 ml 35-percent whipping cream 1/2 cup/125 ml powdered sugar 2 tablespoons/30 ml strong brewed espresso coffee 1 teaspoon/5 ml vanilla extract 2 cups/500 ml strawberries, sliced, plus whole, for garnish 1/4 cup/60 ml granulated sugar 1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped 1 cup/250 ml toasted walnuts, chopped, plus whole, for garnish Instructions: With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).

Remove the giblets and neck from the turkey and rinse. Reserve for the dressing. Place chopped onions, celery, and carrots in the bottom of the roasting pan. Pick a few herbs off the stalks and add to the vegetables. Set aside. Pat dry the turkey with paper towels. Season the cavity with kosher salt (approximately 2 tablespoons). Place the quartered onion and the remaining herbs inside the turkey cavity. Cover the tips of the wings with aluminum foil and truss the turkey (see Cook&#39;s Note**). Rub the turkey with the softened butter. Place the turkey in the roasting pan breast side up on a roasting rack. Place the turkey in the oven with the lid on. Baste every hour starting after the first 1 1/2 hours. Cook until an instant read thermometer inserted in the leg meat near the hip joint reads 160 degrees F (approximately 3 hours). Remove the lid and turn the oven up to 400 degrees F. Continue to cook the turkey for 20 to 25 minutes, until the turkey skin is golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the leg meat near the hip joint reads 175 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the pan and let it rest in a warm place for 20 minutes before carving (see Cook&#39;s Note***.) Place roasting pan over medium heat and add 1/2 cup of water. Use a wooden spoon to help release the drippings from the bottom of the pan. Using a fine sieve, strain drippings into a medium saucepot. Place the saucepot over medium heat. Whisk the cream and flour together in a small bowl to create a smooth paste. Add a 1/2 cup of the pan drippings to the cream mixture and whisk together. Pour the cream mixture into the saucepot and whisk together. Cook for approximately 2 to 3 minutes and reduce heat to medium low. Simmer for 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with the perfect turkey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40711,&quot;Mahi Mahi With Asparagus and Almond Sauce 1/4 cup sliced almonds 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon honey 1 1/2 teaspoons dijon mustard Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley 2 pounds asparagus, tough ends trimmed 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 4 6-ounce skinless mahi mahi fillets (about 1 inch thick) Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Spread the almonds on a rimmed baking sheet and broil, stirring frequently, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Combine the toasted almonds, 2 tablespoons olive oil, the lemon juice, honey, mustard, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a blender and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the parsley. Toss the asparagus with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon water, the lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste on the same baking sheet. Spread in a single layer and broil until the asparagus is bright green and crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and keep warm. Sprinkle the fish with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and arrange on the same baking sheet, rounded side down; broil until opaque, about 3 minutes. Turn the fillets, brush with some of the almond sauce and continue broiling until just firm and cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes. Divide the fish and asparagus among plates and top with the remaining almond sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 40712,&quot;Fried Chicken 6 to 8 pieces skinless white chicken meat with or without bones 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 to 1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening Salt and fresh ground black pepper Instructions: Trim off all fat and discoloration, etc. with kitchen shears or a sharp knife from the chicken. Wash under cold water. Put the flour into a plastic bag. While the pieces are still very wet, place them 1 at a time into the flour. Shake the bag to coat each piece. Melt about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of shortening in a pan on medium heat. Shake the bag again to keep the pieces from sticking together. When the shortening is melted and very hot, remove the chicken from the bag. Gently shake off the excess flour and lay into the hot fat. When all the pieces are in the pan, cover with a lid and allow to fry about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove cover and check each piece to see how brown it is. When it is lightly golden brown, turn to fry the other side. Add salt and fresh ground pepper to each piece on the browned side. Cover again and allow the other side to brown. Season the second side. At this point, you may remove the cover and continue to fry the chicken to the desired \browness\ you prefer. Turn often. It should be nicely browned with a very crisp outside and a moist, tender inside. You may want to reduce the heat a little after you have browned the second side. Boneless, skinless chicken cooks much faster than meat with the bone in. Place the fried pieces on a wire rack covered with a paper towel to drain off the excess grease. For best flavor and texture, serve about 7 to 10 minutes after you remove from the pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 40713,&quot;Organic Multigrain Loaf 3/4 cups (4.4 ounces) grain mix (equal parts cracked wheat, rye, oats, millet, flax seeds) Water to cover 2 cups (8.9 ounces) unbleached organic flour 2 cups (8.9 ounces) organic whole wheat flour 1 tablespoons malt 1 1/4 cups (9.2 ounces) water 1/2 cup (1.8 ounces) sourdough levain 1/3 cake compressed yeast 1 tablespoon sea salt Instructions: Soak grains in water overnight.

Put the chicken in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag and add the brine; seal and refrigerate 2 hours. Prepare the grill: For a charcoal grill, pile 3 to 4 pounds briquettes in the grill; ignite and let burn until the coals are ashy. For a gas grill, preheat to high. Prepare the chicken: Remove from the brine and pat dry; reserve the orange zest and cardamom. Rub the olive oil all over the skin. Loosen the skin on the breasts and legs with your fingers; rub 1 garlic clove under and over the skin. Combine the brown sugar, coriander, cumin, paprika, allspice, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper; rub under and over the skin of the chicken and inside the cavity. Pour half of the remaining beer can into a disposable 8-inch-square pan. Add the reserved orange zest to the pan. Poke 3 or 4 holes into the top sides of the beer can using a paring knife. Add the remaining 3 smashed garlic cloves and the reserved cardamom pods to the can. For a charcoal grill, bank the coals to both sides in two piles; nestle the pan with the beer between the coals and replace the top grill grate. For a gas grill, reduce the heat to medium on one side and turn off the burners on the other; place the pan under the grate on the unlit side. Set the chicken over the beer can, inserting the can into the cavity so 1 inch of the can is exposed. Set on the grill grates over the drip pan so the chicken balances on the can and legs like a tripod. Cover the grill and cook until the chicken is golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F. If using charcoal, this will take about 1 hour 20 minutes; add a handful of briquettes to each bank of coals every 30 minutes to maintain the heat. If using gas, it will take about 1 hour 5 minutes; carefully rotate the chicken halfway through. Remove the chicken from the grill, discard the can and transfer to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40720,&quot;Chocolate-Pistachio Macaroons 3 large egg whites 1/2 cup dried cherries, chopped 1/2 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 1 14-ounce package sweetened shredded coconut 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 1/4 cup pistachios, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Strain the oyster-cooking liquid through a fine strainer into a clean saucepan. Add the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of the heavy cream to the oyster liquid and simmer gently for about 5 minutes, until the mixture has the consistancy of cold heavy cream. Meanwhile, simmer the remaining tablespoon of cream in a small pan until it thickens. Season with salt and pepper and add the spinach. Stir for a minute over medium heat to heat the spinach. Arrange the spinach in a small mound in the center of each soup plate or sea urchin shell. Gently stir the chives, oysters and sea urchin roe into the oyster sauce and heat gently--without boiling--for about 30 seconds. Arrange the oysters and roe around and over the spinach. Make sure everyone gets 4 oysters. Spoon over the sauce. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 40754,&quot;Stromboli Bites 1 cup prepared marinara sauce One 13.8-ounce tube store-bought pizza dough, such as Pillsbury All-purpose flour, for dusting 2 ounces sliced pepperoni, halved 2 ounces sliced salami, cut into 1-inch pieces<br> 1/3 cup sliced pepperoncini 1/3 cup sliced black olives 1 cup shredded mozzarella 1/4 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Reserve 2/3 cup of the marinara for dipping. Lightly flour a work surface. Roll the pizza dough out to a 12-by-15-inch rectangle. Cut the rectangle into fifteen 3-by-4-inch rectangles. Spread 1 teaspoon of the remaining marinara over each little rectangle, leaving a 1-inch unsauced border.

Pour the milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Mix on low to combine. Add 1/2 cup of the flour and the egg yolks and beat on medium to combine. Sprinkle the remaining 2 cups flour evenly over top. Do not mix. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside undisturbed at room temperature until the yeast has risen slightly under the flour, 90 minutes. Add the 2 whole eggs, granulated sugar, lemon zest, salt, and nutmeg and beat on medium speed until a shaggy dough forms, about 1 minute. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the melted butter to make a smooth, sticky dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly buttered large bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 3 hours. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Form into a ball and return to the bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to overnight. For the filling: Add the butter, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl and mix into a smooth paste. On a floured surface, roll the dough into a 20-by-7-inch rectangle, with the long edge facing you. Spread the filling in an even layer over the dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border along all sides. Brush the long edge furthest from you with water. Roll the dough away from you into a long, tight cylinder. Transfer the roll seam-side down to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush one end with water and place the ends together, slightly overlapping to form a ring. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the doubled in size, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the cake until firm and golden brown, about 40 minutes. Transfer the cake to a rack set on top of a baking sheet and let cool completely. Flip the cake over and use a paring knife to cut a small slit into the bottom. Insert the plastic baby into the hole and arrange the slit so that it covers the baby. Flip the cake back over. For the glaze: Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and 2 to 3 tablespoons water to a medium bowl and whisk until smooth (if necessary, add up to 2 more tablespoons water to achieve the correct consistency). Brush a thick band of the glaze over the cake and immediately sprinkle with purple sugar.

Beat the cream cheese, butter and confectioners&#39; sugar together in a large mixing bowl with a handheld mixer until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl. Add the egg, vanilla and lemon zest and beat until smooth, another minute. Scrape down the bowl again. Add the almond and coconut flours and the salt. Beat until a slightly sticky dough forms. Halve the dough and shape each into a flat disc. Wrap each in plastic and chill in the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes. Work with one disc of chilled dough at a time, leaving the other in the freezer. Place the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll to 1/4-inch thickness. Carefully peel off the top sheet of parchment. Dip a 3-inch round cookie cutter into some coconut flour to help keep it from sticking to the dough and cut the dough into rounds. (The dough is very soft, so you will likely have to leave the cookies in place and scrape away the surrounding dough.) If you like, use mini cookie cutters to cut a hole from the middles of the rounds for half of the rounds. The dough will probably be too soft to transfer the cookies, so slide the parchment paper with the rounds onto a baking sheet. Gather the scraps of dough together and flatten into another round. Wrap the disc of dough in plastic, and chill in the freezer. Place the baking sheet of cut cookies into the freezer to chill for 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, repeat the process with the second disc of chilled dough. Reroll the scraps and cut out more cookies. (You should be able to cut a total of 18 to 20 rounds.) Bake one sheet of cookies at a time for 5 minutes. Turn the oven down to 300 degrees F and continue to bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until lightly golden on the edges, about another 10 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack. (Do not try to transfer the cookies from the baking sheet until completely cooled.) Increase the oven to 350 degrees F and repeat with the other cookies. For the frosting: With a handheld mixer, beat the butter in a bowl until light and airy. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla and salt. Mix on low speed until smooth. Transfer a third of the frosting to a piping bag and set aside. Divide the remaining frosting evenly between 2 bowls. Add about 1/2 teaspoon red gel paste to one bowl and 1/2 teaspoon green gel paste to the other. Mix until the color is evenly distributed, adding more gel as desired. Transfer to two more piping bags. Cut off the tips of the bags when ready to assemble. To assemble: Pair off the cookie rounds into tops and bottoms, using any cookies with cutouts as tops. Arrange the flat sides of the bottom cookies facing up. Pipe about 3 tablespoons frosting onto the bottom cookies. Smooth the frosting with an offset spatula. Top with the flat sides of the top cookies facing down, pressing gently so that the frosting is pushed to the edges of the cookies. Put the crushed peppermint candy and sprinkles on separate plates. Place the sanding \sugar\ in a bowl. Roll the edges of each cookie in the candy or sprinkles, or spoon the sugar over the frosting. Sprinkle any cut-out windows with more decorations as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 40768,&quot;Heavenly Chocolate Delight 2 1/2 cups finely chopped chocolate (recommended: Valhrona brand) 2 tablespoons whipping cream 1 cup butter 4 eggs 4 egg yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons Armagnac 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for sifting Powdered sugar Spun Sugar Halo, recipe follows 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup water Instructions: Filling: In a heavy saucepan combine 1 cup of the chocolate and whipping cream.

Cut the remaining backbone piece from the breast and save (use it in the roasting pan when you cook the turkey). Peel the carrots and onions and roughly chop. Roughly chop the celery. Cut the apples in quarters and remove the cores. Place 1/3 of the vegetables and apples in a container large enough to accommodate the turkey with the vegetables and apples. Season the turkey inside and out with salt and pepper. Rub the cider vinegar into the turkey. Place the breast into the container and top with 1/3 of the vegetables and apples. Add the legs and top with the remaining vegetables and apples. Place in the refrigerator and let marinate overnight.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking so the turkey can come to room temperature. Place the vegetables and apples into the bottom of a roasting pan. Place the legs, skin side up, on top of the vegetables, being sure there is room to add the breast later. Put the legs in the oven to cook first, about 1 hour 45 minutes.<br> While the legs are cooking, make the Herb Compound Duck Fat. Place the cold duck fat in the bowl of a standing mixer with a paddle attachment. Add all the chopped herbs and lemon zest. Add the salt and pepper and mix for 1 minute until herbs are evenly dispersed. Place the duck fat-herb mixture in a thick line along the long side of an 18-inch long piece of plastic wrap. Roll into a tube, twist the ends until tight, and then place in the refrigerator to set but not get hard, 30 to 40 minutes.<br> Slide your hand underneath the skin on top of the turkey breast to separate the skin from the breast. Cut one of the ends off the duck fat tube. Squeeze half of the mixture under the skin on top of one of the breasts and the remaining onto the other breast.<br> After the legs have cooked, place the thyme and rosemary in the roasting pan.

Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Let cool until it thickens and becomes spreadable, about 3 hours. If too thin, stir in some confectioners&#39; sugar. Make the Filling: In a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the cream cheese. Add the sugar, egg, and vanilla and blend. Add the chips and mix a few seconds on low to just fold in. Make the Cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients. In a large measuring cup combine the water, oil, vinegar, instant coffee, and vanilla. Whisk it into the dry ingredients until just combined and don&#39;t worry if there are a few lumps. Line 2 muffin tins with cupcake papers and fill each 2/3 full of batter. Drop a heaping teaspoon of the filling into the center of each. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. Frost the cupcakes with the frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40773,&quot;Easy Chicken-Mushroom Quesadillas 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 large onion, chopped (about 2 cups) 8 ounces white button mushrooms, (about 3 cups) 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 cups cooked chopped skinless, boneless chicken breast (1 breast half) 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon dried oregano 2 cups baby spinach leaves, sliced into ribbons 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 4 (10-inch) whole-grain flour tortillas 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese mix or Cheddar 1/2 cup salsa 1/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over a medium heat.

Start to melt suet in the pan over medium heat, using long chopsticks (or a fondue fork) to move it around so the entire pan bottom is well greased. The fat should smoke slightly. Quickly sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of sugar over the bottom and continue moving the fat in the pan (it should not be entirely melted yet.) The sugar will caramelize, turning brown and sticky. At this point, add about 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sake. There will be some sputtering (but this helps entertain guests). Add sake, stir; add dark soy sauce, stir. Begin the cooking by laying a few slices of beef into the pan. The beef should take about 1 minute to cook. Add more beef, switch to vegetables-including shirataki, tofu and fu-then alternate back to beef. Each diner should put into the pan whatever he or she likes. Add water (or half water/half sake) to the pan occasionally, as the sauce is reduced. The ingredients should not swim in the sauce; the liquid should just keep the pan bottom covered. Set each place with an individual dipping bowl into which an egg has been broken. This alone is the dipping sauce. (If you serve a whole egg at each place, which is attractive, provide a saucer or some vessel for the empty shells.) Each diner mixes the egg with chopsticks or fork. As with the other nabemono, long-handled fondue forks are best for anyone who is a little shy about using chopsticks, but dinner forks will do in a pinch. Before eating, dip cooked meat and vegetables into the egg; the thin coating of egg \cooks\ on as soon as it is in contact with the hot food. There is no other garnish or relish. To end the meal, serve hot cooked rice, mild pickles, and Japanese tea as a final course. Serve hot sake or cold beer up to rice course. Suggested Sake: Rich Sake *Have your butcher cut well-marbled sirloin beef into very thin slices. . **Buy grilled bean curd (yakidofu) or use any type of bean surd (tofu) available. . &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 40781,&quot;Cilantro Cream 2 ounces spinach 1 cup heavy cream 4 cups sour cream 2 1/2 ounces cilantro 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon L.A. spice 2 limes, juiced Instructions: Blanch and shock spinach.

Add the raspberries and a splash of lemon juice and mix it together. Bring to a boil. In a separate small bowl, mix the remaining 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar with the pectin to prevent clumping. Once the fruit mixture is boiling, add the pectin and sugar mixture and the chili powder and continue boiling for 15 minutes. Remove the mixture from the heat and set aside to cool. For the red chili chocolate ganache: Put the heavy cream and red chili powder in a small saucepan over medium heat and heat until simmering. Place the chopped chocolate in a large bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and gently whisk to combine. Make sure that all of the chocolate has melted into the cream and the mixture is very smooth. Once the chocolate is melted, add the butter and whisk until well mixed. Your ganache should be very smooth and shiny. Let the ganache cool to room temperature. To assemble: Line a plastic bonbon mold with the tempered chocolate. Place the red chili raspberry jam in a piping bag and fill the mold halfway with the jam. Place the red chili chocolate ganache into a piping bag. Fill the rest of the mold, and top with more tempered chocolate. Place the mold in the refrigerator and let it set for about 20 minutes.

Cook until the underside is golden brown, about 8 minutes. Place a plate, slightly larger than the skillet, over the pan. Using an oven mitt, invert the pan and place the pizza on the plate. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the pan. Slide the pizza back into the pan and cook for 5 minutes. In a small saucepan, stir the tomato-basil sauce over medium heat until warmed through, about 1 minute. Transfer to a serving platter and cut into wedges. Serve the tomato-basil sauce alongside or as a dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 40794,&quot;Summer Rolls with Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce 3 ounces Vietnamese cellophane noodles, cooked according to package directions 2 cups bean sprouts 2 carrots, julienned 1 large beet, julienned 1 fresh red cl, cut in circles 2 handfuls fresh cilantro, hand-torn 3/4 cup chopped unsalted peanuts 2 teaspoons dark sesame oil 1 lime, juiced Sea salt 20 (8-inch) round rice paper wrappers 40 mint leaves 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons fish sauce 1/4 cup hot water 2 tablespoons sugar 1 lime, juiced 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon red chili paste, such as sambal Instructions: Put the cellophane noodles, vegetables, cilantro and peanuts in a large bowl; toss with sesame oil and lime juice to give the filling some flavor; season with salt and pepper. Pour 3 cups of hot, not boiling water in a large shallow bowl. One at a time, immerse the rice paper wrappers in the hot water for 10 seconds to soften, then place on a slightly damp towel. The rice paper is very delicate, don&#39;t soak them any longer or they will break apart. Keep them covered while you work to prevent them from drying out and curling. To form the rolls, lay a rice paper wrapper on a flat surface. Grab a small amount of the cellophane and vegetable mixture and lay it across the bottom third. Use less filling than you think you should, if you overstuff the wrapper it will tear. Carefully fold the bottom of the wrapper up to cover the filling. Fold in the left and right sides, then tuck and roll it over once. Lay 2 mint leaves on top, then tuck and roll it over to close the whole thing up like a tight cigar. The mint leaves should show through the transparent rice paper. Arrange the finished rolls on a platter and cover with a damp towel. Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce: In a blender, puree the rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, hot water, sugar, lime juice, garlic, and chili paste until combined. Pour into a small bowl and serve with the summer rolls. Yield: 1 cup &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 40795,&quot;Ravioli with Potato, Watercress, and Cheeses 1 1/4 pounds all-purpose potatoes 4 cloves garlic, peeled, chopped 2 or 3 good handfuls watercress, large stalks removed, plus extra for garnish 1/4 cup butter 5 to 6 ounces cheese (use 2 contrasting varieties, such as Gorgonzola and Parmesan), plus extra for garnish Grated nutmeg, to taste Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound basic pasta, for ravioli Extra olive oil or butter, for garnish Instructions: Wash and peel the potatoes, put them into well-salted, boiling water with the garlic and cook until the potatoes are just tender (it is very important not to under- or overcook them). Drain them and let them sit for about 5 minutes to enable the excess water to evaporate (if you overcook them or don&#39;t drain them correctly they&#39;ll be too moist and your filling will be too wet). When the potatoes have cooled slightly add your butter and your chosen cheeses. Stir and mash with a fork to mix and break the potatoes up (I like to leave the mixture slightly chunky). Add the nutmeg and seasoning to taste. Stir in the watercress, half finely chopped and the rest coarsely chopped. Stuff the ravioli with a good heaped teaspoon of this mixture and cook in boiling salted water for about 3-4 minutes, until tender. Serve with some extra olive oil or butter, some more of your chosen cheese grated over the top and some torn watercress. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 40796,&quot;Flour Tortillas 3 cups all-purpose flour 5 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup very warm tap water Instructions: In a food processor combine 2 3/4 cups of the flour (reserve the remaining flour for rolling out the dough) with the lard or shortening. Pulse several times until the fat is evenly distributed throughout the flour and no particles of fat are visible. Dissolve the salt in 2/3 cup of the warm water. With the machine running, pour the liquid through the feed tube in a steady stream and stop the machine once the dough has come together in a ball. Feel the dough, it should be a medium-stiff consistency, not too firm but not as soft as most bread doughs. If the dough is too stiff, divide it into several pieces, sprinkle with 1 or 2 tablespoons of the remaining water and process again until a ball forms. Divide the dough into 12 portions, roll into balls and place on a flat surface or plate. Cover with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for at least 30 minutes. On a lightly floured surface roll each ball into a 7-inch circle by flattening the ball of dough, lightly flouring it, and with a rolling pin rolling forward and backward over the dough, then turn it a sixth of a turn and roll forward and backward again. Repeat the turning and rolling process until a 7-inch circle is formed, re-flouring the work surface as necessary. Place the tortilla on a plate and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat the rolling out process for the remaining 11 balls of dough. Heat a flat cast iron griddle over moderately high heat. Lay a tortilla on the griddle and cook for 20 to 45 seconds until tortilla bubbles and lightly browns on the underside. Flip the tortilla and cook it for another 30 to 45 seconds. The tortilla should be lightly browned but still soft and flexible. Transfer the cooked tortilla to a heavy towel and wrap it up. Cook the remaining tortillas in a similar manner and store stacked in the towel to keep them warm and soft. The tortillas can be stored in a sealable plastic bag and refrigerated until ready for use. To reheat the tortillas, tuck them in an \envelope\ made out of aluminum foil and heat in a 325 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 40797,&quot;Breakfast Pizza: Pizza A Colazione 1 (1/4-ounce) envelope active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 1/2 cup lukewarm water (approximately 80 degrees F) 4 cups bread flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 cup canned whole peeled tomatoes (pelati) Kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/4 pound pancetta, diced medium 1/2 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded 4 large eggs 1 handful fresh basil leaves Instructions: For the pizza dough: In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the yeast, lukewarm water, and 1/2 cup of the bread flour. Mix well and let it sit for 30 minutes, or until bubbly, like foamy beer. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 1/2 cups bread flour and the salt until evenly combined.<br> Add 3/4 cup cold water and the olive oil to the yeast mixture. Turn on the mixer and begin adding the flour mixture in increments, then mix for 5 minutes, until the dough starts creeping up the dough hook and detaching from the sides of the bowl.<br> Grease a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough to the bowl. Turn the dough to coat its surface with oil. Cover the bowl loosely with a tea towel. Let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch the dough down, then let rise another 1 hour.<br> Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and form into discs. On a work surface lightly dusted with flour, use your fingers or the heel of your hand (and a rolling pin, if you prefer) to stretch the discs until they&#39;re 13 inches in diameter. The disc should be very thin, less than 1/8 inch.<br> For the pizza: Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F for 1 hour before baking. (Or preheat a wood-fired pizza oven to very hot, 4 hours before baking.)<br> In a food processor, puree the tomatoes until smooth. Season with salt to taste.<br> In a skillet, heat the olive oil and pancetta over medium heat and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until crisp.<br> Using a spoon, spread one-fourth of the pureed tomatoes on 1 disc of dough, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Sprinkle one-fourth of the mozzarella on top. Gently place the pizza on the pizza stone and bake for about 5 minutes, until golden with slight signs of charring. (If using a wood-fired oven, gently place the pizza on the oven floor, and bake for 3 minutes, or until golden and crisp.)<br> Remove the pizza from the oven and break an egg over the center of the pizza. Top with one-fourth of the cooked pancetta, return the pizza to the oven, and bake another 3 to 4 minutes (1 to 2 minutes if using a wood-fired oven), until the egg is cooked.<br> Remove the pizza from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, and top with one-fourth of the basil. Serve immediately. Repeat with the remaining 3 pizza discs. IMPORTANTE! If you&#39;re making pizza within the hour after forming the pizza dough discs, they can be kept at room temperature. Otherwise, place them on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 12 hours before baking, as long as the dough doesn&#39;t rise too much, because acidity will creep in and the flavor will sour. Ideally, though, you should make the pizzas the same day you make the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 40798,&quot;Bellini Cocktail 4 tablespoons white peach puree 1 bottle Prosecco or Champagne, chilled (use sparkling juice or seltzer for a non-alcoholic cocktail) Instructions: Place 1 tablespoon white peach puree into the bottom of a Champagne flute. Fill the glass with Prosecco or Champagne. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Champagne]&quot; 40799,&quot;Maple-Bacon Popcorn 12 slices bacon (about 8 ounces) Vegetable oil, as needed 3/4 cup popcorn kernels<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter<br> 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels, then crumble finely. Pour the fat from the skillet into a spouted measuring cup. Add vegetable oil as needed to make 1/4 cup fat; if there is more than 1/4 cup bacon fat, pour off the extra. Set the skillet aside. Pour the bacon fat into a stockpot (12-quart or larger) over medium heat. Add a few popcorn kernels; when they begin to sizzle, add the remaining kernels and shake to coat in the oil. Cover the pot and cook, shaking frequently, until the popping has almost stopped (a pop every second or two), about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and keep covered. In the skillet used for the bacon, melt the butter and maple syrup over medium-low heat, stirring to loosen any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet. Stir in the crumbled bacon and then pour the mixture over the popcorn; toss well to coat all of the kernels. Season with salt and toss again. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40800,&quot;PB and J Yogurt Parfait 6 ounces fat-free strawberry yogurt 1/2 cup chopped strawberries 1/4 cup peanut butter cereal (with less than 3g fat per serving), lightly crushed 1 teaspoon peanut butter chips, chopped* Fresh strawberries, as an accompaniment, optional Instructions: Spoon 1/2 the yogurt into a parfait glass or any glass.

Bring a medium pot of water to a simmer. Remove the salt cod from the soaking water and place in the simmering water. Poach for 8 to10 minutes, let cool in liquid for another 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from poaching liquid, remove any bones and coarsely chop. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and shallots to the pan and cook until soft. Remove the garlic and shallots to a plate. Place cream in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Place the poached and chopped cod in a food processor, add shallot-garlic mixture and half of the warm cream and process until smooth. Add the riced potatoes, remaining cream and process until just combined. With motor running add the oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Arrange the skewers on the hot grill and grill, turning until the meat is medium-rare, about 2 to 3 minutes on each of the 4 sides. Transfer the kebabs to the platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 40804,&quot;Make-Ahead Gravy 2 medium yellow onions, cut into 6 wedges each 2 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch rounds 1 large head garlic, end removed, turned on its side and split through the middle to expose each clove 2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 turkey wings (about 8 to 10 ounces each) or 2 turkey legs (about 11 to 13 ounces each) 1/2 cup dry sherry 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 bay leaves, optional 4 to 5 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Get ready: In the bottom of a roasting pan, arrange the onions, carrots, garlic and celery. Give them a drizzle of oil and season with salt and pepper. Place a rack on top of the vegetables in the roasting pan and brush it with oil to help prevent the wings/legs from sticking. Arrange the turkey wings or legs on the rack above the vegetables and season generously with salt and pepper. Place the pan in the center of the oven to cook. Cook: Roast the turkey parts until the juices run clear (meaning free of any traces of blood) or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the wings/legs registers 160 to 165 degrees F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and place the pan directly on 2 burners of the stove. Build the gravy: Remove the rack from the pan and move the wings to the roasting pan. Move the garlic halves to a plate. Add the sherry to the pan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the liquid until only a thin layer remains, then whisk in the mustard. Add the bay leaves, if using, and 4 cups of the stock. Simmer gently over medium-low heat until the liquid reduces by about half, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the vinegar. Remove the turkey wings or legs and pick the meat off the bones and reserve. Discard the bay leaves, if used. Finish: Transfer about half of the liquid to a blender. Hold the garlic halves like lemon halves over the blender and \u201csqueeze\u201d the flesh from the peels, allowing the garlic \u201cmeat\u201d to fall into the blender. Blend on low speed until smooth. Add the cooked onions, celery and carrots and blend again until smooth. Transfer to a medium pot. If too thick, simmer with some additional stock. Taste for seasoning. Add the picked turkey meat to the gravy to give it texture and added meaty flavor. Let it cool to room temp, then transfer to a resealable container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. To reheat, add the gravy to a medium pot or roasting pan a turkey was cooked in and place over medium heat. Whisk and thin to desired consistency with stock and or pan drippings from a roasted turkey. Bring to a simmer, taste and adjust seasoning if needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 40805,&quot;Peanut Butter Pie with Chocolate Crust 1 cup chopped dry roasted peanuts 1 cup graham cracker crumbs 1/3 cup sugar 1/4 cup melted butter 1/4 cup shaved semisweet chocolate Peanut butter filling, recipe follows 8 ounces cream cheese 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons peanut butter (smooth or chunky) 1/2 cup milk 3/4 cup powdered sugar 1 cup cream, whipped 1-ounce semisweet chocolate for shaving on top Instructions: Combine the peanuts, graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter in a bowl and pat down into a pie pan.

Toast the almonds on a baking sheet in the oven until they are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool and then coarsely chop, either by hand or in a food processor. Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and add the salt. On the second highest speed of the mixer, beat the egg whites until they come to medium peaks. With the mixer running, gently sprinkle in the sugar and cinnamon. Beat until stiff peaks form, then remove the bowl from the mixer. Gently fold in the chopped almonds in 3 additions. Drop the batter in 1-inch balls, onto 2 parchment-lined cookie sheets. Bake until light brown all over, firm to the touch, and they lift cleanly off the baking sheet, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheets. These cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week. Cook&#39;s Note: Try to avoid baking these cookies on a wet and humid day as the crisp exterior of the cookie will slowly melt into something soft and sticky. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Moscato, Riesling, Vinho Verde]&quot; 40818,&quot;Cajun Oven Fries 4 medium thin-skinned white potatoes 3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper sauce 1 teaspoon (1/3 handful) ground thyme or poultry seasoning 1 teaspoon (1/3 handful) sweet paprika 1 teaspoon (1/3 handful) ground cumin Coarse salt and black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

You should have about 6 cups. Place the potato slices in a large bowl and rinse with cold water until the water runs clean. Thoroughly dry the potatoes, first in a salad spinner, then on paper towels. This is important because any moisture left on the potatoes will cause the oil to splatter. Pour the oil into a 6-quart heavy bottomed, straight-sided saucepan, 8 to 10 inches in diameter. The oil should be 1 1/4 to 1 1/2- inches deep and the pan no more than a quarter full. This prevents any bubbling over when frying the potatoes. Heat the oil to 315 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer. (To check the temperature without a thermometer, drop a small piece of bread the size of a crouton into the oil. It should float to the surface and lightly brown in about 2 minutes) Carefully fry the potato slices in 2 or 3 batches until light brown and crisp. You will need to stir the potatoes with a slotted spoon almost constantly to ensure even cooking. Each batch should take 15 to 20 minutes to cook. (If the potatoes brown in much less time, the oil is too hot. This will result in a chip that is neither cooked through nor crisp.) As you remove each batch of crisp potato chips, place them on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels. When all the potatoes are done, place them in a mixing bowl large enough to hold them comfortably. Over a medium flame, heat the butter and garlic over the potatoes, add the chopped parsley, salt and pepper, and mix thoroughly with a rubber spatula. Be careful not to crush the chips. Serve hot. The chips can be made several hours in advance. Store in a tightly closed container and reheat in a 350 degree oven until hot. Toss with the seasoned garlic butter at the last minute. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 40830,&quot;Goat Cheese and Sun Dried Tomato Profiteroles with Herb Oil 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces Pinch salt 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3 large eggs 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan Pinch freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces goat cheese, room temperature 1/4 cup cream 1/2 cup diced sun dried tomatoes Pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup fresh mint leaves 3/4 cup fresh basil leaves 1 cup olive oil Pinch salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup chopped toasted walnuts, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Bring to a boil, stirring until the butter melts. Add the flour and stir over medium heat for 1 minute. Cool for 5 minutes. Crack the eggs into a measuring cup. Use a wooden spoon to beat the eggs into the dough, 1 at a time. Stir in the Parmesan and pepper. Spoon 18 mounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart.

Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Let cool slightly. Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. The custard can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Refrigerate until 1 hour before using. Pastry: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. In a large saucepan, bring the water, butter, salt and sugar to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return to the heat and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer). Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, add 3 eggs, 1 egg at a time. Stop mixing after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add the remaining 1 egg and mix until incorporated. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip, pipe fat lengths of dough (about the size and shape of a jumbo hot dog) onto the lined baking sheet, leaving 2 inches of space between them. You should have 8 to 10 lengths. Egg Wash: In a bowl, whisk the egg and water together. Brush the surface of each eclair with the egg wash. Use your fingers to smooth out any bumps of points of dough that remain on the surface. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 25 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. Fit a medium-size plain pastry tip over your index finger and use it to make a hole in the end of each eclair (or just use your fingertip). Using a pastry bag fitted with a medium-size plain tip, gently pipe the custard into the eclairs, using only just enough to fill the inside (don&#39;t stuff them full). Glaze: In a small saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat just until it boils. Immediately turn off the heat. Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Set aside and keep warm. The glaze can be made up to 48 hours in advance. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use, and rewarm in a microwave or over hot water when ready to use. Dip the tops of the eclairs in the warm chocolate glaze and set on a sheet pan. Chill, uncovered, at least 1 hour to set the glaze. Serve chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40848,&quot;Italian Sausage Roasted Pork 5 large garlic cloves, crushed with a press 2 teaspoons fennel seeds 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 (18.4-ounce) whole pork tenderloins, patted dry 1 (14-ounce) package Del Monte?

Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are fork-tender all the way through, about 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and rest the colander over the top of the empty pot to allow the heat to dry the potatoes. Once cool enough to handle but still warm, cut the larger potatoes in quarters and the others in half to make all the same general bite size. Some may not need to be cut at all. Add to a large mixing bowl. If using a gas stove, place the pepper directly over a medium flame and allow to char on one side, then rotate until the entire pepper is black and charred. If you don&#39;t have a gas stove, roast the pepper on a baking sheet under the broiler or at the highest temperature of your oven. Carefully watch to rotate the pepper and char on all sides. Remove to a resealable plastic bag and close, allowing it to steam for 5 minutes to loosen the skin. Once cool enough to handle, remove the seeds and charred skin and chop the pepper. Set aside. In a large pan on medium heat, add the bacon and cook, stirring, until crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan. Add the vinegar, sugar, mustard, paprika, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper to the still-hot pan. Cook at a rolling simmer until the sugar and salt dissolve, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and toss until they soak up the vinegar mixture. Transfer the potatoes back to the large bowl. Add the red peppers, bacon, parsley and scallions and toss.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the parsnips in the center of the baking sheet and drizzle generously with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss with 3 sprigs of thyme. Spread the parsnips into an even layer leaving an empty space on both sides. Roast until the parsnips become tender and begin to brown in spots, about 20 minutes. Use tongs to give the parsnips another toss. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and push the parsnips closer together in the center of the pan. Core the apple and cut it into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place the apples on one side of the parsnips, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the cinnamon. Pick the leaves from the remaining 2 sprigs thyme and sprinkle them on top of the apples. Lay the pork chops on the other side of the parsnips and brush with the Dijon mustard. Sprinkle each chop with the herbes de Provence and a pinch of salt and pepper. Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast until the apples are soft, the parsnips are completely tender and golden brown, and the pork chops read an internal temperature of 145 degrees F, about 20 minutes more. Divide evenly between two plates, top the apples with the parsley leaves and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 40855,&quot;Lemon Tea Cake 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing 1/2 cup sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt Juice and zest of 1/2 lemon 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, add the milk and whisk in the granulated sugar to dissolve. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let rest until it dissolves and puffs up, about 5 minutes. Add the butter, vanilla paste and egg and whisk to combine. Mix the dry. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the flour and a pinch of salt and mix to combine. Make the dough. Starting on low speed, slowly add the wet mixture to the dry. Once all of the liquid is incorporated, remove the paddle and replace it with the dough hook. Turn the speed up and watch as the dough comes together; it will eventually release from the sides of the bowl. Let the mixer knead the dough until it looks smooth and is slightly sticky, about 5 minutes. Stop and let the dough relax for about 5 minutes. Let the dough rise. Coat the bottom and sides of a large mixing bowl with oil or cooking spray. Remove the dough and gently shape into a ball. Place the dough in the prepared bowl and turn the dough over to fully coat with the oil. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let rest at room temperature until it rises by more than double, about 1 hour. Shape the donuts and rest. Cut parchment paper into 5- or 6-inch squares and arrange in a single layer on a sheet pan. Gently push your fist into the center of the dough to release the air. Pick up the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface. (I\u2019ve even used parchment with no flour!) Cut the dough into 10 to 12 even parts and gently roll each piece into a ball. Use your hand to press down on the dough to flatten each ball into a circle about 4 inches in diameter. Punch out a hole in the center of each circle using a bottle cap (from your oil bottle, a condiment jar, etc.). Place the donuts and donut holes on the parchment squares and cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray. Set the donuts aside to let rise at room temperature for 1 hour. Fry the donuts and prepare the toppings. Pour at least 4 inches of oil into a large Dutch oven. Heat the oil to 325 degrees F. Meanwhile, fit a baking sheet with a wire rack and set aside. If making sugar donuts, add granulated or cinnamon sugar to a large bowl and set aside. If glazing the donuts, have the glazes prepared in bowls. Fry the donuts in small batches, starting with the donut holes to gauge the oil temperature. The donut holes should fry to a golden color, flip on their own and float in about 2 minutes. For the whole donuts, working with one donut at a time, gently invert the donut into the oil so the parchment paper side is up. Gently peel the parchment paper away from the dough. Repeat with the remaining donuts, adding only a few donuts to the oil at a time. Once the donuts float and the bottoms are golden, flip and cook until the other side is golden, 2 to 4 minutes. Allow the oil to come up to room temperature between batches. For sugar donuts, remove the donuts from the oil with a slotted spoon, then allow the oil to drip off, and put directly into the bowl of sugar. Roll to coat, or use a clean spoon to spoon sugar onto the donut and a fork to gently flip the donut so the other side can be coated in sugar. Remove and let cool slightly on the wire rack. Serve warm. For glazed donuts, remove the donuts from the oil with a slotted spoon, then allow the oil to drip off and place on the wire rack to let cool enough to handle. Drizzle the glaze over the donuts on the wire rack or, working with one donut at a time, gently dip one side into the glaze, then turn right side up and return to the rack. For the Maple-Bacon glazed donuts, sprinkle bacon bits over the top right after coating and before the glaze sets. In a medium bowl, add the confectioners&#39; sugar, salt, vanilla and milk and whisk until smooth. Set aside. In a medium bowl, add the confectioners&#39; sugar, salt, strawberry powder, vanilla and milk and whisk until smooth. Set aside.

Slice the cloves in half lengthwise and then smash with the side of a chef&#39;s knife. Sprinkle the salt over the garlic and chop and smear the garlic against the cutting board until it makes a paste. (This can also be done using a mortar pestle; smash the garlic halves before placing them in the mortar.) Add the oregano, chop it into the garlic paste and mix together. Put the garlic paste in a large bowl. Add the Adobo, Mojo, the orange and lime juices. Mix well to combine. Place the pork in a roasting pan and using a sharp knife, score the surface of the meat in a crosshatch pattern. Pour the marinade over the pork, being sure it gets into the incisions and penetrates the meat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day in the refrigerator, covered and turning it once or twice. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Uncover the pork and allow the meat to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Roast the pork for 30 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. and continue to roast until the meat is falling apart and an instant-read thermometer reaches 160 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the pork. Baste with the marinade every 30 minutes. Total roasting time will be approximately 5 to 5 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let it stand at room temperature 20 to 30 minutes, covered loosely with a foil, before cutting it in slices.

Sprinkle on some icing sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Tightly roll the pastry, along the longest side, into a sausage roll and slice into discs (about 1-inch thick). With the palm of your hand press down into each disc, then roll out each one into a circle. Grease the bottom and sides of 6 oven-proof glasses with butter, then dip each into a bag of flour so that the flour sticks to the butter and shake off any excess. Put the center of the pastry circles on top of the floured oven-proof glass, and gently press the sides of the pastry onto the side of the glass (it should look a bit pleated). Place the glasses (rim side down) on a tray in a preheated 350 degree F.oven). When they are cooked, take them out of the oven and press the bottom of each pastry case, this will ensure that they have a flat bottom. The Custard: Break the eggs into a mixing bowl with the sugar and orange zest and whisk thoroughly. Scrape out the seeds inside of a vanilla pod and stir this into the egg mixture. Pour the cream into a saucepan and remove from the heat just before it boils. Pour the hot cream into the bowl of eggs, stirring all the time.

Cover with plastic wrap and leave in the refrigerator overnight. This will tenderize the chicken. Heat oil in a deep fryer. Drain and discard the buttermilk. In a food processor, combine the marinated chicken, egg, chives, Parmesan, soy sauce, garlic-flavored hot sauce, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Blend until a smooth paste is formed, about 1 minute. Make about 2-inch by 1-inch nuggets, lining them up on a baking tray. In a shallow bowl, add the flour and in a second bowl the beaten eggs, and in a third bowl the panko bread crumbs. Coat the nuggets in flour, then egg, and then the panko crumbs and place the nuggets back on the tray. Deep fry in small batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Alternately, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet and fry, turning every 2 minutes, for about 10 minutes. For the dipping sauce: Combine the mustard, honey, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix well. Cook&#39;s Note: Can be made up to 1 day in advance.

When cool enough to handle scoop out the insides and put through a ricer to eliminate any lumps. In a small bowl combine the egg, salt and nutmeg. On a lightly floured work surface mound the potatoes making a well in the center. Pour in the egg mixture then, using your fingers or a fork, begin to mix the eggs into the potatoes working from the outside in as to not break the \moat.\ When eggs are about halfway combined begin to sprinkle a bit of the flour and cheese over the potatoes, continuing to lightly knead, bringing the mixture together adding more flour as needed to make a pliable dough. Once the dough is no longer sticky the dough is done. It is important not to overwork the dough creating gluten giving the dough a dense texture. Working quickly and lightly will give you light, airy gnocchi. Dust the board with flour and roll 1/4 of the dough into a long rope about 1-inch thick. Cut into thumb size sections and set aside, tossing with a bit of flour to avoid them from sticking together. Repeat with the other pieces of dough. Using the back of a fork take each gnocchi and gently roll over the tines by lightly pressing with your thumb and allowing the gnocchi to fall off the fork. Boil gnocchi in a large pot of salted water until they float. When they float they are done. Remove and toss immediately with Spicy Tomato Sauce.

Those of you who&#39;ve been lucky enough to eat this salad in Greece will know that when it&#39;s made well it&#39;s absolute heaven. Hopefully this recipe will help you achieve the big bold authentic flavours that it&#39;s known for. The trick is to pay attention to the small details that make it so wonderful: things like finding the ripest tomatoes, good Greek olive oil, beautiful olives, creamy feta, and lovely herbs.; I think it&#39;s quite nice to have different shapes and sizes in a salad, so cut your medium tomato into wedges, halve the cherry tomatoes, and slice the beef tomato into large rounds. Put all the tomatoes into a large salad bowl. Slice the onion very finely so it&#39;s wafer thin and add to the tomatoes. Scratch a fork down the sides of the cucumber so it leaves deep grooves in the skin, then cut it into thick slices. Deseed your pepper, slice it into rings and add them to the salad along with the cucumber. Roughly chop the dill and most of the mint leaves, reserving the smaller ones for garnish. Add the chopped herbs to the bowl of salad, then squeeze your handful of olives over so they season the vegetables, then drop them in. Add a pinch of salt, the vinegar, and extra-virgin olive oil. Quickly toss everything together with your hands. The minute all those flavours start working with the vegetables is when the magic starts to happen. Have a taste, and adjust the flavours if need be. To serve, pop the block of feta right on the top of the salad. Sprinkle the oregano over the top along with the reserved mint leaves, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and take it straight to the table. It&#39;s confident and scruffy with a bit of attitude. Delicious. Cook&#39;s Note: I&#39;ve been known to pop leftover Greek salad into a liquidizer with a splash of extra-virgin olive oil and a few ice cubes, then blitz it up to a smooth consistency so it&#39;s basically a Greek gazpacho. It&#39;s not a classic thing to do, but it is very delicious, not to mention a great way of using up leftovers! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 40950,&quot;Jerusalem Artichoke Soup 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 white onion, diced 1 bay leaf Salt 1 1/2 pounds Jerusalem artichokes, roughly chopped 1/2 potato, quartered 3 sprigs fresh thyme, tied with string, plus 1 sprig picked for garnish 1/2 cup 35-percent cream Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the onions and bay leaf, sprinkle with salt and cook until tender and translucent. Add the Jerusalem artichokes and potatoes and stir. Add 8 cups water and the thyme bundle, and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the Jerusalem artichokes and potatoes are fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and thyme bundle.

Serve, garnishing each bowl with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and the thyme leaves. Cook&#39;s Note: When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 40951,&quot;Marble Potatoes with Garlic &amp; Herbs 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 pound multicolored marble potatoes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large garlic clove, grated on a Microplane Fleur de sel 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley Instructions: Melt the butter in a large (8-inch) saucepan.

Add 1/4 cup warm (not hot) water, the yeast, and 2 tablespoons of sugar to a small bowl and stir slightly with fork. Set aside to proof. In a mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, put 3 cups of the flour with the salt, eggs (preferably at room temperature), 1 cup warm (not hot) water, 1 cup sugar, and the cooled melted butter. Mix well. Add the yeast mixture and gradually add the remaining 2 cups of flour and keep beating. Cook&#39;s Note: You may not need the whole 5 cups of flour; the stickier (not runny) the dough, the lighter the rolls. Transfer the dough to a large bowl and pour about 1/4 cup of oil over the dough. Cover with a plate and let rise, at least double or more its original size, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. After the dough has risen, transfer it to a floured surface and knead it a little. Roll out the dough about 1/4-inch thick (or thinner). Let the dough rest a few minutes while you melt the other stick of butter. Use a cookie cutter and cut out rolls. Dip each roll in melted butter, fold in half and put them on a sheet pan. Arrange them close together, filling up the pan. Bake until nice and brown. Ovens vary, so maybe about 20 minutes. Take the pan out of oven and immediately brush the rolls with butter. Transfer them to a serving dish and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 40954,&quot;Chicken and Mixed Vegetable Quesadillas with Artichokes, Mushrooms, and Roasted Red Peppers Nonstick cooking spray 2 cooked chicken breast halves 8 (6 to 8-inch) flour tortillas 1/2 cup chopped red onions 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms 1/2 cup sliced roasted red peppers (from water-packed jar) 1/2 cup sliced artichokes (from water-packed can or jar) 1/4 cup shredded Monterey jack or pepper jack cheese, for each quesadilla Instructions: Coat a large skillet or griddle with cooking spray.

Make a double boiler by setting a large mixing bowl over the simmering water. Place the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and honey in the mixing bowl and make an egg foam by whisking the mixture to 113 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 7 to 10 minutes. The egg foam passes through various stages becoming foamy, then smooth and finally it thickens. When it is thick, it will be hot to the touch, tripled in volume, and light in color and the sugar will have completely dissolved. If you dip the whisk into the mixture and pull it out, the batter should fall back into the bowl in a thick ribbon. Remove the mixing bowl from the heat and whip the batter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until it cools, increases in volume, stiffens slightly and becomes pale yellow, about 7 to 10 minutes. Take the time to whip it well; if the mixture is under whipped, the baked genoise will be dense. Very, very carefully, fold in the flour with a rubber spatula until the flour is no longer visible, making sure to fold to the bottom of the bowl. Do not over mix or the batter will deflate. Fill buttered and parchment paper-lined 8-inch round cake pans 3/4 full with batter. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven until well-risen and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let the genoise cool slightly. Unmold, remove parchment paper and finish cooling on a wire rack. The baked genoise can be stored in the freezer for 2 to 3 weeks if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Return it to room temperature before using it. VARIATION: Make this recipe into a Chocolate Genoise by substituting unsweetened cocoa powder for 10 to 20 percent of the weight (a scant 1/4 cup to a full 1/3 cup) of the flour. Weigh the cocoa powder before you sift it. Jacques&#39; Tip: Genoise can be made with butter. In this recipe, you can substitute butter (5 1/2 tablespoons) for the 3 large egg yolks. Melt and cool the butter and fold it in after the flour is added. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40985,&quot;Moussaka 2 eggplants, sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices 4 tablespoons canola oil, divided Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 medium onion, chopped 1 pound (80 percent lean) ground beef 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups milk, at room temperature 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Wash and gently scrub potatoes under cold running water to remove any excess dirt and thick skin. Poke with a fork to make holes all over - this allows the moisture to escape while baking. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, season with salt and place into preheated oven. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until a paring knife goes through cleanly but the potato is still firm to touch. Remove from oven and allow to cool so you can handle them. Cut into large wedges and lay out in a single layer to dry slightly before dusting with a little potato starch. Turn them over and dust again. Heat some oil in a large pot to 350 degrees F. Fry the potatoes in batches for 5 to 7 minutes until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and season with salt immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 41004,&quot;Berry Delicious Ice Cream 1 1/2 cups frozen blueberries 1/4 cup sugar 1 cinnamon stick Splash orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) 1 pint fresh raspberries French vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: In a small pot combine the blueberries, sugar, and cinnamon stick.

Meanwhile, put the eggs in one shallow dish. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, cayenne, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper together in a medium bowl. Transfer half the flour mixture to a third bowl and stir in the coconut. Working in batches, dredge the shrimp in the flour mixture, shake off any excess, dip in the eggs, and then roll in the coconut mixture, pressing to coat thoroughly. Fry until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain the oil temperature. Transfer the shrimp to paper towels to drain. Serve with sweet chili or sweet and sour sauce on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 41010,&quot;Beet and Celery Salad 4 tablespoons vinaigrette dressing, your choice 1 tablespoon orange juice 1 (15-ounce) can sliced beets 2 stalks celery, plus leaves for garnish Instructions: In a medium mixing bowl, combine dressing and orange juice. Strain beets and add to bowl. Slice celery, including leaves, thin on the bias. Add celery to the bowl and toss together. Place on a platter and top with celery leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41011,&quot;Chocolate Truffles 21 ounces bittersweet chocolate 18 ounces (generous 2 cups) heavy cream 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, softened 2 ounces (1/4 cup) orange liqueur or raspberry vodka (optional) 3 pounds bittersweet chocolate, chopped 2 cups Dutch-process cocoa powder, sifted 2 1/2 cups shredded coconut, toasted 2 cups nuts, toasted and finely chopped Instructions: Chop the chocolate: Use a chef&#39;s knife to chop the chocolate as finely as possible; this will help it melt quickly and evenly. Then place it in a medium glass bowl. (Glass retains heat, so the chocolate will stay melted longer.) Make the ganache: Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbles form around the edge. Remove from the heat and add about one-fourth of the chocolate; whisk until smooth. Slowly pour the cream mixture over the remaining chocolate in the bowl and let sit until the chocolate melts, about 30 seconds. Puree the melted chocolate with an immersion blender or beat with a whisk until all the lumps disappear and the ganache is smooth. Stir in the butter until smooth, then add liqueur, if desired. (Jacques adds the liqueur last, so the flavor doesn&#39;t cook off.) Pour and set: Line a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap, leaving a 2-foot overhang on one side. Pour the ganache onto the baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Fold the plastic wrap back over and press directly onto the surface of the ganache. Let cool at room temperature at least 4 hours or overnight. For the truffles: Using two teaspoons, scoop small mounds of the ganache onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Set aside until firm enough to roll, about 15 minutes in the refrigerator or 2 hours at room temperature. Roll into balls: Place the chocolate mounds between both palms, squeeze slightly and roll. Refrigerate until ready to coat. Temper the chocolate: This is a gentle melting and cooling process that gives chocolate a glossy finish. For the coating, place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir until melted, about 40 minutes. Pour into a clean glass bowl; stir to cool to between 88 degrees and 90 degrees, about 40 minutes. (Jacques recommends a laser thermometer for checking the temperature.) Dip and coat: Spread out the cocoa powder, coconut and nuts on parchment paper. One at a time, dip each truffle in the tempered chocolate with a two-prong dipping fork (you can buy one at a baking-supply store or break off the middle tines of a plastic fork). Lift the truffle and let the excess chocolate drip off. Roll in toppings and place on a rack to dry. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 41012,&quot;Eggs Benedicto (Chipotle Eggs Benedict with Blender Mock Hollandaise) 2 sticks unsalted butter 3 egg yolks* Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon minced and seeded canned chipotles in adobo sauce ** 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Kosher salt 1 teaspoon vinegar 8 very fresh large eggs 2 large croissants, sliced in 1/2 4 slices prosciutto Instructions: For the hollandaise: In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter until bubbling hot. In a blender, add the egg yolks, black pepper, to taste, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Cover the blender and blend on high speed for several seconds. Either remove center cap of the blender lid or carefully remove the lid itself with blender still running. Pour the hot butter in a thin, steady stream into whirling egg mixture. Add the chipotle and pulse to combine. Taste sauce and adjust seasoning with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. (If your sauce gets too thick, you can thin it out with a couple tablespoons of boiling hot water.) For the eggs: In a heavy saucepan combine about 2 quarts of water and the vinegar and bring to a simmer. Break 1 egg into a small bowl or cup and slide the egg into a ladle. Lower the ladle into the water, and hold it there, for 1 minute before removing the ladle and leaving the egg to cook for 2 minutes more. Poach at a low simmer until the whites are firm and the yolks are still runny. Repeat with each remaining egg. Transfer the eggs, with a slotted spoon, to paper towels until ready to serve. To assemble: Arrange a croissant half, cut side up, on each of 4 plates. Put 1 piece of prosciutto on each half, then 2 poached eggs and top with hollandaise.

Cut out with a 3/4-inch circle cutter. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 41023,&quot;Easter Bonnet, Part Two 1 1/4 cups heavy cream, 10.5 ounces, 300 grams Store-bought pound cake Simple Syrup White chocolate, tempered, 14 ounces, 400 grams Cocoa butter, 14 ounces, 400 grams Instructions: To assemble: Use a pastry brush to coat the bottom half of each petal with a little Simple Syrup or warmed corn syrup. This will act as the \glue\ to adhere the petals to the bud. Wrap the first petal around the base of the bud. Continue adding petals in the same fashion until you have formed the size of flower you would like. Gently squeeze the bottom of the bud so the petals open. You can also gently roll back the tops of the petals to achieve a more realistic appearance. Cut off the bottom of the bud. Place around the brim of the hat and add the leaves as desired. To make the ganache: If using gelatin sheets, place them in a medium-size mixing bowl with enough cold water (about 2 cups) to cover. Let stand for about 5 minutes to allow the gelatin to soften and hydrate. Cold water hydrates the gelatin without letting it absorb too much liquid. Remove the gelatin from the bowl and squeeze out the excess water with your hands. If you use powdered gelatin, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup (1.75 ounces; 50 grams) of cold water. Let the gelatin bloom until it has absorbed all the water, about 1 minute. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Pour the heavy cream in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Remove from the heat and make a ganache by pouring the hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for about 30 seconds to allow the heat to distribute throughout the bowl. Add the hydrated gelatin and gently stir the mixture with a rubber spatula. The hot cream will cause the chocolate and the gelatin to melt. Slowly mixing the heavy cream and chocolate together causes the fats in them to combine to form an emulsion. Stir the ganache until it is smooth and homogenous. Place the mixing bowl in the ice bath and stir the ganache occasionally so it cools evenly. The ganache is ready when it has thickened. Test this by using a rubber spatula to draw a line through it. If the line holds for 10 to 15 seconds, it is ready. If the line fills in immediately, the ganache is too warm. Keep cooling and retest every 30 seconds. The ganache should not cool so much that it begins to harden and set. If this happens, warm it up over a saucepan of simmering water, removing it every 10 seconds and whisking it gently until it is smooth and viscous. To finish the mousse: While the ganache is cooling, pour the heavy cream into another medium-size mixing bowl and beat to soft peaks with an electric mixer on medium speed. Be careful; if you overwhip the heavy cream, it will lose volume and the mousse will not be as light and airy. When the ganache is cool but not cold, fold in the whipped cream in 2 additions until combined. The ganache should not be so cold that it has begun to set and is grainy, yet is should be cool enough that it doesn&#39;t melt the whipped cream. If the mousse begins to seize while you are folding in the whipped cream, warm it up over a saucepan of simmering water 5 seconds at a time until it is smooth again. Do not warm it so much that the whipped cream begins to melt. Then fold in any remaining whipped cream. When all of the whipped cream has been incorporated, the mousse will be loose and pourable. Don&#39;t worry; it will set up in the freezer. Prepare the pound cake: Cut the pound cake into a 4-inch flat circle and a 5 1/2-inch flat circle. You want the larger circle to be just a bit smaller than the diameter of your mold. That way, the mousse will cover the edge and the cake won&#39;t show through the mold. Place the mousse into a pastry bag with a large opening (no tip). Pipe the mousse into the dome mold, filling about two thirds full. Spread the mousse up the sides of the mold with the back of a large spoon. Place the smaller cake circle in the mousse. Soak the cake with the simple syrup. Fill with more mousse until almost full. Top with the larger cake circle and press down slightly. Soak the cake with the simple syrup. Place the mold in the freezer for at least 1 hour to allow the mousse to set. At this stage, the cake will hold in the freezer for up to 1 week. Spread a 1/8-inch thick layer of tempered white chocolate onto a piece of parchment paper. Let the chocolate harden until firm but not set, about 5 minutes. To make the brim of the hat, trace around a 10-inch cardboard cake circle or serving plate to cut a circle from the white chocolate. Place a clean sheet of parchment paper over the chocolate sheet and flip over both. Peel off the parchment paper. Separate the chocolate cutout and place on a cardboard cake circle. To assemble: Unmold by dipping the mold in hot water for 5 seconds. Press against one side of the mousse to slide it out of the dome mold. Place the dome, cake side down, in the center of the white chocolate circle. Prepare the paint sprayer: Place equal amounts of white chocolate and cocoa butter over a double boiler and melt until smooth with no lumps. Assemble the dessert and place in the freezer for about 10 minutes. The surface of the dessert must be chilled so the chocolate coating will harden upon contact, giving it the desired texture. Remove the dessert from the freezer and place on a platter or cake circle. Place the chocolate mixture in a clean paint sprayer and use it to spray the dessert with the chocolate. Cleanup will be much easier if you use a plastic-lined cardboard box as a backdrop to the dessert when you spray it. Add the decorations. Let thaw in the refrigerator for about 1 hour before serving. The Bonnet will hold in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Tip: Wrap the cornstarch in cheesecloth. Then you can easily shake an even layer of the starch onto the work surface.

Set a bowl of well-salted ice water on the counter. Add the broccoli rabe and cook for 1 minute, remove the broccoli rabe from the boiling water and plunge it immediately into the salted ice water. Reserve the boiling water to cook the pasta. Once the broccoli rabe has cooled, remove it from the ice water and squeeze out any excess water. Finely chop the broccoli rabe (the food processor works really well here) and put it in a large mixing bowl. Add the ricotta, eggs and Parmigiano and season with salt, to taste. Taste for seasoning and adjust, if needed. Put the filling in a pastry bag and reserve. Pasta: Set the pasta roller on the widest setting (#1). Start with half the pasta dough, keep the other half covered until ready to use. Using your hands, flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller, twice dusting it in between rolls if it feels sticky. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees (a quarter turn) and run it through the pasta machine 2 to 3 times. Move the roller to the next setting (#2) and run the pasta through. Dust lightly with flour if the dough feels sticky. Continue to run the dough through the machine reducing the opening (or moving the setting to the next larger number) in between every roll. Stop when you get to the correct thinness, this will usually be around number 5 or 6 on the dial, but every machine is different, you will have to be the judge of your own pasta thickness. *Tip: When rolling out pasta dough, always hold the pasta on the tops of your hands- palms down! If you hold it fingers up you will create stretch marks and those are never good! To assemble the ravioli: Lay out the dough on a flat surface. Brush the lower half of the dough (the part that is closest to you) lightly with water. This is the glue that will hold the ravioli together. Use the glue sparingly, if you use too much the pasta will slide and not stick. Pipe 1-inch balls of filling onto the pasta that has been brushed with water, leaving about 2 inches between each ball. Fold the top half of the pasta down over the filling to meet the bottom edge. Using your index fingers, poke around each filling ball to seal the ravioli shut, AND to make sure that there are no air bubbles. Using a fluted round cutter or a fluted pastry wheel or even a drinking glass, cut out each ravioli. Transfer to a sheet tray dusted with semolina or polenta and reserve until ready to use. To cook the ravioli and make the sauce: Add the butter to a large saute pan and bring to a medium heat. Add 1 cup of chicken stock and season with salt, to taste. Shake the pan to incorporate the butter and stock and simmer until the stock has reduced a bit and the sauce looks velvety and is the consistency of heavy cream. If the sauce thickens too much, adjust the consistency with chicken stock. Add the ravioli to the pot of boiling water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully remove the ravioli from the cooking water and put them immediately into the sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil shaking frequently to be sure that the ravioli dont stick to the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with 1 cup of Parmigiano and swirl to combine the cheese with the sauce. Transfer the ravioli to a serving platter and sprinkle with a little more grated Parmesan. Garnish with chopped pistachios and serve.

Serve warm with vanilla ice cream if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 41041,&quot;White Chocolate Pavlova 4 large egg whites 1 cup/250ml sugar 3 cups/750ml fresh ground cherries 1/2 cup/125ml sugar Zest and juice of 1 lemon Zest and juice of 1 orange 2 cups/500ml 35-percent cream 4 egg yolks 1/4 cup/60ml sugar 2 cups/500ml chopped white chocolate Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 170 degrees F (80 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. For the meringues: Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until they hold soft peaks. Start adding the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat until the meringue holds very stiff peaks. Test to see if the sugar is fully dissolved by rubbing a little of the meringue between your thumb and index finger. The meringue should feel smooth, not gritty. If it feels gritty the sugar has not fully dissolved, so keep beating until it feels smooth between your fingers. Gently spread the meringue into 8 small rounds on the parchment paper, smoothing the edges and making sure the edges are slightly higher than the center. (You want a slight well in the center of the meringues to place the cream and compote.) Bake until the outside of the meringues is dry, about 3 hours. (The outside of the meringue will feel firm to the touch if gently pressed, but as it cools you will get a little cracking and it will have a marshmallow texture.) Let cool. For the ground cherry compote: Combine the cherries, sugar, and citrus zests and juice in a saucepan. Simmer until the cherries are translucent and the liquid is syrupy, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. For the white chocolate cream: Bring the cream just to a simmer in a saucepan. Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Slowly pour in the hot cream, whisking constantly, than return the mixture to the saucepan. Cook over medium heat until thickened, about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Put the chopped chocolate in a large bowl. Pour the hot cream mixture through a strainer over the chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is melted. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Beat the white chocolate mixture with a mixer until pale and thick. To serve, place each meringue on a serving plate. Fill the centers with a dollop of white chocolate cream and top with the cherry compote. Cook&#39;s Note: The cooled meringues can be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for a few days. The cherry compote can be served on pancakes, waffles, or ice cream. The white chocolate cream can also be used to frost a cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 41042,&quot;Bistro Bacon and Egg Salad 4 slices bacon, cut crosswise into thin strips 2 1/2 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 8 large eggs 8 cups mesclun salad greens (about 7 ounces) 4 to 8 slices crusty bread, toasted if desired Instructions: Cook the bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a paper towel. Pull the skillet from the heat (leave drippings in the skillet) and stir in 1 12 tablespoons cider vinegar, scraping up any browned bits clinging to the skillet. Pour the mixture into a large bowl and whisk in mustard, salt and pepper to taste, and olive oil.<br> Fill a nonstick skillet with about 2 inches of water and bring it to the barest simmer over medium heat; add the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar. Crack the eggs, slipping them gently into the water, and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, about 4 minutes.<br> While the eggs poach, toss the greens with the vinaigrette and bits of bacon. Divide the salad among 4 plates or shallow bowls. Using a slotted spoon, gently scoop the eggs from the water, blot dry with a paper towel, and place 2 of them on top of each salad. Add bread to each plate and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41043,&quot;Turmeric Rice 2 teaspoons coconut oil 1/2 cup finely diced onions<br> 1 cup short-grain brown rice<br> 1/4 cup golden raisins<br> 1 teaspoon grated fresh turmeric 2 cloves garlic, grated<br> 2 1/2 cups vegetable stock or water Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat a medium saucepan to medium heat. Once heated, add the oil and allow to heat up. Once the oil is heated, add the onions and saute until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the rice, raisins, turmeric and garlic. Toss to coat. Saute gently until you smell a nutty aroma, about 2 minutes, and then add the stock. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to steam for 5 minutes prior to removing the lid. Season with salt and pepper, and fluff with a fork before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 41044,&quot;Individual Pumpkin Cheesecakes 18 vanilla wafer cookies 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1/3 cup half-and-half 1/3 cup sour cream One 15-ounce can pure pumpkin puree 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice Whipped cream and chopped crystallized ginger, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line 18 muffin cups, from 2 12-cup muffin tins, with paper liners. Place 1 whole cookie in the bottom of each lined cup.

Mist a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray. Warm the cranberries and rum in a small saucepan over medium heat, then remove from the heat and let steep 5 minutes. Drain. Whisk the flour, baking powder, brown sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the butter, eggnog, eggs and vanilla in another bowl. Gently fold into the flour mixture. (The batter will be lumpy; do not overmix.) Fold in the cranberries. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Make the topping: Mix the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, butter, salt and brown sugar in a bowl with your fingertips until it looks like wet sand. Sprinkle generously over the batter. Bake until the muffins are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly in the pan, then carefully remove to a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 41048,&quot;Popcorn Sandwich Cookies with Salted Caramel Popcorn Cookies: 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 1 large room temperature egg 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup cornstarch 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 cups popped unsalted popcorn, very coarsely ground in a food processor Salted Caramel: 1 1/3 cups sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt Instructions: For the popcorn cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Cream the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until slightly lightened, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the egg. Beat until well incorporated, about 30 seconds. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, kosher salt and 1 cup popcorn together in a separate bowl. Place the remaining popcorn in another bowl and set aside. Add the flour mixture to the creamed butter and mix on low speed until it just comes together to form a dough. Scoop a level tablespoonful of the dough at a time and roll into a ball. Dip one side of the ball into the ground popcorn and place, popcorn-side up, on the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Slightly flatten each ball with your hand. Bake until the cookies are slightly brown around the edges, 14 to 16 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, and then remove to a rack to cool completely. For the salted caramel: While the cookies cool, add the sugar to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Allow the sugar to melt completely around the edges before starting to stir or it will crystallize. When the sugar turns dark amber, after about 10 minutes, quickly turn off the heat and carefully whisk in the heavy cream. Allow the foam to subside, and then add the coarse salt. Allow the caramel to cool until it begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Spoon 1 tablespoon of caramel on the center of the bottom side of one cookie and carefully press closed with another cookie, making sure to push the caramel evenly to the edges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 41049,&quot;Asian Chicken Lettuce Cups 1/2 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced peeled ginger 1 tablespoon sambal oelek (Asian chili sauce) 1 tablespoon plum sauce 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce 1 tablespoon mirin (sweet rice wine) 1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted 1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 6 tablespoons canola oil 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, diced 1/3 cup diced carrot 1/3 cup diced celery 1/3 cup diced red bell pepper 1/3 cup diced sugar snap peas 1/3 cup diced red onion 1 teaspoon minced peeled ginger 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1/3 cup mung bean sprouts, halved 1/2 cup sliced shiitake mushroom caps 2 tablespoons diced scallions 1 tablespoon crushed peanuts 6 wonton wrappers Kosher salt Iceberg lettuce leaves, for serving 1/2 teaspoon black sesame seeds Instructions: Make the sauce: Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and set aside.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.<br> There are several ways to shape your bubble eclairs. Usually I portion the dough with a small cookie scoop (one with a capacity of 2 teaspoons), but you can pipe the dough from a pastry bag with a plain or open star tip, which makes squiggles and swirls that look lovely when baked. You might want to make it simple and just use a zipper-lock plastic bag as a piping bag.<br> No matter what you use, you want to scoop or pipe 3 balls of dough as close to one another as you can get them for each eclair. If you&#39;re scooping, scoop 1 ball, then crowd it with the second-giving it a little nudge-and then scoop out the last bubble, snuggling it up to the second ball of dough. When you&#39;ve got 3 bubbles in a row, move on to the next eclair, making sure to leave at least 2 inches of puff-and-grow space between the clusters. If you&#39;re piping, the principle is the same.<br> Now you have to make some decisions about the topping. If you&#39;re going to top the bubbles with disks of crackle, there&#39;s no need to give them an egg wash. Just lay a circle of the Crackle Top Dough on each puff of dough.<br> If you&#39;d like to top the eclairs with Streusel or pearl sugar, then it&#39;s nice to give each puff a swipe of egg wash. Make an effort to keep the egg wash on the top of the puffs and not let it drip down the sides; it&#39;s not fatal, but it does hamper the even rise of the pate a choux. If you&#39;re using Streusel, break up the pieces with your fingertips and use a smidge on each puff-put it on and press it down very, very lightly. If you&#39;re using pearl sugar, go to town-it&#39;s nice to have that crunch.<br> Slide the baking sheet into the oven and immediately turn the oven temperature down to 375 degrees F. Bake the eclairs for 20 minutes without opening the oven door, then rotate the pan and continue to bake the pastries for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden on top and bottom and firm to the touch. Transfer the eclairs to a rack to cool to room temperature.<br> To fill the eclairs: There are two traditional ways to fill eclairs, both good and both fun. One is to fill a pastry bag with whatever you&#39;ve chosen as a filling, use a medium plain pastry tip to poke a hole in the eclair-either in the bottom or in one side-nuzzle the tip into the hole and squeeze in enough filling to come to the edges of the hole.<br> The other way is to slice the eclairs horizontally, either in half or by cutting off the top one third. If you do this, you can scoop out the (inevitable) eggy innards. Some people love the custard interior, some don&#39;t, so know thyself (and thine audience). Pipe, spoon or scoop the filling into the bottom of the eclairs and cap with the tops.<br> No matter how you&#39;ve filled the pastries, they should be served immediately or stowed in the refrigerator until needed.<br> If you haven&#39;t sugared or crackled your eclairs, you might want to give them a last-minute dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar.<br> Serving: There&#39;s no law that says you can&#39;t pass these around and let everyone eat them out of hand, but I think of them as knife-and-fork pastries. If you serve them with cutlery you might want to serve them with bittersweet chocolate sauce or hot or cold salted caramel sauce. Bring the milk, water, butter, sugar and salt to a rapid boil in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over high heat. Add the flour all at once, lower the heat to medium-low and quickly start stirring energetically with a wooden spoon or sturdy heatproof spatula. The dough will come together and a light crust will form on the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring vigorously for another minute or two to dry the dough. The dough should be very smooth.<br> Turn the dough out into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or into a large bowl in which you can use a hand mixer or a wooden spoon. Let the dough sit for 3 minutes, then add the eggs one by one, beating until the dough is thick and shiny. Make sure that each egg is fully incorporated before you add the next, and don&#39;t be concerned if the dough falls apart; by the time the last egg goes in, it will have come together again. The dough should be used immediately.<br> Remove the butter from the refrigerator 10 minutes before you&#39;re ready to make the dough. After 10 minutes, cut the butter into small cubes and toss it and the brown sugar and salt into a food processor. Process until almost blended. Add the flour and pulse until the dough forms moist curds. Pulse in the vanilla. Scrape the dough onto a piece of parchment or wax paper and shape it into a disk. Cover with another piece of parchment or wax paper and roll the dough out so that it&#39;s about 1/16th inch thick. Slide the dough, still between the paper, onto a cutting board and freeze it for at least 2 hours. (The dough can be frozen for up to 2 months, in which case it should be wrapped airtight.) Put the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl and mix everything together by running the ingredients through your fingers. Drop in the butter and squeeze and rub the cubes into the mixture until you have a sandy mix. If you press a little streusel together, you&#39;ll get lumps, which is just what you want. Drizzle the vanilla over the streusel and toss, squeeze and rub to distribute it. Cover the bowl and chill the streusel until needed. (You can make the streusel up to 1 week ahead; pack it in an airtight container and keep it refrigerated.) If using a vanilla bean, cut it in half lengthwise and use the tip of the knife to scrape out the pulpy seeds. Bring the milk and vanilla bean pulp and pod to a boil in a medium saucepan. (If you&#39;re using extract, you&#39;ll add it later.) Cover the pan, turn off the heat and let infuse for at least 10 minutes, or for up to 1 hour.<br> Return the milk to a boil if you&#39;ve used a vanilla bean; bring it to a boil if you&#39;re using extract.<br> Whisk the yolks, sugar and cornstarch together in a medium heatproof bowl until blended. Whisking constantly, drizzle in one quarter of the hot milk to temper, or warm, the yolks. Still whisking, add the remainder of the liquid in a steady stream. Remove the pod (if you have it), pour the mixture into the saucepan and, whisking vigorously and constantly, bring to a boil over medium heat. Keep at a boil-never stop whisking-for 1 to 2 minutes, then press the cream through a sieve into a clean bowl. Stir in the vanilla extract, if you&#39;re using it.<br> Leave the pastry cream on the counter for 10 minutes, then whisk in the butter until it is fully incorporated and the pastry cream is smooth and silky.<br> Either press a piece of plastic film against the surface of the cream and refrigerate it until it&#39;s thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours, or fill a large bowl with ice cubes and cold water, set the bowl of pastry cream in it and leave the cream there, stirring occasionally, until it&#39;s cold. Use now, or cover and refrigerate until needed.<br> Storing: The pastry cream can be kept tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Whisk it well to loosen it before using.<br> Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer or a balloon whip, beat the cream and 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar together just until the cream starts to thicken. Taste and add more sugar, if you&#39;d like, then continue to beat until you get the thickness you want. I use my stand mixer and start off slow, then increase the speed and when the cream is almost whipped the way I want it, I finish it by hand with a whisk. Hand finishing reduces the risk of overbeating and turning your cream into sweetened butter. When the cream is just right, stir in the vanilla extract, if you&#39;re using it.<br> Storing: Whipped cream is best served soon after it&#39;s made, but it will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for a few hours. Give it a go-round with a whisk just before serving. To keep the cream longer- or to get a thicker cream- line a strainer with a piece of moistened cheesecloth, place the strainer over a bowl and put the cream in the strainer. Wrap the whole setup in plastic film and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours.<br> Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large bowl with a heavy-duty hand mixer, beat the cream until it holds medium-firm peaks. If you&#39;re working in a stand mixer, transfer the cream to another bowl and rinse and dry the mixer bowl and whisk. Cover the whipped cream and refrigerate.<br> Put the eggs and yolks in the mixer bowl and fit the machine with the whisk attachment, or work in another large bowl with the hand mixer. Beat the eggs at low speed just to break them up. Set aside while you prepare the chocolate and syrup.<br> Melt the chocolate in a microwave oven or in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the heat isn&#39;t too high and that the chocolate remains thick and shiny. If necessary, scrape the chocolate into a bowl that&#39;s large enough to hold all the ingredients for the mousse; set aside. The chocolate must cool (114 degrees F is the ideal temperature) so that when you fold in the cold whipped cream, it doesn&#39;t seize and clump.<br> Bring the sugar and water to a boil in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan. Swirl the pan to mix the ingredients as they start to heat, and if some of the sugar spatters on the sides of the pan, wash it down with a silicone pastry brush dipped in cold water. Cook the sugar over high heat until it reaches 257 degrees F on a candy or instant-read thermometer, about 8 minutes (or maybe a little more, depending on the dimensions of your pan and the heat you have under it).<br> Back to the eggs: Beat the eggs on the lowest speed, just to get them moving again, then very slowly pour in the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream. Try to pour the syrup between the side of the bowl and the whirring whisk. Please be careful-this is soooooooo hot and sticky! No matter how careful you are, you&#39;ll get spatters and you should just leave them-trying to scrape them into the eggs will only produce lumps. When all the syrup is in the bowl, up the mixer speed to high and beat until the eggs are pale and more than doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. If the eggs have doubled but still feel warm, lower the mixer speed to medium and keep beating until they reach room temperature.<br> Pull the whipped cream from the refrigerator and give it a couple of rounds with a whisk, just to bring back the medium-firm peaks. Working with a large flexible spatula, fold about one quarter of the whipped cream into the chocolate to lighten it, then gently fold in the rest of the cream. Now, using the spatula and your lightest touch, fold in the whipped eggs. Your voluminous eggs will deflate some, but be gentle and the texture of your mousse will be lovely.<br> Use the mousse now if you&#39;re filling a cake with it, but if you want to pipe it, it&#39;s best to cover and chill it for at least 1 hour. And if you are serving it on its own, chill it.<br> Serving: The mousse can be served elegantly in small cups or bowls, topped with a rosette of unsweetened whipped cream, or family style, as it&#39;s often served in French homes.<br> Storing: The mousse can be covered tightly and kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.<br> &quot;, 41059,&quot;Roasted Turkey with Papaya-Cranberry Salsa 1 pound fully cooked turkey breast meat (or a combination of breast, thigh and leg meat), sliced crosswise into thin slices * 2 cups diced fresh papaya 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 2 tablespoons minced pickled jalapenos 1/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries 1/2 lime, juiced 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Salt and ground black pepper Instructions: Put turkey on a serving platter.

Sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, all of the spices and the salt. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla. Slowly add the sifted ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat until just combined. Fold in the shredded parsnips. Fill the liners about three-quarters of the way full and bake, 16 to 18 minutes. For the compote: Bring the seltzer, wine, granulated sugar and ginger to a simmer and heat through until the sugar dissolves. Add the cubed quince and simmer gently until tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the fruit from the liquid and continue to reduce the liquid in the pot until it becomes syrupy. (You will use this to finish off the top of the cupcake.) Chill both the syrup and fruit in the refrigerator. For the frosting: In an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese until smooth and free of lumps. Add the butter and beat together until fully combined. Slowly add the powdered sugar. Add the honey and vanilla and beat until combined. To assemble: Core out the center of the cupcakes and fill with quince compote.

Lightly spray the bottom and sides of a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter browns, 6 to 9 minutes. Immediately transfer to a medium bowl and let cool slightly. Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl. Whisk the brown sugar, sour cream, vanilla and eggs into the bowl with the browned butter until combined, then stir in the mashed bananas. Fold the flour mixture into the banana mixture with a rubber spatula until just combined (some small lumps are ok). Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and lightly tap the pan on the counter to evenly distribute the batter. Top with the pecans. Bake until the loaf is browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out completely clean, about 1 hour. Let the bread cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely. Wash and dry the loaf pan, then reserve for assembly. For the banana caramel sauce: Meanwhile, combine the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the sugar turns a dark amber, 10 to 12 minutes. Working carefully (as the mixture will bubble up at this point), slowly whisk in the heavy cream until smooth. Stir in the butter and sliced bananas until thoroughly combined. Transfer to a large bowl, then let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. For the assembly: To assemble, line the reserved loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving about a 4-inch overhang on the 2 longer sides. Carefully slice the cooled banana bread with a serrated knife horizontally into 3 even slices. Place the bottom slice into the bottom of the lined loaf pan, then cover with an even layer of 1 1/2 cups of the butter pecan ice cream. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the banana caramel sauce over the ice cream, then sprinkle with half of the pecans. Layer the middle slice of banana bread over the pecans, then cover with the remaining butter pecan ice cream, followed by another 1/3 cup banana caramel sauce and remaining pecans. Finish by placing the top layer of banana bread on top, then press down gently so all the layers adhere. Fold over the plastic wrap, then use another sheet of plastic wrap to cover the loaf pan completely. Freeze until completely firm, at least 6 hours and up to overnight. Refrigerate the remaining banana caramel sauce and reserve for serving. To serve, use the plastic overhang to lift the cake out of the pan. (Run the underside of the loaf pan under warm water if the cake sticks to the pan and is hard to remove.) Microwave the reserved banana caramel sauce in 20-second intervals, stirring after each, until just warm, about 1 minute. Cut the ice cream loaf into 1-inch-thick slices, then drizzle with the warm banana caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41065,&quot;Potato Curlers 1 cup mashed potatoes 1/2 cup sugar 2 tbsp. butter 1 tsp. vanilla 2 cups flour 2 tsp. baking powder 2 eggs yolks Oil for frying Powdered sugar for dusting Instructions: Mix potatoes, sugar, butter, vanilla, and yolks.

In a small bowl, drizzle the tomatoes with oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and put a cooling rack on top. Arrange the tomato slices on the rack. Roast until the tomatoes begin to caramelize on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove and let cool, then gently chop. Pile the cilantro, onion, lime zest and a pinch of salt together on a cutting board. Chop vigorously until finely minced and combined. Mix in the chopped tomatoes. On a griddle or a saute pan large enough to fit the sandwiches, add half of the butter on medium- high heat. Build the sandwiches directly on the grill by putting 1 slice of bread on the pan, making sure the bread gets moistened with the butter. Top with a slice of cheese, evenly sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the onion-tomato mixture, a second slice of cheese and then top with another piece of bread. Repeat for the rest of the sandwiches, gently pressing down each sandwich with a spatula. After the cheese begins to melt a bit, check the bottom of the sandwich for color and if golden brown, gently flip. Add the other half of the butter around the edges and gently press each sandwich while toasting the second side. Remove when the bottom reveals a golden brown color and the cheese is melted, about 4 minutes.

Let the chocolate set until firm yet pliable, but not hard. Next, roll it, chocolate inside, lengthwise into a long tube, but not overlapping the chocolate. Tape it closed, place in the refrigerator and allow the chocolate to set completely. When set, remove from the refrigerator, and peel off the acetate. Using a hot serrated chef&#39;s knife, cut the tube into 1 (8-inch) long tube and 2 (5-inch) long tubes. Set aside.<br> For the Conical Roof Tops: Cut two circles of acetate that are each 7 inches in diameter and one that is 6 inches in diameter. Make a 3 1/2-inch cut toward the center in both of the 7-inch circles, and a 3-inch cut in the 6-inch circle. Overlap the two cut sides of each circle to make a cone shape and tape it closed. Mix the cocoa butter with the powdered food coloring to the desired consistency and paint the inside of the mold. (It is best to use yogurt machine to store and warm your paints.) Using a ladle, fill the cone with white chocolate. When it is full, empty the excess back into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the cone should be evenly coated. Wipe the edge of the plastic cone clean and place it upside down on a wire rack over a sheet pan. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge of the cone clean again with a paring knife. You can place the cone in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat with the other cones. When the chocolate sets, peel off the acetate. Set the cones aside.<br> For the Dice: Place an acetate sheet on your work surface with the long side facing you. Using an offset spatula, spread about a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate onto the sheet and wait until the chocolate begins to set. Using a rolling cutter or hot sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut equal size squares in the amount and size desired. (You will need 6 squares for each die.) When the chocolate has set, carefully peel away the acetate. It should release from the chocolate quite easily. Use white chocolate to glue the squares together to form the cube. Fill a cornet with bittersweet chocolate and draw the dots on the dice.<br> For the Roulette Numbers: You will need to perform the following process once using white chocolate and once using bittersweet chocolate. Place an acetate sheet on your work surface with the long side facing you. Using an offset spatula, spread about a 1/4-inch-thick layer of chocolate onto the acetate sheet. Wait until the chocolate begins to set. Using a rolling cutter or hot sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut squares in proportion to your castle. When the chocolate has set, carefully peel away the sheet. It should release from the chocolate quite easily. Fill a cornet with bittersweet chocolate and draw the numbers onto the squares. For the Playing Cards: Place an acetate sheet on your work surface with the long side facing you. Using an offset spatula, spread about a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate onto the sheet. Wait until the chocolate begins to set, then using a rolling cutter or hot sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut 2 1/4 by 3 1/2-inch rectangles. When the chocolate has set, carefully peel away the card. It should release quite easily. Using a small paintbrush and cocoa butter paints, paint the faces on the cards. For the Castle Walls: place a piece of textured plastic on the work surface in front of you. Using an offset spatula, spread about a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate onto the acetate sheet. Let the chocolate set until firm yet pliable but not hard. Carefully peel away the sheet. It should release from the chocolate quite easily. Using the tip of a hot paring knife, cut the desired design at the top of wall.<br> For the Sparklers: Place a transfer sheet on your work surface with the long side facing you. Using an offset spatula, spread about a 1/4 inch-thick layer of white chocolate onto the transfer sheet, completely covering the design. Allow the chocolate to set. Using the tip of a paring knife or cookie cutters, cut out whatever shape you desire. Let set completely. Remove the parchment paper and set aside. To make the sticks, roll up a piece of parchment paper tightly, tape it closed and stand it up on end inside the tube inside a roll of paper towels. Fill the parchment paper with white chocolate and allow it to harden. When hardened, peel off the parchment paper and \glue\ the top of the sparkler to the stick with white chocolate.<br> For the Base: Overturn the deli tray and, using a clean wide paintbrush dipped in bittersweet chocolate, completely cover the outside of the tray, sides and all. Allow the chocolate to set and apply as many coats as needed to create a 1/3-inch thick coating. Allow the chocolate to set completely. Turn the tray back over and carefully lift it away from the chocolate.<br> To Assemble: Set the base right-side up on the work surface in front of you. Position the roulette wheel squares along the edge about half way around the circle, alternating dark and white. Use a cornet filled with bittersweet chocolate to glue each piece into place. Position the turrets as desired. Use bittersweet chocolate to glue each piece into place. Glue on the roofs. Add the walls between each turret and glue into place. Decorate with the dice and cards as desired. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 41091,&quot;Big Island Greens with Papaya Dressing 1 fresh lime 1 papaya, peeled, sliced, and seeds removed and reserved 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 6 cups mixed fresh greens, soaked in salt water to remove grit, rinsed and dried in a salad spinner 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: To make the dressing, microwave lime in a small bowl to release essential oils, and set aside until cool enough to handle. Through the feed opening of a running blender add, 1 at a time, the papaya, papaya seeds, Dijon mustard, vinegar, salt, pepper, and juice from the microwaved lime. (Note: If you squeeze the lime with the sliced side against your palm, the seeds are likely to stay in the rind.) Then with the blender still running, add the olive oil in a slow thin stream. Please note that the edible papaya seeds lend a wonderful mustard-y taste to the dressing, but are coarse in texture. If you find the texture to be too coarse for you, strain the dressing before use. Toss the greens and cilantro with enough of the dressing to coat, serving additional dressing on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41092,&quot;Cauliflower Toasts 1 small head cauliflower (2 pounds) 4 tablespoons good olive oil<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 12 ounces Italian mascarpone cheese, at room temperature<br> 6 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated<br> 4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, julienned<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 6 large slices country-style bread<br> Paprika<br> Freshly grated Italian Parmesan cheese<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives<br> Flaked sea salt, such as Maldon<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Render the sausages in a large pan over medium-high heat, 5 to 10 minutes. Add your diced veggies and then grate the garlic into the pan. While the veggies sweat down, get the roux started. Add the oil to a large skillet (enough to cover the bottom). Slowly add the flour to the oil and mix together. Let the roux continue to cook until it reaches a dark caramel color, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, sear the chicken in a small pan over high heat on both sides, then remove to a cutting board, cut into dice and reserve. Once that roux reaches the dark caramel color, stir in the chicken stock. The veggies should be done sweating at this time. Add your roux to the veggie mix. Your hot sauce and gumbo file can now be introduced to the mix. Next add your crawfish, shrimp and reserved diced chicken. Allow them to cook in the pot as you reach a boil on the gumbo.

Combine wine, 1/4 cup chestnut honey, water, cinnamon, and lemon zest in a medium saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add the seeds and the scraped bean to the pot. Bring to a simmer, stirring. Pour the poaching liquid into a baking dish just large enough to hold the pears. Keeping stems intact, remove the core from the pear using a melon baller (apple corer) entering through the base and removing only the woody core and seeds. Trim the skin off the base only of the pear and place upright in baking dish. Bake the pears about 25 to 35 minutes or until tender. You must baste the pears with the liquid every 5 to 7 minutes. The skins should be crinkly. Remove from oven and let cool in the liquid. Combine the mascarpone with the remaining 1 tablespoon chestnut honey. Using a pastry bag, fill each pear at its base with the mascarpone. Serve drizzled with poaching syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Ribera del Duero]&quot; 41140,&quot;Grilled Artichokes with Honey-cl Dipping Sauce 4 medium artichokes 1 lemon, halved<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon cl sauce, such as Heinz 1 tablespoon honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Olive oil, for brushing Instructions: Cut 1/2 inch off the top of the artichokes. Then cut each artichoke in half vertically. Using scissors, trim the leaves of pointy ends. Carefully cut out and discard the fuzzy chokes in the center of each half. Rub the artichokes with lemon. Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a large pot fitted with a steamer rack. Add the artichokes, cover, and steam until tender, about 30 minutes, adding more water if necessary. Set aside for 15 minutes to cool. In a bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, cl sauce, honey, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and a pinch of salt. Set aside. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Brush the steamed artichokes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill, cut-side down, until nicely charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 41141,&quot;Ham and Brie Crepes 2 large eggs 1/2 cup milk, or more as needed 1/2 cup club soda Kosher salt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus 3 tablespoons unsalted butter for cooking the crepes 1 cup all-purpose flour 8 slices French ham 12 ounces Brie, sliced 1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for cooking 4 large eggs 1/2 shallot, minced 1/2 cup Champagne vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 3 cups mesclun greens Instructions: For the crepes: Add the eggs, milk, club soda and a pinch of salt to a blender and process until completely combined. Pour in the 3 tablespoons melted butter, then add the flour and blend until smooth. The mixture should be like VERY loose pancake batter. If the mixture is a little thick, add a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using. Melt about 1/2 teaspoon butter in a small nonstick saute pan over medium heat. The butter should coat the bottom of the pan; if there is a lot of excess, wipe it out with a paper towel. Keep the paper towel handy in case you need it again (you will). Fill a 2-ounce ladle almost to the top with batter and pour it into the preheated pan, tipping and rolling the pan as you ladle the batter to evenly cover the bottom. This will take a little practice; even when you are an experienced crepe maker the first couple always get wasted. Accept it and move on. When the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bottom begins to brown a little, turn the crepe over and cook it for about 1 minute on the other side. Remove the crepe from the pan to a plate and let cool. Stack the crepes as they are cooked between parchment paper squares. Repeat this process until all the batter is used, wiping the pan with your paper towel or melting a little more butter in the pan as needed. For the ham and Brie crepes: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Divide the ham and cheese evenly among 8 crepes (save the remaining crepes for another use). Roll each crepe and place on a sheet pan fitted with a rack. Bake to melt the cheese and warm the ham, 6 to 8 minutes. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add olive oil to coat. Crack the eggs in the skillet (you can do this in batches if you prefer). Cook until the whites are just set, a minute or two. Remove from the heat and set aside. Whisk to combine the shallots, vinegar, Dijon, and 1/2 cup olive oil in a medium bowl. Dress the greens lightly and set aside. Plate 2 crepes on each of 4 serving plates and top each with 1 egg and a handful of the dressed greens.

Immerse the peaches in boiling water for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until their skins peel off easily. Place them immediately in cold water. Peel the peaches, slice them into thick wedges, and place them in a large bowl. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, granulated sugar, and flour. Toss well. Gently mix in the blueberries. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes. Spoon the mixture into ramekins or custard cups. For the topping, combine the flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until the butter is the size of peas. Rub the mixture with your fingertips until it&#39;s in big crumbles, then sprinkle evenly over the fruit. Place the ramekins on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the tops are browned and crisp and the juices are bubbly. Serve warm or at room temperature. If you want to make these early, store the unbaked crumbles in the refrigerator and bake before dinner. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 41143,&quot;Cooked Tomatillo Salsa with Arbol Chiles 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 3-4 large cloves garlic, minced 1 medium white onion, finely chopped 3-4 Arbol, chiles finely chopped (approximately 1 tablespoon) 1 pound drained cooked or canned tomatillos 1 cup chicken broth 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped Instructions: You will need a large skillet or heavy saucepan and either a blender or food processor.

Bring to a high boil. Turn off heat and cover with a lid. In the meantime, bring the milk to a simmer with 2 drops of vanilla extract. Place the egg yolks in a bowl, add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and whisk well until it becomes pale in color, then add the sifted flour and cornstarch. Pour the hot milk over the egg mixture slowly to temper, then place everything back in the pot. Cook on medium heat while mixing until it thickens. Transfer to another bowl and cover with a plastic film, let cool. When the strawberries are thawed and slightly melted, remove the lid from the pot, put the flame on high and cook off the water until it becomes a thick puree, reserve and let cool. When they are both cooled, mix the pastry cream and the strawberry puree together. Prepare the souffle mold by buttering the inside and then coating with sugar. Make sure not to touch the inside once it&#39;s coated with sugar or the souffle batter will stick. Set aside until needed. Place the egg whites in a bowl, add a small pinch of salt and beat up until it gets fluffy and white, add half the sugar. Whisk until it becomes very stiff but not too stiff and grainy. Add the remaining sugar and mix well. Fold the egg whites in a white pastry cream mixture delicately until well incorporated. Place half the souffle batter in the buttered/sugared oven-proof dish, then the cubed sponge cakes and finish with the remaining souffle batter on top. Place the whole dish in another oven-proof pan filled with hot water (this is called the bain-marie cooking method). Place in a preheated 400 degree oven and cook until the souffle rises and its top becomes slightly brown (approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The inside should still be slightly undercooked.) Remove and serve immediately. Decorate with fresh strawberries and a mint leaf. It is a good idea to serve with a strawberry or a vanilla sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 41147,&quot;Lunch Kiddie Kebab 12 slices sandwich bread 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter<br> 1/2 cup strawberry jelly<br> 1 banana, thinly sliced (24 slices)<br> 24 blackberries<br> Instructions: Assemble 4 double-decker peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, with a slice of bread separating the peanut butter and jelly (each sandwich will use 3 slices of bread).

Do not overmix. Set aside on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes. For the yuzu dressing: In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and yuzu juice. Whisk in the mustard, paprika and lemon zest and set aside. For the shrimp: Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot. Heat the oil to 320 degrees F, using a deep-frying thermometer to monitor the temperature. Put a wire rack into a rimmed baking sheet. Arrange the Bibb lettuce in an overlapping circle in a large shallow serving bowl or platter. Once the oil reaches 320 degrees F, add the lemon slices and fry until crispy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the rack over the baking sheet with a slotted spoon. Fry the basil (take care as it can splatter when it hits the oil) until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to the same rack. Season with salt. Raise the oil temperature to 350 degrees F. Add the shrimp to the batter to coat. Transfer the shrimp to the oil in batches with a slotted spoon, holding the spoon just over the oil and carefully dropping them in one by one to prevent clumping and splashing.

Cook the pasta until it reaches al dente, according to the package directions. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Sear the chicken, covered, for 5 minutes. Flip and sear another 5 minutes, covered. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside to rest. After a few minutes, give the chicken a good chop. Back in the skillet, add the remaining tablespoon oil. Add the carrots and cook, stirring, until they start to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the onions and asparagus and cook, stirring, until the asparagus is crisp-tender, another few minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season the veggies with a pinch of salt and pepper and reduce the heat the low. In the meantime, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Once the foaming subsides, add the flour and whisk until the color changes from cream to a golden brown, just a few minutes. Slowly add the milk, continuing to whisk over medium heat, until it becomes a bit thicker and creamier. Now, add the Parmesan and a good pinch of salt. Keep whisking until the cheese is melted and the sauce is good and creamy. Taste it and add more salt if needed. Ladle out about 2/3 cup cream sauce and add it to 1 cup cooked pasta, tossing to coat. Divide between 2 kids&#39; plates and top with chopped chicken and extra Parmesan. Done! (Feel free to sprinkle the veggies on the kids&#39; plates, if they&#39;ll remotely let you.) Now, back to the cream sauce: stir in the vodka and let it simmer for a couple of minutes. For your adult plates, serve the creamy pasta with chicken and a good helping of cooked veggies. Garnish with extra Parmesan and fresh parsley. Eat! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 41158,&quot;Mango Meringue Pie with Candied Chiles 1 3/4 cups sugar Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime 1 red jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced into rounds 1 1/3 cups finely ground vanilla wafer cookies (about 40 cookies) 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 1 1/4-ounce packet unflavored gelatin powder 2 ripe mangoes, pitted, peeled and cut into chunks (or 2 cups thawed frozen mango chunks) 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 teaspoon cream of tartar 5 large egg whites Instructions: Make the topping: Combine 1 cup sugar, the lime zest, lime juice and 1 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the jalapeno slices, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the jalapeno cool in the syrup, at least 1 hour. Strain the jalapeno; reserve the syrup. Spread 1/2 cup sugar on a small plate. One at a time, toss half of the jalapeno slices in the sugar until lightly coated. (Set the remaining jalapeno slices aside.) Let the sugared jalapeno slices dry until hardened, at least 4 hours or overnight. Make the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pulse the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 2 unsugared jalapeno slices in a food processor until ground. Add the cookie crumbs and butter and pulse to combine. Press into the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch pie plate. Bake until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Make the filling: Combine the orange juice and gelatin in a small microwave-safe bowl and set aside to soften, about 5 minutes. Puree the mangoes in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the reserved jalapeno syrup, the vanilla and 1 teaspoon salt and puree until smooth. Microwave the juice-gelatin mixture until just hot and liquefied, about 30 seconds. Stir to make sure the gelatin is dissolved, then add to the mango mixture in the blender and puree until smooth. Strain the mango mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then pour into the cooled crust. Press a sheet of plastic wrap onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours or overnight. Make the meringue: Combine the sugar, cornstarch, cream of tartar, egg whites and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over a medium saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the egg whites are hot to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the water and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy and stiff peaks just form, about 2 minutes. Finely chop the remaining unsugared jalapeno slices and combine with a large spoonful of the meringue in a small bowl. Add to the remaining meringue and whisk to combine. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip. Pipe the meringue on top of the pie to make a dome with spiky peaks. Lightly brown the meringue with a kitchen torch and top with the reserved sugared jalapeno slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41159,&quot;Philly Cheesesteak Kebabs 2 1/2 pounds sirloin steak, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 sweet onion, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces 8 ounces button mushrooms, trimmed and halved (or quartered if large) Vegetable oil, for the grill 3/4 cup yellow cheese sauce (such as Cheez Whiz) Hoagie rolls, sliced hot cherry peppers and hot sauce, for topping Instructions: Toss the steak with 2 tablespoons olive oil, the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl.

Using a sharp, flexible knife, cut the skin and white membrane from the orange. Use a sawing motion and cut from top to bottom following the contours of the orange. Free the orange segments by cutting along the seams that separate them from each other. Do this over a bowl to collect any juices. Reserve the segments separately and squeeze what&#39;s left of the orange over the bowl to collect the juice. Do the same with the remaining 2 oranges. Strain the juice into a measuring cup: You should have about 3/4 cup; if not, juice the remaining orange and add as much as needed.<br> Combine the ginger, mayonnaise, mustard, and honey with 1/2 cup of the orange juice in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.<br> In a small bowl, combine half of the chopped shallots with 3 tablespoons of the remaining orange juice. Whisk in the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.<br> Cut the avocados lengthwise up to the large pit in the middle. Gently twist apart the 2 halves and remove the pit. Wedge a teaspoon between the skin and the flesh and remove the flesh in 1 piece. Cut the avocados into 1-inch pieces and put them into the bowl with the honey-and-ginger dressing. Add the remaining shallots, the chopped mint and the chopped cilantro, and mix together lightly so as not to break up the avocado.<br> When ready to serve, set aside 8 orange segments. Toss the rest with the whole lettuce leaves and just enough of the orange-and-olive oil vinaigrette to coat. Divide the lettuce and oranges among 4 plates. Spoon some avocado onto each plate (there will be some dressing left in the bowl). Top with the reserved orange segments and drizzle any remaining honey-and-ginger dressing over the salad. Garnish with whole mint and cilantro leaves, and, if you like, some pickled ginger. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 41161,&quot;Grilled Scallion Skewers 20 scallions 2 teaspoons olive oil Instructions: Preheat the grill or a grill pan.

Whip in the almond extract and confectioners&#39;sugar until peaks form. Make sure not to over whip, the cream will then become lumpy and butter-like. When completely cool, use your hands to crumble the brownies into smaller pieces. In a glass trifle bowl, layer in the following order: crumbled brownies, about 1 1/2 cups pudding, 1 1/2 crumbled toffee bars, about 1 3/4 cups whipped cream. Repeat the layers in the same order. Save the last 2 toffee bars to crumble and sprinkle on top before serving. For individual small trifle bowls, layer in the following order: crumbled brownie, pudding, crushed chocolate covered toffee bars and whipped cream. Garnish with more crumbled toffee bars. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. For your brownie batter, melt your butter in a medium (or large) heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. While the butter is melting, whisk your natural cocoa powder, sea salt and sugar in a separate bowl. (The sugar and salt will work as abrasive agents to get any lumps out of the cocoa.) Whisk the cocoa/sugar/salt combo into the melted butter. Continue to whisk the ingredients together in the bowl over the simmering water until the sugar has dissolved fully. The mixture should look like fudge and pull away from the bowl into a ball. Remove from the heat and set on a dishtowel on your counter, and allow the fudgy mixture to cool down until it&#39;s warm, but not hot anymore. While that is cooling, line the bottom and sides of your 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper or foil. You want to leave about 4 inches of overhang on the 2 opposite sides. These serve as your handles to remove the brownies from the pan in 1 piece, so make sure that there is enough of the overhang for you to have a solid grip. Grease the parchment or foil well. Stir in the vanilla into the cooled fudge mixture to loosen it up. Add the eggs into the mixture 1 at a time, adding the second egg after the first egg is fully incorporated. The batter should look shiny and well blended. Add in your flour and stir it until it&#39;s fully incorporated. Once it looks fully blended, beat the batter vigorously for at least 45 strokes. This&#39;ll not only get out any pent up stress, but it will make the brownies chewy. Fold in your chocolate chips. Spread the very thick and fudgy brownie batter evenly in the lined pan with an offset spatula or your greased hands. Pop the brownies in the oven and bake until they get a nice crust and your house smells like brownies, 30 to 35 minutes. Let them cool completely on a rack or a dishtowel on your counter. Whisk the sugar, cocoa powder and flour in a bowl until there are no lumps. Crack the eggs into the bowl, add the yolks and whisk into a paste. Slowly whisk in 1 cup milk until fully incorporated. Then whisk in the remaining 1 cup milk. Put the milk mixture into a saucepan and put over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it starts to look like pudding. It will begin to bubble and it will hold soft peaks when you lift the whisk out. Take off the heat and cool to room temperature. Cook&#39;s Note: To prevent a skin from forming, cover the pudding with plastic wrap, pressing down directly on the surface of the pudding. Poke a few holes throughout to allow to cool to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 41167,&quot;Cactus Salad 1 1/2 pounds fresh or prepared cactus paddles or nopales, needles removed 3/4 cup olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 4 Italian Roma tomatoes, cored, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch dice 1/2 small red onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice 1 to 2 medium serrano chiles, stemmed, seeded and finely diced 2 bunches cilantro, leaves only, chopped 1/2 cup finely grated Cotija or Anejo cheese 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 to 6 lettuce leaves 1 avocado, peeled, seeded and sliced for garnish 1/4 cup cracked black pepper garnish, recipe follows 2 tablespoons cracked black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat grill or broiler. Place cactus paddles in a bowl and toss with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Grill or broil the paddles until grill marks appear on each side, or they turn dark green with black patches, about 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Cover and chill 2 to 4 hours or overnight. Cut cactus into 1/2-inch pieces. In a large bowl, combine the cactus, tomatoes, onions, chiles, cilantro and cheese with the remaining 1/2 cup oil, the vinegar, the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Toss well.

Butter two 8-by-2-inch-round cake pans and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Combine the chocolate, milk and 1/2 cup water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until the chocolate is melted; whisk until smooth, then let cool. Meanwhile, sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl; set aside. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 4 minutes. Add the vegetable oil, brown sugar, granulated sugar and vanilla; beat until fluffy, about 4 more minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until incorporated. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the melted chocolate mixture; beat until just incorporated. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes in the pans, then run a knife around the edges and invert onto a rack to cool completely. Reheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Using a long serrated knife, cut each cake in half crosswise to make 4 layers. Crumble one of the layers into small pieces on the baking sheet. Bake until dry, about 20 minutes; let cool completely. Cover with parchment paper and crush with the bottom of a saucepan to make coarse crumbs; set aside. Make the frosting: Combine the chocolate, corn syrup and 1/2 cup hot water in a large heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water; stir until melted, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot and let cool 10 minutes. Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and start beating on high speed; beat in the vanilla, then the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until creamy. Refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until thick enough to spread, about 10 minutes. (If the frosting is too thick, microwave in 10-second intervals for up to 30 seconds to soften.) Put one cake layer on a platter; spread 1 heaping cup frosting on top.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color the sugar with food colors, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of food color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp (you can use a space heater or work in front of an open 300 degree F oven). Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. You will need to repeat the following steps for each color. Try to do this somewhat simultaneously to keep the sugar from melting under the lamp. Pull the sugar to incorporate air. Pull and cut a piece of the yellow sugar. Form into and flat oblong shape, like an ear of corn. Use a knife to score the designs of the kernels into the sugar. Form it so it has a curved shape like an ear of corn. Set aside on a silicone mat. Pull and cut a piece of the green sugar. Pull a long piece so it is quite thin at the end. Continue making the green leaves until the corn is covered. Use this process to make additional ears of corn. Make additional leaves. Make a round flat base that is about 6-inches in diameter. Pull a 12-inch tall artistic shape to which you can \glue\ all of the other ears of corn and leaves. Use a blowtorch to glue ears to base.

Add the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Marinate, refrigerated, for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Once hot, put a baking sheet lined with foil in the oven for 20 minutes to heat up. Add the onion, carrots, bell pepper and broccoli to the bowl with the chicken, drizzle with a little olive oil, sprinkle with some salt and pepper and toss. Put the chicken and vegetables flat on the hot baking sheet and sprinkle with more salt and pepper. Put the baking sheet back in the oven and roast, flipping the chicken halfway through to promote even browning, until the chicken is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Transfer the chicken and vegetables to a platter, sprinkle on the Pecorino Romano and pickled cherry peppers and drizzle with olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Gavi, Barbera]&quot; 41194,&quot;BLT Tortas With Spicy Salsa For the salsa: 1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, halved if large 1 small onion, quartered 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled 3 jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded 3/4 cup fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems), coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar Kosher salt For the bacon: 2 tablespoons ancho cl powder 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Pinch of ground cloves 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 pound thick-cut bacon For the sandwiches: 4 Portuguese rolls or soft hero rolls 8 ounces Oaxaca cheese or salted mozzarella, shredded 3 tomatoes, sliced 1/2 small head iceberg lettuce, shredded Instructions: Make the salsa: Preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil and add the tomatoes, onion, garlic and jalapenos (cut-side down). Broil, turning as needed, until the tomatoes and onion char and the garlic softens, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool, then peel the garlic. Coarsely chop the tomatoes, onion, garlic and jalapenos; transfer to a bowl. Stir in the cilantro, vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Make the bacon: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack on top. Combine the cl powder, cayenne, oregano, cumin and cloves in a small bowl; stir in the garlic, vinegar and 1 tablespoon water. Lay the bacon on the rack in a single layer; brush with the spice paste. Bake until the fat starts to render, about 15 minutes. Flip using tongs, then continue baking until browned, 10 to 20 more minutes, depending on the thickness of the bacon. Drain on paper towels and let cool until slightly crisp. Assemble the sandwiches: Halve the rolls and pull out some of the bread from the insides. Lightly toast in the oven, 5 to 7 minutes. Spread some of the prepared salsa on the bottom half of each roll, then top with a layer of cheese, a few pieces of bacon, some tomato slices and lettuce. Top with more salsa, then cover with the roll tops, pressing them down. Cut in half with a serrated knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 41195,&quot;Ginger Shortcakes with Mangoes and Strawberries 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/3 cup roughly chopped crystallized ginger (Australian ginger is best) 3/4 cup buttermilk 1 egg, lightly beaten 2 large, ripe mangoes, peeled and cut into cubes 1/2 pound strawberries, stemmed and sliced 8 ounces lowfat vanilla yogurt, stirred to make smooth Instructions: Preheat an oven to 425 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to mix. Add the butter pieces and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer to a mixing bowl and stir in the crystallized ginger. Make a well in the center and pour in the buttermilk and egg; mix with a fork just until mixture is moistened (do not overwork dough). With a 1/3 cup measure, scoop dough from bowl and drop onto baking sheet, setting 2 inches apart (do not flatten dough). You should have 6 portions. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes, switching pan positions halfway through if using 1 oven. Remove from oven and transfer with a spatula to baking racks to cool. (Shortcakes can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.) To serve, mix together mangoes and strawberries in a bowl. Split each shortcake with a serrated knife. Place bottom halves on each of 6 plates. Top evenly with mangoes and strawberries. Dollop with equal amounts of yogurt, then top with remaining halves of shortcakes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 41196,&quot;Lemon Bars 16 ounces store-bought angel food cake mix One 22-ounce can lemon pie filling 1 cup finely shredded coconut 8 ounces cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup butter, softened 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla Lemon zest, for garnish Instructions: Bottom Lemon Cake: In mixing bowl, combine cake mix, pie filling, and coconut.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda, then set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter with the brown sugar and granulated sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons of the vanilla extract and the eggs and blend until incorporated. Lower the speed to a stir, add the flour and mix until just combined. Then stir in 2 cups of the chocolate chips until incorporated. Drop the dough in teaspoon-size balls 2-inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cookies are golden and crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the cookies for 5 minutes in the pan and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Whip the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and the remaining 1 tablespoon vanilla until medium peaks form. Place about 1/4 cup of the whipped cream in a 9-inch circle on a cake plate and then cover the whipped cream with some cookies. Layer 1 cup whipped cream over the cookies and arrange another layer of cookies over the top. Repeat the layers three more times, finishing with a layer of cream. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over the top. Refrigerate the cake until the cookies soften, at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Slice into wedges to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 41198,&quot;Beans Meanz Fitz Extra-virgin olive oil Lemon juice Salt Black pepper, freshly ground 6 strips bacon, cut into little strips 1 1/2 pounds shelled, fresh, young broad beans 4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and left in cold water Parsley Chives 1 1/2 tins anchovy fillets Crusty bread and unsalted butter, for serving Instructions: Make a dressing with about 1/4 pint (1/2 cup) of the best olive oil, adding lemon juice and seasoning to taste: keep it quite tart.
