vinegar 1 tablespoon fish sauce 1/4 teaspoon chili paste in oil 1/2 bunch green onions, chopped Reserved fresh cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 3 cloves garlic, diced 2 shallots, diced Reserved shiitake mushroom caps Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon thyme leaves 20 wonton wrappers 1egg, beaten 1/4 cup soy sauce 3 tablespoons seasoned rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon fish sauce 1 tablespoon honey 1/2 daikon, peeled and diced Reserved enoki mushrooms 1/2 bunch green onions, sliced thin Chili oil, as desired Instructions: For the daikon broth: Place the daikon, shiitake stems, peppercorns, bay leaves, celery, carrots, cilantro stems, enoki bottoms, onions, red peppers, green onions and 12 cups cold water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, about 1 hour. Strain the liquid into a clean pot, season with salt and keep hot. For the steamed sweet potatoes with green onion vinaigrette: Fill a large pot halfway with water and place a bamboo steamer over top. Bring the water to a boil then reduce to a simmer and steam the sweet potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes.<br> Heat the oil in a small saute pan. Add the garlic and lightly fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, chili paste and green onions. Add the cilantro and toss. Spoon the green onion vinaigrette over the steamed sweet potatoes when ready to serve.<br> For the shiitake cigars: Place the butter and vegetable oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and shallots and saute until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the shiitake caps, season with salt and pepper and saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the thyme and 1/4 cup daikon broth and stir. Allow the liquid to evaporate, then remove from the heat and place on a dish to cool.<br> Place 4 cups water and the soy sauce in a wide-mouth saute pan, bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Place a wonton wrapper on a clean, dry work surface and brush with egg wash. Spoon about 1 teaspoon mushroom mixture along the bottom of a wonton. Roll the wonton over tightly, ensuring the mushroom mixture remains in the center and the wonton is sealed. Press down on the edges and then cut to trim excess wonton dough. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Place the shiitake cigars in the water-soy mixture until the wontons are cooked, about 5 minutes. Remove the shiitake cigars and reserve for the daikon soup.<br> For the daikon soup: Season the remaining daikon broth with the soy sauce, seasoned rice wine vinegar, fish sauce and honey.<br> Place 5 shiitake cigars in the bottom of each of 4 soup bowls. Divide the daikon broth among the bowls, garnish with diced daikon, the remaining enoki mushrooms and chopped green onion. Drizzle chili oil over the top. Serve with the steamed sweet potatoes and green onion vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Grenache]&quot; 53704,&quot;Teriyaki Beef Stir-Fry One 1 1/2-pound piece bottom round steak 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar<br> 1 lime, zested and juiced<br> 6 tablespoons soy sauce<br> Ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup thick teriyaki sauce<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil<br> 1 tablespoon rice vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 4 cloves garlic, cut into thin slices<br> One 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into julienne strips<br> 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips<br> 8 ounces green beans, cut in half across<br> 1 cup julienned carrots<br> 1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips<br> 4 ounces snow peas, cut in half lengthwise<br> Cooked white rice, for serving 2 scallions, sliced, for garnish<br> 2 teaspoons sesame seeds, for garnish<br> Instructions: Cut the beef into 1-by-2-by-1/4-inch strips.

Put the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave until completely melted and smooth, stirring as needed. Pour the chocolate onto the prepared baking sheet and use a small off-set spatula to smooth the chocolate into an even 1/4-inch-thick layer. Scatter the popcorn all over the melted chocolate, slightly turning some pieces so they are partially covered in chocolate. Scatter the candy pieces all over the chocolate, slightly pressing to adhere. Transfer the baking sheet to the fridge and let sit for until completely hardened, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the fridge and break into individual size pieces. Store bark in an airtight container in a cool place for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 53706,&quot;Easter Dinner on Two Sheet Pans 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3 tablespoons Parmesan 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 3/4 cup heavy cream, plus more for brushing biscuits 1 pound medium carrots, peeled<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing pan 2 small bunches thick asparagus, tough ends snapped off, bottom half of stalks peeled (about 1 1/2 pounds 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes (about 2)<br> 1 small clove garlic, minced 2 tablespoons orange marmalade 1/2 cup shredded Gruyere cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces) Three 7- to 8-ounce ham steaks, halved crosswise<br> 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 3 slices canned pineapple in heavy syrup, plus 1 teaspoon of the syrup<br> 3 maraschino cherries, halved (optional) 6 whole cloves 1 hard-boiled egg 4 lemon wedges Mustard, for serving Instructions: Position the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Make the scones. Whisk the flour, 1 tablespoon of the parmesan, the baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of the thyme, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a large bowl. Add 3/4 cup of the cream and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough just comes together. Gather the dough into a ball, transfer it to a floured surface and pat into a 1-inch-thick square. Cut into 4 equal-sized square biscuits, reshaping if necessary, and transfer to a plate to chill. Cut the carrots into 1 1/2-inch chunks on the bias, halving any larger pieces to keep them all roughly the same size.<br> Line one sheet pan with parchment paper and spread the carrots on half. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a small bowl in the microwave. Drizzle the carrots with the butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt and toss to coat. On the other side of the tray, toss the asparagus with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and some pepper and spread it evenly. Bake on the bottom rack until the vegetables are just beginning to become tender, 15 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, slice the potatoes into 1/8-inch-thick rounds with a mandoline or a vegetable slicer and place in a medium skillet with a lid. Stir the remaining 1 cup heavy cream, the garlic, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon chopped thyme, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper together in a measuring cup or bowl and pour over the potatoes. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover the pan, and lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook, stirring only occasionally, until the potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife and the cream has thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside, covered.<br> Remove the carrots from the oven and spoon the marmalade over them, stirring until completely coated. Turn the asparagus spears and return the baking sheet to the oven.<br> Butter 1/3 of the clean sheet pan. Spoon half the potato slices into an even, overlapping layer on the buttered area and sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan. Top with the remaining potato slices, spoon any remaining cream over, and sprinkle with the Gruyere and remaining tablespoon of Parmesan. Arrange the ham slices in a single overlapping layer down the center of the sheet pan, leaving an empty space for the biscuits. Mix the brown sugar and pineapple syrup together in a small bowl and heat in the microwave for 30 second increments, stirring in between until the sugar has melted. Spoon the glaze onto the ham slices and spread it with the back of a spoon to cover. Cut the pineapple rings in half and lay a piece on top of each ham slice. If using, place a maraschino cherry half in the center of each pineapple slice and pin it down with a clove. If not, pin the pineapple to the ham with the clove. Evenly space the chilled biscuits on the tray and brush the tops with cream. Place the tray on the higher rack of the oven. Cook both trays until the potatoes are brown and crusty on top, the carrots are glazed and fully cooked, the asparagus is tender and lightly browned, the scones are golden, and the ham and pineapple are warmed through, about 20 minutes.<br> To serve: Stir the carrots and grate the hard-boiled egg over the asparagus.

Add the chili powder, oregano, paprika, chipotle powder, cumin, coriander and cinnamon and stir until toasted and very aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the garlic, onions and jalape?o and cook, stirring, until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the venison and cook, stirring, until slightly brown, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, chicken stock, masa harina, sugar and chocolate. Bring to a boil and then lower to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, for the jalapeno cornbread: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Combine the cream, milk, butter, thyme and garlic in a medium pot and bring to a simmer. Add the cornmeal, whisking constantly, until thick and creamy, about 8 minutes. Add the chives, jalapeno, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then mix in the egg yolks, one by one, stirring constantly, until just combined then remove from the heat. Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold into the batter. Coat a cast-iron skillet or an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with cooking spray and pour in the batter. Bake until golden brown around the edges and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Add a pinch of salt. Cover and shake vigorously to blend. Taste for seasoning. Set aside. Fill a medium bowl halfway with ice cubes and add some cold water. Place a colander squarely inside the ice bath. The colander will keep you from having to pick the green beans out from amongst the ice cubes. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add salt until the water tastes like seawater. Add a generous pinch of sugar. Add ALL BUT A FEW OF the green beans and cook for 2 minutes. Remove them from the water with a strainer and transfer them to the colander inside the ice bath. Allow them to sit in the ice water for a couple of minutes to assure they have cooled thoroughly. Discard the blanching water. Remove the beans from the ice bath and spread them out on a kitchen towel on a flat surface. Use another kitchen towel to gently pat them dry. This step will prevent the water from diluting the flavor of the beans and the vinaigrette. Transfer to a medium bowl and season with salt. Stir to blend. Remove the garlic cloves from the vinaigrette and toss with the beans, basil leaves and olives. Cut the reserved raw beans into 1-inch pieces and toss with the other beans. Heat a large cast-iron skillet. Add the oil. When it begins to smoke lightly, sprinkle the steak with salt and use a pair of metal tongs to gingerly place the steak in the hot oil. Cook over high heat 3 to 4 minutes on each side. I count 8 to 10 minutes for medium-rare, depending on thickness. If you like your steak a little more cooked, leave it in the pan a few minutes longer on each side. Remove the steak and allow it to rest on a flat surface, 10 minutes. Slice the steak and arrange on a platter with the green bean mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 53709,&quot;d&#39;Arabian Family Protein Bars Olive oil mister or nonstick pan spray 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds 3 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut 2 tablespoons lightly packed light brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons coconut oil (if solid, microwaved until melted) 1/2 cup plain reduced-fat Greek yogurt 1/3 cup almond butter 2 tablespoons honey 1/2 cup vanilla- or chocolate-flavored whey protein powder 3 tablespoons roasted almonds, roughly chopped 1/4 cup dried cranberries Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in the cocoa. Add the boiling water and allow the mixture to boil for 30 seconds, then turn off the heat. Add the flour mixture and stir lightly to cool. In a measuring cup, whisk together the buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla and egg. Stir the buttermilk mixture into the butter/chocolate mixture. Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove the cake from the pan and let cool. For the pudding: While the cake is baking, make the pudding. In a medium pot over medium heat, add 1/2 cup sugar. Melt the sugar, swirling the pot occasionally. When the sugar gets to a medium amber color, remove from the heat. (Keep your eye on this as it can go to burnt very quickly.) Whisk together the cornstarch, salt, 1 cup milk and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Slowly and carefully stir this mixture into the hot sugar. Return the pot to medium-low heat and stir until the caramel is all melted and smooth. Whisk together the egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup milk in a small bowl and stir that into the pot.

Store refrigerated in an airtight container until ready to serve. For the onion blossom: Preheat a grill to 350 degrees F. Spay a disposable pie plate with olive oil cooking spray. Peel the onion and trim the root end to remove any hairs. Slice the pointy stem end of the onion off. Turn the onion so the root end is facing up. Leaving a 1/2-inch rim around the root, make 4 cuts into the onion, down to the stem end. This results in 4 sections of the onion. Repeating the same motion, make 3 more cuts into each section of the onion, from root to stem end. Turn the onion over to reveal 16 onion petals. Use your hands to separate the layers of petals as needed. Place the onion stem-side up in the prepared pie plate. Generously spray all of the petals with the olive oil cooking spray. Sprinkle the onion with the BBQ seasoning. Put the onion on the grill and close the grill. Roast at 350 degrees F, checking halfway, until the onion blossom has opened, 40 to 45 minutes. The petals should be tender and darkened on the ends. Carefully remove the onion from the grill.

Add the pork chops, cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, turning once halfway through. This may seem like a long time, but these are seriously big pork chops. Brining will make your pork so tender and flavor it throughout. For the smashed potatoes: Place the potatoes in large pot and cover with salted cold water. The potatoes will soak up that salt like pasta and it will make a big difference in flavor. Cover and bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes, and return them to the same pot, allowing them to dry. Melt the butter with the half-and-half in a small saucepot over low heat. Add to the potatoes along with the cream cheese and season with salt and pepper. Smash with a potato masher and set aside, keeping warm until ready to serve.<br> For the mushroom escabeche: Heat the canola oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the mushrooms and saute until lightly browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, remove from the heat and reserve. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepot over medium heat and saute the garlic and shallots until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vinegar, sugar, chili flakes and lemon zest and juice. Bring to a simmer and then turn off the heat. Return the reserved mushrooms to the pot, toss to combine and absorb all of that flavor. Garnish with parsley.<br> For preparing the pork chops: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a grill pan over high heat. Remove the chops from the brine and dry completely with paper towels. Drizzle with canola oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place the chops on the grill and sear until browned, 5 to 6 minutes on each side.

For the cake: Put the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar in a large mixing bowl and, with an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale yellow, thick and has tripled in volume, about 8 minutes. Sift the cocoa, flour and baking powder together in another large mixing bowl. Add the egg mixture and fold to mix thoroughly. Grease 2 (9 by 2-inch) round cake pans with the butter. Sprinkle each with a tablespoon of the remaining sugar. Pour the cake batter evenly into the pans and bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 25 minutes. Let cool for about 2 minutes. Using a thin knife, loosen the edges of the cakes and flip onto a wire rack. Let cool completely. Sift together the confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa powder into a medium-size bowl. Add the butter and mix with an electric mixer until incorporated. Add the vanilla and boiling water and mix until smooth. Let cool. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the cream and the chocolate. On medium speed. Whip until stiff peaks form, set aside. To assemble the cake: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place a wire rack over it. Using a serrated knife, cut each cake in half horizontally. Brush the tops of three of the layers with 1/4 cup of the simple syrup. Place the bottom layer on a 9-inch round of cardboard and set it on the wire rack. Spread 3/4 cup of the mousse evenly on top of the cake. Top with a second layer of cake. Spread another 3/4 cup of the mousse over the top of the cake. Repeat the same process with the third layer. Top with the fourth layer. If necessary, shave off any uneven pieces of the cake with a serrated knife so that it is smooth and even on all sides. Chill for 2 hours. Spread the frosting evenly over the sides and top of the cake. Refrigerate until the frosting sets. Place the chocolate curls on top of the cake. Slice and serve with the ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Zinfandel]&quot; 53734,&quot;Cream Puffs 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 large eggs, plus 1 egg yolk 1 cup diced strawberries or whole raspberries Chocolate Whipped Cream, recipe follows 2 cups cold heavy cream 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped Instructions: Make the cream puffs: In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, granulated sugar, salt and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove the pan from the heat and sift the flour directly into the pan. Stir the mixture into a paste with a wooden spoon. Return the pan to a medium heat. Stir the mixture until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and is slightly shiny, about 3 minutes. Transfer the paste to a medium bowl, and beat with a wooden spoon until slightly cooled, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the 3 eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one thoroughly before adding the next. Before adding the third egg, beat it in a small bowl. Adding it by tablespoons to the mixture, just until the batter is smooth and tight. If the batter starts to get loose, do not add all of the last egg. Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Fill a large pastry bag, fitted with an open tip, with the cream puff mixture. Pipe twelve 2 1/2-inch circular mounds, about 2 inches apart, onto the prepared pan. (Alternately, use a large spoon to form the dough into the mounds.) Dab the tops of each puff with a fingertip dipped in water to smooth the tops. Beat the egg yolk with a tablespoon of water and brush the surface of the puffs with the beaten yolk. Bake in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F; continue baking until golden brown and the puffs are light, airy, and crisp, about 30 to 35 minutes more. Cool on a rack. Assemble the cream puffs: Cut the puffs in half with a serrated knife, and set the tops aside. (If the puffs are very moist inside, scoop out the excess dough and re-crisp them in a 350 degree F. oven for about 5 minutes. Cool completely before continuing.) Put a heaping tablespoon of the fruit in the bottom halves of the cream puffs. Pipe or spoon about 1/3 cup of the Chocolate Whipped Cream on top. Replace the puff tops. Refrigerate for up to 3 hours or serve immediately. Yield: 12 cream puffs Beat the cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer or a whisk, until it begins to hold a loose peak. Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into the cream. Continue beating until the cream holds a firm but still soft peak. Set aside. Put the chocolate in a clean, medium, microwaveable bowl. Melt the chocolate in the microwave, at half power, at 30 second intervals, until softened and warm. Whisk until smooth and liquid. (Alternatively melt the chocolate in a double boiler.) Fold about 1/2 cup of the whipped cream into the warm chocolate to lighten it. Add the lightened chocolate mixture back to the remaining whipped cream, folding until completely blended. Store in an airtight container until ready to use. It&#39;s best used the same day it is prepared.

Stir in the olive oil to make a loose paste. Add the pork and toss to completely coat. Let sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours or refrigerate overnight. Make the romesco sauce: Coat a skillet with the olive oil, place over medium heat and add the garlic and red pepper flakes. When the garlic starts to turn golden, add the tomato and piquillo peppers. Season with salt and cook until the tomato is soft and mushy, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat; let cool. Preheat a grill to medium. Grill the bread on both sides until toasted. Let cool; cut into cubes. Pulse the almonds and bread cubes in a food processor to form a coarse paste. Add the cooked tomato mixture and toss in the saffron, vinegar and parsley. Pulse to puree. Taste and season with salt, if needed. Add a couple tablespoons of olive oil or water if the mixture is really thick. Skewer the pork to make kebabs, putting 4 or 5 pieces of meat on each skewer. It&#39;s OK if the meat is touching, but do it loosely so the heat reaches all sides of the meat and the pork cooks evenly. Brush the grill with a wire brush and then rub down with an oiled paper towel. Grill the skewers on all sides so each side gets nice and brown (brown food tastes good), 5 to 8 minutes total. Transfer the kebabs to a platter and let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with the romesco sauce.

Arrange the almonds on a flat surface and coarsely chop them with a large knife. Set aside. In a medium metal bowl, combine the chocolates. Create a makeshift double boiler by filling a pot that will hold the bowl snugly with about 2 inches of water. (The bowl should not touch the water.) Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat so that the water is simmering. Set the bowl of chocolate over the pot, stirring with a heatproof spatula from time to time, until the chocolate is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. In a small pan, simmer the honey over medium heat until it bubbles, froths and turns amber brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and gently stir the honey into the chocolate. Use a strainer or sifter to sift the powdered sugar over the chocolate-honey mixture and stir it in, along with the almonds, rum and vanilla, until smooth. Place the sprinkles in a cookie tin or container with a fitted lid. Roll the chocolate mixture into small balls (about 1 1/2 inches) and arrange on a baking sheet. Spill the sprinkles over the chocolates and press the sprinkles into the exterior of each to make them stick. When all are rolled, sprinkle them with salt and store them in the container nestled in the remaining sprinkles.

Divide the pasta evenly into bowls and top each with some scallops.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 53765,&quot;Pot of Gold Cake Nonstick cooking spray 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/3 cups sugar 4 large egg yolks, at room temperature (use the whites for the frosting) 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/3 cups whole milk 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup golden syrup or honey 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 sticks plus 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and slightly softened 1 to 1 1/2 cups golden M&amp;M&#39;s 1 small container edible gold luster dust (available at craft stores or online) Instructions: Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray; line the bottoms with parchment paper. Coat the parchment with cooking spray and dust the bottom and side of each pan with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; add the egg yolks one at a time, making sure each is incorporated before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk in 2 batches, until just incorporated. (It&#39;s OK if the batter looks curdled.) Increase the speed to medium and beat 1 more minute. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and spread evenly. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the tops are golden and spring back when lightly pressed, about 40 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes in the pans, then run a knife around the sides of the pans to loosen. Turn out onto a rack to cool completely; discard the parchment. Make the frosting: Bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk the egg whites, sugar and golden syrup in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set the bowl over the saucepan; cook, whisking, until the sugar dissolves, the egg whites become frothy and the mixture is warm, about 5 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form. Switch to the paddle attachment. Beat in the vanilla, then beat in the butter a few pieces at a time until smooth. (It&#39;s OK if the frosting looks separated; keep beating.) Cut a 3 1/2-inch hole from the center of one cake layer with a paring knife; set the cake layer and the cutout aside. Score a 3 1/2-inch circle in the center of the other cake layer, then scoop out the middle without going all the way to the bottom; carefully transfer the cake to a serving plate. Spread the top of the scooped-out cake (but not inside the hole) with 1 cup frosting. Top with the other cake layer and pour the M&amp;M&#39;s into the hole. Slicing horizontally, cut off the top 1/2 inch from the reserved cutout to make a thin round; place on top of the candies to form a lid. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Refrigerate until just firm, about 20 minutes. Dip a small dry brush in luster dust; tap and brush all over the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53766,&quot;Raspberry Rose-Filled Donuts 1/2 cup warm milk (105 to 110 degrees F) 1/4 cup warm water (105 to 110 degrees F) 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon sugar 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Zest of 1/2 orange 1 large egg plus 2 yolks, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature Canola or vegetable oil, for the bowl and frying 1 cup raspberry jam 1/2 tablespoon rose water, or to taste 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, plus more if needed 2 tablespoons whole milk, plus more if needed 1 teaspoon vanilla extract A pinch of kosher salt 1/4 cup food-quality dried rose petals Instructions: For the dough: In a medium bowl, combine the milk, water, yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar and give it a little stir. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until it becomes foamy on top. Meanwhile, in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together the flour, salt, cardamom, cinnamon, orange zest and remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Add the eggs, vanilla and yeast mixture and mix to form a very very stiff dough. It will seem like the dry ingredients aren&#39;t all going to get incorporated, but try as best you can. Knead for a few minutes and then with the mixer on, begin gradually adding the butter, tablespoon by tablespoon. This, too, will seem like it isn&#39;t going to incorporate into the dough, but keep on mixing for 8 to 10 minutes more, scraping down the dough hook occasionally, until your dough is smooth and slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature (or in the fridge, see notes) until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours.<br> Turn the dough out onto a work surface and roll it out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out 2 1/2-inch circles and transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment. When re-rolling scraps, first press them together and then allow the dough to sit for about 10 minutes before proceeding. Cover the circles with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rise for another hour, until doubled.<br> In a large heavy pot fitted with a thermometer, heat 3 to 4 inches oil to 350 degrees F. Fry the donuts in batches of 3 or 4, for 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. For the filling: Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the jam and rosewater. Taste and adjust as desired. Fill a squeeze bottle or piping bag with the jam.<br> For the glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, vanilla and salt until smooth. It should be the consistency of a slightly thicker glue; if it&#39;s too thick, add a little more milk, and if it&#39;s too thin, add a little more powdered sugar. Dip the cooled donuts into the glaze and let any excess drip off (if the glaze has a hard time sticking to the donuts, that means it&#39;s too thick and that you should add more milk). Stick the squeeze bottle straight down into the center of each donut, wiggle it around to make space and fill up with jam. Top with a sprinkle of pistachios and rose petals and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53767,&quot;Healthy and Flavor-Filled Soba Salad Salt 8 ounces soba, or whole-wheat linguine or spaghetti 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons rice vinegar or sherry vinegar 2 large cloves garlic, finely grated or minced One 2-inch piece ginger, peeled and finely grated 1 Fresno cl or red finger cl, finely chopped 1/3 cup olive oil or vegetable oil 1/4 pound cabbage, very thinly sliced 1 cup shelled edamame, thawed if frozen 1 small bunch scallions, very thinly sliced on an angle 3 tablespoons black sesame seeds or toasted sesame seeds Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until al dente, then drain. Meanwhile, combine the honey, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, ginger and cl in a large bowl, then whisk in the oil. Add the cabbage, edamame, scallions and noodles, and toss to combine.

Rub it with the salt and place it in a baking dish just large enough to hold it. In a blender or a food processor, combine the orange juice, olive oil, brown sugar, and shallots. Process until the shallots are finely minced. Pour the orange juice mixture over the chicken, crumble the bay leaf over the top, and cover the whole dish tightly with plastic wrap. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight, spooning the marinade over the chicken occasionally. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Transfer the chicken to a rack in a roasting pan, breast side down and reserve the marinade and add 1/2 cup water. Roast the chicken for 40 minutes, then turn to the other side and roast for 40 minutes more. As soon as you put the chicken in to roast, prepare the papaya glaze: strain the orange juice marinade into a food processor, discarding the solids, and add the mustard, garlic, halved papaya, thyme, salt, and pepper. Process the mixture for 10 to 20 seconds, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until smooth. Divide the glaze into halves and use half of it to baste the chicken as it roasts, basting thoroughly every 20 minutes or so. When the chicken is cooked through with no trace of pink remaining, remove it to a warmed serving platter and set aside at the back of the stove. Discard all the fat from the roasting pan, saving the pan drippings. Scrape the drippings into a small saucepan and place it over medium heat. Whisk in the butter, then add the remaining half of the papaya glaze and simmer the sauce for 4 minutes. Garnish the platter with the parsley and watercress sprigs and the remaining half papaya, cut into long strips. Drizzle a little of the sauce over the top. Serve at once, passing the remaining sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 53769,&quot;Easy Citrus Tart 14 whole graham crackers 2 tablespoons sugar 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 batch curd<br> Whipped cream, for topping 1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest, plus 1/2 cup lemon juice (from 2 to 3 lemons) Pinch of salt 3 large eggs plus 3 egg yolks 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces Instructions: Make the curd: Whisk the sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice and salt in a medium saucepan. Whisk the whole eggs and yolks in a small bowl, then whisk into the lemon mixture. Cook the mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it&#39;s thick like pudding, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter a few pieces at a time until incorporated. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pushing it through with a rubber spatula. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely set, at least 4 hours and up to 5 days. Make the tart: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Break the graham crackers into pieces, then pulse in a food processor with the sugar until finely ground; drizzle in the melted butter and pulse to combine. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1 inch up the side of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake until golden, about 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Pour the curd into the prepared crust and gently press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours. Remove the springform ring and transfer the tart to a platter.

Grind to a fine powder and set aside. Rinse the calamari tubes under cool water and pat dry. Split the bodies from top to bottom so you have 2 triangular pieces from each. Put the calamari, lobster, and prawns on a platter and drizzle with a nice dose of olive oil so the seafood is well coated; season with a fair amount of salt and pepper. Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill and get it very hot. Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel then carefully and quickly wipe the ridges of the grill pan or the hot grates of the grill. Place the lobster on the grill, shell-side up, and cook for 5 minutes until the shell begins to turn reddish-orange. Turn the lobster tails over and lay the calamari, prawns, green onions, and limes (cut side-down) on the grill too until everything is slightly charred. Grill the calamari for 2 minutes per side, and no longer, otherwise they will get rubbery. Put the grilled mixed seafood and green onions on a large platter and sprinkle a little of the spice mix all over.

First, have fun. Second, the bigger the mold, the thicker the layer of chocolate.<br> For the Base: There are a few options for making a chocolate base. If you have a plastic deli tray, you can pour a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate onto it. Allow it to set. When it hardens, the chocolate will retract from the sides. Simply overturn the tray being careful to support the chocolate. Remember, the chocolate base will assume any pattern that exists on the tray. Make sure the tray is big enough for the bottom of your mold. If you do not have a tray, simply use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate onto a sheet of parchment paper, being sure to spread it all the way to the edges. Lift the chocolate-covered paper by its corners and move it to a clean space on your work surface. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate should be firm enough to cut but it will not be hard. Using the tip of a sharp paring knife or an X-acto knife, cut a straight edge and cut a base that is large enough to hold the mold.<br> For the Support Pole: Roll a piece of parchment paper into a tube. The thickness of the tube will be determined by the size of your body mold. This piece will support the body so make sure it is long and thick enough to hold it. Set the tube on end and fill it with white chocolate. Allow this to set until hard. Pull the parchment paper with the chocolate inside out of the tube. Use white chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the body against it.<br> For the Body: Start by drizzling both white and bittersweet chocolate in the mold. Dip your clean, dry fingers in the bowl of bittersweet chocolate and use them to spread the chocolate over the drizzles to create a marbled effect. Dipping your fingers in chocolate adds a thin layer of chocolate to the mold, which makes it easier to create the marble pattern. When the mold is marbleized, fill it with white chocolate. Pour excess chocolate back into the bowl. Place the bust upside down on a wire rack over parchment paper. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip clean with a paring knife. Allow to harden. Using a paintbrush, paint another layer of white chocolate. Allow to harden and repeat until the chocolate is thick enough to support the structure. The inside of the bust should be evenly coated with chocolate. You will be able to see that the chocolate is ready to be unmolded when it automatically pulls away from the sides of the mold. (continued) If the chocolate is properly tempered, it will easily release from the mold. To unmold, rest your thumbs on the outside, place your first two fingers on the inside and gently begin to lift the mold from the chocolate. Do not press or pull too hard or you will break the chocolate. You will need to apply this lifting pressure to all four sides to loosen the chocolate from the mold. Use more chocolate to glue the mold onto the base.<br> For the Face: Mix some red food coloring powder into a some of the melted cocoa butter. Using a small paint brush, paint the lips on the inside of the mask. Use other colors to paint the eyes, cheeks, eyebrows and any other features you desire. Allow the colors to set briefly. Use the same techniques for filling the inside of the mask as for filling the bust, except use only white chocolate. Let set and unmold. Use chocolate to \glue\ the mask onto the body.<br> For the Hair: Start by drizzling both white and bittersweet chocolate onto parchment paper. Dip your clean, dry fingers in the bowl of white chocolate and use them to spread the chocolate over the drizzles to create a marbled effect. Dipping your fingers in chocolate adds a thin layer of chocolate to the parchment, which makes it easier to create the marble pattern. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate will be firm enough to cut but it will not be hard. Use the tip of a sharp paring knife to cut lengths of chocolate to represent hair. Use tempered chocolate to \glue\ the strips onto the mask.<br> Apply the fruit jewels by \glueing\ them with chocolate onto the model. Fruit jewels can be used as a necklace and earrings. Use toothpicks to secure the earrings to the head. Place the applesauce, apricots, and sugar into a non-reactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Mix together, then add the raspberries. The raspberries will dominate the flavor. If you want apricot-flavored Pate de Fruit, omit the raspberries. Using a hand-held immersion blender or whisk, combine all of the ingredients until smooth and homogenous. As the mixture cooks, the natural pectin in the fruit will cause the mixture to thicken. Continue to cook until it is thick, mixing constantly. To test for the correct consistency, dip a whisk in the mixture and hold horizontally in front of you. Watch as the mixture drips off the whisk and back into the pan. If the mixture stays on the whisk and beads up into small balls, like pearls, it is ready. If it drips back into the pan in thin strands, it needs to be cooked a little longer.<br> When the mixture is a bit thicker than jam, pour it into a spouted container. Fill either a half-dome or triangle shaped flexipan, depending on the desired design of the jewels and let rest for 4 hours at room temperature. When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar. If you do not have a flexipan, you can pour the Pate de Fruit into a 10-inch bottomless tart mold or cake ring placed on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Let the Pate de Fruit cool and set, about 3 hours at room temperature. When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar. To unmold, run a sharp paring knife between the fruit and the mold and lift off the mold. (At this point the Pate de Fruit can be stored, well wrapped in plastic and in an airtight container, for up to 2 months.) Sprinkle the top of the Pate de Fruit with a thin layer of sugar and flip it onto another sheet of parchment paper. Remove the parchment that is now on top. Sprinkle this side with more sugar. Using a wet chef&#39;s knife or cutter, cut the Pate de Fruit into any shapes. Roll each piece completely in sugar and serve. Do not store in the refrigerator, as the humidity will make the sugar melt. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]&quot; 53780,&quot;Fig and Almond Tart 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick (1/2 cup) cold, unsalted butter, cut into bits 4 tablespoons ice water 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 6 tablespoons sugar 1 large egg, beaten lightly 2/3 cup finely ground blanched almonds 1/2 teaspoon vanilla Pinch ground cinnamon Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 pound figs, stemmed and quartered 1 1/2 cups dry red wine 3 figs, stemmed and quartered 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1 cinnamon stick Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. To make the dough, combine flour, sugar, salt and butter in a bowl with your hands until it resembles a coarse meal. In a separate small bowl combine the ice water and vanilla and add it to the flour mixture and combine until the dough forms a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate it for 30 minutes. On a lightly floured board roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick and large enough to fit into a 9-inch tart pan. Trim the edges and prick the bottom of the dough with a fork. Line the crust with parchment paper and weigh it down with dry beans. Bake the dough in the oven for 20 minutes and then remove. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees. In an electric mixing bowl beat softened butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the beaten egg and combine. Stir in almonds, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spoon the mixture into the baked tart shell and top with the quartered figs. Bake the tart for 25 minutes or until golden brown. To make the sauce, in a saucepan combine the red wine, figs, sugar and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil and simmer until the wine is reduced by half. Remove the cinnamon stick and transfer the sauce to a blender and puree. Strain into a saucepan and simmer until lightly thickened. Let cool 1 to 2 minutes. Brush the sauce over the tart and serve with more sauce on the side.

Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, cut through the top shell lengthwise. Cut a slit through the meat lengthwise taking care not to cut through the bottom shell. Gently pull the shells apart. Thread a skewer, starting at the underside base of the tail, along the inside of the bottom shell. Brush the meat with 1/4 cup of the clarified butter. Wrap the lobster tails in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until the lobster meat is opaque. Place the remaining clarified butter in a butter warmer or dipping bowl. Remove the meat from the lobster shells and dip in the Clarified Butter. In a small, heavy bottomed saucepan, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Pour the mixture into a 2-cup glass measuring jug. Let the melted butter stand for 5 minutes. Using a spoon, remove the foam from the top of the butter. Place the lemon zest in small bowl. Pour the clarified butter over the lemon zest and discard the milk solids left in the bottom of the jug.

Trim 1/4 inch from the stem ends of the broccoli rabe (as they can be dried out) and discard. Add 1 tablespoon salt and the trimmed broccoli rabe to the boiling water. Boil until the stems are tender when pierced with a knife, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove with tongs to a colander to drain. When cool enough to handle, press out as much excess water as possible from the broccoli rabe, and then chop into 1- to 2-inch pieces. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Quarter the potatoes and slice the garlic into thin slivers. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the potatoes, cut-side down, and cook until browned, about 4 minutes. Turn with tongs or a slotted spoon to the other cut side and cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Lower the heat to medium, add the garlic and stir until it softens a bit, about 1 minute. Stir in the paprika until the potatoes are coated, about 30 seconds more. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the reserved cooking water and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook the potatoes until tender when pierced with a knife, about 5 more minutes. If there is still a lot of water in the skillet, uncover, increase the heat and reduce until only 2 to 3 tablespoons remain, enough to coat the broccoli rabe. Add the chopped broccoli rabe to the skillet and toss to coat. Drizzle with a generous amount of olive oil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 53784,&quot;Fruit Cobbler 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups oatmeal 2 cups brown sugar 1 cup butter or margarine 4 cups your favorite fruit, cut into pieces if necessary Instructions: Preheat a grill.

Add enough salt so the water tastes as briny as sea water. Bring to boil and cook until completely tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 40 to 50 minutes. (If you&#39;re in a hurry, you can quarter the potatoes and boil about 20 minutes.) Drain the potatoes. Once cool enough to handle, peel and mash the potatoes in a large steel or glass mixing bowl. I find it easier to get an even mash by coarsely grating the potatoes. Add the ghee, chiles, cilantro, 1 cup of the flour and 1 teaspoon salt and mix well to form a soft dough. Add more flour as needed to form a dough, but be careful and add a little at a time as you cannot add any water to this recipe. Divide the dough into about 15 balls. Heat a nonstick skillet or seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Keep a bowl of flour nearby. Dab each dough ball in flour, flatten to look like a patty and then dip in flour again. Roll each patty into a thin round on a generously floured surface. The potato in the dough makes it extremely sticky and you will need to use the flour as you roll. Add 1/2 teaspoon of oil to the skillet, then add a roti. Cook until light brown spots appear on each side, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining roti and additional oil. In India, we put the rotis in an insulated chapati box or insulated casserole dish to keep warm as we go.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Fit a large pastry bag with a plain 1/3-inch diameter round pastry tip. Combine the egg whites, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer set over a pan of simmering water over medium heat. Whisk constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is too warm to comfortably hold your finger in it for more than a couple of seconds, about 1 1/2 minutes. (The mixture should feel completely smooth when rubbed between your fingertips and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the whites should read 140 degrees F.) Attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Starting on low and gradually increasing to medium-high speed, whisk until stiff peaks form. Continue mixing until the mixture is fluffy, glossy and only slightly warm to the touch, about 4 minutes. Fill the prepared pastry bag with the meringue. On the lined baking sheet, pipe a 1 1/3-inch dollop for the snowman&#39;s base, then pipe a smaller mound on top and then another smaller mound on top of that to form the base, torso and head of the snowman, lifting the tip at the end to leave a peak of meringue on the head (this will be the snowman&#39;s hat). Pipe about forty snowmen in this manner, leaving at least 1 inch between them. Bake until the snowmen are dry enough to easily release from the parchment, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn off the oven and let the snowmen sit inside it for another 3 hours or overnight to dry completely. Fit a small pastry bag with a #1 or #2 plain pastry tip. Place the chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, until just melted. Dip the tips of the snowmen&#39;s heads in the chocolate to form chocolate \hats. Transfer the remaining chocolate to the pastry bag, and pipe faces and buttons on the snowmen. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53802,&quot;Grits and Sausage Casserole 1/2 pound turkey breakfast sausage 1 1/2 cups 1-percent milk 1 1/2 cups water 3/4 cup quick-cooking grits 3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded reduced-fat sharp cheddar 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/8 teaspoon black pepper Dash of ground red pepper 3 egg whites, room temperature Vegetable cooking spray 2 cups red bell pepper strips Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yogurt; mix until wet clumps form. Slowly add the milk and, using your hands, work the milk into the flour mixture until a smooth dough forms. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let rest 2 to 3 hours, or wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (the longer the dough rests, the softer the naan will be). Heat a griddle or large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and form into balls. Flatten each ball into a disk and dust with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll each disk into a 1/4-inch-thick oval. Brush the tops with water. Transfer the disks to the griddle, water-side down (do this in batches, if necessary). Using foil or an upside-down stainless-steel bowl, cover the naan and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, hold each piece of naan over the flame of a gas burner, turning and rotating often, until cooked through and charred in spots, about 20 seconds per side. (If you don\u2019t have a gas stove, char the naan under the broiler.)

Enjoy!!! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 53819,&quot;Caramel-Dipped Fruit 1/2 cup water 2 1/4 cups granulated sugar 2/3 cup light corn syrup Fresh fruit Instructions: Place the water, sugar, and corn syrup in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. The corn syrup will make the cooked sugar harder and crunchier; it will also help prevent the cooked sugar from melting as quickly when it reacts to the humidity in the air. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture to 311 degrees F (155 degrees C), what is known as the hard crack stage. Stir the sugar slowly as it cooks to ensure that it cooks evenly. If you do not stir it, the mixture will develop hot spots and the sugar will cook faster in those spots. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks, or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Remove the cooked sugar from the heat and pour it into a medium-size heatproof glass bowl. The glass bowl will hold the temperature and stop the cooking process. It will also allow you to reheat the sugar in the microwave if necessary. If you leave he sugar in the saucepan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown. Occasionally stir the hot sugar to keep it from darkening due to the residual heat. Stirring also helps to keep its temperature even. I put a towel under the bowl to keep it from tipping and to protect my hands from the heat of the glass. Peel, core or pit, and halve the fruit as necessary. Use a sharp knife to slice the fruit into small pieces. (This is not necessary for berries or grapes.) Arrange the fruit on toothpicks or small skewers in any combination you like. Leave enough room at one end of the toothpick or skewer so you will be able to hold it as you dip it in the hot sugar. Dip each toothpick in the hot sugar, coating the fruits completely. Wipe the toothpick against the rim of the bowl to remove any excess sugar and place on a sheet of parchment paper. Repeat until all of the fruit has been dipped. The fruit skewers should release easily from the parchment paper as soon as they cool. You can arrange them on a plate or use your imagination to make a fruit skewer centerpiece. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 53820,&quot;Three Cheese Fondue 4 oz Havarti cheese, shredded (1 cup) 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese (4 oz) 1 cup shredded American cheese (4 oz) 3 tablespoons Gold Medal? all-purpose flour 1 cup dry white wine 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 6 cups French bread cubes Instructions: In medium bowl, toss cheeses and flour to mix.

Put the sweet potatoes on a small roasting pan and bake until easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile make the dough: Pulse the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor with the metal blade until combined. Add the shortening and pulse about 10 times. Add the butter and continue to pulse until it resembles cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter. Beat the egg yolk and vinegar together, add and pulse 3 to 4 times, but don&#39;t let the dough form a ball in the machine. Remove the blade, and gather the dough together by hand. If dough does not come together, sprinkle up to 1 tablespoon of ice cold water over the dough and bring together. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and shape into disk. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. (To make the dough by hand, see below.) Peel the cooked sweet potatoes and mash lightly with a fork; you should have about 2 cups puree. Mix the sweet potatoes and butter in the food processor until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and pulse to combine. Set aside. Lightly dust the counter with flour. Roll the dough into an 11 to 12-inch circle and transfer to the pie pan. Trim the dough so that the edges hang about 1/2 inch over the pan; fold edges under and flute as desired. (See how to). Pierce the crust all over with a fork, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes or up to a day. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven of the 425 degree F oven. Line the crust with foil or parchment paper and pie weights or dried beans and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the crust sets and begins to brown around edges, about 25 minutes. Lift foil and weights out of crust, lower oven temperature to 375 degrees F. and continue to bake until crust begins to brown on the bottom, about 10 to 12 minutes more. Pour filling into the warm crust and bake until set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on rack When ready to serve, whip the cream with the whiskey until it holds soft peaks. Top pie with whipped cream and candied pecans. Serve. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly beat the egg white until frothy. Whisk in the sugar and cinnamon, and then toss pecans in the mixture. Evenly spread nuts on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until dry and toasted, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 53828,&quot;Homemade Noodle Cups 8 ounces fresh ramen noodles 6 tablespoons white miso paste 1/4 cup soy sauce<br> 2 tablespoons sesame oil<br> 2 tablespoons sriracha<br> 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger 1 jalapeno, thinly sliced<br> 4 scallions, cut on a bias into 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup sugar snap peas cut on a bias<br> 3/4 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped<br> 3/4 cup fresh Thai basil, torn (regular basil will do, too!)<br> 1 lime, cut into wedges, for serving Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

Butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan; line the bottom with parchment paper. Butter the parchment and dust the bottom and sides with cake flour, tapping out the excess. Microwave the semisweet chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth; let cool. Meanwhile, sift the cake flour and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until light, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the 6 egg yolks, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the melted chocolate. Add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Beat the 4 egg whites in a separate large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until frothy, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar. Increase the speed to high and beat until the egg whites are stiff and glossy, about 1 more minute. Working in two batches, fold the egg whites into the batter with a rubber spatula until just combined. Spread the batter in the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes, then remove the springform ring and let the cake cool completely. Remove the cake from the bottom of the pan and cut in half horizontally using a long serrated knife. Make the filling: Combine 1/2 cup apricot jam, the granulated sugar and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring, until the jam melts; strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl and stir in the rum. Gradually brush about two-thirds of the syrup on the cut sides of the cake, allowing it to soak in. Remove any large pieces of fruit from the remaining 1/2 cup apricot jam; spread over the cut side of the bottom cake half and top with the remaining cake half, cut-side down. Brush the top and sides of the cake with the remaining syrup, allowing it to soak in. Make the glaze: Combine the corn syrup and water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring to combine. Remove from the heat and add the bittersweet chocolate; stir until melted and smooth. Transfer the cake to a rack set over a baking sheet. Working in two or three batches, pour the glaze over the cake, allowing the excess to drip down the sides. Smooth the glaze with an offset spatula if needed. Refrigerate until the glaze is set, about 30 minutes. Serve with whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 53830,&quot;Flavorful Tofu Tostada One 14-ounce package extra-firm tofu 1 clove garlic, grated<br> 1 teaspoon sesame oil<br> 1/3 cup soy sauce<br> 1/3 cup orange juice<br> 3 limes<br> 1/4 cup sour cream<br> 1 tablespoon sriracha hot sauce 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 8 corn tortillas<br> 1/4 head red cabbage, thinly sliced<br> 4 cups baby spinach<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Pat the tofu dry with a paper towel and then cut into 1/2-inch cubes. In a large bowl, combine the tofu cubes, garlic, sesame oil, soy sauce, orange juice and the juice of 2 limes. Give it a good stir, then cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or as long as overnight. Mix together the sour cream, sriracha and the juice of 1 lime in a small mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat the vegetable oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Fry the tortillas in batches of two until lightly crispy but still tender on the inside, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. Remove the tofu from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. In the same pan the tortillas were cooked in, sear the tofu over medium-high heat until browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate. Add the cabbage to the pan and saute until wilted, 3 minutes. Add the spinach and saute until wilted, another 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread each tortilla with a spoonful of the sour cream mixture. Top with the spinach and cabbage and 4 or 5 crispy tofu cubes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 53831,&quot;Roasted Butternut Squash, Sauteed Apples and Toasted Walnut Crepes with Cinnamon Gelato 1 1/2 cups medium-diced butternut squash Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 2 to 3 tablespoons butter 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled and medium diced 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup bourbon 1/2 cup apple cider 1/2 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped Basic Crepes, recipe follows Cinnamon Gelato, recipe follows Powdered sugar, for dusting 1 cup all-purpose flour Pinch kosher salt 2 eggs 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup club soda 3 tablespoons melted butter, plus 3 tablespoons for cooking the crepes 2 1/2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3 cinnamon sticks 6 egg yolks Instructions: For the filling: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the butternut squash with some olive oil and salt. Place onto a baking sheet and into the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Put a saute pan over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Add the apples and salt to taste, and saute until softened. Hit it with the brown sugar and toss until melted. Hit it with the bourbon off the flame, and then carefully tip the pan to the flame to flambe and let the alcohol burn off. Add the apple cider and bring back to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until glazy and delicious, about 10 minutes. Toss in the roasted butternut squash and half of the chopped walnuts. To assemble: Add about 1/4 cup of the filling into the bottom third of a crepe. Roll the crepe and place seam-side down on a plate. Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients. To serve: Arrange 1 crepe roll on each serving plate and spoon more butternut squash and apple filling over the top. Garnish with toasted walnuts and serve with Cinnamon Gelato. Dust with powdered sugar. For the batter: In a mixing bowl, add the flour and salt and make a well in the center. Add the eggs, milk and club soda into the center of the well and whisk together until just combined. The mixture should be like VERY loose pancake batter. If the mixture is a little thick, whisk in a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using. The crepe batter can be made up to 2 days in advance, covered and refrigerated. For the crepes: Melt about 1/2 teaspoon of the butter in a small nonstick saute pan. The butter should coat the bottom of the pan; if there is a lot of excess, wipe it out with a paper towel. Keep the paper towel handy in case you need it again (you will). Put the pan over medium heat. Fill a 2-ounce ladle almost to the top with batter and pour it into the preheated pan, tipping and rolling the pan as you ladle the batter to evenly cover the bottom. This will take a little practice; even when you are an experienced crepe maker, the first couple always get wasted. Accept it and move on. When the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bottom begins to brown a little, flip the crepe over and cook it for about 1 minute on the other side. Remove the crepe from the pan to a plate and let cool. Stack the crepes as they are cooked between parchment paper squares. Repeat this process until all the batter is used, wiping the pan with your paper towel or melting a little more butter to the pan as needed. In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, 1/4 cup of the sugar, the vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil, turn off the heat and let sit. In a small bowl, combine the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat to a homogeneous consistency. Bring the heavy cream-cinnamon mixture back to a boil and turn the heat off. Whisk a third of the heavy cream mixture into the egg-sugar mixture, and then immediately whisk the egg mixture back into the remaining heavy cream mixture. Bring the mixture back up over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Strain the mixture and chill over an ice water bath. Churn the chilled mixture in an ice cream/gelato machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53832,&quot;Sweet Corn, Jicama, and Baby Spinach Salad with Tequila Lime Dressing 6 ears of corn 2 jicama 1 red pepper, finely diced 1 yellow pepper, finely diced 3 baby spinach 2 tablespoons pine nuts Juice of 3 limes 2 tablespoons tequila 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar 1/2 cup olive oil 1 pinch cumin 1 pinch cayenne Instructions: Cook corn in salted water until tender.

Set aside for 10 minutes to allow the mixture to macerate and the sugar to dissolve. Meanwhile, place a small plate in the freezer to chill; this will be used to test the doneness of the jam. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat. (See Cook&#39;s Note for flavor additions.) Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium low, stirring frequently. Continue to cook until the jam becomes thick and syrupy, about 1 1/2 hours. To test doneness, place a small amount of the jam onto the chilled plate and freeze for 2 minutes. Drag your finger or spoon through the jam. If the jam holds its shape and thickness, remove from the heat. If it&#39;s runny, continue to cook and test again in 5-minute increments.

Pat the pork dry of any juices and generously season with salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Place the pork in the pot and brown well on all sides. Remove the pork and reduce heat to medium, add the onion, carrot, celery, fennel, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Cook to soften the vegetables, about 10 minutes, then deglaze the pot with the wine, scraping up the bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add the chicken stock and stir, slide the pork back into the pot and bring liquids to low boil. Cover the pot and place in the oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, turning the meat 1/2 way through cooking. Keep the pork in the oven until the meat is tender and falls apart when pulled at with a fork. Remove the pork from the pot, place on a platter, and when cool enough to handle, pull the meat apart with 2 forks, divide the meat and reserve one half. Strain the cooking liquids and add to the reserved pork. To make the pickled onions and chiles: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the vinegar, water, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and coriander seeds, and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Arrange the onions and pepper rings in a small container with a tight-fitting lid and pour the brine over the top. Cool, cover, and store chilled for a minimum of several hours and up to several days. Cook&#39;s Note: The pickled onions and peppers make powerful companions to the smoky mild stew. To make the red posole: Seed and stem the ancho chiles. Place the peppers in a pot and cover with stock, add a little water, if necessary, to cover. Reconstitute the peppers by bringing the liquids to a low boil, and then reduce the heat to simmer, and cook until the peppers are soft. Carefully transfer the peppers and their liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Meanwhile, heat about 2 tablespoons olive oil, a couple turns of the pan, in a skillet over medium heat, and add onions, garlic, and season with paprika, cl powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cook until the vegetables are very soft, 10 to 12 minutes, stir in the pepper puree, hominy, cilantro, 2 cups chicken stock, honey, the juice of 1 lime, and 1/2 the pulled pork. Add just enough water to form stew as loose or thick as you like, 1 to 2 cups additional liquid. Cool and store for a make-ahead meal. To serve, heat the stew over medium heat. Once hot, spoon the stew into shallow bowls and top with pickled onions and jalapenos, queso fresco, and serve with warm charred tortillas for dipping and wrapping. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 53848,&quot;Marshmallow Fondant Elephants 5 ounces mini marshmallows (2 2/3 cups) 8 ounces confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted (2 cups), plus more for kneading Vegetable shortening, for kneading Pink, black and blue gel food coloring Instructions: For the marshmallow fondant: Combine the marshmallows and 1 1/2 teaspoons water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add about three-quarters of the sifted confectioners&#39; sugar into the marshmallow mixture and stir to combine. Once the mixture becomes too stiff to stir, grease your counter and hands with shortening (or wear greased plastic, disposable gloves) and dump the mixture onto the counter. Knead, adding the remaining quarter of confectioners&#39; sugar, a little at a time, until the fondant is very smooth, not sticky and holds its shape into a ball without relaxing. Use right away or grease it lightly with additional shortening, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and store in an airtight plastic bag or container at room temperature for up to several days.<br> Remove a 1-ounce piece from the fondant ball (about 2 tablespoons). Color the 1-ounce piece bright pink (about 3 drops), rolling and kneading to evenly incorporate the color. Work in a little confectioners? sugar if the moisture from the food coloring makes the fondant too soft. (Wear plastic, disposable gloves and wash your hands well between colors so as not to bleed colors.) Pull off an almond-sized piece from the large white piece of fondant and color dark black (about 2 drops), working in additional confectioners&#39; sugar if needed. Color the remaining fondant bright blue (about 6 drops), working in additional confectioners&#39; sugar if needed.<br> For the elephant head, trunk, ears and legs: Divide the blue fondant into 6 pieces. Cut 1 piece in half. With greased hands, roll a half into a head with an elongated trunk and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Use a wooden skewer to poke 2 nostrils in the end of the trunk. Divide the remaining half into 4 pieces: roll 2 pieces into stubby legs. Press together to join in a \v\ shape. Roll and flatten the other 2 pieces into large round ears, about 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Repeat with the remaining 5 pieces of blue fondant.<br> For the inside of the ear: Divide the pink fondant into 12 pieces. Roll and flatten 2 pieces of pink fondant into rounds a little smaller than the blue ears and stick them in the middle of the blue ears. Repeat with the remaining 10 pieces.<br> Build the elephants: Arrange a set of legs on the parchment, \v\ point-up. Arrange the ears above the legs so that they are just barely touching. Rest the head on top of the ears and legs, pressing lightly to adhere. Drape the trunk over one of the legs. Use a 1/4-inch round pastry tip to make toe indentations in the tip of each leg. Roll 2 tiny black balls and press in to adhere.<br> Repeat with the remaining fondant to make 5 more elephants. Let the elephants dry, uncovered, overnight.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53849,&quot;Macaroni and 4 Cheeses Nonstick cooking spray 1 pound elbow macaroni 2 (10-ounce) packages frozen pureed winter squash 2 cups 1 percent lowfat milk 4 ounces extra-sharp Cheddar, grated (about 1 1/3 cups) 2 ounces Monterrey jack cheese, grated (about 2/3 cup) 1/2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon powdered mustard 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons unseasoned bread crumbs 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1 teaspoon olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Put the brisket in a small roasting pan. Score the thick top layer of fat (known as a fat cap) a few times with a sharp knife. Rub all over with the liquid smoke. Mix the chili powder, salt, cumin, garlic powder, paprika and pepper, and rub all over the brisket. Make sure the brisket is fat-cap-side up in the pan. Add 1/2 cup water to the bottom of the pan and then tightly cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the meat reads around 190 degrees F, about 3 hours (a thin knife should easily pierce the meat but it should not be falling apart). If cooking a second cut brisket, make sure to take the temperature in a few different spots as the different muscles can cook at different rates. Let the meat rest in the pan for about 30 minutes, and then transfer to a cutting board. Pour the juices into a large measuring cup. Then skim off the fat from the top and reserve. For the barbeque sauce: While the brisket roasts, heat the oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onion. Cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the ketchup, Worcestershire, vinegar, molasses and sugar. Stir in 1/2 cup water, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Simmer until slightly thickened and the flavors have blended, 15 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper and hot sauce. Set aside. Chop the brisket, trimming away and discarding excess fat as you cut. Put the chopped brisket into a pot and mix with 1 cup of the barbecue sauce and 1/2 cup of the reserved juices. Keep warm over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, while you prepare all the other components. For the Gut Pak: Place the smoked sausages in a medium nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Slice the sausage.

Place ice in two rocks glasses; divide the mixture evenly between the glasses, leaving at least 2 inches between the top of the glass and the liquid. Float a lime wheel over the ice in each glass to act as a barrier; pour the rum over the lime wheels. Set the glasses on a heatproof surface with nothing above; place a baking sheet nearby. Using extreme caution, light a long wooden match and carefully hold it right above one of the glasses--the flame will turn a deep blue color and the top of the cocktail will ignite. Light the second cocktail, then run the match under cold water to extinguish -- simply blowing on the match is not enough because the wood soaks up the rum. Let the cocktails burn for a few seconds, then extinguish the flames by placing the baking sheet on top of the glasses and holding it there for at least 10 seconds.

Allow it to sit until it becomes creamy and starts to bubble, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, granulated sugar, salt and anise. Stir together with a rubber spatula. Whisk together the melted butter, heavy cream, vanilla and egg yolks in a separate bowl. Add the wet ingredients and the active yeast to the dry ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, stir together to form a rough dough. Place the bowl on the mixer with a dough hook and knead until the dough pulls away from the sides but is still soft and silky, about 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to double in size, about 1 hour. For the filling: Mix together the brown sugar, orange zest, lemon zest, anise, cinnamon and salt in a bowl. Dust the counter lightly with flour. Pour the dough out onto the counter and dust the top of the dough with more flour. Gently, roll the dough into a rectangle about 22 by 15 inches and a 1/3 inch thick. Spread the softened butter evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edge. Sprinkle evenly with the brown sugar mixture. Starting at the end closest to you, begin rolling the dough away from you. Moisten the far edge with a little water and seal. You should have a log that looks like a pinwheel on the sides. Cut the log into twelve 2-inch rolls. Butter the inside of a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish. Place the rolls in the pan and allow to double in size, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the rolls until golden brown and puffed, 30 to 35 minutes.

Line an 8-inch diameter bowl with plastic wrap leaving some overhang. Line another medium bowl with paper towels. Separate the vermicelli bundles lengthwise into 1-inch-wide sections. (It&#39;s okay if some noodles break off, you may still use them.) Drop one bunch into the oil; the noodles will immediately puff and the oil will bubble vigorously. Cook for 10 to 15 seconds, until the oil stops bubbling and the vermicelli are crisp. Using a spider or mesh strainer, transfer the noodles to the paper towel-lined bowl and immediately sprinkle with salt, tossing to coat. When the temperature returns to 375 drop another bunch in. Repeat the frying process until all of the vermicelli, including any loose or broken pieces are cooked. Set the fried vermicelli aside. Heat the chocolate in a small microwavable bowl in the microwave until melted, about 2 minutes, pausing every 30 seconds to stir with a rubber spatula. Remove the paper towels from the bowl of vermicelli and discard. Scrape the melted chocolate into the bowl of vermicelli. Wearing latex gloves, use your hands to toss the vermicelli with the chocolate until the noodles are completely coated and sticky. Gently press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the plastic lined bowl leaving the edges uneven and ragged to resemble a bird&#39;s nest. Chill the nest in the bowl until firm, at least 30 minutes.<br> Make the cake. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with circles of parchment paper. Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl and set aside. Beat the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium-high and slowly add the sugar, beating until the mixture is light and smooth, about 4 minutes. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla and beat on medium, 1 minute more. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and add the eggs, one at a time, beating for 1 minute between each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.<br> Combine the milk with 1 1/4 cups water in a small saucepan, bring just to a boil and remove from the heat.<br> With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, until it is incorporated. Turn off the mixer, then carefully pour the hot liquid into the batter and combine by hand with a whisk until smooth. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Lightly tap each pan on the counter to settle the batter.<br> Bake until the cakes begin to pull away from the sides of the pans and the centers spring back when touched lightly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a rack for 10 minutes. Run a thin knife or small spatula around the edges of the pan, turn out the cake layers and place on the rack to cool completely.<br> Make the buttercream: Beat the butter, confectioners? sugar and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until just combined. Add the vanilla extract and increase the speed to medium-high, beating until fluffy and creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat in 2 tablespoons milk and the food coloring, if using, to make a pastel shade. Continue beating until light and spreadable, 2 minutes. If the frosting seems too stiff, add the remaining tablespoon of milk. To assemble: Place 1 cake layer right-side up on a cake stand or flat plate and top with 1 cup of frosting. Using a large offset spatula, spread the icing evenly over the layer to the edges. Place the other layer, on top. Evenly spread half of the remaining frosting over the top, leaving a small off-center mound to place the nest on. Spread the remaining frosting around the sides of the cake in a swirly pattern. Lift the chocolate nest from the bowl by the plastic-wrap overhang. Peel off the plastic and discard. Place the nest on the top of the cake on the mound of frosting and fill with candy coated eggs. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 53869,&quot;Schiacciata 1 cup lukewarm water 1 package instant dry yeast 2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup cherry tomatoes 2 teaspoons sea salt 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves removed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Put some flour on a plate and dredge the apple slices until lightly coated, shaking off any excess flour. In the same skillet over medium to medium-low heat, place 3 apple slices about 3-inches apart in the skillet. Cook without turning until browned, about 3 minutes. Ladle about 2 tablespoons of the batter over each apple ring. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add a nut-sized bit of butter to the skillet, as needed, and flip the pancakes, cook until golden on the underside, about 1 minute more. Serve immediately or transfer to oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining apples and batter. Serve with warm maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53882,&quot;From Scratch Pumpkin Pie 1 medium sugar pumpkin Canola oil, for oiling pumpkin 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring 1/4 teaspoon salt 2/3 cup (11 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk 1/2 cup whipping cream 2 tablespoons cornstarch 2 tablespoons molasses 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 3 large eggs<br> Whipped cream, for serving, optional Instructions: For the pumpkin: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Remove the stem from the pumpkin and scrape out the insides, discarding the seeds. Cut the pumpkin in half and lay the pieces cut-side down on a rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Rub canola oil all over the skin and bake until fork-tender, about 1 hour. Let cool.<br> For the easy pie crust: While the pumpkin is cooking, make the crust. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add in the butter and work into the dough with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in just enough cold water (4 to 5 tablespoons) with a fork just until the flour is moistened. Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a ball and flatten slightly. Wrap one ball in plastic wrap and refrigerate for another use.<br> Roll out the remaining dough ball on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch round. Transfer to a 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Fold the overhangs under and crimp decoratively. Pierce the dough all over with a fork. Chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.<br> Line the crust with foil, fill with dried beans or pie weights and bake until the sides are set, about 12 minutes. Remove the foil and beans. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.<br> For the filling: Scoop out the pulp from the roasted pumpkin and puree in a food processor until smooth. Add the condensed milk, cream, cornstarch, molasses, canola oil, cinnamon, ginger, salt and eggs and combine thoroughly.<br> Pour the filling into the crust and bake until the filling is set in the center, about 1 hour. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool for 30 minutes. Serve at room temperature or chilled.<br> Decorate with whipped cream before serving, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53883,&quot;Poutine 6 to 8 large Yukon gold potatoes, peeled 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for frying 1 shallot, minced 1 small clove garlic, minced 2 cups chicken stock 2 cups beef stock 2 tablespoons ketchup 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon whole green peppercorns 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 cups cheddar cheese curds Instructions: Slice the potatoes lengthwise, about 1/4 inch thick. Stack the slices and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick sticks (or cut the potatoes into fries using a french fry cutter). Place in a large bowl filled with cold water and let sit at least 1 hour, or up to 24 hours for extra-crispy fries. Drain well and pat dry or spin dry in a salad spinner. Make the gravy: Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken and beef stock, ketchup, vinegar, peppercorns and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the flour and make a roux, stirring until slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk the stock mixture into the roux and simmer until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Season the gravy with salt and pepper and keep warm. Line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels. Heat 2 to 3 inches vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F (or use a deep fryer). Fry the potatoes in small batches until whitish yellow, about 8 minutes. Remove with a strainer and drain on the paper towels. Bring the oil temperature to 375 degrees F over high heat. Fry the potatoes in batches again until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain on fresh paper towels. Salt and pepper the fries while hot. Strain the gravy. Put the fries in shallow dishes; top with the cheese curds and gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53884,&quot;Cauliflower in Curry Cream Sauce 1 head cauliflower, rinsed and broken down into florets 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 1 cup chopped onion 2 teaspoons yellow curry powder 1/2 teaspoon turmeric Salt 3 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp 1 cup chicken stock 2 cups heavy cream Instructions: For the cauliflower: In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and butter to melt. Once melted, add the cauliflower florets, a nice sprinkle of salt and cook until golden on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Give a good toss and let cook for 3 more minutes. Repeat tosses until most of the cauliflower is coated with the butter and golden on parts, about 4 tosses or so. Cauliflower should still be crunchy at this point, but tender enough to eat a smaller floret. Go ahead, take a bite! Then, pour the rest of the florets into a large bowl and quickly cover tightly with plastic wrap. Cook in batches if the florets won&#39;t fit into one pan. While the cauliflower continues to steam in the bowl, make the sauce. In the same pan over medium heat, add the butter. Once the butter is melted, add the onions, curry powder, turmeric and season with salt. Cook until tender, about 5 minutes, and then add the garlic and cook a bit more. Once the garlic is fragrant, add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Cook until the stock is reduced by half, and then add the heavy cream and raise to a simmer. Cook until the sauce is reduced and thickened. With a slotted spoon, remove the cauliflower from the bowl and add to the pot. Raise the heat and simmer 5 minutes more. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 53885,&quot;Sierra&#39;s Grandma&#39;s Secret Buffalo Wing Sauce 2 cups vegetable oil 10 whole, fresh chicken wings, cut in pieces (20 wing pieces) 1 stick butter 4 tablespoons brown sugar 5 tablespoons tomato sauce 1/4 teaspoon garlic 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 1/4 teaspoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon oregano, fresh or dried Dash beer 1 dash hot sauce (recommended: Frank&#39;s Hot Sauce) Instructions: Chicken Wing preparation: Heat 2 cups vegetable oil to 350 degrees F in a large skillet on stovetop.

Put the vanilla wafers in a food processor and pulse until the cookies are finely crushed. Reserve 1/2 cup to layer in and to top the pie. Pour the remaining crumbs in a 9-inch pie plate. Pour the melted butter over the top and, using a spoon or your hands, combine the ingredients. Press the mixture in the bottom and up the sides and onto the lip of the pie plate. Bake until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Peel and slice the bananas, adding them to a bowl. Stir the salt into the caramel sauce and toss the banana slices with the salted caramel. Arrange some banana slices evenly over the bottom of the crust. Spread half of the warm Vanilla Pudding over the bananas, top with some more crushed vanilla wafers (reserving some for garnish) and more caramel-coated bananas. Spread the remaining Vanilla Pudding over the top. In a large bowl, whip the cream until stiff peaks are just about to form. Add the almond extract and sugar and beat until peaks form. Make sure not to overbeat, or the cream will become lumpy and butter-like. Spread the whipped cream over the pie. Just before serving, garnish with a caramel swirl and the rest of the crushed vanilla wafers. Combine the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. This is the only time you can stir the sugar. If you stir it while it&#39;s cooking, it turns to rock candy. Place the saucepan over medium to low heat until the sugars start to dissolve, 5 to 10 minutes. Then turn the heat up to medium-high and cook until the sugar starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Do not stir while this is happening. You&#39;ve got to watch the pot, because it goes from caramel to burnt really quickly. And be careful, the mixture is extremely hot! Turn off the heat and stand back to avoid splattering. Slowly add the cream. Don&#39;t panic - the cream will bubble violently, and the caramel will solidify. Just give it more time to liquefy again-trust me! Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature, at least 4 hours. It will thicken as it sits.<br> 3 cups. In a bowl, whisk together the sugar and flour until all of the lumps are gone. Once it is a fine powder, whisk in the egg yolks and whole eggs and continue whisking until a smooth paste is formed. Slowly whisk in 1 cup milk, and once this is incorporated add the remaining 1 cup milk. Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it reaches the thickness of chilled pudding, 10 to 15 minutes. (Mixture will just begin to bubble and will be thick enough to hold soft peaks when the whisk is lifted.) Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 53893,&quot;Lemon Vinaigrette 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 cup good olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 53894,&quot;Super Stock 2 cups water 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces 1 parsnip, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces 6 celery stalks, cut into 1 inch pieces 1/2 large onion or 1 medium onion, quartered 1/4 stick (1 oz.) butter or margarine, or 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 rutabaga, peeled and diced 1 turnip, peeled and diced Instructions: Put the water, parsnip, carrots, celery and onion in a stockpot and bring to a boil.

Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the yeast and then a pinch of granulated sugar. Set aside undisturbed until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the salt, nutmeg, 2 3/4 cups of the flour and the remaining granulated sugar in a large bowl. Beat together the melted butter, vanilla and egg yolk in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment on medium high until combined. Add the yeast mixture and continue to mix on low until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix on low until a thick and slightly sticky dough forms. Once the dough comes together, switch to the dough hook and knead on medium speed, adding up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed, to make a soft, smooth ball that sticks to the hook, 3 to 4 minutes. Coat a large bowl generously with cooking spray. Add the dough, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (The dough can also be tightly wrapped and refrigerated overnight. Let it come to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe.) For the filling: Combine the butter, granulated sugar, flour and cinnamon in a food processor and pulse until crumbly. Set aside. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the butter mixture over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge. Tightly roll the dough into an 18-inch log. Pinch to seal at the seam and then put on the counter seam-side down. Form the log into a circle, pinching the ends together. Squeeze and roll the dough if needed so it is an even width throughout. Transfer the log to a parchment lined-baking sheet. Cut 16 slits across the log, about 1 inch apart; each slit should go about three-quarters of the way through the log so that it is still completely intact. Bend about a quarter of the log by turning some of the newly cut \tabs\ out so that the pinwheels of filling are facing up. Continue turning the \tabs\ out and bending the log until you have a ring. Butt the ends up against each other. Loosely cover the wreath with plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake until the wreath is golden brown and puffed, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool on a rack until just warm, about 10 minutes. For the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk and lemon juice in a medium bowl to make a thick but pourable glaze, adding a little more confectioners&#39; sugar if needed to get the right consistency. Drizzle over the wreath and let harden before serving. To serve, decorate with candied cherries and mint leaves to resemble holly sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53899,&quot;Flourless Almond-Honey Cake with Candied Lemon 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan 1 3/4 cups almond flour, plus more for the pan 1/3 cup potato starch 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/2 cups sugar 2/3 cup honey Finely grated zest and juice of 2 lemons, plus 1 lemon, halved, very thinly sliced and seeded (preferably Meyer lemons) 4 large eggs, separated, plus 2 egg whites, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract Chopped almonds and pomegranate seeds, for topping Instructions: Make the cake: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Brush the bottom and side of a 9-inch springform pan with olive oil and line the bottom with parchment. Brush the parchment with more olive oil and dust with almond flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the almond flour, potato starch and salt in a medium bowl. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup honey, the lemon zest, 4 egg yolks, vanilla and almond extracts, and the olive oil in a large bowl; beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; beat in the almond flour mixture until just incorporated. In a separate bowl, beat the 6 egg whites with a mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup sugar until stiff glossy peaks form, about 3 more minutes. Gently fold about one-third of the beaten egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest until just incorporated (it&#39;s OK if some white streaks remain). Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the cake is golden and springs back when lightly pressed, 50 to 55 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. (Don&#39;t worry if the cake falls slightly in the center.) Meanwhile, make the topping: Place the lemon slices in a small saucepan, cover with water and bring to a simmer over high heat, about 3 minutes; drain and return to the pan. Cover with fresh water; bring to a simmer and drain. Repeat one more time with fresh water. Return to the saucepan and add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup honey, the lemon juice and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lemon slices are tender and the liquid is syrupy, about 20 minutes. Set aside. Run a thin knife around the edge of the cake, then remove the springform ring. Use a spatula to transfer the cake to a serving plate (remove the parchment). Remove the candied lemon slices from the syrup with a fork. Brush the cake all over with some of the lemon-honey syrup, then top with the candied lemon, almonds and pomegranate seeds. Serve with the remaining syrup on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 53900,&quot;Tailgate Crab Cakes 6 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 cup chopped onions 1/3 cup chopped green bell peppers 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepper Fresh ground black pepper 1 cup green onions 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon Cajun choice seasoning 3 eggs 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 pound real or imitation crab meat 2/3 cups flour 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup seeded, chopped tomatoes 2 teaspoons minced shallots 2 teaspoons minced garlic 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon white pepper 1/2 cup chicken stock (can) 1 large egg* 1/2 cup olive oil Black pepper Instructions: Heat 1/2 of oil over high heat.

To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. The recipes for this program, which were provided by contributors and guests who may not be professional chefs, have not been tested in Food Network&#39;s kitchens.

Add the butter and pulse until pea-sized pieces appear. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. Add the vinegar mixture and pulse briefly?it will still look crumbly. Transfer the crumbs to a work surface and shape into a round, flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature to make it more workable. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don&#39;t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on forming a good circle from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don&#39;t do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm up the butter. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies. Set your pie pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. To transfer the crust to the pan, I find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan. Don&#39;t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don&#39;t be concerned; we&#39;ll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. To decorate the rim, fold under the excess dough then just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of 1 hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \V\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line the shell with a sheet of foil and fill with raw rice or dried beans. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil and rice and continue baking until golden brown. Let the pie shell cool on a rack while you make the filling. Make the Filling: In a mixing bowl with a whip attachment, whisk together the yolks and 1/3 cup sugar until fluffy, then add the lemon juice and zest. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and cook, whisking, until thickened, about 7 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, sprinkle the gelatin over cold water and let dissolve. Remove the yolk mixture from the heat and whisk in the gelatin until dissolved. Place the mixture over an ice bath and stir with a rubber spatula to cool it. Once it&#39;s room temperature remove it from the ice bath and let it sit while you whip the meringue. Place the egg whites in a clean dry bowl and whip on medium speed until foamy; then turn up to high and continue whipping until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and whip until glossy and sugar has dissolved. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the lemon mixture; then fold in the remaining whites in 3 batches. Pour the mixture into the cooled pie shell and smooth the top. Chill the pie at least 2 hours before serving. Serve with dollops of whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53902,&quot;Double Stuffed Brownies 2/3 cup solid vegetable shortening, plus additional for greasing pan 4 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate<br> 4 large eggs<br> 2 cups granulated sugar<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 3 to 4 tablespoons warm water<br> Instructions: For the brownies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottom of a jellyroll pan, then line with parchment paper and grease the paper. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the shortening and chocolate together, stirring every 30 seconds and cooking until melted. Set aside to cool slightly. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the eggs well. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla; beat to combine thoroughly. Beat in the chocolate mixture. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Stir into the chocolate mixture. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake the brownies until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Release the edges with a butter knife, and turn the brownies out onto a cutting board to cool completely. Cut in half, creating two large, equal pieces. For the filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the shortening and vanilla. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 cup at a time, adding 1 tablespoon of water between each addition and mixing until you get a spreadable consistency. You may not need to add all the water. Spread the filling over one of the large brownie pieces, and cover with the other piece like a sandwich. Cut into 2-inch\ squares. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Pinotage]</p><p>&quot; 53903,&quot;Crispy Mashed Potato Egg Rolls 2 quarts neutral-flavored oil One 12-ounce package egg roll wrappers<br> 2 cups leftover mashed potatoes<br> 1/3 cup shredded Cheddar<br> Instructions: Fit a large Dutch oven with a deep-frying thermometer. Pour in the oil and bring to 325 degrees F over medium-low heat. Line a plate with paper towels. Position an egg roll wrapper with a corner facing towards you. Place 3 heaping tablespoons mashed potatoes in the center of the wrapper. Cover with a heaping teaspoon Cheddar and use your fingers to mold the filling into a rectangular shape. Fold the bottom corner up over the filling, tucking it to cover the filling. Fold in the left and right corners to meet in the middle. Dampen the corner farthest from you with water, then continue to roll up. Use a little more water to seal the seam. Continue with the remaining wrappers and filling. Gently drop the egg rolls in batches in the hot oil, seam-side down. Cook, turning the rolls to brown evenly, until deeply golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on the paper towels and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53904,&quot;Green Pea Guacamole 1/2-cup julienned spinach 1/3-cup frozen peas 1 ounce lite tofu 1-1/2 Tbs. lemon juice pinch of salt pinch of cumin pinch of cayenne pinch of chili powder dash of Tabasco 6 Tbs. mashed avocado 3 Tbs. peeled and minced tomato 2 Tbs. pico de gallo 1 Tbs. minced cilantro 3 Tbs.minced white onions 2 tsp. chopped scallions Instructions: Steam spinach until wilted.

On a large cutting board, chop the garlic and then the chiles. Add the parsely and mint and continue to chop. Slice and then chop the tomatoes, adding them to the pile of other ingredients. Mix as you chop by turning the salsa with the flat of your knife or cleaver. Mix in the salt. When all the ingredients are well-chopped, put the salsa into a small attractive bowl and blend in the lemon juice. The salsa will be quite runny, ideal for being sopped up with flatbreads. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53906,&quot;Peaches in Sauternes 6 to 8 very ripe yellow or white peaches 3 tablespoons sugar 1 (375 ml.) bottle good Sauternes 1 tablespoon orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) Instructions: Bring a pot of water to a boil and immerse the peaches in the water for 1 to 2 minutes, until the skins come off easily. Remove them with a slotted spoon and place them in a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. Peel the peaches and then slice them in wedges off the pit and into a bowl. Stir in the sugar, Sauternes, and orange liqueur. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Serve cool but not cold. &quot;,&quot;[Sauternes, Riesling, Moscato, Vin Santo]&quot; 53907,&quot;Eggs Over Easy 2 eggs (the fresher the better) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat a small non-stick skillet over low heat and add butter. As soon as the butter stops foaming, crack the eggs into the pan. Lift the handle about an inch so that the eggs pool in the far corner of the pan. Hold for 30 seconds or until the whites start to set, then lower the handle and give the pan a jiggle just to make sure there&#39;s no sticking. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and continue to cook over low heat until the whites become opaque. Jiggle to loosen the eggs, then lift the pan, holding it about a foot above the heat. Now, flip the eggs over by pushing the pan away and snapping upward simultaneously. Once the eggs start their somersault, raise the pan to meet them so that the exposed yolks experience the softest landing possible. The goal of course is to avoid breaking the yolks. If you succeed, count to 10 slowly then flip the eggs again, slide them onto a plate and serve. If the yolks do break, act like you meant them to, fry for another minute and serve. They&#39;ll still taste great. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 53908,&quot;Grilled Sea Bass with Jalapeno-Mango Salsa Two 6-ounce pieces sea bass (white, black or striped) Olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup Jalapeno-Mango Salsa, recipe follows 1 lime, wedged Cooked white rice, optional 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 whole jalapeno chiles 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 2 mangoes, peeled, pitted and diced 1 lime, juiced 1/4 large red onion, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat a grill pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the bread dough into a 9-by-12-inch rectangle. When rolling, if the dough springs back, cover with a dry towel and let it rest for 5 minutes. Shingle the ham slices onto the dough, leaving a 1/4 inch of exposed dough on all sides. Sprinkle with the cheese and roll the dough into a large log, pinching together the seam and tucking the ends under to seal completely. Place the log, seam-side down, in the prepared loaf pan and bake until golden brown and cooked through and the internal temperature is 200 degrees, for 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let it sit for at least 10 minutes. Remove from the pan. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53913,&quot;Homemade Black Pepper Potato Chips 6 Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled Canola or vegetable oil, for frying Kosher salt and black pepper Instructions: Wash and clean the potatoes in cold running water. Using a mandoline, or vegetable peeler, finely slice the potatoes into chips. Drop the chips into a bowl of ice water as you work to prevent them from going brown. This will also remove any excess starch. In a heavy Dutch oven, heat oil to 400 degrees F(use a thermometer to keep the temp right!). When it&#39;s hot enough, lay the potatoes on baking sheet lined with paper towels, and blot them with more paper towels to dry. Lower batches of potatoes into the oil using a spatula. They will fry very quickly; stir with a heavy metal spoon as they fry to get them to be the \kettle\ style. Remove with a slotted spoon when they&#39;re nice and golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Immediately sprinkle on salt and lots of black pepper. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes!

Add the pork and turn to coat in the marinade. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours. Remove the pork from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling and pat dry with paper towels. Preheat the grill to high heat for indirect grilling. Brush the pork with the canola oil and sprinkle with salt. Place the pork directly over the heat and cook until charred on all sides, about 8 minutes. Move the pork to the cooler part of the grill and continue grilling until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 150 degrees F, about 12 minutes longer. Remove the pork from the grill and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice into 1/4-inch thick slices. For the green sauce: Combine the cilantro, parsley, onions, lime juice, olive oil, salt, garlic and Scotch bonnet in a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and add a little honey to sweeten. Add a little water if the sauce is too thick. Spoon the green sauce over the sliced pork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 53923,&quot;Herb Spaetzle 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Kosher salt 2 eggs 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup mixed chopped herbs (parsley, chives, marjoram, oregano or dill are great) Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil over medium heat. In a small bowl whisk together the eggs and milk until they are a homogeneous mixture. In a large bowl, add flour and make a hole in the flour. Add a pinch of salt and using a fork, gradually combine the milk/egg mixture with the flour. Mix until they are just combined. Stir in 1/4 cup of the herbs. Place the batter in a colander over the boiling water. Using a rubber spatula or a spaetzle maker, push the batter through a colander into the boiling water. Boil the spaetzle for 2 to 3 minutes or until firm. Drain the spaetzle and place in a medium bowl. Add some olive oil and the remaining 1/4 cup of herbs. Toss to coat evenly and serve immediately.

Whisk together the eggs, rosemary, red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl. Melt the butter in a cast-iron skillet. Add the onions and tomatoes, and saute until the onions are soft and the tomatoes are starting to burst, about 5 minutes. Add the greens, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper; saute for another 2 minutes. Turn down the heat to low and pour in the eggs. Using a rubber spatula, very gently move the eggs around a bit -- not scrambling them, just massaging them into the cracks and crevasses of the greens. Once the eggs start to set on the bottom, dollop with the goat cheese and transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake until the frittata is set on top, 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 53926,&quot;The Best Fudgy Brownies Nonstick baking spray 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) unsalted butter<br> 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate (64-percent cacao), chopped<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 1 1/4 cups Dutch-process cocoa<br> 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar<br> 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla paste or extract<br> 2 teaspoons instant espresso powder<br> 6 large eggs, chilled<br> Instructions: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Spray a 13-by-9-inch baking pan, preferably metal, with nonstick baking spray. Line the pan with parchment paper leaving a 2-inch overhang on the longer sides. Lightly coat with nonstick spray. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling occasionally, until the butter is a deep golden color, about 5 minutes; the butter will hiss and spit as the whey evaporates so be careful. As the foam subsides the butter will go from a canary yellow color to golden. When it does, take it off the heat. Add the chocolate and cream to the butter and let it sit, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted.<br> Sift the flour and cocoa powder through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Beat the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, vanilla, espresso powder and eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Start on low speed and gradually increase to high speed until the eggs are pale, very thick and fluffy, about 8 minutes (start your timer when you get to high speed). Do not be tempted to skimp on the mix time; this step is key to getting the signature shiny, crackled brownie top. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour the warm chocolate into the eggs; beat until completely incorporated. Gradually add the dry ingredients and beat until just combined; do not overmix. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and fold until the batter is completely combined.<br> Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the brownies are glossy and just barely firm, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 205 degrees F, 25 to 35 minutes. Don&#39;t let the thermometer touch the bottom of the pan or you will get a much higher reading. (The cook time will be at the higher end of the range if using a glass or ceramic baking dish.)<br> Let the brownies cool completely to allow the crumb to set before slicing, about 3 hours.<br> Use an offset spatula to loosen the brownies from the sides of the pan. Use the parchment overhang to lift the brownies out of the pan. Remove the parchment and cut into 24 squares.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Syrah]&quot; 53927,&quot;Tasty Dill Bread 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 3 cups bread flour 2 medium shallots, very thinly sliced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 2 teaspoons dill seeds 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon sesame seeds 3 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses 1 tablespoon wheat germ 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 cup 4 percent cottage cheese 1 large egg Butter, for greasing the bowl and pan Instructions: Make the dough: In a medium bowl, sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm water (about 110 degrees F) and gently shake the bowl to help the yeast mix with the water. Set aside until dissolved, about 10 minutes.<br> In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the bread flour with the shallots, fresh dill, dill seeds, fennel seeds, sesame seeds, honey, molasses, wheat germ, salt and pepper. Mix on medium-low speed to blend. Mix in the cottage cheese and egg.<br> Add the yeast mixture and mix to incorporate. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl. Cover with a towel and put in a warm place until doubled in volume, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.<br> Grease an 8-inch loaf pan with butter. Gently push the air out of the dough. Put the dough squarely in the pan and cover it with the towel again. Leave in a warm place to rise for 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Bake the bread: Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake the loaf until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean or the internal temperature of the bread reaches 200 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and unmold. Let the bread rest on a rack for at least 30 minutes before cutting. (Or, if you&#39;re like me, tear off the end and nibble on it immediately as you wait for the rest of the loaf to cool! The crust is addictive.)<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53928,&quot;Cranberry Sauce One 12-ounce bag fresh bog cranberries 1 cup cranberry juice<br> 1 cup pure maple syrup<br> 3 tablespoons orange juice<br> 1 tablespoon orange rind Instructions: Wash the cranberries under cool water, then throw into a medium saucepan.

Obviously you wouldn&#39;t be organized at this point so it&#39;s a matter of using what you&#39;ve got, but ideally I like to have mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, sausages and eggs. By the time you have got these together, the pan will be hot so slice your sausages in half lengthways and pat them out flat so they cook quickly. Place into the pan at one side. On the other side, put tablespoon or so of oil and place a pile of mushrooms over it which can be sliced or whole. Shake the pan about a bit to coat the mushrooms and season with some salt and pepper. Push to one side and then lay some slices of bacon and halved tomatoes in the pan. Cook for a couple of minutes until the bacon is crisp and golden. Shake the pan a little and turn the bacon over. Now is the time to put a round of toast in the toaster. At this stage you should respect the rustic and authentic look and shuffle everything about so that it&#39;s all mixed together and add 2 or 3 eggs at different ends of the pan. The whites of the eggs will dribble in and around the sausage, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms. You could turn the heat down a little at this point. Cook for another 1 or 2 minutes until the yolks are slightly soft or to your liking. In a non-stick pan I&#39;ve always found the removal of this dish to the plate extremely easy as it resembles a frisbee and will slide onto your plate with no trouble at all. Doesn&#39;t that sound appetizing? But honestly, it really is a gem. Anyway, I always used to have 3 or 4 friends back to my house for munchies or to stay the night and this dish was devised so we didn&#39;t have too much trouble making it or much washing up to do. In actual fact, I only had to wipe the non-stick pan clean. It also makes its way from the pan to the plate quite quickly, as patience isn&#39;t a virtue at that time of night with my mates!. Finely chop all the ingredients that can be chopped. Put this mixture into a bowl and add the mustard and vinegar. Slowly stir in the olive oil until you achieve the consistency you are looking for and balance the flavors with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and if necessary more red wine vinegar.

Make sure you rinse out the cavities as well as the outsides to remove as much blood as possible. In a large pot, combine the chickens and 16 cups ice water. Bring to a boil and then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Simmer the broth for 3 hours. Trim the lemongrass stalk, then bruise it by hitting it with the back of a chef&#39;s knife, down the length of the stalk. Add to the broth along with the onions, tamarind paste, cl paste, palm sugar, garlic and ginger and simmer for an additional hour. Season the broth with salt and pepper. Add the lime juice and additional cl paste if you want a spicier broth. Strain out the solids and reserve the chicken meat for another use. For the braised oxtail: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the oxtail with the salt and pepper and dredge in the flour. Heat a wok over high heat and add the oil. Working in batches, sear the oxtail pieces until browned. Transfer to an oven-safe casserole dish and fill the casserole dish with enough of the beef broth to cover the oxtail pieces three-quarters of the way. Cover with aluminum foil and place in the oven. Cook until the oxtail is tender, 3 to 4 hours. Allow the oxtail to cool in the braising liquid. Keep the oven temperature at 350 degrees F. For the Vietnamese meatballs: In a large bowl, mix together the beef, pork, onions, scallions, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, soy sauce, salt and pepper. Form 2- to 3-ounce meatballs from the mixture and arrange them on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake the meatballs until fully cooked through, 30 to 45 minutes. For the noodles: Bring 16 cups water to a boil and add the egg noodles. Cook until tender, then drain and rinse in cold water.

For the dough: Place thinly rolled out pasta sheets on a clean work surface and place tablespoonfuls of the filling, along 1 of the long edges about 2 inches apart and about 2 inches from the edge. Brush around the filling lightly with some of the beaten egg. Fold the dough over the ricotta filling and, using a sharp knife or pastry wheel, cut the ravioli apart into squares or circles about 2 1/2 inches wide and press the edges carefully to seal. Place the ravioli on a baking sheet that has been sprinkled with some of the cornmeal and repeat with the remaining filling and pasta sheets until you have used all of the filling. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil Cook the ravioli, in batches, until they float on the top of the surface, about 5 minutes. Serve hot with the Sicilian Style Meat Sauce. In the bowl of a food processor combine the flour and salt. Turn on processor and mix well. With the machine running, add the eggs, egg yolks, and olive oil through the feed tube, and process until it resembles wet cornmeal, about 2 minutes. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed, to help pasta come together when pressed. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil Take a handful of dough at a time and form into a firm ball. Press each dough ball into desired shape using a pasta machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Repeat with the remaining dough. Recipe courtesy Emeril Lagasse, 2001 In a Dutch oven or large saucepan heat 1/2 the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the onions. Cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon until soft and lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes. Add the tomatoes, sugar, fennel, nutmeg, allspice and cloves Bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until sauce has thickened slightly, about 20 minutes. Using a hand-held immersion blender, puree the sauce until smooth. Heat the remaining oil in a skillet and add the pork ribs. Season the ribs lightly on all sides with salt and pepper, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides. Add the browned ribs to the tomato sauce and simmer until sauce is thick and flavorful and the ribs are very tender, 2 to 3 hours, adding water as necessary to keep the sauce from getting too thick and burning. Serve over pasta or Ragusa-Style Ricotta Ravioli. You may want to pull the meat off the bones, shred it, and return it to the sauce before serving the sauce with the ravioli. Any unused pasta sauce may be frozen for up to 2 months. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 53943,&quot;Chicken, Chorizo and Tortilla Stoup (Stew-like Soup) 1 pound chicken tenders Salt and pepper 3/4 pound chorizo sausage, in packaged meats case near kielbasa 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, smashed 1 red bell pepper, chopped 1 medium onion, chopped 6 small red potatoes, diced 1 (15-ounce) can fire roasted chopped tomatoes (recommended: Muir Glen) 1 (15-ounce) can dark red kidney beans, drained 2 teaspoons hot sauce 1 quart chicken stock 1 sack red or blue corn tortilla chips 2 cups shredded pepper jack or smoked Cheddar Suggested garnishes: chopped scallions, chopped cilantro or fresh thyme leaves Instructions: Preheat medium soup pot over medium-high heat.<br> Chop tenders into bite-size pieces.

Grease three 8-inch round cake pans and then flour the insides of the pans, tapping out excess. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large mixing bowl if you&#39;re using a hand mixer), sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and mix for 2 minutes on medium speed. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl; mix for an additional 20 seconds--the batter will be very thin. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans. Bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the pans and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the cakes comes out almost clean, with just a few moist crumbs, about 12 minutes more. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire racks for 20 minutes, then carefully turn out onto cooling racks to cool completely. For the nougat filling: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sugar and evaporated milk, stirring until dissolved. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and add the marshmallow fluff, peanut butter and vanilla extract, stirring until completely smooth. Fold in the peanuts. Let the nougat mixture cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, before using in the cake--you can do this by leaving it at room temperature, or you can place it into the refrigerator to speed up the process. (Makes 2 cups.) For the salted-caramel buttercream frosting: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed for 5 minutes. Pour in the salted caramel sauce, salt and vanilla, and beat until combined. Reduce the speed to medium-low, and slowly add the powdered sugar, a little at a time, until fully incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. (Makes 2 cups.) To assemble: Level off the tops of the cakes if they baked up uneven or domed. Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Cover with half of the nougat filling. Top with a second cake layer, and cover with the remaining filling. Place the final cake layer, face-down, on top. Frost the cake with the salted-caramel frosting, finishing it as smoothly as possible. Drizzle with caramel if desired. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until the frosting is set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 53967,&quot;Grilled Fruit Kebabs 2 firm-ripe small plums, sliced into 6 wedges each 1 cup chopped pineapple chunks Honey, optional Instructions: Preheat grill to medium.

Puree until smooth. Drain the second jar. Using an electric mixer, combine the Cheddar, cream cheese, pureed pimentos and diced pimientos, beating until smooth. Add the mayonnaise and jalapenos and mix until fully combined. For the fried green tomatoes: Cut the ends off of the tomatoes and slice into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of freshly ground pepper. In a second shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. In a third shallow bowl whisk together the panko, cornmeal and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Working with one tomato slice at a time, first coat the tomato with the flour mixture, shaking off the excess. Then coat with the egg mixture, followed by the panko mixture. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes. Heat 2 cups oil in a large skillet over medium heat until a pinch of panko sizzles when dropped in. Carefully place some of the tomatoes into the heated oil in a single layer. Fry until golden, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat the frying process with the remaining tomatoes, changing the oil if the particles left in the oil between batches begin to burn. For the BPT: Cook the bacon in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until desired crispness, 8 to 10 minutes. Gently spread one side of each slice of bread with the jalapeno pimiento cheese. Arrange the bacon, then the fried green tomatoes and then the lettuce on 4 slices. Top with the remaining slices, and cut each sandwich in half.

Sprinkle a little salt over the shrimp and separate the layers of fanned out shrimp by using waxed paper. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine cake flour, katakuriko, and baking powder and mix well. Set aside. Into a 2 cup measure, combine eggs, salt, sugar, and ajinomoto. Add several ice cubes to the mixture and fill with cold water to equal 2 cups volume of chilled egg mixture. Stir slightly, but don&#39;t melt all of the ice cubes yet. Pour the iced egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir slightly until lumps of undissolved flour mixture remain in batter. Place a frying pan over medium high heat. Fill frying pan with 1-inch of oil and heat. Grab a fistful of the batter and clench fist over frying pan. Rotate clenched fist over the hot oil to create a bed of laced, flaky batter in the hot oil. The bed of laced batter must be thick enough to lay the fanned shrimp on. Once the batter is cooked, about 1 to 2 minutes, and the batter is flaky and crispy, place the fanned shrimp meat on the crispy bed of batter. The shrimp should not sink through the bed of batter, but remain atop it as it deep-fries. Using a chopstick, break up the bed of flaky batter so that you can individually flip the shrimp in the frying pan so that the shrimp is below the batter in the oil. Cook until the shrimp are cooked through, about 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53981,&quot;Cilantro Lime Pesto Pasta 1 tablespoons olive oil One 8-ounce box regular or gluten-free angel hair pasta 1 cup black olives, pitted and quartered, plus more for garnish 1/2 red bell pepper, diced 1/4 cup raw pumpkin seeds 2 1/2 cups fresh basil leaves, tightly packed, plus more for garnish 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, preferably cold pressed 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves 1/2 cup pine nuts, plus more for garnish 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 teaspoons nama shoyu or tamari 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper Pinch cayenne pepper Hemp seeds, for garnish Instructions: For the pasta: Bring a large pot of filtered water to a rapid boil.

Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and lay the seasoned rack, fat side down, into the pan. Sear the lamb until the fat is golden brown or until the fat has rendered, about 3 minutes or so. Flip and brown the meaty side and ends of the rack. The browning should take about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary so the fat is sizzling, not sputtering. Transfer the rack of lamb to a plate to cool and set the skillet aside, but don&#39;t wash it. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the minced onion and garlic and cook until softened and fragrant about 3 minutes. Stir the bread crumbs into the skillet until coated with the onion mixture. Lower the heat and add the cumin, oregano, chili powder, and salt and pepper, to taste. Stir constantly to prevent scorching until the bread crumbs are toasted and golden, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime zest. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put the roasted pepper, chipotles and adobo sauce in the work bowl of a food processor. (If you have a mini-processor, use it here.) Process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl once or twice. Using a small spoon, paint the flat/bone side (not the rounded, meaty part) of the rack with enough of the pepper paste to coat it generously. Sprinkle the toasted bread crumb mixture over the painted lamb and press lightly to make sure the crumbs adhere to the lamb. Stand the rack, bone side up in the skillet used to sear the lamb, and place in the preheated oven. Roast for 20 minutes for medium rare. (An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the rack should register 125 to 130 F degrees F.) Remove to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Carve the rack between the bones into double chops and serve immediately. <em>There will be more of the \dos cl\ paste and the toasted bread crumbs than needed to coat the rack.

You can parboil the carrots, fennel, parsnips, and baby turnips together-everything except the beets, as they&#39;ll turn everything else red! The beets also take quite a bit longer to cook, around 20 to 25 minutes. Put the rest of the vegetables into a large pot, cover with cold water and season well. Bring to the boil and cook for about 6 to 7 minutes until you&#39;ve got part-cooked, softened bendy vegetables, and then drain in a colander and leave to steam dry. Get yourself a small tray, and use it to mix up each set of vegetables with their own gorgeous flavours, a few good lugs of oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the carrots, clementines and rosemary together first and move them to a larger roasting tray so they&#39;re all together. Then mix your fennel with its flavours and do the same... When you get to the parsnips, keep the honey back for later. Make sure each vegetable group is separate in the roasting tray. Cover the tray with tin foil and keep in the refrigerator or the garage until your turkey is out of the oven and resting. When you are ready to cook them, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F/ 190 degrees C/ Gas 5. Roast the vegetables in the hot oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour until they are golden, crispy and beautiful looking. Five minutes before they are ready to come out of the oven take the tray out, drizzle the honey over the parsnips and jiggle the tray so they are nicely coated. Pile all the vegetables up on a platter so they sprawl and hang all over the place.

(Note: If you are using a pork shoulder instead, cut under the thick cap of fat using a fillet knife, cutting while pulling the fat out of the way to one side, revealing the meat; do not remove the layer of fat, just detach it to make way for stabbing slits with your knife.) Using your hands, fill all the slits with garlic cloves, pressing them down into each slit. Add salt and pepper and spread evenly. Pour lemon and lime juices over the pork. Add the achiote, coriander and oregano. Using your hands, massage and spread evenly. Pour the olive oil and spread evenly. Let the pork rest at room temperature for 2 hours.

Drain the garlic and peel. Set aside. Dry the chicken with paper towels. Season liberally with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the butter and oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. In batches, saute the chicken in the fat, skin side down first, until nicely browned, about 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Turn with tongs or a spatula; you don&#39;t want to pierce the skin with a fork. If the fat is burning, turn the heat down to medium. When a batch is done, transfer it to a plate and continue to saute all the chicken in batches. Remove the last chicken to the plate and add all of the garlic to the pot. Lower the heat and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, turning often, until evenly browned. Add 2 tablespoons of the Cognac and the wine, return to a boil, and scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Return the chicken to the pot with the juices and sprinkle with the thyme leaves. Cover and simmer over the lowest heat for about 30 minutes, until all the chicken is done. Remove the chicken to a platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the sauce and the flour and then whisk it back into the sauce in the pot. Raise the heat, add the remaining tablespoon of Cognac and the cream, and boil for 3 minutes. Add salt and pepper, to taste; it should be very flavorful because chicken tends to be bland. Pour the sauce and the garlic over the chicken and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 54041,&quot;Rum Raisin Truffles 125 grams heavy cream (about 1/2 cup) 750 grams (about 26 ounces) milk chocolate, divided 15 grams butter (about 1 tablespoon) 40 grams raisins (about 1/8 cup) 60 grams dark rum, such as Mount Gay (about 1/4 cup) Instructions: In a heatproof bowl set over simmering water, heat the cream until hot to the touch and turn off the heat.

Place the raisins and rum in the bowl of a mini food processor or blender and process until the raisins are finely minced. Stir the raisin mixture into the chocolate mixture and set aside at room temperature for at least 6 hours or overnight to cool. Using a 1 1/4-inch ice cream scoop, scoop balls of the rum raisin mixture and place them on sheet pans lined with parchment paper. To make the tempered chocolate, chop the remaining 400 grams of milk chocolate and place 3/4 of it in a small glass bowl in the microwave for 20 seconds exactly. Stir the chocolate and continue to microwave for 20 seconds at a time, stirring in between, until the chocolate is smooth and shiny. Add the remaining 1/4 of the chocolate and stir until smooth. The chocolate should register 85 to 89 degrees F on a candy thermometer. With 2 small spoons, pick up each ball and cover it with tempered chocolate. (You can also use your hands to coat them.) They can look a little messy and \truffle\ like. Place the truffle back on the parchment paper. Continue to coat each of the balls until they&#39;re all coated with milk chocolate.

Scrape onto a piece of parchment and form into a log. Roll up and twirl the ends to tightly seal and form a tight log about 3 inches long. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. For the dukkah seasoning: Toast the cumin and coriander in a small skillet over low heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool and crush in a spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the almonds, sesame seeds and salt. Set aside. For the farro: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil, as for pasta. Add the farro, then reduce the heat and simmer rapidly until just tender, about 30 minutes. Rinse to cool and drain well. Add to a serving bowl. Preheat a 2-burner grill pan or outdoor grill to medium to medium-high heat. For the steaks: Combine the brown sugar, paprika, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Rub all over the steaks on both sides. Place the steaks on the grill. Grill for 90 seconds, then give the steaks a 90-degree turn. Grill for another 90 seconds, then flip the steaks. Repeat the procedure on the second side, cooking the steaks 6 to 7 minutes total for medium-rare. Remove the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Unwrap the chilled butter and slice into 4 or 5 rounds. Place on the steaks to melt while they rest. Meanwhile, grill the scallions until tender, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes. Grill the lemon until charred on the cut sides, about 2 minutes. Chop the scallions and add to the bowl with the farro. Squeeze the lemon over the farro and add the tomatoes, cucumbers, Garlic Oil, cilantro, mint, feta and dukkah. Toss well and season with salt if needed. Mound the salad on a serving platter. Thinly slice the steaks against the grain and place on the salad. Serve immediately. Combine the garlic cloves, rosemary sprigs, thyme sprigs, bay leaf and oil in a small saucepan.

Turn the heat to medium high and cook the shrimp uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until just firm and pink. Drain in a colander. Place half the shrimp in a large bowl. Cut the rest of the shrimp sideways through the back with a sharp paring knife and add them to the bowl as well. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add the celery, scallions, tarragon, and mayonnaise, and combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours for the flavors to meld. Transfer the salad to a serving bowl, sprinkle with extra tarragon and salt, and taste for seasonings. Serve cold or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54059,&quot;Garlic Shrimp Casserole 2 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 pint leftover rice 2 pints leftover garlic shrimp 3/4 cup toasted panko bread crumbs (Japanese bread crumbs) Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

In a foil lined terra cotta pot, pour the rice and add the leftover garlic shrimp. Then pour the cream mixture over it. Top with the toasted panko and place in the oven for 45 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54060,&quot;Creme Caramel 2 cups granulated sugar 1 1/4 cups water Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. For caramel, combine sugar and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan. Be sure all sugar granules are washed down from pot sides. Cook over moderate heat, swirling pan occasionally, until color is golden brown and mixture smells like caramel. Often you need to cook it a bit darker than you would imagine. This should take 10 to 15 minutes. Pour enough caramel into a 9-inch round cake pan to coat bottom and sides. Swirl to coat and reserve. Add remaining water to caramel in saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook over moderate heat until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Occasionally stir and brush down sides with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. This process prevents crystallization of the sugar. Set this caramel sauce aside at room temperature, then chill until serving time. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 54061,&quot;The Best Baingan Bharta 1 medium globe eggplant (about 1 pound) 3 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil 1 medium red onion, chopped (1 packed cup) 1 to 2 Indian or Thai green chiles, 1/2 to 1 serrano cl or 1/2 jalape?o, chopped (seeded for less heat, if desired) 3 to 4 tomatoes, chopped (1 packed cup) Kosher salt 1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped (about 1/2 cup) Instructions: Put the whole eggplant directly over a moderate flame on a gas stove or grill. Cook, turning it every couple of minutes with metal tongs, until charred all over and the flesh is completely soft, about 10 minutes. Wait until the eggplant is cool enough to handle then peel off the skin and discard--don\u2019t worry if little bits of skin remain. Remove and discard the stem, coarsely chop the flesh and set aside. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet occasionally, until softened with just a hint of color, about 10 minutes. Add the chiles and cook, stirring occasionally, until the raw smell goes away, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add the eggplant and cilantro and cook, stirring occasionally, until well mixed and the flavors have melded, about 3 minutes.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and draw a 6-inch circle in the center of each. Dust the parchment with flour. Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. In a second large bowl, beat together the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture, beating just until incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips. Divide the dough into eight portions. Transfer one portion to the center of the circle on one of the prepared baking sheets. Press flat, then dust with more flour and place another sheet of parchment paper on top. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a 6-inch circle, using the circle on the parchment as your guide. Remove the top piece of parchment and bake until almost done, about 12 minutes. Immediately transfer the cookie with its parchment to a work surface. Lay a piece of parchment on top of the cookie and flip the cookie and parchment over. Using a rolling pin, gently roll to compress the cookie. Then use the parchment to roll the cookie around a large waffle cone filled and wrapped in foil. Let the cookie cool completely before removing the cone, about 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough and the other baking sheet, timing batches to finish baking right when it&#39;s time to remove the cone from the cooled cookie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54063,&quot;Thai Red Curry Mac &#39;n&#39; Cheese Kosher salt 1 pound elbow macaroni 5 tablespoons butter 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 (4-ounce) jar Thai red curry paste 2 cups whole milk 2 cups cream (alternatively, use 5 cups whole milk instead of both milk and cream) 8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated 8 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs 2 tablespoons butter, melted Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese: Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Salt generously, and then add the pasta and cook to box instructions, usually 6 to 7 minutes. Drain. In another large pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour and continue whisking until it deepens in color and releases a light toasted aroma, about 1 minute. Whisk in the Thai red curry paste, and when fully combined, pour in the milk and cream (or all milk, if using). Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, and then turn down to a simmer. Simmer until the mixture thickens, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes. Off heat, whisk in the cheeses and stir until melted. Add the pasta and toss to combine. Turn your broiler on. For the crumb topping: Toss the panko with the melted butter and season with salt and pepper. To assemble: Pour the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese into a broiler-safe casserole dish, sprinkle with the bread crumb mixture, and broil until browned, about 1 minute. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Pinotage, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 54064,&quot;Jambalaya 2 tablespoons garlic, minced 1 tablespoon crushed red cl flakes 4 bay leaves 1/2 cup canola oil 8 ounces tomato puree 1 (32-ounce) can tomatoes, diced in puree 1 (32-ounce) can tomatoes, diced 1 pound andouille or other hot, smoked sausage 1 quart chicken stock 4 cups green peppers, diced 4 cups yellow onions, diced Cooked Rice 1 pound chicken, boned and cubed Salt and pepper, to taste 1/2 cup scallions, diced Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Saute the garlic, chiles, and bay leaves in the oil. Once the garlic is fragrant, add all the tomato products and simmer, stirring for about 45 minutes. Slice and roast the sausage for about 20 minutes. Drain the fat off. Add to the tomatoes, chicken stock, sausage, green peppers, and onions and simmer another 1 to 1 1/2 hours, add salt and pepper. The jambalaya is finished when it has thickened and turned brick color, without any more oil coming to the surface. At this point, cook a big pot of rice to mix with the sauce (equal amounts of rice to the sauce) and add any meats you want to the jambalaya sauce (chicken pieces, shrimp, alligator, veal etc.) Poach the meat in the sauce to cook it. Add scallions at the last minute for color. To make vegetarian jambalaya, smoke the tomatoes first, in a home smoker, or place them in the oven with a pie plate of smoking chips for a 1/2-hour. This gives the sauce the same flavor as adding sausage. Then use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and add any vegetables of your choice at the end. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 54065,&quot;Peanut Butter-Chocolate Chip-Bacon Cookies 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch of chipotle or ancho cl powder 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 5 strips bacon (1/3 pound) 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup roughly chopped honey- roasted peanuts 1/3 cup bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cl powder and salt in a large bowl. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; reserve 2 tablespoons of the drippings and set aside to cool. Crumble the bacon, discarding any chewy bits. Beat the butter and reserved bacon drippings in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in the peanut butter until combined, about 1 minute. Beat in the granulated and light brown sugar until creamy, about 4 minutes, then add the egg and vanilla and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour mixture in 2 additions, scraping down the bowl as needed, until just combined. Stir in the peanuts and all but 2 tablespoons each of the chocolate chips and bacon. Form the dough into 12 balls and arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Flatten with your fingers (the cookies will not spread in the oven); press the reserved bacon and chocolate chips on top. Bake until golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Let the cookies cool 2 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low and continue simmering about 1 hour. Strain. For the salmon: Place a flameproof roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add the court bouillon and bring to a simmer. Add the salmon, skin-side up. Turn heat to low and bring to a slow simmer. Cook for 5 minutes per inch, measuring the thickest part of the salmon, about 10 to 15 minutes total. The salmon should be cooked to rare (a thin knife can be inserted into the center with slight resistance); keep in mind the salmon will cook a second time later in the recipe. Remove from the poaching liquid and let cool slightly. Break the salmon up into chunks and place in a bowl. Discard the skin and set aside. For the mushroom duxelles: Add the shallots to a food processor and pulse to chop. Add the mushrooms and continue pulsing until a rough puree forms. Add the butter to a medium skillet over medium heat and cook until foaming. Add the shallot and mushroom puree and cook until the mushrooms have released their liquid, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the cream and continue cooking until incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside. For the spinach: Add the butter to a medium skillet over medium heat until foaming, then add the onions. Saute until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the spinach and toss and saute until just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside. For the crepes: Whisk together the eggs, butter and heavy cream in a large bowl. Whisk in both flours until incorporated and a pourable batter forms. Let the batter rest at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour. Heat a 9-inch nonstick crepe pan over medium heat, then add a thin layer of batter (about 1/2 cup). Spread around the pan to completely cover the bottom. Cook until the top is dry and the edges begin to curl up, around 1 minute. Flip and cook another minute, then remove the crepe to a sheet pan and repeat to make additional crepes, using all the batter. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay a thawed sheet of puff pastry on the bottom. Cover the puff pastry with 3 crepes, overlapping a bit. Add half of the cooked spinach followed by half of the salmon, leaving a slight border of puff pastry and crepes around the edges. Make a furrow in the middle of the salmon running the length of the pan, then add the duxelles. Top with the remaining salmon and spinach, in even layers. Cover everything with more crepes, overlapping a bit. Top with the remaining puff pastry sheet. Crimp the edges together to seal. Whisk the egg together with a tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Brush over the top. Brush the melted butter over the egg wash. Using a sharp knife, score the top in a cross-hatch pattern to release steam as it bakes. Bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes. For the beurre blanc: Cook the white wine, champagne vinegar and shallots in a heavy nonreactive saucepan over medium heat to a glaze, about 10 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking until each piece is absorbed before adding the next piece. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to a bare simmer and keep warm.

Mix the vanilla and egg with a fork in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed until the butter has picked up the sugars, about 30 seconds. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 2 minutes.) Increase the speed to medium and beat until slightly creamy, stopping halfway to scrape the bowl, about 1 minute (about 3 minutes with a hand mixer).<br> Reduce the speed to low, slowly add in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture a heaping cup at a time in 2 additions, stopping a few times to scrape the bowl and beaters. (If using a hand mixer, increase the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning.) Once all the flour is just incorporated, add the confetti stars, increase the speed to medium (higher with a hand mixer) and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 2 minutes (about 5 minutes with a hand mixer).<br> Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together.

In a large bowl, toss the potatoes in the olive oil, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on two baking sheets. Place the sheets in the oven and roast until the potatoes are tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, 40 to 50 minutes. Place the dried porcinis in a small bowl and fill with boiling water. Rehydrate the mushrooms for 10 minutes. Strain the liquid and chop the mushrooms. Place the butter in a medium mixing bowl. Add the chopped mushrooms, parsley, thyme, lemon juice and zest, and mix until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve 1/4 cup of the butter at room temperature for a later use. Lay out an 18-inch piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface. Spoon out the remaining butter along the bottom third of the plastic wrap, leaving a 2-inch space on each end. Fold the plastic wrap over the butter and roll it up into a log. Twist the ends to close and roll the tube holding the ends to make sure it&#39;s tightly wrapped. Place in the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes. Remove the plastic and slice half the butter log into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Place the butter rounds on a serving plate. Wrap the remaining half of the butter log in plastic wrap and store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Add the reserved room temperature butter mixture and toss to evenly coat the potatoes. Serve the potatoes with the extra butter rounds on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54091,&quot;Lobster BLTs 4 slices thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, such as Nodine\u2019s 1/2 cup good mayonnaise, such as Hellmann\u2019s 1/4 cup ketchup, such as Heinz 1 tablespoon sweet relish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 ripe Hass avocados, pitted and peeled Juice of 1 lemon 8 (1/2-inch-thick) slices good bakery white bread, lightly toasted (see Cook&#39;s Note) 4 large Bibb, Boston, or butter lettuce leaves 4 (1/4-inch-thick) ripe red tomato slices (1 large tomato) 1/2 pound cooked lobster meat, sliced (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Cut off top of artichoke leaves, creating a flat top. Cut thorns off top of each leaf on artichoke. Gently stretch artichoke from inside to create hole for stuffing. Cut away little purple/white thorny leaves in center. Peel away outer skin of stems so that it is fresh all around. Chop stems into small cubes for stuffing.<br> In a large bowl drizzle olive oil over bread cubes until they&#39;re moist. Add salt and pepper, chopped onion and garlic, sliced olives and chopped stems. Work together with hands. Check olive oil content by squeezing stuffing into a ball in your hand. If it sticks together, there&#39;s enough oil, if not, add more. Stuff mixture tightly into center of artichokes -- as tightly as possible.<br> In a large stove top pot (i.e. Dutch Oven) add water half way up artichokes. Artichokes should be firmly together in pan. Add salt and 1 1/2 cups of extra virgin olive oil to water. Make certain water is high enough but not beyond half way. Bring water to a slow boil in covered pot. Baste leaves around stuffing with broth from the pan every 15 to 20 minutes for approx. 3 hours. When outside leaves are tender they&#39;re done.

Increase the speed to low and knead until the dough is no longer sticky and springs back when pressed with a finger, about 10 minutes. It may still be slightly tacky, which is okay. If the dough gets stuck on the hook at any time during the mixing, stop the machine and pull the dough off the hook, pushing it to the side of the bowl so that it can continue kneading. Move the dough to the counter and shape into a ball. Place in a tall 2- to 4-quart transparent container, pressing down the top to flatten the dough. Mark the dough height on the outside of the bowl with tape or a rubber band. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave to rise at room temperature until the dough is about 1 1/2 times its original size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, line two half sheet pans with parchment paper and have standing by. When the dough has increased to 1 1/2 times its original size, punch the dough down and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 12 (4-ounce) pieces and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Working with one piece at a time, roll each into a 16- to 18-inch-long snake, making sure to pop any large air bubbles, and then wrap around the palm of your hand twice to form a tight circle. With the seam side down and the snake still around your hand, roll your hand across the counter to seal the ends together. (Sometimes my wood board gets so dry, the dough just slides. If that happens, moisten the surface lightly with water. A spritz bottle is perfect for this.) Continue rolling on the counter to seal the seam all the way around the bagel. Transfer to the prepared pans and repeat with the remaining dough, evenly spacing 6 bagels on each tray. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, preferably in the coldest part of your fridge, for 18 to 24 hours. (Tip: I place metal ramekins, the kind you might serve melted butter in, in the corners of the first pan so that I can stack the second pan on top of it without crushing the bagels below. This will save a lot of refrigerator space.) When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and place a rack in the center position. You\u2019ll be boiling, then baking the bagels, so you\u2019ll need to set up a work area around your cooktop. You\u2019ll need to drain the bagels as they come out of the water (a wire rack over a pan or even a kitchen towel will suffice) and you\u2019ll need a fresh piece of parchment to put them on for baking. Remove one pan of bagels from the refrigerator and set by the cooktop until they soften and register between 60 and 65 degrees F, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a gallon of water to a boil over high heat in a wide pot, along with the remaining 80 grams (1/4 cup) of malt syrup and 50 grams (3 tablespoons) of salt. Once the water boils, reduce the heat to a gentle, not rolling, boil. At this point, remove the second pan of bagels from the fridge so they can warm up while you cook the first batch. Check the temperature of the first pan of bagels. If they\u2019re at 60 degrees F, carefully place three into the boiling water, making sure they don\u2019t overlap. (Use your fingers for this.) Boil for 1 minute, flipping if they rise to the surface in 30 seconds or less. (Don\u2019t worry if the bagels don\u2019t fully rise to the surface.) Remove the bagels with a slotted spoon and set them on the rack to drain and cool. Repeat with the other three bagels. As they drain, replace the parchment on their original pan (trust me, they\u2019ll stick if you use the old paper again) and then move the bagels back to it. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the pan and continue baking until the sides of the bagels are golden brown and the bottoms are firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the bagels to a cooling rack. Repeat the same steps with the second pan of bagels. Let all of the bagels cool at least 10 minutes before serving. If you\u2019re not planning to eat all of them in one sitting, slice the cooled bagels, then wrap in plastic wrap, transfer to a gallon-size zip-top freezer bag, and freeze until ready to eat. To reheat, wrap frozen bagels in a paper towel and microwave on high to thaw, 30 seconds to 1 minute, then toast if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54104,&quot;Quinoa Tabouli 1/2 cup quinoa 1 1/2 cups water Bunch of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 1/2 bunch of cilantro, finely chopped 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint 2 ripe tomatoes, halved, seeded,and finely chopped 3 scallions (white and green parts), trimmed and finely chopped Zest and juice of 1 lemon 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper Instructions: Rinse the quinoa under cold water in a fine-mesh sieve. Turn it out into a large microwave-safe bowl and add the water. Cover and microwave on high for 9 minutes. Set aside for 2 minutes and then carefully uncover and fluff with a fork. The quinoa should have a tender snap when you bite it - if it doesn&#39;t, cover and microwave for up to 1 minute longer. Stir the parsley, cilantro, mint, tomatoes, and scallions into the quinoa. Whisk the lemon zest and juice with the olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl to make a vinaigrette and pour it over the quinoa. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 1 hour for the flavors to combine before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 54105,&quot;Blueberry Ginger Mojito Pitchers 1/4 cup grated fresh ginger 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup cold water 1 cup fresh blueberries 1 lime, cut into wedges 20 to 24 fresh mint leaves 4 ounces ginger simple syrup 4 ounces vodka 5 ounces club soda Ice cubes Blueberries, for garnish Mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: Peel and grate the ginger and add it, together with the sugar and cold water, to a saucepan. Bring it to the boil and stir until the sugar dissolves. Cover and let steep for 15 minutes. Strain and cool in the refrigerator when done. Add the blueberries, lime wedges and fresh mint leaves to the glass (or pitcher). Muddle with a wooden spoon so the blueberries are broken and the mint and lime release their juices and flavor. If assembling pitchers you can cover them at this stage and leave in the refrigerator until ready to serve. When ready to serve, add the simple syrup, vodka and top off with club soda. Give it a quick stir and then pour into glasses with ice cubes. Garnish with a handful of fresh blueberries and a sprig of mint. The recipe outlined below is for 2 tall glasses, but you can use the ratio to make pitchers (depending on how big your pitcher is double or quadruple the recipe). Combine the blueberries, mint leaves and lime wedges in the pitcher and muddle it in there with the back of a wooden spoon. When you are ready to serve add the vodka, ginger simple syrup and club soda. Stir and pour into glasses with a couple of ice cubes.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the butter, all-purpose and hazelnut flours, turbinado sugar, baking powder, salt and egg until just combined. Roll thin between 2 pieces of parchment paper or on a silicone mat. Cut into 1-inch rounds and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool. For the sacher sponge cake: Preheat the oven to 335 degrees F and line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the almond paste and confectioners&#39; sugar for about 1 minute. Slowly add the egg yolks until well combined. Add the cocoa powder and flour and mix until combined. Add the melted butter and mix until combined. In a clean mixer bowl, beat the egg whites and granulated sugar using the whip attachment until they hold stiff peaks; fold into the cocoa mixture. Spread in a 9-by-13- inch pan and bake until the cake is lightly golden and springs back to the touch, about 12 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet. Once cool, cut rounds slightly smaller than the base of the hazelnut sugar crust rounds. For the blackberry cream: Soak the sheets of gelatin in a bowl of cold water, making sure they are completely covered, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the blackberry puree, butter, eggs and sugar until it registers 194 degrees F on a candy thermometer, then immediately remove from the heat. Whip the heavy cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Squeeze the water out of the gelatin and add the gelatin to the warm blackberry mixture, stirring to dissolve. Let cool to 90 degrees F, then fold in the whipped cream. Transfer to a pastry bag and pipe into small, round silicone molds. Place a hazelnut crust on top of each. (It should be smaller than the base of the cream to fit just inside the mold.) For the chestnut cream: Soak the gelatin in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes. Combine the milk, egg yolks and granulated sugar in a saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until it registers 165 degrees F and is thickened slightly. (Be careful not to exceed 165 degrees F or the custard may curdle.) Squeeze the water out of the gelatin and add those sheets to the custard, stirring to dissolve. Add to a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, then add the chestnut paste and cream and mix until combined. Chill, then transfer to a pastry bag. Unmold the blackberry domes and place them on top of the sacher sponge rounds. Pipe chestnut cream on top of the blackberry domes. Place toasted hazelnuts and chopped chestnuts on top and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 54110,&quot;Coconut Curry Popcorn 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, diced 1/2 teaspoon whole brown mustard seeds 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 1/4 teaspoon hot smoked paprika 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger 1/8 teaspoon onion powder 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 cup popcorn kernels Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Grate the potatoes and place in the sieve. Grate the parships and carrots and place in another large bowl. Add the onion, dill, matzo meal, salt, and pepper to the parsnip mixture. Using your hands, squeeze the potatoes a palmful at a time over the sieve to remove as much moisture as possible. Add the squeezed potatoes to the parship mixture. When all the potatoes have been squeezed, remove the sieve and carefully pour off the potato liquid while leaving the white potato starch in the bottom. Add the starch to the vegetable mixture. Add 2 eggs and thoroughly combine. Put a scant 1/4 cup of the mixture into the palm of your hand and flatten with your other hand. If the mixture sticks together, you can form the remaining mixture into cakes. If not, add another egg and then form the cakes.

You can use a kitchen mixer to soften your gelato, but make sure that you place the mixer bowl and paddle in the freezer for at least 15 minutes beforehand. Mix the gelato in a chilled bowl until soft but not melting.<br> Take your clean, dry terrine and rub a tiny bit of oil over the entire interior surface using a clean paper towel. Make sure you get into the corners.<br> Line the terrine using a large piece of plastic wrap, leaving at least 6 inches of wrap over the sides. Push into the corners and smooth the wrinkles using a clean dry paper towel. Place the terrine in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill.<br> Remove the chilled terrine and working quickly, spoon the cioccolato scuro gelato into the bottom, filling it by one-third. Push the gelato down firmly into the corners using a small offset spatula. Level the surface, and then freeze for 1 hour.<br> Repeat the process with the white chocolate gelato, freezing for 1 hour, and then repeat with the bacio gelato, freezing for 1 more hour, making sure each layer is firm before adding the next.<br> After leveling the top, pour the chopped caramelized hazelnuts onto the surface. Take the plastic edges and cover the surface, pressing the nuts into the gelato. Freeze overnight.<br> To serve, remove the terrine from the freezer and let stand for about 8 minutes. Using the plastic wrap, slowly lift the gelato out of the terrine. Unwrap the plastic and invert onto a serving tray. You can tip the terrine on its side to view the nuts.<br> Run your knife under very hot water, wipe dry and slice the terrine. Do this before each slice. Serve it in slices, sandwiched between rectangular homemade sugar cookies or simply with some warm chocolate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 54154,&quot;Biscotti 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 3/4 cup canola oil<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 3 large eggs<br> Add ins: 1/2 to 3/4 cup (total) of your favorites, such as toasted coconut, raisins, walnuts, etc. (I use semisweet chocolate chips and then throw in a chopped-up toffee bar)<br> Cinnamon sugar, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a smaller bowl, whisk the egg with the granulated sugar until pale. Whisk the milk into the egg mixture, then gently fold into the flour mixture. It should be a bit thicker than pancake batter but thin enough to pour. Add up to 3 tablespoons milk to loosen the batter, if needed. Heat about 2 inches of canola oil in a large high-sided skillet or pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375. Meanwhile, mix the confectioners&#39; sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Hold a funnel in one hand with your finger plugging the hole at the bottom. Pour 1 cup batter into the funnel. Hold the funnel over the hot oil and remove your finger from the hole, letting the batter drop in a spiral pattern all over the surface of the oil. It will look like lots of individual pieces at first, but as you continue to add batter, the pieces will fuse together. Cook until the batter floats and the underside is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Flip with tongs and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 30 more seconds. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and repeat to make 5 more funnel cakes. Dust with the cinnamon-sugar and serve with whipped cream and/or fruit sauce, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 54159,&quot;Cast-Iron \Fruit Cake<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1 pint blackberries<br> 1 cup canned diced pineapple, drained Leaves from 2 sprigs thyme Pinch kosher salt<br> 1 box yellow cake mix (I like Duncan Hines)<br> 12 ounces creme fraiche 2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> Seeds from 1/2 vanilla bean Zest of 1/2 lemon Pinch kosher salt Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Season the steaks with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large saut pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and the butter has melted, add the steaks and sear until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Set the steaks aside on a plate. To the same pan, add the garlic and shallot and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any of the flavorsome steak residue into the mixture, for about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the brandy. (If the pan ignites, stand back and allow the flame to disappear, which it will in a few seconds.) Return the pan to the heat and bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan again. Simmer until the brandy is almost totally reduced, about 2 minutes. Add the broth, cream, mustard and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine, then cook for a minute to thicken. Plate up the steak and pour over the sauce. Garnish with the parsley and chives and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Pinot Noir]&quot; 54161,&quot;Lobster Tandoori 1 live lobster 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 clove garlic, chopped One 1-inch piece of ginger, chopped 1/2 small onion, chopped 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon garam masala 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/4 teaspoon red chili powder A pinch of salt A pinch of pepper 1/4 cup plain yogurt 1/2 teaspoon honey Juice of 1/2 lime 1/4 cup grated white Cheddar Slices of lemon, for serving Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut the rubber bands off of the lobster claws and then plunge the live lobsters into the pot. Cover tightly with a lid and cook for 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the water. When they are cool enough to handle, pull off the claws and cut each lobster in half lengthwise, taking care to keep the shell halves intact (you will need these shells to complete the recipe). Remove the tail meat and clean the lobster shells by removing the green tomalley and rinsing well under cold water. Place them on a baking sheet. Crack the claws open and remove the claw and knuckle meat. Discard the claw shells. Heat the oil in a small skillet and add the garlic, ginger and onions, and fry until they begin to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Add the cardamom, cumin, garam masala, smoked paprika, red chili powder, salt and pepper, and cook for 1 minute, mashing it into a paste. Put the yogurt, honey, lime juice and spice paste into a large bowl and whisk until well combined. Chop the lobster meat and stir into the marinade. Place an oven rack at the top of the oven and preheat to broil. Spoon the marinated lobster meat into the reserved lobster shells. Sprinkle each lobster half with 2 tablespoons grated cheese, and then place in the oven and broil until they are golden and bubbling, about 5 minutes.

In a coffee grinder dedicated to spices or with a mortar and pestle, grind the juniper berries, coriander seeds, star anise, salt and peppercorns together into a powder. Rub all sides of the chops with the spice mixture. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large saute pan (deep enough to accommodate the chops and sauce) and sear the chops, leaving undisturbed for 2 minutes on each side to allow the spices to integrate into the surface of the meat. Remove chops to a utility platter. In the same pan, over medium-high heat, saute the shallots until translucent. Add the mushrooms and cook until they give up their juices. Add the wine and let cook for about 5 minutes. Then reduce heat to medium-low, return the chops to the pan, cover, and let cook until the chops are tender, about 35 minutes. Transfer the chops to a platter and increase the heat under the pan of mushrooms and sauce and allow to reduce by two-thirds. While the chops are cooking and the sauce is reducing, prepare the bulgur porridge which was traditionally served with venison as a digestive aid. Because it is pre-steamed, it can be soaked in boiling water to make it meal-ready. Put bulgur and salt in a mixing bowl. Add 2 1/2 cups boiling water, cover and let stand for 30 minutes. To serve, place some bulgur porridge in the middle of each serving plate. Top with a venison chop and spoon mushrooms and sauce over and around. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 54163,&quot;Salty Lemonade One 1.6-quart container store-bought lemonade 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus additional as needed<br> Instructions: Stir together the lemonade and salt in a large pitcher until the salt is fully dissolved.

Yogurt adds subtle flavor and helps keep the cake moist. Recipe by Nancy Baggett. Preheat oven to 350degreesF. Very generously coat a 10-inch Bundt or tube pan with cooking spray. Dust the pan with flour, tapping out the excess. To prepare cherry filling: Combine sugar and cornstarch in a medium nonreactive saucepan (see Note). Stir in cherries, kirsch (or orange juice), lemon zest and almond extract. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture looks like very thick jam and has reduced to about 1 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. To prepare cake: Sift cake flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a medium bowl. Beat sugar, butter and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low, then medium speed, until very light and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes, scraping the sides as needed. Add half the yogurt and beat until very smooth. With the mixer on low speed, beat in half the dry ingredients until incorporated. Beat in the remaining yogurt, eggs, vanilla and almond extract until combined, scraping the sides as needed. Stir in the remaining dry ingredients just until incorporated. Spoon a generous half of the batter into the prepared pan, spreading to the edges. Spoon the cherry mixture over the batter. Top with the remaining batter. Grease a butter knife and swirl it vertically through the batter and cherries. Bake the cake until a toothpick inserted in the thickest part comes out with no crumbs clinging to it and the top springs back when lightly pressed, 50 to 65 minutes. (Dark-colored metal pans usually bake cakes faster than light-colored or shiny metal pans.) Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let stand until the cake is completely cooled, about 1 1/2 hours. Very carefully run a knife around the edges and center tube to loosen the cake from sides and bottom. Rap the pan sharply against the counter several times to loosen completely. Invert the pan onto a serving plate and slide the cake out. Dust the top with confectioners&#39; sugar before serving.

Heat a 12-inch non-stick saute pan over a high flame. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Add a small amount of oil to the pan and sear both sides of the salmon quickly, just a few seconds on each side, leaving the fish very rare. Remove the pan from the heat, and place the fish on a work surface. Wipe out the pan and reserve for later use. Spread a 1/4-inch layer of pesto evenly over 1 side of the fillet. Sprinkle the top of the pesto with a light, thin dusting of fresh bread crumbs. Carefully invert each fillet into the pan and place it over a medium flame. Toast the bread coating, adding tiny bits of butter to the pan that will melt into the salmon underneath. Once the bread is toasted (after about 1 minute), place the pan in the oven for about 3 minutes, just to heat the fish through. To serve, mound 1/6 of the spinach in the center of a warm dinner plate. Invert 1 salmon fillet onto the spinach, crust-side up, and ladle citrus soy sauce around the sides. Place 1 orange segment on top of 1 grapefruit segment in the sauce at 3 different points on the plate. In the bowl of a food processor place, pine nuts, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add the basil and process again. With the motor running, add the oil in a stream slowly, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Add bread crumbs a little at a time, just enough to make pesto spreadable. Process and repeat until the pesto is the right consistency. Remove from food processor and set aside until ready to use. In a non-reactive saucepan, saute the ginger in 1 tablespoon olive oil for 1 minute over medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic and continue cooking for 1 minute longer. Deglaze the pan with white wine, champagne vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, and all 3 fruit juices. Reduce the liquid volume down to 1 cup. Add the chicken stock, bring it to a boil, and cook another 3 minutes. Strain, pushing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible, and place the liquid into a blender or food processor. With the motor running on low, add the remaining olive oil in a slow stream until all the oil is incorporated. Wash spinach thoroughly and drain, leaving some of the water clinging to the leaves. In a 12-inch saute pan over medium heat, saute the spinach in a small amount of olive oil until it is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain excess moisture, season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Peel potatoes and slice thin in a criss-cross cut on the zig-zag part of the mandolin. Lay out the slices on a baking sheet. Brush with clarified butter and bake until crisp, about 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 54168,&quot;Wiener Schnitzel 1 lemon, halved 1/4 cup clover honey<br> 1/4 cup Dijon mustard<br> 2 heaping tablespoons prepared horseradish, drained<br> 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 pound fingerling potatoes Kosher salt 1 tablespoon canola oil<br> 1/2 pound slab bacon, finely diced<br> 2 shallots, finely diced<br> 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 heaping tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup finely diced cornichons<br> 2 cups fresh beet juice 1 tablespoon clover honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cups fresh breadcrumbs 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 7 large eggs<br> 4 veal shoulder cutlets (about 5 ounces each), pounded thin 1 cup canola oil 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> Instructions: For the lemon sauce: Heat a nonstick pan over high heat, place the lemon halves in the pan cut-sides down and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove and let cool slightly. Whisk together the honey, mustard and horseradish in a medium bowl, squeeze in the juice from the seared lemon and add the dill, mint and salt and pepper to taste. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. For the potato salad: Cover the potatoes with cold, salted water and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and continue to cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain and slice the potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until golden brown and slightly crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Add the shallots to the pan and cook until soft. Add the vinegar and sugar and cook until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat, whisk in the mustard, add the potatoes and cornichon and gently mix until combined. Transfer to a platter and top with the crisp bacon. For the beet reduction: Bring the beet juice to a boil in a small nonreactive pan over high heat. Cook until thickened and reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 12 minutes. Add the honey and season with the salt and pepper. Let cool slightly. For the wiener schnitzel: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Spread the breadcrumbs out on a baking sheet and bake until pale and dried, about 12 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Set 2 baking racks on 2 baking sheets. Put the flour in a baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Put 3 of the eggs in another baking dish with a few tablespoons of water, whisk until smooth and season with salt and pepper. Put the breadcrumbs in a third baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Season the veal on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge in the flour and tap off the excess. Dredge in the eggs, letting the excess run off. Dredge in the breadcrumbs and tap off the excess. Place on one of the baking racks. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook the veal, one cutlet at a time, until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side. Place on the second baking rack and finish cooking in the oven for 5 minutes. Melt the butter over medium heat in a 12-inch straight-sided skillet. Crack the remaining 4 eggs into the pan, season the tops with salt and pepper and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are slightly firm, about 2 minutes. Gently flip and continue cooking until the other side is just slightly set, about 30 seconds. To serve: Divide the wiener schnitzel among large plates, drizzle with the lemon sauce, top each with a fried egg and drizzle with the beet reduction.

Toast the guajillo chiles, california chiles, and chiles de arbol on the grill until they are charred in spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside to cool, then remove the stems and seeds and cut them in half. Put aside 6 guajillo halves. Soak the rest of the chiles in water, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, add the coriander, cumin, oregano, peppercorns, allspice, ginger, cloves, bay leaves, garlic and onion to a blender, and add enough of the soaked chiles to come about halfway up the blender cup. Add 1/2 cup of the cl soaking liquid and 1 cup water and process until very well blended and runny. Transfer to a large bowl. Blend the remaining soaked chiles with more water as needed.

Add the lemon juice and continue whipping until completely incorporated, about 3 minutes. The lemon juice whitens the royal icing. The royal icing should be light, fluffy, and slightly stiff. You may need to adjust the consistency by adding more egg whites if the icing is too dry or more powdered sugar if it is too wet. Make a cornet and fill it half full with royal icing. Cover the remaining icing with a damp cloth to keep it from drying out while you work. It will be much easier to decorate the cake if you place it on a turntable. Use the royal icing to make decorations as you desire. Make as many cornets as needed to complete the design. You can use a cornet filled with royal icing to fill in the seams and edges where the cakes meet. Decorate with dots, swags, or any other design. The royal icing will harden as it dries. Piping fine decorations with royal icing takes some practice but you will improve with time. To train your hands and practice piping, try this exercise: use a medium-point magic marker to draw the desired pattern on a sheet of parchment paper. Repeat the pattern several times to allow for practice. Place another sheet of parchment paper over the designs and tape both pieces to the work surface to keep them from moving. Use a cornet filled with royal icing to trace the pattern. When you feel you have had enough practice, place the cake in front of you and repeat the patterns on the cake, instead of on the parchment paper. For different widths of decoration, use several cornets and cut the ends into different-sized openings. With royal icing, if you make a mistake, you can just wipe it off! The royal icing will harden as it dries. Flowers are widely used to decorate cakes. Usually, when the flowers are not fresh, they are made from gum paste. You can make your own or buy them already made from a specialty baking supply store. I would suggest buying them since they are very reasonably priced compared to the time and energy it takes to make them. Gum paste flowers can be reused or stored in an airtight container for any celebration. Remember to handle them with care because they will chip or break. If you have your own garden, pick some lovely blooms and use them to decorate the cake. Don&#39;t forget to use the natural greens to decorate around the base of the cake. Be sure you know which varieties of flowers and greens are safe to use; there are some that are poisonous. Flowers that are safe to use include: apple blossoms, citrus blossoms, day lilies, English daisies, pansies, roses, tulips, lilacs, and violets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 54185,&quot;Death in the Afternoon Cocktail Dash absinthe 4 to 6 ounces good-quality champagne or sparkling wine, for topping 1 piece lemon peel 1 sugar cube Instructions: Add a dash of absinthe to a champagne flute and swirl it around the flute until it is coated; pour out any excess.

Prepare the cake mixes as directed; pour 1 1/2 cups batter into the square pan and divide the rest between the other two pans. Bake at 350 degrees F, 15 minutes for the square cake and 20 to 25 minutes for the 9-by-13-inch cakes. Let the cakes cool slightly; remove to racks to cool completely. Stack the 9-by-13-inch cakes on a cutting board with frosting in between them. Cover the sides of the cakes with a thin layer of frosting, filling in any gaps between the layers. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Make the field: Trim off 3 1/2 inches from one side of the square cake; use the larger piece for the field. Reserve the trimmings. Put 1/2 cup coconut in a resealable plastic bag; add a few drops of green food coloring and massage until tinted. Repeat with 1/4 cup coconut, using red and yellow food coloring to tint it orange (or use your own team colors). Place the rectangular field on a large cake board (about 10 by 13 inches). Spread with frosting, then cover most of the field with the green coconut and the end zones with the orange coconut, pressing the coconut into the frosting. Make the goalposts: Trim 2 lollipop sticks to 2 inches. Melt the candy melts in the microwave; cool slightly, then transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip a corner. Pipe two goalpost tops onto parchment; add a stick to each and pipe over them to secure. Let dry. Cut the 9-by-13-inch layer cake lengthwise into thirds. Cut each strip of cake on the diagonal to make the sloped sides of the stadium; reserve the trimmings. Cut the center strip of cake in half to form the short ends of the stadium. Arrange the cake strips around the field, trimming as needed. Remove the field and set aside. Round out the corners of the stadium using a serrated knife to form an oval shape; reserve the trimmings. Crumble all of the reserved cake trimmings and mix in just enough frosting to moisten. Clump the mixture together with your fingers. With damp hands, use the crumbled cake mixture to fill in the gaps and form a uniform oval stadium with sloped sides. Trim the cake board as needed so it doesn?t show. Frost the entire stadium. Coat the sloped parts with the nonpareils to look like fans. Press the remaining white coconut around the outside of the cake. Return the field to the stadium and pipe yard lines across it with frosting. Add the goalposts. Pipe the remaining frosting around the top edges of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 54196,&quot;Cucumber-Mint Iced Tea 4 green tea bags 1 cup lightly-packed mint leaves, plus 12 sprigs for garnish 1 cucumber, unpeeled, cut into1/8-inch slices ? cup honey Instructions: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.

Season to taste with the salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 54216,&quot;Rum Raisin Truffles 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 26 ounces good milk chocolate, chopped, divided 1 1/2 ounces raisins (about 2 tablespoons) 1/4 cup dark rum, such as Mount Gay Instructions: In a heat-proof bowl set over simmering water, heat the cream until hot to the touch but not boiling and turn off the heat. Add the butter and 12 ounces of the chocolate to the hot cream. Stir until the chocolate melts. Meanwhile, mince the raisins and combine them with the rum in a small bowl. Stir the raisins and rum mixture into the melted chocolate mixture, cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 6 hours or overnight. The next day, using a very small (1 1/4-inch) ice cream scoop (you can also use 2 spoons), scoop balls of the mixture onto sheet pans lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. When the chocolate is cold, place 10 ounces of the remaining chocolate in a small glass bowl and heat it in a microwave on high for 20 seconds exactly. Stir the chocolate and continue to heat it in the microwave for 20 seconds at a time, stirring in between, until the chocolate is smooth and shiny. This will take 5 or 6 times, depending on your microwave. Add the remaining 4 ounces of chocolate and stir until smooth. The chocolate should be 85 degrees F to 90 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. If it?s too cool, heat it briefly in the microwave. You?ll want it to be pourable. Using 2 spoons, pick up a chilled ball in one spoon and warm chocolate in the other and roll them around together until the chilled ball is completely coated in warm chocolate (don?t drop the ball into the chocolate or the warm chocolate will cool off!). Place the coated truffle back on the parchment paper. Continue coating the balls until they?re all covered with milk chocolate. Allow to sit at room temperature until the chocolate hardens. Serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 54217,&quot;Beef and Bell Peppers En Brochette 3 pounds London broil 2 teaspoons Irvine Spices Smokey Rotisserie Seasoning 1 cup red wine (1/2 cup for marinating and 1/2 cup for sauce) 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon olive oil 3 red bell peppers, stem and seeds removed and cut into 1-inch pieces 3 yellow bell peppers, stem and seeds removed and cut into 1-inch pieces 3 white onions, peeled and cut into 1-inch wedges 12 to 16 long wooden skewers, soaked in water for at least 25 minutes Instructions: Rinse the meat to remove any unwanted smells and pat dry with paper toweling.

Separate the claws from the lobster bodies and carefully stuff each lobster tail with a spoon handle, inserting at the fan end (this will help keep the lobster tails straight as they cook). Add the lobsters and claws to the boiling water and cook for about 6 minutes. Shock in ice water until cool to the touch. Remove the spoons. Split each lobster in half. Remove the tomalley from the lobster bodies and add to a medium heatproof bowl. Set aside. Clean out the shells of the bodies, as we will be filling them later. Set aside the lobsters on a sheet tray. Remove the claw meat from the shell and chop. Mix the chopped claw meat with the parsley, sun-dried tomatoes, celery, capers and zest in a bowl. Set aside. For the breadcrumbs: Melt the butter in a small saucepan and cook until browned. Place the panko, parsley and lemon zest in a blender and slowly add the brown butter until smooth. Set aside. For the sabayon: Place the lemon juice, roe, yolks and a pinch of salt in the bowl with the tomalley and set over a small pot of simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly and occasionally removing the bowl from the pot to prevent the mixture from getting too hot and curdling, until the mixture has thickened, about 4 minutes. (The whisk should leave a trail when pulled through the mixture.) Turn off the heat but leave the bowl in place to keep warm. For the couscous: Add the butter to a large, high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat and allow to brown. Add the Israeli couscous to the browned butter and stir to combine. Allow the couscous to toast, about 1 minute. Slowly start adding the lobster stock and cook until absorbed, continually adding lobster stock as needed (similar to risotto), until all the liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add the parsley, garlic, olive oil, walnuts, lemon zest and juice and salt to a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add the pesto to the couscous and stir to combine. Preheat the broiler. Filled the cleaned out lobster bodies with the lobster salad. Cover the lobster salad with the sabayon. Spread the breadcrumb mixture over the lobster tails. Broil the lobsters until the breadcrumbs and sabayon are browned, about 5 minutes. Pour the couscous onto a large, shallow serving platter. Top with the broiled lobsters. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 54245,&quot;Chocolate Layer Cake Cooking spray 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (sift, then measure), plus more for dusting 2 cups hot strong coffee 1 1/2 cups natural unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process) 2 teaspoons salt 1 tablespoon baking soda 1 tablespoon baking powder 4 cups sugar 4 large eggs 1 cup vegetable oil 4 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/2 pounds bittersweet chocolate, chopped 3 1/3 cups heavy cream 4 ounces white chocolate, finely chopped 4 ounces milk chocolate, finely chopped 8 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped Instructions: Prep the pans: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fold a large sheet of parchment paper in half; put a 10-inch-round cake pan on top. Trace the cake pan, then cut out the circle to make two rounds of parchment. Spray two 10-inch cake pans with cooking spray; fit a parchment round into each. Spray the pans again, then dust with flour and tap out the excess. Make the batter: Pour the coffee into a liquid measuring cup or bowl; whisk in the cocoa powder. Put the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer; mix with the paddle attachment on low speed, 1 minute. Add the eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla and 2 cups water; beat on medium speed, 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; beat in the coffee-cocoa mixture in a slow stream until combined. The batter will be thin. Bake the cakes: Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool in the pans on a rack, 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto the rack to cool completely. Place each cake on a 10-inch cardboard cake circle (this helps stabilize the layers as you move them around), wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Make the ganache: Pulverize the bittersweet chocolate in a large food processor. Bring the cream just to a boil. With the motor running, pour the hot cream through the feed tube; process until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and set in a bowl of ice water. Chill, stirring often, until the ganache is cool but not stiff, about 20 minutes. Make the bark: Microwave the white chocolate in 15-second intervals until two-thirds melted; stir to fully melt. Scrape into a zip-top bag and seal. Put a plastic sheet protector on each of 2 baking sheets. Snip a corner of the bag; pipe thin lines of white chocolate over the sheets. Refrigerate the baking sheets until the white chocolate is set, about 10 minutes, then repeat the process with the milk chocolate, piping thin lines over the white chocolate. Refrigerate until the milk chocolate is set. Melt the bittersweet chocolate in the same way, then spread over the white and milk chocolate lines using an offset spatula. Refrigerate until hard, about 30 minutes. Peel the sheet protectors off the chocolate and break the chocolate sheets into shards of various sizes. Slice the layers: Put one cake on a cake turntable. Position a long serrated knife against the side of the cake, about halfway down. Slowly rotate the turntable so the knife slices the cake in half horizontally. Don&#39;t move the knife much-let the rotation of the turntable do the work. Repeat with the other cake to make 4 layers; transfer each to a cardboard circle. (If you don&#39;t have a turntable, carefully slice the cakes in half on a cutting board.) Frost the cake: Transfer half of the ganache to a bowl and whisk until light brown and fluffy. Place one cake layer (still on a cardboard circle) on the turntable; spoon one-third of the whipped ganache on top. Rotate the turntable to smooth the ganache with a long spatula (or just assemble and frost on a cake plate). Repeat to sandwich all 4 cake layers with whipped ganache. Spread all but about 1/2 cup of the unwhipped ganache over the top and sides of the cake. Decorate the cake: Press the chocolate bark against the sides of the cake, using small dollops of the remaining ganache to help the pieces stick, if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 54246,&quot;Grilled Filet of Beef with Jamican Rum Glaze 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 shallots minced 3 gloves garlic, minced 1 cup Myer&#39;s dark rum 3 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons ancho puree 2 tablespoons molasses Salt and freshly ground pepper 4 filet mignon steaks, 8 ounces each Instructions: Melt the butter in a saucepan over mediumhigh heat and sweat the shallots and garlic.

Place 1/2 cup of the cheese in an airtight container in the refrigerator for serving. Reserve the remaining cheese for the filling. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until foamy, but not brown. Add the leeks, shallots and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and translucent, but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add the peas and cook until heated through and softened, but still bright green, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and add the lemon zest, 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the reserved Asiago. Process, scraping down the sides as needed, until smooth. Let cool to room temperature, then transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch-wide plain tip. For the pasta dough: Whisk the oil, whole eggs and yolk with a fork in a large liquid measuring cup. Put the flour and a large pinch of salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to combine. With the motor running, slowly add the egg mixture through the feed tube and process until the dough forms a ball around the blade. (If the dough is too sticky to form a ball, add a tablespoon or so of flour and process again. If it is too crumbly to form a ball, add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and process again.) Once the dough forms a ball, process until smooth and springy, 20 to 30 seconds.\u202f\u202f Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead several times until it comes together in a smooth ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. (The dough can be made 1 day ahead, wrapped and refrigerated. Let it come to room temperature before rolling.)\u202f Anchor a pasta machine to your countertop or fit a stand mixer with the pasta attachment. Set the machine to the widest setting. Unwrap the dough and cut it into 4 equal pieces. Wrap 3 of the pieces while you work with the fourth.\u202f\u202f Flatten the dough piece into a rectangle and lightly dust with flour. Roll it through the pasta machine. Fold the dough in thirds like a letter and feed it through the pasta machine. Repeat the folding and feeding of the dough through the machine 2 more times. (Rolling and folding in this manner will help strengthen and smooth the dough.)\u202f\u202f Set the pasta machine to the next setting (one setting thinner than the widest). Flour the dough as necessary and feed it through the machine. Repeat, feeding it through one more time. Adjust the machine to the next thinnest setting and feed the dough through 2 times as above. Continue changing the setting and feeding the dough through 2 times for each setting until you have fed the dough through the second-to-last setting. The dough should be thin enough to see your hand through. Cover the dough sheet with plastic wrap. Repeat the folding and rolling process with the 3 remaining pieces of dough, covering each dough sheet as you finish.\u202f Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour. Starting 1 inch from one end of a sheet of dough, pipe an even line of filling all the way down it, stopping 1 inch from the other end. Fold the dough over so that it extends about 1 inch past the filling and press to seal the long edge. Trim the excess dough from the sealed side with a fluted pasta wheel. Seal the ends by pinching them together. With your thumb and forefinger, pinch every inch along the dough sheet to make little pockets of filling (short fingernails work best here so the dough doesn&#39;t tear). Use the fluted pasta wheel to cut between each pocket, starting closest to you and pushing firmly away, creating little purses. Transfer to the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Refrigerate until ready to cook. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Combine the lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons water and remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a large skillet. Heat over medium heat, swirling often, until the butter is melted and the sauce is emulsified. Add the agnolotti to the boiling water and stir. Once they float to the surface, let them cook for about 1 minute. Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the agnolotti to the skillet and coat in the sauce. Gently transfer to a warm serving platter, top with the reserved 1/2 cup Asiago and sprinkle with the mint and black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo]&quot; 54269,&quot;Miso Caramel Cracker Cookies 11 ounces store-bought caramels 2 tablespoons heavy cream<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons white miso paste<br> About 2 1/2 sleeves butter crackers, such as Ritz (about 72 crackers)<br> 8 ounces chopped dark chocolate or dark chocolate chips<br> Flaky salt, such as Maldon, for topping Sprinkles, for topping Instructions: In a medium pot, combine the caramels and heavy cream. Heat over medium low, stirring, until the caramels are melted and the mixture is smooth, about 7 minutes. Stir in the miso and remove from the heat. Let cool for a few minutes, so the caramel can thicken slightly. Arrange half of the crackers salty-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment and dollop on about 1 teaspoon caramel per cracker (or as much as will fit without spilling over the edges\u2026but it&#39;s ok if it spills off a little). Top each with another cracker salty-side up. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. In a double boiler or a microwave in 30-second increments, melt the chocolate, stirring until smooth. Let cool slightly. Dip the crackers halfway into the chocolate and place back on the baking sheet. Sprinkle with flaky salt and sprinkles.

In a saucepan, melt the butter for the bechamel, and add the flour, stirring gently to make a smooth paste. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the milk. Turn the heat back on to medium, and stir the bechamel until it begins to thicken and come to the boil. Let it bubble for about 5 minutes to get rid of the floury taste. Take off the heat and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and the oil in a large wide pan. Drain the porcini, reserving the liquid, and chop before adding to the pan with 3/4 cup chopped parsley, the dried or fresh thyme, and garlic. Stir for a couple of minutes then melt the remaining 1 stick of butter in the same pan and add the chopped mushrooms, stirring for about 5 minutes. The mushrooms will appear dry at first but will eventually start to give off some liquid. Add the porcini soaking liquid, which the mushrooms will largely absorb, but keep stirring and add the sherry and let it bubble away. Turn off the heat when you have a bronzed, syrupy stew. Stir the mushroom mixture into the bechamel and add 1 cup of the Parmesan and the other 3/4 cup of the chopped parsley. Put a big pan of water on for the pasta, and when it boils, salt it well. Cook the pasta until al dente, then drain and add to the mushroomy white sauce, stirring it as best you can to get the pasta covered. Turn into the large roasting pan and sprinkle over the remaining 1 cup of Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes or until the top begins to turn golden in places.

Ganache: In a small pot, over low heat, heat the cream with the cinnamon and orange zest. Use the pot of cream as the bottom of a double boiler and melt the chocolate, in a bowl, over the cream. When the chocolate has melted and the cream is heated, transfer the cream to a bowl and allow the chocolate and cream to cool slightly and separately. When somewhat warm, whisk the cream and the chocolate together to combine. Put the ganache in the refrigerator to cool. Crostata: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt and lemon zest. Pulse the mixture to blend. Add the butter and continue pulsing to integrate and give the dough the consistency of a \gravel driveway.<br> With the processor running, pour 2 tablespoons of ice water through the hole in the top of the machine and process until the dough looks like wet sand, adding more water if necessary, until it finally gathers into a ball. Remove the dough from the food processor and flatten it between 2 pieces of floured parchment paper on a baking sheet. Chill and allow it to rest for about 30 minutes. Roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness and cut out 8 (5 1/2-inch) circles. Make sure you lightly flour under and over the dough as you roll it. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush any excess flour off the dough before putting a spoonful of the cooled ganache in the center of each circle. Fold the sides up around it, making the chocolate the center of a small \money purse.\ Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven to a serving platter. Put any remaining ganache in the cavities of the crostada. Serve immediately with sour cream, whipped cream, or ice cream, if desired.

Remove teabags and add sweetener to taste. Stir in 6 cups ice cubes until melted. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. Makes two quarts. For the chicken: Prepare an outdoor grill so that you have medium-hot heat for both direct and indirect grilling (move hot coals to just one side of the grill, or turn on only half the burners on a gas grill or under a grill pan). Once hot, brush the grill grates with oil. Pat the chicken dry and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and a couple turns of pepper. Grill the chicken, skin-side up, over direct heat (the hotter side) until lightly charred, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until faint grill marks appear on the skin, 3 to 5 minutes more. Flip again and move the chicken to the indirect side of the grill (the cooler side). Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 160 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add the chili powder and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add the ketchup, peach preserves and 1/2 cup water and bring to a simmer. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 8 minutes. Add the pickles. Puree with an immersion blender or transfer to a blender. Set aside 1 cup of the sauce for serving. When the chicken is fully cooked, begin basting it with some of the remaining BBQ sauce and move it back to direct heat. Continue to baste it, gently flipping often, until glazed and lightly charred, about 5 minutes. Serve with the reserved BBQ sauce on the side and the iced tea. Note: When blending hot liquid, first let it cool for five minutes or so, then transfer it to a blender, filling only halfway. Put the lid on, leaving one corner open.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Zinfandel, Malbec]&quot; 54317,&quot;Stuffing Waffles with Cranberry Concord Syrup 1 pound frozen cranberries 1 1/4 cups concord grape jam<br> 3/4 cup concord grape juice<br> 1/3 cup sugar<br> One 3-inch strip orange zest<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the waffle iron 4 1/2 cups leftover stuffing, such as Cranberry-Walnut Stuffing, recipe follows 1/3 cup milk<br> 3 large eggs<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the baking dish 1 1/2 cups walnuts<br> 8 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casings removed<br> 2 celery stalks, chopped<br> 1 medium onion, chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup dried cranberries<br> One 14-ounce package cornbread stuffing mix<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage<br> 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme<br> 2 cups turkey or chicken stock<br> 1 large egg, lightly beaten<br> Instructions: For the cranberry concord syrup: Combine the cranberries, grape jam, grape juice, sugar and orange zest in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries are very soft and easily break apart when pushed with a wooden spoon, about 20 minutes. Do not simmer too hard or the sauce may boil over. For the stuffing waffles: Meanwhile, preheat a waffle iron to medium high and spray the top and bottom with cooking spray. Break up the stuffing into small crumbles in a medium bowl, then mix in the milk and eggs. Pack the stuffing mixture evenly into the waffle iron, then close it and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and tent loosely with foil. Repeat with the remaining stuffing mixture. Serve the waffles topped with the warm cranberry concord syrup. Any leftover syrup can be refrigerated for 1 week. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter a 2- to 3-quart glass or ceramic baking dish. In a dry saute pan over medium heat, toast the walnuts until lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes. Cool and chop. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon, until brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the celery, onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in the cranberries and cook to just slightly plump them, about 1 minute, then remove from the heat. In a large mixing bowl, add the stuffing mix, sage, thyme and walnuts. In a large measuring cup, mix together the stock and egg and then add it to the mixing bowl along with the vegetable-sausage mixture. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper and stir gently to combine thoroughly. Transfer the stuffing mixture to the baking dish and bake until hot and golden brown on top, 30 to 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 54318,&quot;Best Lemonade 2 teaspoons grated fresh lemon peel 2 cups sugar 1/2 cup water</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/quartered and scored.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Preheat%20the%20oven%20to%20500.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Preheat the oven to 500</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/Roasted%20Carrots.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Roasted Carrots</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
