cooked orzo, at room temperature 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 cup finely shredded green cabbage 1/2 cup finely shredded radicchio 2 tablespoons rice vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper Vegetable sandwiches, for serving Instructions: Set the pasta in a mixing bowl. In a skillet heat the olive oil. Add the garlic, cabbage and radicchio and stir fry for 30 seconds. Remove from heat and add rice vinegar; season to taste with salt and pepper and immediately stir with pasta. Adjust the seasoning and serve alongside or as a bed for vegetable sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 63094,&quot;Southwestern Style Potato Latkes 1-1/2 pounds russet potatoes peeled 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 2 tablespoons flour (or more) or matzo meal (during Passover) 2 tablespoons chopped herbs such as cilantro, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil for frying Rasoted red peppers and salsa for garnish Instructions: In a food processor grate the potatoes. Line a sieve with cheesecloth and transfer potatoes to the sieve. Set sieve over a bowl, twist cheesecloth into a pouch, squeezing out some moisture. Let mixture drain for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, pour off liquid from the bowl but leave the white potato starch that settles in the bottom of the bowl. To that starch add eggs, flour,herbs, 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt and freshly ground pepper. Return drained potatoes to this mixture and toss to combine. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Line a baking pan with paper towels. When you are ready to eat, in a large skillet heat 1/4 inch of oil over medium high heat until hot. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of potato mixture and cook for 3 to 4 minutes a side; latkes should be golden and crisp on both sides. Eat right away or keep warm in oven. Serve topped with slivers of roasted red peppers,and salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63095,&quot;Bourbon Apple Pie 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/8 teaspoon baking powder Pinch of salt 1/4 cup cold vegetable shortening 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 tablespoon bourbon 8 to 10 tablespoons ice water 1 large egg, lightly beaten Coarse sugar, for sprinkling 4 pounds assorted apples (such as McIntosh, Honeycrisp, Braeburn, Granny Smith and/or Golden Delicious) 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon bourbon 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger Instructions: Make the crust: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a food processor to combine. Add the shortening and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Add the bourbon and pulse until just incorporated. Pulse in the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough holds together when pinched. Turn out the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap and gather together, using the plastic wrap to help you. Divide into 2 pieces and gently pat each into a disk; wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Make the filling: Peel the apples and slice about ? inch thick. Toss with the lemon juice and ? cup bourbon. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the apples and sprinkle with half of the granulated sugar. Cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the apples soften, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Add 2 more tablespoons butter to the skillet and repeat with the remaining apples and sugar. Add to the bowl and toss with the cinnamon and ginger. Let cool completely. Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Transfer to a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. Spoon the apple filling into the prepared pie crust. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon bourbon and dot with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Lay the dough round over the filling. Pinch the overhanging dough together and fold under itself; crimp the edge with your fingers. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush the crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Refrigerate 1 hour. Put a baking sheet on the lowest oven rack; preheat to 400 degrees F. Bake the pie on the hot baking sheet until the crust is golden, 60 to 70 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool at least 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]</p><p>&quot; 63096,&quot;Apple-Pumpkin Brown Betty 1 2-to-3-pound sugar pumpkin 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup cubed bread (preferably from a baguette) 2 Gala apples, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup golden raisins 1 tablespoon rum (optional) 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Kosher salt Maple syrup, for drizzling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Slice off and reserve the top 1 1/2 inches of the pumpkin. Scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bread and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 4 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, the apples, brown sugar and raisins to the skillet and cook until the apples are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in the rum, vanilla, cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Return the bread to the skillet. Put the pumpkin in a small baking dish and fill the pumpkin with the apple mixture. Cover with the pumpkin top and add 1 inch of boiling water to the baking dish. Cover loosely with foil and bake until the pumpkin is tender, 2 hours to 2 hours, 30 minutes. Remove the foil and pumpkin top and return the stuffed pumpkin to the oven. Bake until the filling is lightly browned, about 10 more minutes. Transfer to a serving plate and drizzle with maple syrup. To serve, scrape the pumpkin flesh and stir into the apple mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 63097,&quot;Nana&#39;s Potato Salad About 5 large potatoes; peeled, cubed and boiled one medium onion, chopped one stalk of celery, chopped 2tbsp. butter or margarine 1/4 cup raisins, chopped about 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped about 1 tsp. dried rosemary 1/4 cup mayonnaise 3 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Boil the peeled and cubed potatoes until fork tender. While the potatoes boil, sweat the onions and the celery in butter until soft and translucent; do not brown. Drain potatoes. While still warm, add the ingredients slowly, being sure not to mash the potatoes. Mix thoroughly. Serve warm or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63098,&quot;Baklava Phyllo Cups 2 to 3 sheets of store-bought phyllo pastry dough, thawed 1 tablespoon olive oil, to brush the pastry 4 ounces shelled pistachios 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon agave 4 ounces light brown sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 lemon, zested Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Cut the phyllo sheets into forty-eight 2-inch squares. Take one phyllo square and brush with the oil. Lay a second square on top at a 45-degree angle and brush again with the oil. Fit it into one cup of a 24-cup mini muffin tin. Repeat to fill the remaining mini muffin cups. Blitz the pistachios and cinnamon in a food processor until finely chopped. Spoon equal amounts into each prepared pastry cup. Bake for about 8 minutes until the pastry is crisp and golden. To make the syrup, gently simmer the agave, sugar and lemon juice in a medium or small saucepan over high heat until it coats the back of the wooden spoon, about 3 minutes. Once the phyllo cups are out of the oven, spoon equal amounts of syrup into each phyllo cup. Grate over a little lemon zest to garnish. Let cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 63099,&quot;Santa-pe&#39;s 20 cherry tomatoes 20 bocconcini mozzarella balls 1 cucumber, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices (20 slices) 1 container garlic cheese spread, such as Alouette or Boursin (5 to 6 ounces) 1 tablespoon milk Black sesame seeds, for garnish Instructions: Cut a small piece off the bottom of a tomato so the bottom is flat, reserving the piece. Cut the remaining tomato in half. Thread the bottom half of the tomato onto a skewer and slide it down. Thread a mozzarella ball onto the skewer for a head and slide it down to meet the tomato piece (Santa&#39;s body). Thread the top half of the cherry tomato onto the skewer for a hat. Poke the skewer into the center of a cucumber slice to stabilize it so the skewer will stand. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes, mozzarella balls and cucumber slices. Combine the cheese spread with the milk in a small bowl and stir until creamy and pipeable. Transfer to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag. Snip off a small piece at the end of the plastic bag to create a small opening. Pipe a zigzag triangle of cheese at the bottom of each Santa face for a beard, extending onto the bottom piece of tomato.

Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess. Heat half the clarified butter (1/8 cup) in a large saute pan, and brown the chicken on both sides over medium heat, cooking about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to an ovenproof casserole. Add the rest of the clarified butter (the other 1/8 cup) to the same saute pan, and add the tomatoes and chopped basil, cooking gently over low heat for 2 minutes. Then, add the white wine and reduce the liquid by half. When the liquid in the saute pan is reduced, add the vegetable stock and heavy cream and bring to a gentle boil. Let the sauce cook until mixture starts to thicken about 5 to 10 minutes. Pour the sauce directly over the chicken in the casserole and bake covered in the oven until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 25 to 35 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, begin the rice. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepot and saute onion and garlic until translucent. Add rice and toast lightly. Pour in the 5 cups of chicken stock and add the poultry seasoning and season with salt and pepper. Return to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes, keeping covered at all times. When the chicken is done, transfer the pieces to a utility platter. The chicken should still have sauce on top. You can spoon some more sauce on top of the chicken if desired, but most of the remaining sauce in the casserole will be used for the rice. Finish the rice by adding the tomato/basil sauce and combining well. Spoon the rice onto center of serving plate, top with a piece of chicken and garnish with basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 63102,&quot;Braciole 6 (6-ounce) slices round steak, pounded very thin Salt Pepper 1 cup toasted bread crumbs 2 hard-cooked eggs, finely chopped 6 slices Sicilian salami, finely chopped 1/4 cup freshly grated Locatelli 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons minced parsley leaves 1 small egg, lightly beaten Salt Pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil Tomato Sauce (recipe follows) 1 cup minced onion 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes in puree 1 cup water 1 15-ounce can tomato sauce 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch lengths 1 boiling potato, peeled and left whole 1 teaspoon dried basil, crumbled Cayenne pepper to taste Salt to taste Instructions: Pat the meat dry and season with salt and pepper.

For the burgers: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Set a rack on the baking sheet and lay the bacon on it in a single layer. Cook until crisp, 35 to 45 minutes, turning halfway through. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are golden and caramelized, about 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, gently mix together the meat, Worcestershire, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Divide the meat into 6 equal portions and form each into a ball. Take one of the balls in your palm and, using the thumb of your other hand, gently poke straight into it to just beyond its center. Gently create a small cavity in the ball by pinching the meat between your thumb from the inside and your forefinger on the outside, pressing outward with your thumb and using the forefinger to maintain the round shape from the outside. Take care to leave the meat at least 1/4 inch thick. Fill the cavity with 1 to 1 1/2 ounces of the blue cheese. Gently and carefully close the opening in the meat around the cheese, being careful to seal it fully. Gently press the sphere between your palms to flatten it a bit, being careful not to create any openings. Repeat with the remaining meat and cheese. Preheat the broiler. Put the buns on a baking sheet with the insides facing up. Toast the buns until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Heat a grill to medium-high heat and oil the grill grates. When hot, add 2 to 4 burgers, leaving space to comfortably flip them, and grill 2 to 3 minutes on each side for medium. Repeat with the remaining burgers. To assemble the burgers, arrange the bottom buns on a clean, dry work surface. Spread each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the special sauce and then top with some of the caramelized onions, a burger, tomato slice, lettuce leaf, avocado slices, 1 slice of bacon, cut in half, and finally, the top of the bun slathered with more special sauce.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 63107,&quot;Vinegar-Coarse Salt Chipotle Roasted Potatoes 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon chili powder 6 small or 4 large russet potatoes 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon coarse black pepper 1 small red onion, cut into medium wedges Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Add butter and olive oil to a large saute pan and set over medium heat. Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saute for 8 to 10 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool. For the Beef: To prepare the beef: Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking. Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef. Using a rubber spatula cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles. Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves. When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard. Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it up nice and tight. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape. Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about a 1/4-inch thickness. Depending on the size of your sheets you may have to overlap 2 sheets and press them together. Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off plastic. Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef - saving ends to use as a decoration on top if desired. Top with coarse sea salt. Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet. Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife ? this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from oven and rest before cutting into thick slices. Garnish with minced chives, and serve with Green Peppercorn Sauce, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with Fresh Herbs and Garlic, and Warm Wilted Winter Greens. Add olive oil to pan after removing beef. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme; saute for 1 to 2 minutes, then, off heat, add brandy and flambe using a long kitchen match. After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock and reduce by about half. Strain out solids, then add 2 cups cream and mustard. Reduce by half again, then shut off heat and add green peppercorns. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F and place a baking sheet inside to heat. Add potatoes, rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic to a medium bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Remove sheet pan from oven, lightly coat with olive oil, and pour potatoes onto pan. Place potatoes in oven and reduce heat to 425 degrees F. Roast for 20 minutes, or until crispy on outside and tender on inside. Cook honey and balsamic together over medium-high heat in a large saute pan, about 5 minutes. Toast walnuts in a small skillet; set aside to cool. Pile greens on a platter. Stir mustard into balsamic-honey dressing, then whisk in about 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil; pour over greens.

Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners, and lightly coat with cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Bring the cocoa powder, milk and 1/2 cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, and whisk until the cocoa dissolves into a smooth, thicker mixture, about 3 minutes. Stir in the vanilla, and set aside until just slightly warm to the touch. Beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld mixer) until combined and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

While pasta water comes to a boil, heat olive oil in a medium sauce pot over medium-high heat, add pancetta and render 2 to 3 minutes then add meat and break up as it browns. When the meat has begun to caramelize and develops a nice brown color, 4 to 5 minutes, add carrot, onion, 2 cloves of garlic, allspice, salt and pepper and a bay leaf. Cook 3 to 4 minutes more to soften onions and carrots bits then stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, then stir in wine and cook out 1 minute then stir in stock and reduce heat to simmer. While red sauce cooks, cut remaining whole clove of garlic and rub the inside of a medium sauce pot with it. Melt butter in pot over medium heat. Add in flour and whisk together a minute or so then whisk in milk and bring to a bubble, reduce heat then season sauce with salt, pepper and nutmeg, thicken 8 to 10 minutes. Toss pasta with white sauce and 1/2 cup grated cheese. Serve pasta in individual bowls and top with a ladle of meat sauce in the middle of the bowl for mixing in. Garnish with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 63169,&quot;Potato and Mushroom Pierogies with Roasted Apples 4 large eggs, plus 1 egg for egg wash 1/2 cup (1 stick) melted unsalted butter, cooled 1/2 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon salt 5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 pound potatoes, peeled and cubed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for sauting 1 large leek 10 ounces mushrooms, finely chopped 4 sprigs fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup heavy cream Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish Roasted Apples, recipe follows 3 Gala apples, peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped 3 Golden Delicious, peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped 1 lemon, juiced 2 cinnamon sticks 1/4 cup sugar Pinch salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: To make the pierogi dough: Mix the 4 eggs, butter, sour cream, and salt together in a bowl with a whisk. Sift the flour onto a flat work surface and make a well in the center, pour the wet ingredients into the crater. Stir the mixture together with a fork, gradually incorporating the flour into the well until a soft dough forms. Squeeze the dough with your hands, if it?s too sticky, add a bit of flour; if it?s not pliable, add a couple of drops of water. Knead the dough, adding only as much additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking, until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Gather the dough into a ball and cover it with an inverted bowl or plastic wrap for 10 minutes or so to rest. To make the filling: Cook the potato cubes in boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and then mash them with a ricer or regular old potato masher while they are still hot; set them aside to cool while preparing the rest of the filling. Trim the root off the end of the leek and cut off all but 1-inch of the green part. Halve the leek lengthwise and rinse really well under cool water, checking for dirt everywhere; it gets trapped in all the layers of outer leaves. Slice the leek finely. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the leek, mushrooms, and thyme, saute for a few minutes to soften the vegetables; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the vegetables are broken down and almost dry, then pour in the cream, stir to incorporate. Remove the pan from the heat, take out the sprigs of thyme, and scrape the mushroom mixture into the potatoes, mix well to incorporate the ingredients. Make sure the filling is not too hot, or it will start to cook the dough, causing it to sog. Lightly flour your rolling pin and counter. Take 1/2 of the dough (leaving the rest covered so it doesn?t dry out while you work) and roll it out into a thin circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Using a 3-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut circles out of the dough. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Beat the remaining egg with 2 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash and brush it on the edges of the circle. Fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle and seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork. Lightly tap the bottoms of the dumplings on the counter to make it flat. Repeat with the remaining half of dough and filling. You should make about 35 pierogies; put 1/2 of them in the freezer to keep on hand (they are better than the ones you find in the frozen section of the grocery store.) Coat a large saute pan (that has a tight fitting lid) with vegetable oil and place over medium heat. Lay the pierogies in the pan (you may have to do this in batches) and fry them for a couple of minutes until they start to crisp and brown on both sides. Pour in 1 cup of water and cover the pan to let the pierogies steam; when the water evaporates the turnovers should be cooked and crisp. Arrange the pierogies on a platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with roasted apples and/or sour cream. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread the apples out in a casserole pan and add the lemon juice, cinnamon, sugar, salt, and butter. Bake until the apples are roasted and soft, about 30 minutes. Serve the chunky apple sauce with pierogies, either hot or chilled.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gamay]&quot; 63170,&quot;Herb Crusted Fresh Ham 1 tablespoon freshly chopped thyme leaves 1 teaspoon freshly chopped rosemary leaves 1 teaspoon freshly chopped tarragon leaves 1/2 teaspoon dried untreated lavender flowers 1 (6 to 8-pound) bone-in ham (preferably shank end, with skin) Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups chicken stock Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the thyme, rosemary, tarragon, and lavender.

For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups (see Cook&#39;s Note). To spatchcock the chicken, use strong kitchen scissors or poultry shears to cut down both sides of the backbone. Pull out the backbone, turn the chicken over and press down firmly on the breast to flatten it out to one thickness. Set aside at room temperature (see Cook&#39;s Note). Combine the butter, parsley, chives, garlic, shallot, lemon zest, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Starting at the neck, gently slide your fingers under the skin of the chicken to loosen it from the breast meat. Continue to slide you hand down and loosen the skin around the legs, taking care not to tear it. Rub all but 1 tablespoon of the butter mixture under the skin, spreading it all the way down to the legs. Rub the outside of the chicken with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Place the chicken skin-side up on the indirect-heat area of the grill with the legs facing the hotter side. Cover the grill (the lids vents should be partially open) and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh (avoiding the bone) measures 150 to 160 degrees F (almost cooked through), about 50 minutes. Transfer the chicken to the direct-heat area of the grill. After 2 minutes, flip the chicken to char and crisp up the skin side, another 3 to 4 minutes. Check that the temperature in the thigh is now at least 165 degrees F when not touching bone. If not, move the chicken back to the indirect area, skin-side up, cover and cook until the final temperature of 165 degrees F is reached. Remove the chicken from the grill to a cutting board; let rest 20 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 63187,&quot;French Bread Baguettes 1-1/8 cups water, room temperature 1-1/2 teaspoons salt 3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar 3 cups bread flour 2 tablespoons wheat germ 1-3/4 teaspoons yeast, active dry, instant or bread machine cornmeal for dusting Instructions: Place all ingredients except for the cornmeal, in the order listed into the bread pan fitted with the kneading paddle and secure in the Cuisinart Bread Maker.

On a baking sheet, sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and drizzle with the olive oil. Bake until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool, then shred into small bite-sized pieces.<br> For the mole: Reconstitute the dried chiles by soaking them in 1 1/2 cups hot water for 15 minutes. Then drain and set aside. Toast the corn tortillas in a dry skillet until dry, crisp and golden. Tear into pieces and set aside. In the same skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, season with a little salt and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook 2 minutes more. Transfer the onion and garlic mixture to a blender with the chiles, tortillas, peanut butter and oregano. Pour the chicken stock over and blend until very smooth. Then transfer the sauce to a medium saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer 20 minutes. Stir in the chocolate. Season the mole with salt and pepper. Reserve 1 cup of mole for garnishing the enchiladas, the rest will be used for dipping the tortillas.<br> To assemble the enchiladas: Fill a medium saute pan half way with oil over high heat. When the oil is hot, dip 1 tortilla at a time and fry just until soft and heated through, a few seconds. Lift out, let the excess oil drip off and then dip the fried tortilla directly into the warm mole (which should be right next to the pan for easy dipping) and transfer to a plate. Working quickly, put 1/3 cup of the shredded chicken in the center, being careful not to over fill. Roll the tortilla like a cigar to enclose the filling and place in a serving dish seam- side down. Continue to fill all of the tortillas and place them side-by- side. Pour the reserved mole over the top. (This recipe can be tightly wrapped and frozen for 3 weeks at this stage. To reheat: Preheat oven to 350degrees F, unwrap and bake until sauce is bubbly and enchiladas are heated through, about 20 to 25 minutes.) To serve, drizzle with a little sour cream and sprinkle with queso. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 63208,&quot;Potato Gnocchi with a Gorgonzola Sauce 1 pound baking potatoes, washed Olive oil, for drizzling, plus 1 teaspoon Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 large egg 1/2 cup, plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups milk 1 cup water 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 pound Gorgonzola Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Prepare an ice bath for the tomatoes by filling a medium bowl with cold water and some ice cubes. Use a slotted spoon to plunge the tomatoes into the boiling water for about 1 to 2 minutes. The skin should show evidence of peeling away from the flesh of the tomatoes. Remove them from the water and plunge them into the ice bath. Allow the tomatoes to sit in the cool water so they stop cooking. In a medium skillet, heat a tablespoon of the olive oil and add the garlic, shallots, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the oregano and sugar. Stir to blend. Allow to cook, over low heat, until the shallots and garlic become tender and translucent. Meanwhile, remove the tomatoes from the ice bath, peel off and discard the skin from each. Place them on a flat surface, quarter them and scoop out the seeds and \jelly\ from each piece. Gather all the seeds in a strainer and push through the liquid that naturally surrounds the seeds. Discard the seeds. Reserve the liquid and tomato flesh. Add the tomato and liquid to the shallot mixture and stir in about 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 teaspoon ground pepper. Turn the heat down to medium and cook until the tomato flesh starts to lose shape, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the water and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. If there are still some hard pieces, add a little more water and cook for a few more minutes. Taste for seasoning. In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil. Add a generous amount of salt. The pasta water should taste like sea water. Add the pasta to the pot and stir so none of the pieces stick to the bottom as they cook. Cook the pasta until \al dente, chewy but not hard or raw tasting, 8 to 10 minutes, and drain the pasta in a colander until the sauce is finished. Reserve a little of the pasta cooking liquid in case you need it later. Put the tomato sauce in the blender and puree until smooth. Slowly add the vinegar through the top of the blender as the sauce is blending. Next, pour the remaining olive oil through the top in a slow, steady stream. Blend in another cup of water then remove the sauce from the blender and taste for seasoning. Pour most of the sauce into a large skillet and add the pasta. Toss to blend with a wooden spoon. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the pasta liquid to thin it out. Taste for seasoning. Add the basil leaves and sprinkle with cheese, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 63225,&quot;Potatoes and Leeks 4 small new potatoes 1 cup thinly sliced celery 1 cup sliced leeks 1 1/2 cups chicken stock Instructions: Peel and halve the potatoes.

Put the 1 1/2 pounds of fresh or defrosted frozen berries in the bowl of a food processor with the preserves, and process until liquefied, or push through a food mill fitted with the fine screen. Strain through a sieve to remove any remaining seeds. You should have about 3 1/2 cups of raspberry coulis or puree. Reserve 1 1/2 cups for the sauce, and add the brandy to this sauce. Refrigerate until serving time. Add the lemon juice and water to the remaining 2 cups to be used for the sherbet, and freeze, covered with plastic wrap, in a stainless-steel bowl for about 3 hours, until frozen but not too hard. Break the frozen sherbet into pieces with a spoon, and dump them into the bowl of a food processor. Emulsify in several batches or all together until the sherbet becomes creamy and lighter in color. It should not be processed much more than 30 seconds; by then, it will have liquefied a little. Return the puree to the stainless-steel bowl, cover, and put back in the freezer for a few hours. To make the sherbet receptacles, line six 1-cup glass bowls with plastic wrap, and spoon a sizable scoop of sherbet inside each. With a spoon, press on the center of each scoop to hollow it out, and push the sherbet up around the sides of the cup to create a \nest\ in the center. Fold the plastic-wrap edges over the sherbet, and place in the freezer for a few hours, until hard. (This can be done several days ahead). To serve: Remove the frozen sherbet receptacles from the freezer, and pull back the plastic wrap to expose the center. Fill each with about 1/4 cup fresh raspberries. Invert the sherbet cups carefully in the center of six dessert plates, and remove the plastic wrap. Pour the raspberry sauce around the cups, decorate with lemon peel, mint, or edible flowers, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 63264,&quot;Spiced Cocktail Nuts 1 teaspoon caraway seed 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces 1/2 cup packaged, salted pumpkin seeds 1 cup walnut halves 1 cup whole almonds Instructions: Over medium heat in a medium nonstick skillet, toast seeds until they pop, 1 to 2 minutes.

Just over 1 pint tepid water (625 milliliters) 2 level tablespoons sea salt 1 ounce (30 grams) sugar 10 slices Parma ham 8 large organic eggs, boiled for 8 minutes and shelled 14 ounces (400 grams) cheese (a mix of Cheddar, Parmesan, Fontina, mozzarella, or any leftovers that need to be used up), grated 2 handfuls fresh basil Sun-dried tomatoes Extra-virgin olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1 jar chocolate spread Chopped toasted hazelnuts 2 bananas, sliced Instructions: Basic Bread Mix: Mix all the ingredients together and knead into a dough. Cut the dough in half. Roll one piece of dough out into a long rectangular shape about 1/2 inch (1 centimeter) thick, about 39 1/2 inches (1 meter) long and 12 to 15 inches wide. Savory: Along the middle of the first piece of rolled out dough, lay out your Parma ham, eggs, cheese, basil, and tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pull the dough over the filling so it forms what looks like a cannelloni shape. Bring one end round to the other so that they join up. Pinch and pat the two ends together firmly to form a doughnut shaped bread. Brush on olive oil and sprinkle the loaf with a little sea salt and rosemary. Transfer to a baking tray dusted with flour and allow to proof for 15 minutes. Place in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven until golden, about 35 minutes. Sweet: On the second piece of the rolled out dough use a palette knife to cover the surface with chocolate spread. Sprinkle some toasted chopped hazelnuts and the sliced banana onto the dough. Roll up into a cannelloni shape and then roll the long snake shape inside itself to form a snail shape. Sprinkle with chopped hazelnuts. Transfer to a baking tray dusted with flour and allow to proof for 15 minutes.

Adjust seasoning if needed. Put the filling in a pastry bag and reserve. For the pasta: Set the pasta roller on the widest setting (#1). Start with half the pasta dough; keep the other half covered until ready to use. Using your hands, flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller, twice dusting it in between rolls if it feels sticky. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees (a quarter turn) and run it through the pasta machine 2 to 3 times. Move the roller to the next setting (#2) and run the pasta through. Dust lightly with flour if the dough feels sticky. Continue to run the dough through the machine reducing the opening (or moving the setting to the next larger number) in between every roll. Stop when you get to the correct thinness, this will usually be around number 5 or 6 on the dial, but every machine is different, you will have to be the judge of your own pasta thickness. To assemble the ravioli: Lay out the dough on a flat surface. Brush the lower half of the dough (the part that is closest to you) lightly with water. This is the glue that will hold the ravioli together. Use the glue sparingly, if you use too much the pasta will slide and not stick. Pipe 1-inch balls of filling onto the pasta that has been brushed with water, leaving about 2 inches between each ball. Fold the top half of the pasta down over the filling to meet the bottom edge. Using your index fingers, poke around each filling ball to seal the ravioli shut, AND to make sure that there are no air bubbles. Using a fluted round cutter or a fluted pastry wheel or even a drinking glass, cut out each ravioli. Transfer to a sheet tray dusted with semolina or polenta and reserve until ready to use. To cook the ravioli and make the sauce: Add the butter to a large saute pan and bring to a medium heat. Add 1 cup of chicken stock and season with salt. Shake the pan to incorporate the butter and stock, and simmer until the stock has reduced a bit and the sauce looks velvety and is the consistency of heavy cream. If the sauce thickens too much, adjust the consistency with chicken stock. Add the sage and season with salt. Add the ravioli to the pot of boiling water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully remove the ravioli from the cooking water and put them immediately into the sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, shaking frequently to be sure that the ravioli don&#39;(TM)t stick to the bottom of the pan. Transfer the ravioli to a serving platter. Mangia Bene! Put the flour on a clean, dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, salt and water. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, salt and water. Using the fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture; be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately do not refrigerate. Roll and cut the pasta into desired shape. How smooth and supple! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gaja]&quot; 63283,&quot;Gateau de Sirop Cinnamon-sugar mixture in shaker Powdered sugar in shaker 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon solid vegetable shortening, in all 1/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup Steen&#39;s Pure Cane Syrup 1/3 cup boiling water 1 egg, beaten 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups flour 3/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon baking soda Sugar-cinnamon topping: 1/3 cup light brown sugar 2 teaspoons cinnamon 3 tablespoons flour 3 tablespoons solid vegetable shortening 1/3 cup roasted pecan pieces Whipped cream in pastry bag with star tip Fresh mint sprigs Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Add the egg yolks (and if making sweet pastry, the sugar) and a pinch of salt and stir together with a knife. Squidge the mixture together into a ball. If the pastry feels very dry add the water (or if making sweet pastry, the cream or milk), but try and get by without for a more tender pastry. Once the pastry is all squidged together, pop it in the refrigerator to rest for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove it from the refrigerator and let it warm up a little (if you use it straight from the refrigerator and try to roll it out, the pastry will just be a hopeless crumbly mess).

Sprinkle the butter cubes on top and use your fingers to work them in by rubbing your thumb against your fingertips, smearing the butter as you do. Stop when the mixture looks like wet sand with some pea-sized bits of butter remaining (try to work quickly so the butter doesn&#39;t melt). Sprinkle 1/4 cup ice water on top and stir with a fork until the dough just begins to come together. If needed, add more ice water, one tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead just until smooth-three times should do it. Gather the dough into a ball, then divide in half and press each piece into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine apple slices, sugar, lemon juice and zest, and cinnamon. Stir well, then let sit at room temperature until the dough is chilled.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and set a rack to the middle position. Remove the first disk of dough from the refrigerator. On a floured surface, roll out into a rectangle about 16 inches wide, 12 inches long, and 1/8 inch thick (if the dough becomes soft or sticky at any point during this process, put it in the freezer for 10 minutes). Cut the dough from top to bottom into four strips, each about 4 inches wide.<br> Now, roll up the wrapples. You&#39;re basically making a jelly roll, only with apples as the filling. Lay four apple slices on the pastry about 4 inches from the bottom of the first strip. Overlap them like shingles. Use your bench scraper to help you fold the bottom 4 inches of dough up over the apples. Layer a few more apple slices just above the seam, then fold the dough over those slices, creating a roll. Repeat once more until you reach the top of the strip. Press the seam to seal the packet, then refrigerate uncovered. Repeat with remaining strips, then repeat with second disk of dough. You should have eight packets in all.<br> Arrange the packets on an ungreased baking sheet, put them in the oven, and immediately reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar with 2 tablespoons water and stir until smooth.

Grease 2 9-inch round cake pans and line the bases with parchment paper. Set the prepared pans aside. Combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add the eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla and whisk together. Add the boiling water to the bowl and whisk to incorporate well. Divide the batter equally between the 2 prepared pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, and then turn the cake out onto a wire rack. Remove the parchment from both layers. Turn one of the cakes right side up to be the top layer. Allow the cakes to cool completely, about 1 hour. Once cool, place the first cake layer, with the bottom of the cake facing up, on a cooling rack set over a baking pan or on a cake plate and spread the jam on top of the cake, leaving a 1/2-inch border of cake. Top the jam with the second cake layer, that has been turned right side up. Pour the ganache over the cake, if using. Put the strawberries in a small bowl and sprinkle with sugar to the desired sweetness. Set the bowl aside. In another bowl, add the cream and softly whip with a hand whisk or electric mixer, and set aside until needed. Cut one slice of cake and lay in a dessert dish. Sprinkle the cake with about 1 tablespoon of sherry. Spoon 1/3 cup of the sugar and strawberries mixture over the cake, and then top with a large spoonful of whipped cream. Add a fresh mint sprig for garnish. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until little bubbles appear around the edges. Remove the saucepan from the heat and immediately add the chocolate. Shake the pan to submerge the chocolate and leave it to melt for a couple of minutes. Stir gently to mix the chocolate to a smooth cream. Set the mixture aside for 20 to 30 minutes to thicken to a spreadable consistency. Stir through a few times as it&#39;s cooking over low heat to keep the ganache smooth. Pour the thickened ganache in a wide ribbon around the circumference of the cake and with a spatula gently push the ganache over the edges. It should fall in thick waves. Fill in the middle with more ganache and swirl the ganache into luscious billows. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling, Tawny Port]&quot; 63313,&quot;Classic Clam Chowder 4 slices bacon, chopped Olive oil 1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, smashed 6 sprigs fresh thyme 1 bay leaf 16 littleneck clams, scrubbed well 1/2 lemon, juiced 1/2 cup white wine 3 cups water 2 tablespoons butter Extra-virgin olive oil 2 garlic cloves, minced Leaves from 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups heavy cream 2 Idaho potatoes, peeled and diced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Common Crackers, recipe follows 2 to 3 cups crushed saltine crackers (crackers wrapped in a tea towel and smashed with a rolling pin 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons butter, melted Instructions: Start by making the clam broth: Put a large pot over medium heat, add the bacon and saute until the fat is rendered and the bacon is browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the cooked bacon pieces from the pot and reserve them for something else. Add a 1-count of olive oil, the onion, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the clams, lemon juice, white wine, and water and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer for 10 or 15 minutes to steam open the clams. Remove the clams from the pot, discarding any that don&#39;t open. Strain the broth into a bowl. Pull the clams out of their shells, chop them, and set them aside separately; discard the shells. Set the broth aside. Heat the butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the bacon, onion, garlic, and thyme and cook until the bacon renders its fat and the vegetables are good and soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Dust the vegetables with flour and stir to coat everything well. Pour in the clam broth and bring to a boil. Add the cream and the potatoes, bring to a boil and boil hard for about 7 minutes, until the potatoes break down (this will help to thicken the soup and give it a good texture). Add the chopped clams and season with salt and pepper. Now add the 16 clams in their shells. Cover and simmer to open the clams, about 10 minutes.

Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.<br> Simmer the neck, chestnuts, broth and 4 cups water in a medium saucepan over low heat, partially covered, until the chestnuts are plump, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Strain, discarding the neck, and reserve the chestnuts and broth in separate bowls. (This can be done a day ahead.)<br> Bring the turkey to room temperature 30 minutes before roasting. Place a rack in the lowest position of the oven and remove the other racks; preheat to 400 degrees. Season the turkey all over with salt and pepper and stuff the lemon halves into the cavity. Tie the legs together with twine. Line a roasting rack with a double layer of foil and place in a roasting pan. Place the turkey, breast-side down, on the foil and roast 45 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and turn the turkey breast-side up, discarding the foil. Roast until golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 160 degrees, 30 to 35 more minutes.<br> Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the remaining 12 cipollinis and 2 thyme sprigs and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Add the parsnips and cook until light brown, about 3 minutes. Add 3 cups of the reserved chestnut broth and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook until glazed, about 10 more minutes. Keep warm.<br> Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and place the roasting pan with drippings over medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour until browned, then whisk in 2 1/2 cups of the chestnut broth. Simmer until the gravy coats a spoon, about 5 minutes.<br> Melt 2 tablespoons butter in another skillet, add the mushrooms and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the reserved chestnuts and cook until toasted, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add to the glazed vegetables. Whisk in the 2 tablespoons cold butter, then stir in the vinegar, chives and chopped parsley.

Butter and flour an 8-inch (1 1/2 quart) ovenproof metal bowl. Line 4 muffin cups with paper liners. For the cake: Whisk the eggs and egg whites in a large bowl. Whisk in the cream of coconut, pineapple, coconut extract and vanilla extract until combined. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in another large bowl. Beat in the butter, one piece at a time, with an electric mixer on low speed until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add half the egg mixture and beat on high until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in the remaining egg mixture until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Fill the muffin cups each 2/3 full, then pour the remaining batter into the prepared bowl. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes for the cupcakes and 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes for the bowl. Remove the cakes to a wire rack and let cool in their pans for 15 minutes, then turn them out and let cool completely. For the buttercream: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar and butter together with an electric mixer on low speed until well combined, then beat on high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in 1 tablespoon of the milk and the vanilla and coconut extracts until light and spreadable, 2 to 3 minutes more, adding up to 1 tablespoon more milk if the frosting is too stiff. With a serrated knife, trim the flat bottom of the bowl-shaped cake so it lies flat on a plate, rounded-side up, and frost with a layer of buttercream. Remove the wrappers from the cupcakes and anchor 2 of them with a pretzel stick each at the base of the cake to make the bunny&#39;s feet (leave about 1 1/2 inches between the feet). Cut the third cupcake in half from top to bottom. With pretzel sticks, attach the cupcake halves to the top of the feet, with the cut-side facing down and the rounded ends positioned to be the heels of the feet. Attach the last cupcake with a pretzel stick to the lower half of the top of the cake to make a tail. Frost the cupcakes with the remaining frosting. Wipe away any frosting that has smeared on the cake plate.<br> Pat about 1 1/2 cups shredded coconut all over the cake. Put the remaining coconut in a large zip-top plastic bag. Mix the green food coloring with 2 teaspoons water and add to the bag. Toss and massage the coconut until it is uniformly green in color. Press the chocolate candies into the bottoms of the bunny feet with the larger candy at the top and the smaller ones underneath so they resemble the pads of the toes. Spread the green coconut all around the cake plate to make grass and decorate with candy eggs. Flatten the apricots with a rolling pin and roll into carrot shapes. Cut the leaves in half crosswise and use scissors to snip them to resemble carrot tops. Insert the carrot tops into the wider end of the apricot carrots and arrange them in the grass around the bunny. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 63321,&quot;Red, White and Blue Smoothie 4 ounces pomegranate juice (1/2 cup) 1/2 frozen banana, sliced 1/2 cup frozen blueberries 1/2 cup ice 1 tablespoon honey 2 ounces orange juice (or the juice from 1 orange) 1/2 cup ice 1/2 cup yogurt, plain or vanilla 1 frozen banana, sliced 2 ounces pomegranate juice (1/4 cup) 1 cup frozen strawberries, halved 1/2 frozen banana, sliced 1/2 cup ice Instructions: For the blue layer: Pour the pomegranate juice into the blender.

Butter a 1-quart casserole dish or baking pan. Combine the sugar with 1 tablespoon of the flour, the berries and 1 cup of water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a medium bowl, use a pastry blender or two knives to cut the butter into the remaining 2 cups of flour until small crumbles start to form.

Add the strips of pepper and fry until they start to soften. Remove and reserve for garnish. Fry the chicken and rabbit at medium heat until golden brown, adding more oil, as necessary. Add the paprika half way through to add color to meat. Push the meat out to the edges of the pan and add the beans and tomatoes in the center, mixing them well. Add 1/2 the water making sure to cover the pan until it is 1/2 full. Simmer for approximately 30 minutes until most of the water has evaporated. Add the snails and cook for 5 or 10 minutes. Add the rice, distributing it evenly over the pan and fry for a few minutes, moving it around in the pan. Add the rest of the water and cook for about 20 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Add a pinch of saffron for colour. Once this is done the paella should not be stirred anymore. For the last 1 to 2 minutes increase the heat to medium-high, until the bottom layer of rice starts to caramelize, creating what Valencians call the \socarrat. If the rice starts to burn remove the pan from the heat immediately. Garnish the paella with the strips of red pepper and the sprigs of rosemary. Cover the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Cava]&quot; 63343,&quot;Ginger Sugar Cookies 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 1-pound box confectioners? sugar 2 tablespoons meringue powder 5 to 6 tablespoons water Assorted food coloring (optional) Nonpareils, for decorating Instructions: Make the cookies: Sift together the flour, ginger, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl.

Prick the chicken all over with a fork and make diagonal slashes, 1/2 inch deep and one inch apart, on the meat. Mix together the lemon juice, food coloring, if using, cumin, Garam Masala, red pepper, and salt and brush over the chicken, pushing the marinade into the slits. Combine the yogurt, ginger, and garlic and pour over the chicken. Mix, turning several times, to coat the chicken pieces evenly with the marinade. Cover and marinate at room temperature for one hour or refrigerate for 8 hours or up to 2 days. If the chicken has been refrigerated, bring to room temperature before cooking. If placing on skewers, slide meat down metal skewers prior to grilling. If grilling, heat the grill and place the grill rack at least 5 inches from the heat. If roasting, place the oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Remove the chicken from the marinade and coat generously with usli ghee. To grill, place meat side down, on the grill rack. To roast, place the chicken, meat side down, on a wire rack set over a jelly-roll pan. Grill or roast the chicken, turning 3 or 4 times during cooking, until the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. Brush the chicken with the remaining usli ghee and transfer to a platter. Surround the chicken with slices of onion, tomato, and cucumber and serve. The tandoori marinade is traditionally colored bright orange using natural food coloring. This is purely for visual effect. You can omit the color if you prefer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 63361,&quot;Seared Scallops with Orange-Jalape?o Slaw 1 1/2 pounds large scallops (about 24) 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 3 large navel oranges 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 1 tablespoon fish sauce 1/2 head napa cabbage, shredded 1 bunch cilantro, leaves roughly chopped 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 1 jalape?o pepper, sliced 1/2 cup roughly chopped unsalted roasted peanuts Instructions: Put the scallops on a paper towel\u2013lined plate and pat dry with more paper towels.

Add the pork, turkey, breadcrumbs, eggs, allspice, onion powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to a large bowl. Mix the meat with your hands until the mixture is uniform in color and texture. Scoop level tablespoonfuls, and roll them into balls; place them in a single layer in the slow cooker. When the bottom of the cooker is covered, add a second layer, starting on the outer edge. (The outside of the cooker is hotter; meatballs on the edge will cook more quickly than those in the center.) Cover and cook on high for 2 hours, until the meatballs are cooked through. Meanwhile, rub the butter and flour together in a small bowl to make a smooth paste (which will be used to thicken the sauce). Pinch off 1/2-inch balls, and set on a small plate. Transfer the meatballs with a slotted spoon from the slow cooker to a large bowl, leaving the cooking liquid in the pot. (You should have about 1 1/2 cups liquid.) When removing the meatballs, start from the outer edges and scoop carefully. Some may be stuck together; gentle coaxing with the spoon will separate them. Whisk the butter-flour paste into the cooking liquid, 1 or 2 balls at a time, to incorporate. Whisk in the sour cream and jelly, if using. Return the meatballs to the slow cooker, and stir with the spoon to coat. Cook on high, uncovered, until the sauce is thickened, 30 minutes. Adjust the setting to keep warm, sprinkle the meatballs with the parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 63370,&quot;Greek Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs 3 tablespoons panko or regular breadcrumbs 3 tablespoons milk<br> 1 pound ground lamb<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 2 cloves garlic, grated<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 small shallot, finely chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> One 8-ounce block feta cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes<br> Olive oil, for the skillet<br> 1 small yellow onion, chopped One 24-ounce jar good marinara<br> Red pepper flakes, optional<br> 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives<br> Kosher salt 1 pound thick long pasta, such as bucatini or spaghetti<br> Crumbled feta cheese, for garnish<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the meatballs.

Trim off a 1-by-12-inch strip, then cut twelve 1-inch leaf shapes out of the dough with a paring knife. Gently press the paring knife blade into each leaf to make the impression of veins on the leaves, and set the leaves aside for later. Working vertically, cut a column of 1 1/2-inch vertical slits in the remaining 12-inch square of dough, leaving 1/4-inch of space in between each slit. Space a second vertical column of slits 1/2-inch from the first with the first slit of the second column starting halfway down the first slit in the first column and finishing halfway down the second slit in the first column. Continue this pattern until the entire square of dough is marked. Stack the top and bottom tart doughs and the leaves on a baking sheet with parchment between each and cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge until the dough is firmer and easier to work with, about 20 minutes. Place the bottom piece of puff pastry on a sheet of parchment paper and assemble the tart by placing a 3-inch bowl in the center. Stuff each pear center with a chocolate truffle and arrange the 6 pear halves cut-side down with the stem ends pointing out around the bowl, leaving a 3/4-inch space between the bottom of the bowl and the bottoms of the pears.<br> Brush the dough surrounding the pears with the egg white. Place the dough with the slits over the top of the pears and gently stretch it to create diamond-shaped openings. Press the dough down all around each pear to seal it. Use a paring knife to cut around the perimeter of the bowl, and remove the bowl and the central piece of dough. Press to seal that edge as well. Use your paring knife to trim the extra dough from the edges, following the outline of the pears, leaving a 1/2-inch border of the dough. Brush the tops of the puff with the egg white. Attach 2 leaves to the stem end of each pear, and brush those with egg wash too. Sprinkle the tart with sanding sugar. Use the parchment to carefully transfer the tart to an 18-by-13-inch baking sheet.<br> Bake the tart until the pastry is risen and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Pinot Noir]&quot; 63403,&quot;Valentine&#39;s Cookies 1/2 cup butter 1 cup sugar 1 egg 1/4 cup milk 1/4 teaspoon vanilla Approximately 3 cups flour 2 teaspoons baking powder Icing, recipe follows Silver balls Gold balls 2 tablespoons egg whites* (See Disclaimer) 2 cups powdered sugar Red food coloring Instructions: Cream the butter. Add the sugar and mix well. Add the egg, milk and vanilla and combine. Sift together 1 cup of the flour with the baking powder and mix it into the batter.

Zest the lemon over the top, then juice about 1 tablespoon and add to the berries. Give it a stir. Put on the stove about medium heat and cook until the berries release their juices and looks like jelly or jam. While that&#39;s happening, whisk your egg yolks and cornstarch together in small bowl. Stir into the berries and boil until nice and thick. Set aside. For the crust: Put your flour into a food processor, add the 1/2 cup almonds, the sugar, a pinch of salt and pulse until it&#39;s a fine meal. Add the egg yolk and cold butter (Cold butter makes the crust nice and flaky.) Add the extract and process the mixture until it turns into a little ball of dough. Press the dough nice and evenly into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Freeze 1 hour or so to firm it up. Freezing will also help make a nice crispy tart after baking. Put a piece of parchment on the dough and fill it with dried beans. Bake for 12 minutes or so. This is called blind baking, which keeps the crust nice and flat and leaves plenty of room for the filling. Remove the beans and parchment and cook the crust until it&#39;s nice and golden brown, another 16 minutes. Let cool. Heat the black currant jelly and 1 tablespoon water in a saucepan to melt it. Pour the blueberry filling in the tart and spread out to the edges. Mound the remaining fresh blueberries over top. Brush the top with the jelly glaze.

Butter a 9-inch spring-form pan and line the bottom with parchment. Combine the melted butter with the wafer cookies in a medium bowl. Press the mixture into the bottom and almost up the entire side of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes, let cool completely before using. Scoop the chocolate and mint ice creams onto the cookie layer, packing it in tightly and alternating the scoops to create a marbled or checkerboard effect. Spread with an offset spatula to make a smooth top. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Unmold the cake by running a knife around the edge, then unhinge the spring-form and remove. Invert the cake onto a sheet of plastic wrap and remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment. Place a serving plate on the bottom and invert once more (so the cookie layer is on the bottom). Keep in the freezer until ready to frost. Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan. Pour the cream over the chocolate and stir until smooth. Allow to cool 10 minutes before using. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the ganache and top with the wafer cookies. If the cake begins to get too soft, put it back into the freezer for a few minutes. Freeze another 1 1/2 to 2 hours or up to overnight.

Add the garlic and sweat until fragrant. Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste, mixing well. Add salt, pepper, basil flakes and parsley flakes and stir until well-combined. Simmer over a low flame while you cook the beef. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add ground beef and boil until cooked all the way through. Strain cooked beef and add to tomato sauce. Simmer for about 1 hour. For the sausage: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Have a meat grinder assembled with the sausage attachment and hog casing. Combine the pork, beef, fennel seed, black pepper, red pepper, salt and oil in a medium bowl and mix thoroughly so that all the spices are evenly incorporated. Run the meat through the sausage grinder and into the casing, twisting into sausages. Place the cased sausages on a baking sheet. Poke the sausages a few times with a toothpick or fork to create small holes (this will prevent the casing from bursting during cooking). Bake, rotating once halfway through the cooking, about 24 minutes. Set aside and let cool. For the meatballs: Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Combine the beef, breadcrumbs, Romano, parsley flakes, garlic, pine nuts, salt, pepper and egg in a medium bowl, being sure to mix well so that all the spices are evenly incorporated. Roll the meat into 3-ounce balls. Brown the meatballs on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from heat and let cool. For the filling: Assemble the meat grinder and have a bowl ready to catch the ground meat and cheese. Run 3 meatballs, 3 sausages, the prosciutto, soppressata and mozzarella cubes through the grinder and into the bowl. Mix well. Combine the ricotta, Romano, eggs, butter, parsley, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the ground meat and cheese mixture. Mix well. For the pasta dough: Heat a large pot of water to boil on the stove. Add a splash of oil. Fit a stand mixer with the dough hook, then generously oil the hook to prevent dough from sticking. Whisk the egg, milk, salt and 1 tablespoon water together in a mixing bowl. Pour egg and milk mixture into the stand mixer bowl and add half the flour. Beat the dough over medium-low speed until the flour begins to incorporate into the mixture. Gradually add the rest of the flour until the dough comes together and forms a ball. Once the dough is mixed, turn out onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into several portions. Using a pasta machine or pasta attachment for your stand mixer, sheet the dough: Begin with the machine on the thickest setting and run one of the dough pieces through. Gradually reduce the setting number until the dough has been sheeted through the lowest number. Using a pasta cutter, cut the dough into rectangular strips. Place cut strips onto a well-floured sheet pan or tray. Repeat this process with the rest of the dough. Carefully add the pasta sheets to the boiling water. Cook, stirring with a spatula to prevent the pieces from sticking together, about 2 minutes. Using a large wire strainer or slotted spoon, carefully transfer the cooked pasta to a parchment-lined tray or plate, being sure to use additional parchment sheets if layering the noodles. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and oil a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish. Gently drape the pasta sheets over the sides and corners of the dish, then fill in the bottom once the sides are covered (the finished lasagna will be fully wrapped in noodles). Add half the ricotta and meat filling, pressing it down into an even layer. Next, add a layer of meat sauce, putting just enough sauce to cover the ricotta and meat filling. Add another layer of noodles, this time only arranging them on top of the sauce and not draped over the sides. Add the remaining ricotta and meat filling and another layer of meat sauce. Carefully fold in the noodles that were draped over the sides and corners, then use more noodles to fill in any areas of the lasagna that are not covered. Cover lasagna in foil and bake for 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Cut and serve topped with a generous amount of meat sauce and fresh basil for garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello di Montalcino, Amarone]&quot; 63428,&quot;20-Minute Chicken Cutlets with Charred Escarole Salad 1 head escarole (about 1 pound) 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar Pinch of crushed red pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1 teaspoon, plus 3 tablespoons, plus more for drizzling 1/4 cup golden raisins 1/4 cup panko 1/4 cup sliced almonds 1 1/2 pounds thin chicken breast cutlets Instructions: Position an oven rack about 5 inches from the broiler element and preheat the broiler. Cut the head of escarole lengthwise through the stem-end into 4 wedges. Discard any discolored or wilted leaves. Rinse the escarole wedges under cold water, being sure to rinse away any dirt or grit between the leaves. Give each wedge a good shake to remove excess water and place upside down to drain in a colander. Meanwhile, whisk together the vinegar, crushed red pepper, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup of the oil, whisking constantly, until blended. Stir in the raisins. Spread the panko and almonds together on a baking sheet. Toss with 1 teaspoon of the oil and a pinch of salt. Place under the broiler and toast until lightly browned, 20 to 30 seconds. Toss again and broil until golden brown, another 10 to 20 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl. Wipe off the baking sheet and drizzle generously with oil. Arrange the four escarole wedges, cut-side up, on the baking sheet. Drizzle the wedges with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil until the tops are browned and charred in places but the escarole is still raw underneath, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle a second baking sheet with oil. Arrange the chicken cutlets on the baking sheet in one layer. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Drizzle the tops of the cutlets with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Place under the broiler and broil until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide the cutlets and escarole wedges among 4 plates. Spoon the raisin vinaigrette over each wedge, then top with the toasted panko and almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 63429,&quot;Mini Chocolate Tarts 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips 14 mini phyllo tart shells 1/2 cup dulce de leche 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 7 pecan halves Canned whipped cream and sprinkles Instructions: Heat the cream in a saucepan until almost boiling.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean sized bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture. Make the dough in a food processor. With the machine fitted with the metal blade, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. Make the filling. Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve, and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apple with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and toss to combine evenly. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the apples, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes. Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice. Shake the colander to get as much liquid as possible. Return the juices to the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, toss the apples with the reduced juice and spices. Set aside to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up to 6 months.) Cut the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half of dough into a disc about 11 to 12 inches wide. Layer the dough between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one of the discs of dough, and trim it so it lays about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Put the apple filling in the pan and mound it slightly in the center. Brush the top edges of the dough with the egg. Place the second disc of dough over the top. Fold the top layer of dough under the edge of the bottom layer and press the edges together to form a seal. Flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Pierce the top of the dough in several places to allow steam to escape while baking. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. Bake the pie on a baking sheet until the crust is golden, about 50 minutes. Cool on a rack before serving. The pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63432,&quot;Hoosier Pork-Tenderloin Sandwich 2 pounds center-cut boneless pork loin 2 large eggs 2 cups buttermilk 2 cloves garlic, crushed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 sleeves saltines (about 80 crackers) 2 cups instant flour (such as Wondra) Peanut oil, for frying 4 soft hamburger buns, split 1/3 cup mayonnaise 3 tablespoons yellow mustard 1/2 head iceberg lettuce, shredded 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced 1 red onion, thinly sliced 4 half-sour dill pickles, thinly sliced Instructions: Cut the pork crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Put each piece flat on a cutting board and slice horizontally almost in half (stop about 1 inch from the other side). Open like a book. Sprinkle each piece with water, place between 2 pieces of heavy-duty plastic wrap and pound to 1/4 inch thick with a mallet or heavy skillet. Whisk the eggs, buttermilk, garlic, 1 teaspoon each salt and black pepper, and the cayenne in a shallow bowl. Add the pork, cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Pulse the crackers into coarse crumbs in a food processor, then transfer to a shallow dish. Put the flour in another dish. Remove each piece of pork from the marinade, letting the excess drip off. Dredge both sides in the flour, dip in the buttermilk marinade again, then coat with the cracker crumbs. Heat 1/4 to 1/2 inch peanut oil in a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360. Fry the pork in batches until golden and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Spread both halves of each bun with mayonnaise and mustard.

For the Braised Red Cabbage: In a large heavy-bottomed pot sweat the shallots in the butter. Then add the shredded cabbage and let cook for 5 minutes. Finish by adding the salt and pepper and sherry wine vinegar. Let cook for 5 more minutes and reserve for later. For the Butternut Squash Pan Sauce: Take the squash and cut it in half. Cut off the bottom of the squash (bulb shaped) and medium dice it. In a pot sweat the onions then add the diced squash, let cook for 5 minutes and then add the Calvados, let the alcohol cook off then add the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Let simmer until tender, puree in a blender until smooth. Cut the top of the squash (cylinder shaped) into small dice and leave it raw until needed. For the Chestnut Crust: Peel chestnuts and then steep them in some apple juice until tender about 1 hour. Then puree chestnuts and add the butter and the breadcrumbs. The texture will be pasty. Reserve. To assemble the dish, quickly sear both sides of the salmon and then dry off the top part of the salmon. Spread the chestnut crust on, about 1/4-inch thick. Put in a preheated 350-degree oven for 5 minutes. While fish is in the oven heat the cabbage up in a little bit of butter. Take the butternut squash sauce and heat in a small pot with the small diced butternut. Add a pinch of fine herbs to the sauce. On a 12-inch plate make 2 quenelles of the apple jam and place them at 3 and 9 o&#39;clock. The cabbage goes in the middle and the salmon on top. The sauce goes around. The seeds that were saved, you can wash them very well and salt them and then dry them out in the oven at 200 degrees. Then sprinkle around. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 63442,&quot;Eggs en Cocotte with a Basque Piperade 2 cups water 2 tablespoons butter, softened 8 eggs Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup cream 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1 1/2 ounces prosciutto (about 4 slices), cut in 1/4-inch strips 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small onion, finely diced 1 red pepper, seeds and ribs removed, cut in 1/4-inch strips 1 green pepper, seeds and ribs removed, cut in 1/4-inch strips 1 clove garlic, minced 1 (14 1/2-ounces) can diced, peeled tomatoes, drained 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves Instructions: Special equipment: 4 (1-cup) capacity ramekins Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups water to a boil. Smear the bottom of each ramekin with the butter. For each serving, crack 2 eggs into a small bowl or dish, being careful not to break the yolks, then slide into a prepared ramekin. Season with the salt and pepper, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the cream, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan. Set the ramekins into a medium-sized glass or ceramic baking pan, allowing at least 1 inch of space between dishes. Transfer to the bottom rack of the oven and pour the boiling water into the baking dish, being careful not to splash any hot water into the ramekins. Cover with a sheet of aluminum foil and bake 8 to 12 minutes, until the whites are set but the yolks are still soft and a bit runny. Prepare the piperade while the eggs are baking. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the prosciutto in the olive oil until beginning to crisp, then add the onion. Saute until lightly golden, then add the red and green pepper and cook until the strips just begin to soften. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant, then add the tomatoes and red pepper flakes, if using. Allow the mixture to stew over medium-low heat until liquid has evaporated and the tomatoes are heated through. Check for seasoning and add salt and pepper. Off the heat, add the basil. Divide between the ramekins (you will have extra) and serve on a small plate, piping hot.

The open frame can be square (7-inches by 7-inches) or rectangular (8-inches by 6-inches) and have a height of 2-inches. Build a pressing board (removable top) from the same lumber. The dimensions of the top should be 1/2- inch smaller than the interior dimensions of the frame. Two cross pieces can be used to hold the board together in the event two or more pieces of lumber were used to make it. These cross pieces serve as handles to lift the board from the frame after the tofu is pressed. The cross pieces should be located one inch from the edge of the board.<br> Tofu: Stirring frequently, heat the strained soybean milk to 180 degrees, remove from heat source. A couple of different coagulants can be used to bind the soybean milk. The most commonly available is Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate), which can be purchased from drugstores. I have found that magnesium chloride works better. Mix the coagulant with 1/4-cup of water before adding it to the heated soybean milk. Pour the mixture into the hot soybean milk a little at a time and observe. The process is like thickening a sauce with a cornstarch slurry. The milk will begin curdling. The quantity of coagulant varies depending on the choice of chemical, the amount of soybean in the milk, and the desired firmness of the final product. If a soft tofu is desired, curdling should be minimal; the curdling milk in the pot can still be stirred easily. If a hard tofu is desired, the stirring becomes harder.<br> Put the tofu mold in the sink so the excess liquid can drain easily. Cover the inside of the mold with rinsed cheesecloth, allowing at least 6-inches of extra cheesecloth for each side of the mold. Pour the curdled soybean milk into the mold, then fold over the extra cheesecloth, sides first. Place the pressing board on top of the cheesecloth. Put a water-filled bowl or pot on top to exert pressure, remember that water is very heavy, a gallon of water weighs seven pounds. The position of the weight should be adjusted so pressure on the tofu is uniform. For soft tofu, a five-pound weight will be more than adequate - a pot plus two quarts of water will work fine. The final firmness is also dependent on time. For soft tofu, five minutes pressing will be sufficient. For firmer tofu, more weight and longer time will be required. When the tofu has reached the desired consistency lift the wrapped tofu from the mold and uncover it. Tofu can be divided and the pieces stored in water in the refrigerator of up to one week. Tofu can also be frozen. Use a blender to make soybean milk in batches of one cup of soaked soybeans to three cups of water. Each batch should run for at least 3 minutes. Put the coarse soybean milk into a large pot and heat to a slow simmer. Cook for 10 minutes. Place a colander, covered with a clean kitchen towel, into a large pot or bowl. Pour the hot soybean milk into the towel to strain the soybean milk. A small amount of milk will drain via gravity; most must be forced out. This should be done when the milk has cooled. To do this, gather the edges of the towel to form a sealed ball. Tighten the towel edges like a screw. Use a spoon to scrape the outside of the ball to facilitate the flow. Make certain that the bean residuals are trapped inside the ball. Continue this process until the inside of the towel is nearly empty. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 63459,&quot;Moroccan Chicken Tajine 6 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika 1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 large Spanish onion, grated (about 1 cup) 2 tablespoons canola, grapeseed or olive oil (not a heavy olive oil) 1 to 2 preserved lemons, depending on size 8 chicken thighs, with bone and skin Stems from the parsley and cilantro, tied with twine 1/4 teaspoon powdered saffron or 1/4 teaspoon powdered turmeric and 4 strands saffron 1 cup pitted green Moroccan or Greek olives 1/2 bunch Italian parsley, about 1/4 cup chopped 1/2 bunch cilantro, about 1/4 cup chopped Instructions: In a large bowl, mix the garlic, cumin, ginger, paprika, salt and pepper, 1/2 cup grated onion, and the oil. Rinse the preserved lemons, and remove the pulp. RESERVE the lemon peel for later use. Add the lemon pulp to the mixing bowl. Add the chicken. Mix everything together and place in a large plastic bag to marinate overnight in the refrigerator. (Twenty-four hours really gives the chicken the best flavor.) In a large Dutch oven or casserole, place the chicken and marinade; add the stems of the parsley and cilantro, the rest of the grated onion, the powdered saffron and 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat, turn down to a simmer and cook, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Remove the cover, stir the chicken and continue to simmer for another 15 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Remove the chicken to a serving dish and cover with foil to keep warm. Keep sauce on stove and begin to reduce. Slice the preserved lemon peel into thin slices and add to the sauce along with the olives, parsley and cilantro. Reduce until the sauce is just a little thick. This shouldn&#39;t take more than 5 minutes at most. Uncover the chicken and remove the skin from the chicken. (It doesn&#39;t look pretty and who needs the extra fat.)

Place all the meat in a large pot, 2/3 filled with water, cover then boil 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the water and refill the pot; then cover and boil the meat again for about 1 hour. Drain the collards; add them to the cooked meat and stock, along with the onion, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook the whole potful for another 30 to 45 minutes.

Grease three 6-inch cake pans with the butter. Combine the flour, granulated sugar, dry milk and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix well with a whisk until the dry ingredients are combined. While mixing on low with an electric mixer, add the oil, sour cream, vanilla extract and eggs. Lastly, add the instant pudding while simultaneously adding the warm water. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature before moving on. For the buttercream frosting: Beat the butter for a few minutes on medium speed, preferably using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. On slow speed, gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar 1 to 2 cups at a time, allowing each batch of sugar to incorporate with the butter before adding the next. (Use less confectioners&#39; sugar for a slightly more buttery, looser frosting, or more confectioners&#39; sugar for a slightly sweeter, stiffer frosting.) Increase the speed to medium and add the vanilla extract, cream and salt. Beat for an additional 3 minutes. To decorate: Before you start, fill a plastic piping bag with frosting. If you have a multi-opening decorating tip, insert that into the end of the piping bag before adding the frosting. If not, just cut a very small hole at the end of the bag to allow the air to escape as you fill it. Tie the bag with a rubber band to close. Add the leftover frosting to a bowl. Since you will need only 2 of your 3 cakes to start, set 1 cake aside for later. Step 1: Cut 2 of the cakes in half from top to bottom to make 4 half-circles. Leave 2 of the half-circle pieces as is and carve the rounded top off the other 2 pieces using a serrated knife to make them level. Step 2: Set the pieces together on a cake plate cut-sides down with the 2 level pieces in the center and the rounded pieces at each end with the rounded sides facing outward. With a spatula, add a light layer of frosting in between each piece. Step 3: Next, frost the entire cake. Don&#39;t worry about frosting it perfectly, as this layer will be covered up with more frosting later. Place the cake in the fridge to allow the frosting to set for at least 15 minutes. Step 4: While your cake is setting, use a serrated knife to carve off the darker thin exterior layer from the reserved third cake so that the cake is an even lighter color all around. Put the cake in a bowl and mix with a fork until it turns into fine crumbs. Add 2 to 3 large spoonfuls of frosting to the crumbs and continue to mix. Make sure you add enough frosting so that the mixture is pliable and able to be molded without crumbling. To test this, form a ball with the mixture in your hands. If it cracks, you need to add more frosting. Step 5: With your hands, mold the following: 1 large, rounded oval shape (the head), 2 small, pointed oval pieces (the ears) and 4 small oval pieces (the legs). Step 6: Attach the leg pieces to the body of the lamb, 2 at the front and 1 at each side. Use a small dab of frosting to secure the pieces in place. Next, add a dollop of frosting to the back of the head and place it atop the cake, positioning the head at an angle. Add 2 toothpicks to the head piece to help hold it in place. Add a small dab of frosting on each side of the head for the ear pieces. If your head doesn&#39;t feel stable atop the body, add a thin layer of frosting around the side of the head for extra reinforcement. Place the cake back in the fridge for at least 10 minutes to allow the molded pieces to set into the frosting. Step 7: Next, pipe the frosting for the hair onto the cake, covering the body of the lamb and adding frosting around the top of the head. Use short, quick motions to pipe 1/4-inch-long sections of frosting onto the cake. You want your frosting to be semi-stiff. If the frosting becomes too warm, it can start to appear a bit runny.

Let the ham boil (to flavor the water) while you make the klubb. To make the klubb: In a large mixing bowl, add the grated potatoes, egg and salt. Using a fork, mix well until thoroughly combined. Add 1 1/4 cups flour and mix well. Add up to ? cup more flour, a little at a time, until you get a thick, sticky dough that clumps together when pressed in your fist. Moisten your hands with water. Using a 1/3 cup measure, scoop the potato mixture into your hand and press an indentation in the center. Place a piece of ham into the center and press the potato mixture around to enclose it. Roll into a loose ball and coat in the flour. Then roll into a nice round ball. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture. You\u2019ll get about 8 to 10 klubb in all. Gently drop the klubb in the boiling water. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Let the klubb cook for 2 minutes to firm up, then loosen them with a spatula if they seem to be sticking to the bottom of the pot. Cook the klubb for 35 to 45 minutes, until firm, shiny and floating at the top. When the klubb have about 15 minutes left on the timer, make the Brussels sprouts. When the klubb are done, drain and nestle directly into the Brussels sprouts, adding another drizzle of oil if the pan looks dry. Cook undisturbed for a couple more minutes to get some texture on the klubb. Add the butter, mustard, salt and pepper. Stir to combine and fully coat. Season with flaky salt and black pepper. Serve with hot sauce at the table, if desired. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook undisturbed for 6 to 8 minutes until deeply golden. Give them a toss and add the remaining ham, the shallot, a couple of good pinches of salt and pepper.

Continue cooking, stirring constantly until thick, 8 to 10 minutes or so. Take off the heat and stir in the vanilla, salt, coconut and pecans. Allow to cool. Dip the cooled cupcakes in the chocolate glaze. Place on the rack and let the glaze harden. Scoop the topping on the cupcakes with a heaping 1/2-ounce ice cream scoop. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together onto parchment paper. With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, cream the butter and sugars until light and fluffy, 4 or 5 minutes. Add your eggs, 1 at a time, mixing until completely incorporated before adding each additional egg. Mix in the chocolate and vanilla, making sure to combine really well. Turn the mixer to low and slowly add the dry ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk, in 3 batches, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Make sure to let it mix thoroughly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 63486,&quot;Beef Rouladen with Brunoise Vegetables and Red Wine 1 1/2 pounds bottom round, trimmed 3 yellow onions, small dice 3 large carrots, peeled and diced 3 stalks celery, small dice 3 tablespoons garlic, minced 1 pound ground chicken Salt Black pepper 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs 1 egg, beaten 4 dill pickles 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 bunch parsley, chopped 3 cups red wine 1 cup port wine Fresh thyme 1 cup veal stock 2 cups chicken stock 4 tablespoons butter Instructions: Flatten the beef round with a cleaver, or meat pounder to1/4-inch thick, butterfly if necessary. Mix the vegetables together with the garlic. Take half of the diced vegetables and mix with the ground chicken. Season with the salt and pepper, bread crumbs and egg. Mix thoroughly. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Spread the chicken farce on 1 side of the flattened bottom round and add the pickles lengthwise, directly down the middle of the meat. Carefully roll the beef into a tight roll, being sure not to press too hard or squeeze the chicken farce out of the sides. Season the outside of the beef roulade with salt and pepper. Tie with butchers string in 5 or 6 sections along the length of the roll. Tie them fairly tight, because when the beef cooks it will shrink and the string will fall off. Sear the beef in a smoking hot saute pan in olive oil until all sides are a dark brown color. Remove from the pan and keep in a warm place. In the same pan, add the other half of the vegetables and cook for 3 minutes, when the vegetables are golden brown deglaze with wines and add the fresh thyme. Bring this mixture to a boil and add the beef and reduce the heat. Cover with either the lid or foil and cook for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and add the veal stock and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and turn the meat, so that the other side of the meat is in the liquid. Cook for 10 more minutes on a medium flame. Cook this mixture until the internal temperature reads 165-degrees. The chicken must read 165- degrees or you risk the chance of possible bacteria. If too much of the liquid evaporates add a little more chicken stock. Remove the meat from the pan and let rest for 10 minutes prior to slicing. Remove the string from the beef with a small knife. Slice the beef into 1/2-inch portions and transfer to a serving platter. Add butter to the vegetable mixture and swirl to melt. Spoon the vegetable mixture over the meat and serve with chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 63487,&quot;Garlic-Roasted Brussels Sprouts with &#39;Low &#39;n Slow&#39; Spicy Portuguese Sausage and Crispy Parsnip Chips 1 pound Brussels sprouts, stems and outer leaves removed, halved 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Big pinch kosher salt Garlic, crushed with garlic press 1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 spicy Hungarian sausages 5 parsnips, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds Peanut oil or canola oil, for deep frying Instructions: To make the Brussels sprouts: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the Brussels sprouts in a single layer in a baking dish, and drizzle them with extra-virgin olive oil and kosher salt. Mix together to coat evenly. Bake for 25 minutes. Add the crushed garlic bits to the sprouts and mix together. Cook for another 10 minutes. To make the Hungarian smoked sausages: Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Stab some holes in the sausages with a fork. Turn the heat down to medium-low and add the sausages to the pan. Cook them for 20 minutes, turning them every 4 minutes. To make the parsnip chips: In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat enough peanut oil to come halfway up the side of the pan, to 375 degrees F. Deep fry the parsnip rounds for a few minutes, until golden. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet and sprinkle generously with sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]&quot; 63488,&quot;Three-Seed Crown Loaf 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water 4 tablespoons honey 5 teaspoons instant yeast 8 cups freshly ground whole-wheat flour 4 teaspoons salt 5 teaspoons gluten (available at health food stores and specialty grocery stores) 5 teaspoons dough enhancer (available at specialty baking shops and online) 4 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sunflower oil 1 egg 4 tablespoons sunflower seeds 4 tablespoons poppy seeds 4 tablespoons sesame seeds Instructions: Measure the water and honey in a bowl and sprinkle the yeast on the top. Let the yeast sit for a couple of minutes to activate it. Add 2 cups of the flour, salt, gluten, dough enhancer, and 4 tablespoons of the sunflower oil to the yeast mixture and mix well. Slowly add the rest of the flour (approximately 6 cups) to the mixture until a soft, moist dough is formed and the dough no longer clings to the outside of the bowl. You may need a little more or less flour. Knead the dough until gluten is formed (it is critical that the gluten be formed or you will get a heavy bread). The dough should be smooth and spring back when pressed, about 8 to 10 minutes. You can also check to see if gluten is formed by doing the \window test. The window test is when the dough can be stretched and it doesn&#39;t break, but will stretch and create a translucent membrane or window. Rub 1 teaspoon of sunflower oil around a large bowl. Turn the dough in the oil, then cover the bowl and let dough stand until double, about 1 hour. While dough is rising, lightly grease a 12-inch deep Dutch Oven. When dough has doubled, turn out dough and shape it into a round even ball. Cut the ball into 8 equal wedges. Combine 2 of the wedges into a ball and place in the middle of the Dutch oven for the larger middle ball of the crown. Form the remaining 6 wedges into individual balls. Lightly beat the egg in a small bowl to make the egg glaze. Brush each of the balls in egg glaze and then dip 2 balls in poppy seeds, 2 balls in sesame seeds, and 2 balls in sunflower seeds. Place each set of balls on the opposite side of the middle ball so that you have the different balls alternating around the outside of the middle ball or Dutch oven (eg. Going around the circle, it may go poppy, sesame, sunflower, poppy, sesame, and sunflower.) Let the dough rise until just about double again inside the Dutch oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes to 1 hour. Notes: To get lighter dough you can substitute about 1/2 of your whole-wheat flour with white flour. However, you can still get remarkably light dough using all whole-wheat flour if you add the dough enhancer and gluten and make sure your gluten is properly formed during the kneading process. Adding the enhancer and gluten were tricks learned from my mother who raised us on home made whole-wheat bread. I have yet to find a better way to get whole-wheat bread as light and fluffy as this. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63489,&quot;Pressure-Cooker Shrimp and Saffron Risotto 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, coarsely chopped 3 large cloves garlic, smashed 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus additional for seasoning Freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice 2 tablespoons tomato paste Pinch saffron threads 1/4 cup dry white vermouth 3 cups chicken broth, low-sodium canned or homemade 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a 7-liter pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, fennel seeds, the 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften a bit, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, tomato paste, and saffron and stir until the grains are evenly colored. Stir in vermouth and chicken broth. Close the pressure cooker lid and bring the pressure up to high (which can take up to 10 minutes), then reduce the heat, if necessary, to maintain an even pressure for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and press the cooker&#39;s pressure indicator stem until no more steam comes out. Carefully remove the lid--the risotto will look a bit soupy at this point. Stir in the shrimp and let the risotto stand, off the heat, until shrimp are pale pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 63490,&quot;Sczechuan Noodles 6 garlic cloves, chopped 1/4 cup fresh ginger, peeled and chopped 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup tahini (sesame paste) 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter 1/2 cup good soy sauce 1/4 cup dry sherry 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 1/4 cup honey 1/2 teaspoon hot chili oil 2 tablespoons dark sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper 1 pound spaghetti 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 yellow bell pepper, julienned 4 scallions, sliced diagonally (white and green parts) Instructions: Place the garlic and ginger in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the vegetable oil, tahini, peanut butter, soy sauce, sherry, sherry vinegar, honey, chili oil, sesame oil, and ground peppers. Puree the sauce. Add a splash of oil to a large pot of boiling salted water and cook the spaghetti al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander, place it in a large bowl, and while still warm, toss with 3/4 of the sauce. Add the red and yellow bell peppers and scallions; toss well. Serve warm or at room temperature. The remaining sauce may be added, as needed, to moisten the pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63491,&quot;Baked Buffalo Cauliflower Tots 1/2 cup low-fat plain yogurt 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon 2-percent milk 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Pinch cayenne pepper 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Cauliflower Tots: 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 small onion, finely chopped 2 small heads cauliflower 1 cup almond meal or almond flour 2 large eggs, separated 1/4 cup hot sauce, plus more for serving Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 cups crispy rice cereal Cooking spray Instructions: For the blue cheese sauce: Whisk together the yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice, milk, Worcestershire and cayenne in a medium bowl until smooth. Gently stir in the blue cheese. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days, covered, to let the flavors develop. For the cauliflower tots: Position an oven rack at the top of the oven, and preheat to 450 degrees F. Set a cooling rack on a rimmed baking sheet. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until browned and soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, and let cool in the skillet. Remove and discard the outer leaves and core of the cauliflower. Separate the heads into large florets, and trim away most of the stems. Process half the florets in a food processor until very finely chopped, almost a paste. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining florets. Lay out a large double layer of cheesecloth, and put the cauliflower paste in the middle. Gather up the sides into a bundle. Hold the bundle over the sink, and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you possibly can (there will be a fair amount). Put the remaining cauliflower back into the bowl (it should be fairly dry now). Add the browned onion, almond meal, egg whites, hot sauce, 2 teaspoons salt and cayenne to the cauliflower, and work together with your hands until combined and the mixture holds together when squeezed. Scoop out even tablespoonfuls of the cauliflower mixture. Roll each into a ball, shape into a squared-off tot shape and place on a baking sheet. (The tots can be covered loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to overnight.) Pulse the rice cereal in the food processor until finely ground, then transfer it to a small dish. Whisk the egg yolks with 1/4 cup water in a medium bowl. Line up the tots, egg wash, ground cereal and prepared baking sheet (with rack) on your work surface. Dip each tot in the egg wash, letting the excess liquid drip off, then roll in the cereal to fully coat and place on the baking sheet. (To avoid a mess, designate one hand for the dipping and retrieving in the egg and the other for rolling in the cereal.) Spray each tot all over with the cooking spray, turning as needed. (The unsprayed breaded tots can be frozen on a parchment-lined baking sheet until solid, about 2 hours, then transferred to a large freezer bag and frozen for up to 1 month.) Bake the tots on the prepared baking sheet until golden brown outside and hot inside, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a serving platter. Shake some hot sauce on top. Serve with the blue cheese sauce. (If baking the tots from frozen, coat with cooking spray and bake for until golden brown outside and hot inside, 15 to 20 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 63492,&quot;Spaghetti Bolognese 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 ounces bacon or pancetta, diced 1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onions 3/4 cup diced carrots 3/4 cup diced celery 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 2 bay leaves 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 pound ground beef or ground veal 1/2 pound pork sausage, removed from the casings, or ground pork 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 cup red wine 2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes and their juice 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can tomato sauce 1 cup beef or chicken stock or broth 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 pound spaghetti 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until browned and the fat is rendered, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, carrots and celery and cook, stirring, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, salt, pepper, bay leaves, thyme, oregano, cinnamon, and nutmeg and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the beef and sausages, and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan and remove any browned bits sticking to the bottom of the pan, and until half of the liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juices, the tomato sauce, beef broth, and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, to keep the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the sauce is thickened and flavorful, about 1 1/2 hours. Add the cream, butter, and parsley, stir well, and simmer for 2 minutes. Discard the bay leaves and adjust the seasoning, to taste. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and return the water to a low boil. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent the noodles from sticking, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain in a colander. Add the pasta to the sauce, tossing to coat. Add 1/2 cup of the cheese and toss to blend. Divide among pasta bowls and serve with the cheese passed tableside.

Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven. Throw in the onion and cook until translucent. Now dump in the diced tomatoes and stir to combine. Add the tomato juice. Next - and this is important - in order to combat the acidity of the tomatoes add 3 to 6 tablespoons of sugar. Now, you&#39;ll want to start on the low side, then taste and add more as needed. Some tomatoes and juice have more of an acidic bite than others. (For what it&#39;s worth, and I realize it&#39;s not worth much, I use 6 tablespoons of sugar.) Next, add 1 or 2 tablespoons chicken base to the pot. I added 3, and it wound up being a little too much. Now you can add lots of freshly ground black pepper.

Brush four 8-ounce ramekins with butter. Pour the sugar into 1 ramekin and rotate it to coat the bottom and sides. Pour the excess into another ramekin and repeat to coat all the ramekins; tap out any excess. Refrigerate until ready to fill. Make the bechamel: Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-low heat. Just as the foam subsides, whisk in the flour to make a roux; cook, whisking constantly, to remove the starchy taste, 2 to 3 minutes (do not allow the roux to brown). Add the warm milk and continue whisking until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes. (Trace a figure 8 in the bechamel with the whisk; if the sauce holds the shape, it&#39;s done.) Flavor the bechamel: Remove the bechamel from the heat and whisk in the egg yolks one at a time. Season with salt, white pepper and the nutmeg, then whisk in the cheese until melted and smooth. (Return the pot to very low heat, if necessary.) Transfer to a large bowl and refrigerate until cool. Add the egg whites: Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with a whisk or mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the cooled bechamel mixture by slowly and gently scooping from the bottom to the top of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Fold in the remaining egg whites the same way until no streaks of white remain. Bake the souffles: Place the prepared ramekins on a baking sheet. Spoon the batter into the ramekins, filling each about three-fourths of the way. Use a towel to wipe the rims clean (this will help the souffles rise evenly). Bake until golden and puffed at least 1 inch over the rims, about 25 minutes. Serve immediately with fig compote and other garnishes (see below). Tyler dresses up his souffles with honeycomb, chamomile flowers, microgreens and this fig topping: Fig Compote: Combine 1 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cups water, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 2 lemon slices and 2 chamomile tea bags in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook, stirring, 5 minutes. Remove the tea bags. Add 12 halved dried figs, return to a boil and cook 10 more minutes. Remove the lemon slices.

In a saucepan over medium heat, add olive oil. Add the shrimp shells and toast until opaque and a little crunchy, about 10 minutes, tossing frequently. Add half the onion, the carrot and celery and cook, stirring, until softened. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring, about 2 minutes. Add the water, bay leaf, and peppercorns, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, about 30 minutes. Strain; you should have about 2 cups stock; if more, return stock to clean saucepan and reduce over medium heat. In a skillet, melt on medium heat the 4 tablespoons of butter, add the remaining onion, and cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, thyme, basil, red pepper, and paprika and cook another 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice. Carefully arrange shrimp in a pan large enough to hold them without overlapping. Pour seasoned butter over shrimp and mix well with shrimp. Bake until just cooked through, about 10 minutes. (Do not overcook or you will have rubbery shrimp.) Remove shrimp from pan and place pan back on stovetop over medium-high heat to make the sauce. Add beer and 1 cup shrimp stock to the seasoned butter, cook until reduced to 1/3 volume. Whisk in cold stick butter, 2-3 pats at a time, until sauce holds together. Remove from heat and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and hot sauce. Arrange shrimp on a platter and drizzle with sauce.

Blend together until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Pour 3 tablespoons of ice water over the mixture. Toss together lightly and gather the dough into a ball. Add more water until dough holds together. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour before using. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 14-inch round, about 1/8-inch thick. Place the dough in a 9-inch tart pan. Gently press it into the bottom and around the sides of the pan, being careful not to stretch the dough. Trim off the excess dough by rolling the pin over the rim of the pan. Line the inside of the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill with beans or pie weights. Blind bake in the middle shelf of the oven for 10 minutes. Remove foil, prick the dough all over with a fork and return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes, or until the shell begins to brown. Make the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a heavy 6 to 8-inch skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat until haze forms above it. Add the onions and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are soft and transparent but not brown. Stir in the paprika and set aside off the heat. In a bowl toss together the Gruyere and Emmentaler cheese until thoroughly combined. Spread half the cheese evenly in the baked pastry shell and scatter the onions over it. Cover with the remaining cheese. Beat the eggs cream, milk, salt, and nutmeg together with a wire whisk and pour the mixture slowly and evenly over the cheese. Bake in the upper third of the oven for 10 minutes. Increase the heat to 425 degrees and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the filling has puffed and browned and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove pan from the oven and remove the tart from the pan. Serve hot or at room temperature as a first or main course. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 63513,&quot;Italian Cream Cheese Cake with Raspberry Sauce 1 cup graham cracker crumbs 1 cup biscotti bread crumbs, crushed 1 stick butter, melted 2 cups ricotta cheese 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature 5 eggs 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 12 ounces fresh raspberries 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon brandy Instructions: For the Cream Cheese Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the onion, garlic cloves, carrots, celery, bay leaf, oregano, marigolds and salt. Add enough water to cover the chicken and bring to a boil over high heat. Once the chicken comes to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Once the chicken is cooked, allow it to cool in the broth for up to 30 minutes. Remove from the broth and shred with two forks. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve discarding the vegetables and herbs and reserve. The chicken can be made a day ahead. Store the shredded chicken and broth separately, covered in the refrigerator.<br> For the masa: Warm the reserved chicken broth. Beat the lard until light and fluffy in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the masa harina, baking powder and salt and continue beating until combined, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to incorporate all the masa harina. Slowly add the warm chicken broth 1 cup at a time until the masa is smooth and spreadable (you may not need all the broth). To test if the masa is ready to use, add a spoonful to a glass of water. If it floats it is ready. If it sinks, add additional lard 1 tablespoon at a time and continue to mix until it floats.<br> For assembly and serving: Remove the husks from the soaking water, drain and keep moist with a damp kitchen towel or damp paper towels. Moisten the chicken with some reserved chicken broth if needed.<br> Using a spoon, spread a spoonful of masa onto center of a corn husk and spread about 1/2 inch thick with the back of the spoon leaving a 1/2-inch border along the side and a 2-inch border from the top. Put about 2 tablespoons shredded chicken in the center of the masa. Fold the sides until they overlap, fold the narrow end under using the husk to press the masa dough over the filling. Place the prepared tamale on a baking sheet, cover with a damp kitchen towel and repeat until all the tamales are assembled.<br> Put the tamales upright in a tamale steamer, nestled together to prevent them from falling over. Fill the tamale steamer with about 2 inches of water\u2014the water should not touch the tamales. Cover with the lid, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 40 minutes, adding more water if needed. To check the tamales, carefully remove 1 tamale from the steamer. Tamales are ready when they can easily be removed from the husk. If the tamale does not easily remove from the husk, cook for an additional 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the tamales to stand in the steamer for 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Carefully remove the tamales from the steamer and serve warm, garnished with diced onions and dried marigolds if using.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 63522,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Easy Shrimp and Rice Pineapple Boats 1 pineapple 1 cup your favorite BBQ sauce<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 pound 16/20 shrimp, peeled and deveined<br> One 10-ounce tray microwaveable basmati or jasmine rice, prepared according to package 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br> 2 scallions, finely chopped<br> Zest of 1 lime<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup lightly packed fresh cilantro leaves Lime wedges, for spritzing<br> Instructions: For the shrimp: Preheat the grill or the oven to 350 degrees F.

Using a towel, grasp and oyster in the palm of your hand. Press the oyster, rounded-side down, on a firm surface, still holding it with the towel. Shuck the oyster by wedging the tip of an oyster knife (regular knives are too thin-bladed) between the halves of the shell, at the shell&#39;s narrowest end. When the knife tip is securely wedged, rotate the blade to pry open the shell. Slide the knife blade along the length of the shell to open completely. Remove the oyster from the shell and reserve, along with its juice. From each pair of oyster shells, save the one that is most concave on the inside, and discard the one that is flatter. Place the concave shells in a pan of cold water and scrub inside and out. Place the clean oyster shells on a cookie sheet and set aside. Dip the tomatoes briefly in boiling water to loosen the skins, then in ice water. Peel, cut in half, remove and discard the seeds, and dice. Have the remaining ingredients measured and ready beside the stove. When you are ready to begin cooking the oysters, place the cookie sheet containing the oyster shells in the oven. On the top of the stove, melt the butter in a hot saute pan until it begins to foam. Add the shallots, the oysters and their juice and the white wine. Cook the oysters 30 seconds, then add the heavy cream. Bring to a quick boil, then reduce to a simmer just 1 minute more, or until the oysters&#39; edges begin to curl. Add the tomato, tarragon and bacon. Heat another 30 seconds, then remove promptly from the heat. Remove the oyster shells from the oven and arrange 6 on each plate. Spoon 1 oyster into each shell and spoon a little of the sauce over each. A nice variation of this recipe is to place a \nest\ of steamed spinach in each oyster shell before adding the oysters and sauce. Serve with Melba Toast, brioche toast points or toast points of country bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63539,&quot;Breakfast Casserole 4 slices white bread Butter, for greasing 1 pound mixed mild and medium sausage, such as Salt Lick sausage 2 cups half-and-half 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt Pinch of pepper Dash hot sauce 6 beaten eggs 8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced, optional 1 1/2 cups thinly sliced, cooked unpeeled red potatoes 1 cup grated Cheddar 1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese Instructions: Cube the bread and place it in a lightly greased 8-by-11-by-2 inch casserole.

Turn the biscuit out onto a cooling rack and wipe the skillet with paper towels. Form the sausage into an 11-inch circle on a piece of wax paper. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to the cleaned skillet. Lift the sausage with the wax paper, flip it over into the skillet and carefully peel off the wax paper. Turn the heat to medium high and cook until browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Invert a large plate over the skillet. Using oven mitts, carefully flip the sausage onto the plate, then slide it back into the skillet to cook on the other side, about 5 minutes more. Remove to a plate. Wipe out the skillet with paper towels, return to medium heat and add 1 tablespoon oil. Crack the eggs one at a time into the skillet in a circle, overlapping very slightly. Once all the eggs are in, loosen the edges with a spatula. If the eggs are sticking, add up to 1 tablespoon of additional oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and reduce the heat to medium low. Cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 3 to 5 minutes.<br> Slice the biscuit in half horizontally. Place the sausage patty on the cut side of the bottom piece, arrange the cheese slices on top of the sausage (a slight overhang is okay) and slide the hot eggs on top of the cheese. Drizzle the eggs with hot sauce and cover with the top of the biscuit. Finish with a drizzle of maple syrup or honey if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 63544,&quot;Spiced Scallop-Zucchini Kebabs 1/2 cup lightly packed fresh cilantro 1/4 cup lightly packed fresh mint 1/4 cup light coconut milk Juice of 1 lime 1 jalape?o pepper, seeds removed 1 small clove garlic 1 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small clove garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, cracked 1/8 teaspoon hot paprika Kosher salt 12 to 18 large sea scallops, muscles removed 2 small zucchini, cut into 1/2-to- 3/4-inch-thick rounds Vegetable oil, for brushing Lime wedges, for serving Instructions: Make the chutney: Combine the cilantro, mint, coconut milk, lime juice, jalape?o, garlic, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender; puree until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve or up to 1 day. Prepare the kebabs: Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. When it foams, stir in the garlic, cumin, coriander, paprika and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring, 4 minutes. Remove the spiced butter from the heat and let cool. (The butter can be made up to 1 day in advance.) Preheat a grill to medium. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water, about 15 minutes (you&#39;ll need 4 to 6 skewers). Thread the scallops and zucchini rounds onto the skewers. Brush the grill generously with vegetable oil. Stir the spiced butter, then brush on the kebabs and season with salt. Grill the kebabs until the scallops are firm and just cooked through and the zucchini is marked, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Brush with more spiced butter.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a small glass and a pencil, draw 4 (3 1/2-inch) circles on each piece of paper. Turn the paper face down on the baking sheets. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt on high speed until frothy. Add 2/3 cup of the sugar and continue beating on high speed until the egg whites form very stiff peaks. Whisk in the vanilla. Carefully fold the remaining 1/3 cup sugar into the meringue. With a large star - shaped pastry tip, pipe a disk of meringue inside each circle. Pipe another layer around the edge to form the sides of the shells. Bake for 2 hours, or until the meringues are dry and crisp but not browned. Turn off the heat and allow the meringues to sit in the oven for 4 hours or overnight. For serving, place each meringue on a separate plate and top the shell with berries. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries on a sheet pan and toss with the sugar and vanilla bean seeds. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes.

Cut in the chilled butter or margarine until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. In a small bowl, beat together the egg and wine just to blend, then add all at once to the flour mixture, tossing together until the dough forms a ball.<br> Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead gently a few times until smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill while you make the filling. For the filling: Cut the eggplant in half. Brush the cut side with the vegetable oil and place cut side down on a baking sheet. Bake until very soft, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool until easy to handle.<br> Scrape out 2 cups of the eggplant flesh, and discard the seeds and skin. Place the eggplant flesh and the remaining ingredients in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process continuously until the mixture forms a very smooth paste. For the pastries: Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Divide the dough into quarters. Work with one piece of dough at a time, keeping the remainder covered. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each piece very thin (no thicker than 1/8 inch). With a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut out circles of dough. Place a teaspoonful of filling in the center of each, moisten the edges with a little water, and fold over. Pinch the edges together to seal and trim the edges with a fluted pastry wheel. Reroll the scraps of dough to make more circles.<br> Place the pastries 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light golden brown.

Lightly sprinkle the cod and salmon with salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons of the oil. Bake until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes, then cool and place in a bowl. Add one-quarter of the panko, the mayonnaise, parsley, pimentos, zest and some salt and pepper. Mix together gently to prevent the fish from breaking too much. Form two 4-ounce patties. The cakes should be moist. Gently crust the outside of the patties with the remaining panko, which will prevent the patties from sticking to the pan. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil in a medium pan, then place the cakes in the oil and pan-fry until warmed through and the outside is nicely browned, 3 to 5 minutes. For the remoulade: Mixing together the mayonnaise, pickles, lemon juice, mustard, parsley, scallions and some salt and pepper.

Cook, flipping occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, then finely chop. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with lots of ice and water; set aside. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Gently lower 6 of the eggs into the water with a slotted spoon and cook until soft boiled (the whites have set but the yolks are still runny), 5 minutes (see Cook\u2019s Note). Transfer the eggs immediately to the ice water bath to stop the cooking and let sit until completely cool, about 15 minutes. Carefully peel the eggs and reserve. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and spray a 6-cup jumbo muffin tin generously with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk the flour, baking powder, kosher salt, baking soda, pepper and sugar in a medium bowl until evenly combined. Whisk the vegetable oil, yogurt and remaining 4 eggs in a large bowl until smooth and combined. Stir the flour mixture into the yogurt mixture until just combined (do not overmix), then gently fold in the Cheddar, Pecorino Romano, scallions and reserved bacon until just combined. Transfer to a piping bag or resealable freezer bag and snip the tip. Put a couple tablespoons of flour in a small bowl. Pipe enough batter into each prepared muffin cup to just cover the bottom and help anchor the soft-boiled eggs. Carefully dust the soft-boiled eggs in the flour, shaking off any excess (this will help the batter to adhere), then place 1 upright in each muffin cup. Pipe the remaining batter around and on top of the eggs, making sure the eggs are completely coated. Use a rubber spatula or offset spatula to help smooth out the tops of each muffin (they should look domed). Bake until the muffin tops are light golden brown, the batter is just cooked through and the eggs inside are soft and jammy, about 16 minutes. Let the muffins sit in the tin for just 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Enjoy warm cut in half with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt and a few dashes of hot sauce.

In a large bowl combine the onion, lemon, garlic, half the thyme, and 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil; season with salt and pepper and mix it well. Stuff the bird with the mixture. Using 2 (3-foot) pieces of kitchen twine, tie up the chicken: Tuck the wing tips between the wings and the body. Put the midpoint of the twine under the chicken, bring the ends up and around the wings, and pull them tight against the body. Bring the ends of the twine up underneath the legs, wrap the string around them, pull the legs together, and tie them tightly. Place the chicken, breast side up in a roasting pan, and layer the strips of bacon up breast until covered. Scatter over the remaining thyme, drizzle over some more olive oil and season everything with salt and pepper. Roast the chicken for 1 1/2 hours; arrange the mushrooms around the chicken 45 minutes after roasting. Baste with the pan juices every 20 minutes. The chicken is done when an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (the legs should wiggle easily in their sockets.) Remove the chicken from the pan, cover with foil, and let stand for 10 minutes to rest. Serve the chicken with the roasted mushrooms and pan juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 63586,&quot;Nigiri Sushi 3 1/3 cup short-grain sushi rice, rinsed 4 cups water 5 1/3 tablespoons sushi vinegar, or 5 1/3 tablespoons rice vinegar, 5 tablespoons sugar and 3 tablespoons Salt 1 (4 to 6 ounce) piece sushi-grade tuna or salmon Instructions: Wash the rice until the water rinses clear. Drain the rice in a colander and let it stand for 30 minutes. Place the rice in a pot or rice cooker, and add 4 cups of water or follow the instructions on a rice cooker. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pot. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove the cover, place a damp towel over the rice, and let cool for 10 minutes. You can find sushi vinegar prepared at a grocery story or you can easily make it by pouring the vinegar, sugar and salt into a pan under low heat until the sugar and salt are dissolved. If you like sweeter vinegar, add more sugar. Pour sushi vinegar over cooked rice and mix it gently. You can do this in a wooden bowl for making sushi rice or in your rice cooker by turning off the cooker and pouring the vinegar and mixing gently and evenly and leaving it until it cools down to room temperature. The lid should remain open. Buy fresh fish at a fish market or a Japanese grocery store, make sure to ask the clerk if the fish is good for eating raw. Only purchase sushi-grade fish. With salmon, be sure to cover fish with salt and leave for 1 hour. Then, rinse off salt and put it into the freezer. Once frozen, defrost and use for sushi. Slice the fish very thinly into bite-sized pieces. Hand-mold fingers of rice and place a thin slices of fish on the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63587,&quot;Pita Pockets with Grilled Veggies 2 small green, red or yellow bell peppers, cut into 2-inch strips 2 slices fresh or canned DOLE?

Lightly brush both sides of the bread slices with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet and put into the oven for about 12 minutes, or until crispy on the outside and soft within. Keep warm until needed. Turn on your espresso machine and build up the pressure. In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat just until it simmers. Remove from the heat. Break the eggs into a bowl, whisk until blended, and season with salt and pepper. Whisk in the hot cream and 1 tablespoon of the chives. Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture into a heatproof 1-cup measuring cup (a metal pitcher for steaming milk works well). Plunge the steamer wand deep into the eggs and steam them, keeping the nozzle deep and rotating the cup to cook the eggs evenly. Don&#39;t shake the cup or the eggs will scramble. You want them to set into a cake, being careful not to overcook them. You will notice the noise changes as the eggs solidify. Lower the cup and steam the surface of the eggs. The eggs should remain soft and not be fully set. Invert the cup onto a warm plate, top with a spoonful of caviar, and sprinkle with some of the remaining chives. Serve with 2 slices of the toasted bread. Repeat to make 4 servings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Prosecco]</p><p>&quot; 63590,&quot;Bulgur Meatloaf with Prunes and Gouda 1 1/2 pounds ground meatloaf mix (equal parts ground beef, pork and veal or turkey) 1 cup fine bulgur 1 cup grated Gouda 1/2 cup pitted prunes, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 medium onion, grated 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 cup ketchup Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons apricot preserves 2 teaspoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Bring the water to a boil. Fry the guanciale in a skillet until crispy; do not drain the fat drippings. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat the whole eggs with the Pecorino Romano cheese for 1 minute. Then add the freshly ground black pepper. At this point your water should be boiling. Add your pasta and cook it for 8 to 9 minutes or according to the instructions on the box (or if using fresh pasta, cook for 4 to 5 minutes). When the pasta is cooked al dente (chewy and firm), drain the pasta well, add the pasta to the bowl with the mixture of eggs and cheese, mix quickly and then finally add the guanciale with all the fat drippings. Stir quickly for a few more minutes and serve in hot bowls. Heap the flour into a pile on a wood or marble countertop. Make a large well or crater in the center, big enough to the hold the eggs like a bowl. Break the eggs in the center and knead for about 10 minutes, pausing after 5 minutes in order to let the dough relax. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

Repeat 3 more times. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 63595,&quot;Butternut Squash and Mussel Soup 2 pounds fresh mussels 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 fresh cl pepper, chopped 1 cup dry white wine Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 onion, chopped 10 ounces butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cubed (about 2 cups) 7 ounces ditalini pasta 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Chopped fresh parsley, for topping (optional) Instructions: The first thing you have to do is clean the mussels. Put them in a colander and rinse them under cold running water to remove any sand and grit. Mussels often have little threads that look like seaweed hanging off them called beards. Rip them off. The mussels should be closed; discard any that are open. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cl pepper and cook for a minute. Add the mussels, wine, and salt and pepper to taste and stir together. Bring to a simmer and cover with a lid, allowing the mussels to steam open, which should take about 5 minutes. Cook until all of the mussels are fully opened. Discard any unopened mussels. Let this cool down a bit. Remove and discard the garlic. When the mussels are cool enough to handle, shell them and discard the shells. Put the mussels in their broth and set aside. In another large saucepan, heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, butternut squash, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the onion gets slightly golden, about 8 minutes. Add the pasta and mix together. Add 3 cups water, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until the pasta is done and the squash is fork-tender, about 12 minutes. Eyeball it here: If your ingredients need to cook longer and you need more liquid, add more water. If you want to give the soup a creamier consistency, mash half of the squash with the back of a fork. Add the mussels and broth to the squash and pasta mixture; let it simmer for about 5 minutes to combine the flavors. Remove from the heat and add the Parmigiano before serving. Top with the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 63596,&quot;Fig and Pepita Goat Cheese Log One 10.5-ounce log goat cheese 1/4 cup fig jam<br> 1/2 cup toasted, salted pepitas (shelled pumpkin seeds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place the goat cheese log on a cheese board, plate or platter.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the sesame oil, white wine vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar. Set aside. Prepare an ice bath: Fill a large bowl halfway with ice cubes and add some cold water. Place a colander squarely inside the ice bath. The colander will keep you from having to pick the asparagus out from amongst the ice cubes in the ice bath. Add salt until the boiling water tastes like seawater. Add the asparagus to the boiling water and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes - you want them to be crunchy. If the asparagus are thin, cook for only 1 minute. Remove the asparagus from the water with a strainer and transfer them to the colander inside the ice bath. Allow them to cool completely for a few minutes and then place them on a kitchen towel to drain any excess moisture. Toss the asparagus, sesame seeds, and the sauce together and refrigerate for 1 hour, or until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63598,&quot;Chudleighs Nanaimo Bars 1/2 cup butter 1/4 cup sugar 5 tablespoons cocoa 1 egg, well beaten 2 cups graham cracker crumbs 1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup walnuts, finely chopped 1/2 cup butter 2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons custard powder 1 tablespoon milk 4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate 2 tablespoon butter Instructions: Mix butter, sugar and cocoa.

Add 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil and swirl to coat the wok. Add the shrimp and stir-fry just until pink, about 2 minutes. Remove shrimp and reserve. Add eggs to wok and scramble until set, but still slightly runny. Remove from pan, breaking into bite-sized pieces, and wipe wok clean. Return wok to heat, add remaining 2 tablespoons peanut oil, and swirl to coat the wok. Reduce the heat to medium-high, add the onions, garlic, and ginger and stir-fry until onion is half-cooked, 1 minute. Add the red pepper and stir-fry until just tender but still crisp, about 2 minutes. Add the cold rice, quickly spreading it all over the wok and tossing it to heat through, then fry for about 5 to 7 minutes. (Add a little more oil if the rice is sticking.) When the rice is hot, add the peas and toss to heat through, about 1 minute. Add the pork, reserved shrimp, eggs, and salt, and stir fry to heat thoroughly, 1 to 2 minutes.

Pour into a spice grinder and process until powdered. In a small food processor or blender, combine the toasted spice mix and the rest of the wet masala ingredients. Process until smooth. Place a large (preferably nonstick) pot over high heat and add the oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the onions and serrano pepper. Stirring frequently, saute the onions until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Don&#39;t let them burn! Turn the heat down to medium-high if they&#39;re starting to burn. Add the ground wet masala, taking care because it will sizzle wildly and steam up your glasses, if you wear them. Stir quite vigorously and turn down the heat if it&#39;s bubbling too furiously. Don&#39;t wash the food processor bowl yet. Keep stirring, with short pauses, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the masala comes together as one mass, about 2 minutes. Also, you may see little droplets of oil on the perimeter of the masala. That&#39;s a good sign! Quickly add the meat and stir, coating the meat in the masala. Stir and cook about 5 minutes until the meat browns. Remember that dirty food processor bowl? Fill it with 1 cup of hot water (from the tap is fine), swirl it around so it picks up any leftover masala, and pour that into the pot. Add salt and pepper, stir, bring the curry to a boil, and then turn it down to a simmer. Cover and cook 30 minutes. Then cook with the lid ajar for another 10 minutes to thicken the gravy slightly. Check the meat at the end of the cooking time; it should be tender and not chewy at all. Adjust the salt if you like, and serve over rice or with chapatis (whole wheat griddle bread). Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. Save what you don&#39;t use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It&#39;s a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 63617,&quot;Dubby&#39;s Puppies 2 cups self-rising cornmeal 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder Boiling water, to combine 1 egg 1 can smoked oysters, chopped 3 jalapenos, chopped 1 onion, chopped 5 egg whites, beaten slightly Panko Japanese bread crumbs, for coating Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Mix all dry ingredients and add enough boiling water to make a thick dough.

Lightly spray four madeleine molds with cooking spray and then dust with flour. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the eggs until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add in the granulated sugar and lightly mix to combine. Slowly beat in the lemon zest, vanilla and salt. Then, with the mixer running on very low speed, slowly add in the flour, a little at a time, until incorporated. Still running on a low speed, drizzle in the melted butter. Add the food coloring and mix until fully incorporated and there are no streaks, adding more coloring as needed. Use a tablespoon measure to spoon the batter into the madeleine molds, about 40 in total. Use a small offset spatula to smooth the batter so that it fills each mold. Bake until cooked through and spongy, 14 to 16 minutes, checking throughout to avoid browned edges. Cool the madeleines completely on a cooling rack. For the mousse: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, cream together the cream cheese and 1/2 cup of the confectioners&#39; sugar until light, fluffy and smooth. With the mixer on low speed, add the cherry syrup, kirsch if using and the vanilla, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. When fully combined, stop the mixer. In a large mixing bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the heavy cream. Once the cream reaches the soft peak stage, add the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar and continue mixing until stiff peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, fold one-third of the whipped cream into the cream cheese to loosen the mixture. Then gently fold in the remaining whipped cream, being careful to avoid deflating the whipped cream. Once combined, fold in the sour cherries. Transfer the mousse to a large piping bag and cut off the corner. On a large platter or clean cutting board, pipe a thick circle of mousse to act as glue. Layer the madeleines in a circle so that they look like leaves on a wreath.

This is what you will place the marshmallows on as they finish so they don&#39;t stick. Sprinkle the gelatin over 1/3 cup very cold water in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, mix the granulated sugar and corn syrup with 1/3 cup water. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. When the syrup reaches 245 degrees F, remove from the heat. Turn the mixer to medium (the bloomed gelatin will be thick and clumpy--don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s supposed to look like that) and slowly pour the hot syrup into the gelatin, being careful not to hit the whisk or let it run down the sides of the bowl. Once all of the syrup is incorporated, turn the mixer to high and beat until the mixture begins to cool; it will gain volume, turn white and start to pull from the sides of the bowl, and the exterior of the bowl will be close to room temperature, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the orange extract and mix to combine. Lightly spray a large serving spoon with cooking spray. Drop about 1/2-cup-size scoops of the marshmallow on the powdered sugar mixture and let cool, spraying the spoon in between scoops--you want 18 scoops total. Set aside.

Cover and cook until they start to open, about 5 minutes. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the clams to a bowl; discard any unopened clams. Pour the clam juices into a liquid measuring cup (avoid the sediment from the bottom of the pot). Wipe out the pot. Cover the clams to keep warm. Add the olive oil to the pot and set over medium-high heat. Add the onion, diced fennel, a big pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes and red pepper flakes; cook, stirring, until mostly dry, about 2 minutes. Add enough water to the clam juices to equal 3 cups, then add the liquid to the pot, cover and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, trim the green beans and cut into 1-inch pieces. Add to the pot along with the pasta and cannellini beans and their liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente, 8 to 10 minutes.

Top with chopped fennel fronds and the pesto. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 63635,&quot;Susan Feniger&#39;s Kaya Toast 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup granulated sugar 8 pandan leaves, washed and tied into a knot 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 3 eggs 3 egg yolks 2 slices dense white bread, such as pain de mie or pullman, toasted on 1 side 1 1/2 tablespoons shaved salted butter 1 soft boiled egg, peeled or 1 soft fried egg \sunny side up<br> 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce Dash ground white pepper Instructions: In a small sauce pot, mix together the coconut milk and 1/2 cup sugar. Stir in the pandan leaves and salt and bring to a boil over high heat, keeping the pandan submerged in the milk as the leaves cook and soften. When the milk has come to a boil, remove from heat and let the mixture steep for 10 minutes. Remove the pandan leaves from the milk, squeezing any excess liquid from the leaves into the milk. Discard the leaves. In a medium stainless steel mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Whisk in the coconut milk mixture to form a custard base. Place the stainless steel bowl over a medium pot of lightly simmering water. Gently cook the custard, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until the mixture thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. The final texture should have a thick custard consistency (a trail of the spatula should remain on the surface of the custard for more than 10 seconds). Immediately remove from the heat and strain into a medium bowl set over a larger bowl of ice water. Stir until the custard cools, then cover and refrigerate until needed. This makes about 2 cups coconut jam, more than is needed for the remainder of the recipe. The jam will keep for 1 week, refrigerated. Spread 2 tablespoons coconut jam evenly over both slices of the bread on the untoasted side. Then place a layer of shaved butter over the jam. Place one slice of bread over the other to form a sandwich. Halve the sandwich, and then cut each half into thirds to form 6 even wedges. To soft boil the egg, add the egg to boiling water. Cook for 6 minutes, remove and ice. Pour the dark soy sauce over the egg and dash with the pepper. Serve the egg alongside the sandwich wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 63636,&quot;Salzburger Nockerln Raspberry Jam, heated, recipe follows 7 ounces sugar 2 tablespoons tapioca flour, sifted 4 egg yolks 2 tablespoons orange liqueur (Recommended: Grand Marnier) 1 tablespoon orange zest, finely minced 1 tablespoon lemon zest, finely minced 8 egg whites 12 ounces fresh raspberries (about 2 baskets) 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the black peppercorns and squeeze in 2 of the halved lemons. Submerge the pork in the brine for 6 hours. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Remove the pork from the brine and dry off. Heat a large oven-safe skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add the oil and sear each side of the loin until golden, about 8 minutes total -- keep turning until it&#39;s golden all over. Add the sliced onions to the pan alongside the pork, and stir around to coat the onions in fat. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the pork until it reaches an internal temperature of 140 to 145 degrees F, about 30 minutes. For even cooking, be sure to stir the onions once or twice during roasting. For the sandwich build: Butter the pretzel bun halves and griddle them until golden brown. With a sharp knife, slice the loin into thin shavings. Spread some mustard on the bottom half of each bun, then top with some sliced pork. Sprinkle the pork with a little salt and squeeze the remaining lemon halves over the top. Top with the roasted onions and some Pickled Fresno Peppers. Eat while standing.

Rinse beef to remove any unwanted smells, pat dry with paper toweling and season with garlic powder and salt and pepper, and set aside briefly. Make an oven pouch out of a 3 foot length of heavy duty foil by bringing the 2 ends to the center, folding the sides to seal, and leaving an opening at the top center through which to place the sauce and beef. Shake flour in the pouch to coat the inside. Sear all sides of beef on the grill, then put beef in pouch and pour 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce and 1 tablespoon of the hot sauce over the meat (reserving the rest of the barbeque sauce and hot sauce). Seal the foil pouch by folding shut. Grill bagged beef directly on grill for about 30 minutes per pound. Ideally this should be cooked until fork tender, so that you can pull it apart with a fork. Let beef rest 10 minutes before carving into thin slices, or pulling it apart with a fork. Heat the reserved barbeque sauce and hot sauce in a small saucepan. Then chop or shred the sliced beef and serve on Kaiser rolls or crusty Italian rolls.

Add the garlic and shallots and saute until golden brown. Add lobster, crab, and chives and saute 2 to 3 minutes. Add Cognac and reduce for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for 30 minutes, until room temperature. Chop lobster mixture into small chunks. In a large bowl, combine lobster mixture and ricotta and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Lay out the first piece of Pasta Dough on the table and place 1/4-ounce mounds of stuffing 2 inches apart. Using a pastry brush, brush egg white around each bit of stuffing, making the dough damp not wet. Take the second piece and cover the bottom piece with the stuffing. Press around each ravioli being careful not to squeeze the stuffing out. Using a round ravioli cutter, cut each ravioli round and put on a sheet pan sprinkled with semolina. Gently place ravioli in boiling water and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. For the sauce: Using a 12-inch saute pan at medium heat, add butter, shallots, and saute until shallots are translucent. Add the crabmeat and saute for about 2 to 3 minutes.
