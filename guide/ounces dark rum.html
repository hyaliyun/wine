pot and stir to dissolve the sugar. Pour into a punch bowl and add the ice cubes and orange segments. Serve in tall glasses over ice with straws. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3706,&quot;Salt and Pepper Caramels Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons flaky salt 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 4 teaspoons mixed peppercorns, coarsely crushed<br> Instructions: Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper, leaving some paper hanging over the edges of the dish. Spray the parchment and the exposed sides of the dish with cooking spray. Combine the cream, butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the butter melts; remove from the heat and set aside. Combine the sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook, swirling occasionally, until the syrup is medium-amber colored and registers 310 to 320 degrees F on a candy thermometer.<br> Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the cream mixture. Return to medium heat and cook until the caramel reaches 245 degrees F. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla and 2 teaspoons peppercorns. Pour the caramel into the prepared dish and tap it against the counter a few times to help get rid of air bubbles. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons peppercorns. Let cool to room temperature. Cover the baking dish and let set completely, 4 hours or up to overnight.<br> Lift the caramel out of the pan using the parchment paper overhang and transfer on the paper to a cutting board. Cut the caramels into candies with a very sharp knife. (If the caramels stick to your knife, spray your knife with nonstick cooking spray.) Cut squares of wax paper a little bigger than your caramels. Wrap each caramel in a piece of wax paper and twist the ends closed. Caramels will keep at room temperature for about 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3707,&quot;Lavender Lemonade with Cava 1 cup sugar 1 heaping tablespoon food-grade dried lavender<br> 1 cup fresh lemon juice (6 to 8 lemons), plus lemon slices, for garnish 1 bottle chilled cava or other sparkling white wine such as prosecco or champagne<br> Instructions: Put the sugar and 1 cup of water in a small pot and bring just to a simmer, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat, stir in the dried lavender, cover and let steep for at least 20 minutes. Pour the lavender syrup through a fine-mesh strainer. The syrup can be made up to 3 days in advance and kept cold in the refrigerator. In a large pitcher, add the lemon juice, lavender syrup, 2 cups of water and ice and stir to combine. Taste, adding more water to reach the desired sweetness. Pour the lavender lemonade into individual glasses with ice, top with chilled cava and garnish with lemon slices. Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Cava, Prosecco, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3708,&quot;You Won&#39;t Be Single For Long Vodka Cream Pasta 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, once around the pan in a slow stream 1 tablespoon butter 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 shallots, minced 1 cup vodka 1 cup chicken stock 1 can crushed tomatoes (32 ounces) Coarse salt and pepper 16 ounces pasta, such as penne rigate 1/2 cup heavy cream 20 leaves fresh basil, shredded or torn Crusty bread, for passing Instructions: Heat a large skillet over moderate heat. Add oil, butter, garlic, and shallots. Gently saute shallots for 3 to 5 minutes to develop their sweetness. Add vodka to the pan, 3 turns around the pan in a steady stream will equal about 1 cup. Reduce vodka by half, this will take 2 or 3 minutes. Add chicken stock, tomatoes. Bring sauce to a bubble and reduce heat to simmer. Season with salt and pepper. While sauce simmers, cook pasta in salted boiling water until cooked to al dente (with a bite to it). While pasta cooks, prepare your salad or other side dishes. Stir cream into sauce. When sauce returns to a bubble, remove it from heat. Drain pasta. Toss hot pasta with sauce and basil leaves. Pass pasta with crusty bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti]&quot; 3709,&quot;Toasted Barley with Mushrooms 1 tablespoon olive oil 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup pearled barley 1 strip fresh lemon zest 6 sprigs fresh thyme 2 1/4 cups chicken stock 3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus whole leaves, for garnish 1 small yellow onion, diced 8 ounces any combination of cremini, shiitake, or oyster mushrooms (about 4 cups) 4 tablespoons grated Parmesan (about 3/4 ounce) Kosher salt Instructions:</p><ol><li>Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a medium saucepan. Add the barley and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the barley smells toasty, about 5 minutes.</li><li>Add the lemon zest, 3 sprigs thyme, and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 30 to 35 minutes, stirring occasionally. When most of the water is absorbed, add the chopped parsley.</li><li>Remove the stems of shiitake mushrooms and discard. Slice the mushrooms into 1/4-inch wide strips. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan. Add the onions and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and the remaining 3 sprigs thyme and continue to cook until brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li><li>Spoon the barley into warm bowls and top with the mushrooms. Sprinkle the Parmesan over the top. Garnish with parsley leaves and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3710,&quot;Crab Cake Mixture 1-ounce olive oil 1/2 Medium yellow onion, small dice 1 stalk celery, small dice 2 pounds crab meat 1/2 cup mayonnaise (recipe to follow) 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped 1 1/2 ounces Japanese bread crumbs Instructions: In saute pan, add olive oil. Sweat onions and celery in oil. Set aside. In a separate bowl, mix crab meat, mayonnaise, parsley, bread crumbs and onion-celery mixture. Chill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3711,&quot;No-Bake Oreo Truffle Snowmen 1 pound chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Oreo? (about 36 cookies) 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 cups white melting wafers 2 to 3 teaspoons coconut oil 16 small orange sprinkles or other tiny orange candies, such as Tic Tac? 32 mini candy-coated chocolates in assorted colors 8 red or green sour gummy belt candies, cut into 5 1/2-inch strips, then cut in half lengthwise 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips Black gel food coloring Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Process the cookies in a food processor to fine crumbs. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the cream cheese. Stir and work with a wooden spoon until smooth and completely combined. Roll about two-thirds of the mixture into 16 balls (about 1 tablespoon each) and put on the prepared baking sheet. Roll the remaining mixture into 16 smaller balls (about 1 teaspoon each). Freeze until just beginning to firm up, about 15 minutes. Press a small truffle onto each large truffle to make snowmen, then press a lollipop stick through the top of each snowman so that it sits up with the stick coming out of the head (it&#39;s ok if the truffles crack during this step; just form them back together with your fingers). Put the baking sheet in the freezer while you heat the melting wafers. Microwave the melting wafers and 1 teaspoon coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl on 50 percent power in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until melted. (Alternatively, melt in a double boiler.) Add another teaspoon of coconut oil if the mixture is too thick. Holding a snowman by the stick, dip it into the white coating mixture to coat completely, letting as much excess drip off as possible. Return to the baking sheet. While the coating is still wet, press an orange candy onto the head for a nose. Press 2 mini candy-coated chocolates onto the sides of the head for earmuffs. Repeat with the remaining snowmen. Refrigerate until the coating is set, about 5 minutes. Wrap a sour belt strip around the neck of each snowman, using a dot of the coating mixture as glue to secure it. Combine the chocolate chips, 1 teaspoon coconut oil and 1/2 teaspoon black food coloring in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until melted. Transfer to a piping bag or a resealable plastic bag and snip off the corner. Pipe on the eyes and a band connecting the earmuffs over the top of each head. Pipe 3 buttons down the front of each snowman&#39;s body. Refrigerate until completely set, about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3712,&quot;Barbecue-Roasted Salmon Nonstick cooking spray 1/4 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 4 teaspoons chili powder 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pinch cayenne pepper 4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, about 1-inch thick Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a shallow baking dish with cooking spray. In a small bowl, whisk together orange juice, lemon juice, brown sugar, chili powder, lemon zest, cumin, salt, and cayenne. Using tongs, add salmon fillets to the prepared pan. Pour the orange juice mixture over the salmon and turn to coat both sides.

Toss spinach with dressing, Gorgonzola and pecans. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 3738,&quot;Pork and Scalloped Potato Stew 700 grams (about 1 1/2 pounds) trimmed pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon flour 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 red onion, peeled and cut into 8 wedges 1 large carrot, cut diagonally into 3/4-inch slices 1 leek, white and light green parts only, washed and cut into 1-inch slices 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 1 cup (250 milliliters) dry cider 1 cup (250 milliliters) low-sodium chicken stock 2 sprigs fresh sage, leaves picked and chopped and reserved for the topping 1 bay leaf, optional 1 firm sweet apple, such as Gala 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 handfuls (about 2 cups) roughly chopped hearty greens, such as green kale, black kale, or collards 1/3 cup (85 milliliters) 35% cream Kosher salt, to taste Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Freshly grated nutmeg 1 tablespoon finely chopped sage, plus more for serving 2 medium (about 550 grams/1 1/4 pounds) sweet potatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick 2 medium (about 400 grams/3/4 pound) yellow potatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick 1 small red onion, thinly sliced rounds Sour cream, for serving Instructions: For the pork stew: Place a large cast-iron skillet or oven-proof pan over medium-high heat. Season the pork in a large mixing bowl with salt and pepper. Scatter with 2 tablespoons flour and toss to coat. Add the olive oil to the pan and sear the pork in batches until golden brown. Transfer to a plate. Add the butter to the pan along with the onions, carrot and leek and cook just until they begin to develop a little color, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic along with the remaining 1 teaspoon flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the pork and any juices back into the pan. Add the cider, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any brown bits. Stir in the stock, sage sprigs and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and cut the apple into 8 to 12 wedges, toss with the lemon juice and set aside with the greens. For the scalloped potato topping: In a liquid measuring glass or small bowl, combine the cream with salt, pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and chopped sage. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove the bay leaf and sage sprigs from the simmered stew and stir in the apples and greens. Arrange the sliced potatoes on top, alternating between the two colors, tucking in slices of red onion here and there. Brush the topping with the cream mixture and transfer the pan to the oven. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the potatoes are tender and golden brown on top. Cool for 10 minutes before serving with sour cream and a sprinkling of sage. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3739,&quot;Lemon-Ginger Molasses Cake with Whipped Cream 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed 2 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 1/2 cup unsulphured molasses 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest, plus extra for serving 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup whole milk 1/3 cup small-diced crystallized ginger, plus extra for serving Whipped Cream, for serving 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons creme fraiche 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch-round baking pan, line with parchment paper, then grease and flour the pan. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed for 3 to 5 minutes, until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. Add the eggs, one at a time, the molasses and the 2 teaspoons lemon zest and mix until combined. (The batter may look curdled.) Sift together the flour, ground ginger, baking soda and salt. With the mixer on low, slowly add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, scraping down the sides. Mix until smooth. With a rubber spatula, fold in the 1/3 cup crystallized ginger. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick just comes out clean. Don&#39;t overbake it! Cool in the pan for 30 minutes, turn out onto a baking rack and cool completely. Spread the top with whipped cream and sprinkle with crystallized ginger and grated lemon zest. Place the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, granulated sugar, creme fraiche and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on high speed, until it forms soft peaks. Refrigerate up to 4 hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 3740,&quot;Sausage Chili 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 pounds Andouille, or other spicy, smoked link sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 cups chopped yellow onions 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 tablespoons chili powder 1 tablespoon Essence, recipe follows 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 (12-ounce) bottle dark beer 1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, crushed, and their juices<br> 1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, crushed, and their juices 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 teaspoon sugar 6 cups cooked red kidney beans, drained and rinsed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup grated cheddar cheese, garnish 1 cup finely chopped green onions, garnish 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: In a large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, garlic, chili powder, Essence, and cumin and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 4 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the beer and cook until the foam subsides, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, and kidney beans to the pot. Stir well and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the chili from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Remove from the heat and transfer to a thermos. To serve, ladle into bowls or thick cups. Sprinkle each serving with grated cheese and green onions, and serve hot. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch. Published by William and Morrow, 1993. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 3741,&quot;Pumpkin Pie in a Sheet Pan Cooking spray 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 large egg Two 15-ounce cans pumpkin puree 2 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 4 large eggs, lightly beaten 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon grated nutmeg 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Position an oven rack in the bottom of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Tear off two 24-inch pieces of 18-inch-wide heavy-duty aluminum foil. Line a 10-by-15-inch rimmed baking sheet with the foil, crisscrossing the pieces and leaving an overhang on all sides. Fold over each overhang so it stands upright and forms a sturdy wall about 3 inches high. Crimp the corners together, and lightly coat the bottom and sides with the cooking spray.<br> For the dough: Beat the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high until smooth, about 1 minute. Add half the flour, and beat to incorporate; add the remaining flour, and beat until the dough just starts to come together in large, soft clumps. (It should hold together when squeezed.) Set aside 1/3 of the dough (for decorating the edges).<br> Press half the remaining dough into the bottom of the baking sheet until it is completely covered, with no gaps, about 1/4 inch thick. (The dough won&#39;t be completely smooth.) Press the remaining dough into and about 1 inch up the sides of the foil wall until the dough is about 1/4 inch thick and there are no gaps where the sides and bottom meet. Bake until the dough is light golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely on a rack.<br> Meanwhile, knead the reserved dough a few times to bring it together. Put it between 2 pieces of flour-dusted parchment; pat it into a disk, and roll it out to about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out about 50 rounds with a 1-inch round cookie cutter, gathering scraps and rerolling as needed. Lay all the rounds out on a parchment-lined baking sheet or platter, beat the egg with a little water and brush the tops of each round with the egg wash. Refrigerate until ready to use.<br> For the filling: Gently whisk together the pumpkin, cream, granulated sugar, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and salt in a large bowl until blended well.<br> Pour the filling into the cooled pie shell. Press the rounds in a single line all around the edges of the crust. (It&#39;s OK if part of the round sinks into the filling slightly.) Bake until the filling is only slightly wiggly when shaken, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool completely. Wrap and refrigerate overnight. Cut into squares, and serve with whipped cream.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3742,&quot;Floral Sugar Squares 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed 1 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons powdered sugar 1/2 orange, zested Pinch baking powder Pinch salt 4 large egg yolks Edible flowers Scant 5 cups or 1 kilo sugar 1 1/4 cups or 400 grams corn syrup 1 cup and 2 tablespoons or 250 grams water Instructions: Place the butter and flour in the bowl of an electric mixer, mix with paddle attachment the mixture resembles small peas. Add powdered sugar, orange zest, baking powder and salt, mix to combine. Add egg yolks and mix jut enough to make a smooth dough. Do not over mix the dough or it will become tough. Remove the dough from the bowl. If your butter was very cold, you will be able to roll the dough immediately. If not, place it in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. If necessary, remove the dough from the refrigerator. The dough will be hard when it comes out of the refrigerator and you will need to give it a few quick raps with a rolling pin to make it easier to roll. Lightly flour the dough and roll out into a 5 by 10-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Cut 1-inch square cookies and place them on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes and cool on a wire rack. Arrange the cookies on a silicone mat covered baking sheet. Cut the stems from the edible flowers and place 1 flower on top of each cookie. Place the sugar, corn syrup and water in a large saucepan and cook to 320 degrees F. Pour a small amount of cooked sugar on the short side of a silicone baking mat placed over marble or granite. Use an offset spatula to spread the sugar evenly over the entire mat until it is about 1/16-inch thick. The spread sugar will cool very quickly but you want to use it while it is still warm. Overturn the sugar layer onto the cookies and remove the silicone mat from the thin sugar sheet. Use a mini-torch or heat gun and melt the sugar until it melds into the flower and coats the cookie. Use the heat of the torch to \cut\ the cookies from the sugar. Move the finished cookie to a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 3743,&quot;Stewed Rabbit 2 rabbits 2 tablespoons cooking oil<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 clove garlic, chopped<br> 1 herb bouquet, chopped<br> 1 large onion, finely chopped<br> 1/2 cup mushrooms, chopped<br> 1 cup wine<br> 1 cup boiling water Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Serving suggestions: rice or mashed potatoes Instructions: Wash the rabbits in cold water and debone them by cutting at the joints like you would a chicken. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Place the cooking oil in a stewing pot (deep iron pot with a lid, if possible). When the oil is hot, place the rabbit pieces in the pot and let brown, about 5 minutes on each side. Once both sides are nicely seared, remove the pieces and set aside. Reduce the heat and add the flour to the pot and stir frequently until the mixture is brown, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to burn. Once the flour is brown, throw in the garlic, herb bouquet and the onion. Stir frequently and cook for about 5 minutes. Place the seared rabbit back into the pot, along with the mushrooms. Cook for another 5 minutes. Add the wine and water to the pot and bring it back to a boil. Once it has boiled, reduce the heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Place a tightly fitting lid on the pot, and let simmer for about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper again and continue to simmer until the rabbit is tender, about another hour. Serve hot over something like rice or mashed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Rioja, Tempranillo]&quot; 3744,&quot;Chicken in Milk 4 ounces (115 grams) or 1 stick butter 1/2 cinnamon stick 1 good handful fresh sage, leaves picked 2 lemons, zested 6 garlic cloves, skin left on 1 pint (565 milliliters) milk 1 (3 pound/ 1.5 kilogram) organic chicken Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C/gas 5), and find a snug-fitting pot for the chicken. Season it generously all over with salt and pepper, and fry it in the butter, turning the chicken to get an even color all over, until golden. Remove from the heat, put the chicken on a plate, and throw away the butter left in the pot. This will leave you with tasty sticky goodness at the bottom of the pan, which will give you a lovely caramel flavor later on. Put your chicken back in the pot with the rest of the ingredients, and cook in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Baste with the cooking juice when you remember. The lemon zest will sort of split the milk, making a sauce, which is absolutely fantastic. To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide it on to your plates. Spoon over plenty of juice and the little curds. Serve with wilted spinach or greens and some mashed potato. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3745,&quot;Breakfast Garbage Bread 2 1/2 cups frozen potato tots One 12-ounce package pork breakfast sausage 10 strips bacon (8 ounces) 5 large eggs 2 cups grated American cheese (6 ounces) 2 cups grated white Cheddar (6 ounces) All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 1/2 pounds store-bought pizza dough (see Cook&#39;s Note) Ketchup and/or hot sauce, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment and spread the potato tots on the sheet. Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 25 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and let cool. Lower the oven to 400 degrees F. Meanwhile, heat the sausage in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring to break up the sausage, until browned and no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Transfer the sausage to paper towels with a slotted spoon to drain; discard any remaining fat. Let the sausage cool, then crumble into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat the bacon in the skillet over medium heat and cook, flipping once, until browned, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain; discard any remaining fat. Let the bacon cool, then crumble into 1/2-inch pieces. Prepare a bowl of ice water and set aside. Cover 4 eggs by 1 inch with water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand for 6 minutes. Uncover and drain the eggs, then transfer to the bowl of ice water and let stand for 3 minutes. Drain and peel the eggs, then quarter each egg lengthwise. Toss the American cheese and Cheddar together in a small bowl until evenly combined. Roll the dough into a 20-by-14-inch rectangle on a lightly floured work surface. Starting from the shorter end, spread the cheese mixture evenly over half of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Scatter the sausage, bacon and potato tots evenly over the cheese. Arrange all the egg quarters, yolk up, along the short side of the rectangle. Working from this short side, tightly roll the dough up, jelly roll-style, into a log. Pinch the open seams together to seal, then tuck them underneath the log. Beat the remaining egg. Transfer the log to the prepared baking sheet and brush with the egg wash. Bake until the bread is golden brown all over, about 40 minutes. Let the bread cool for 10 minutes. Halve the bread lengthwise, cut each half crosswise into 4 equal pieces and serve warm with ketchup or hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]&quot; 3746,&quot;Fava Bean Soup Kosher salt 2 pounds shelled fava beans Extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 pound bacon, cut into lardons, optional (but I highly recommend it) 1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 ribs celery, cut onto 1/2-inch dice Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 3 cloves garlic, 2 smashed, 1 reserved whole 1 large Yukon gold potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 4 to 5 cups vegetable or chicken stock 2 to 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan High quality extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat and set up a bowl of well-salted ice water. Add the shelled fava beans to the boiling water. Once the water has come back to a boil, cook the beans for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove them from the boiling water and immediately put them into the bowl of salted ice water. Once the beans have cooled completely, strain them from the ice water. Peel the tough, light green outer layer from the beans. You will be left with a delicate, lovely vibrantly green tender fava bean. MMMMMM! Reserve these little lovelies.<br> Coat a large saucepan over medium-high heat with extra-virgin olive oil. Add the bacon (if using, if not just start with the onions and celery) and once the bacon has started to become brown and crispy and is very aromatic, add the diced onions and celery. Season with salt, to taste, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook the onions and celery until they become translucent and are very aromatic. Add the smashed garlic cloves and the diced potato, stir to coat with the oil and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 2/3 of the reserved fava beans and 4 cups stock. Taste for seasoning and add salt, if needed. Bring the stock to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.<br> When the potatoes are tender enough to slide easily off a fork when cooked, puree the soup in a blender* until smooth. You probably will have to do this in batches. Return the soup to the pot, and add the remaining fava beans. If the soup is too thick, add some the remaining stock to adjust the consistency. Taste the soup to check the seasoning and reseason, if needed.<br> Ladle the soup into serving dishes, give them a little sprinkle of grated Parmesan and a drizzle of big fat finishing oil.<br> Fava beany-weany delicious! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 3747,&quot;Chicken and Dumpling Soup One 3 1/2-pound whole chicken 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns plus freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 2 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 3 large carrots, 1 cut into large chunks and 2 thinly sliced<br> 3 large celery stalks, 1 cut into large chunks and 2 thinly sliced<br> 2 medium yellow onions, 1 quartered and 1 chopped<br> 2 medium parsnips, 1 cut into large chunks and 1 thinly sliced<br> 6 sprigs fresh dill, 3 left whole and 3 chopped 6 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, 3 left whole and 3 chopped, plus more for serving<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more as needed<br> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar<br> A few fresh grinds whole nutmeg<br> 3 large eggs<br> Instructions: For the soup stock: Combine the chicken, peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic, thyme, carrot chunks, celery chunks, quartered onion, parsnip chunks, 3 sprigs dill and 3 sprigs parsley in a large pot. Add cold water to cover by 2 inches (about 5 quarts). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is very tender, for at least 1 1/2 hours (or up to 2 hours if you have the time. The longer the better!) Add more water, as needed, skimming off scum (there won\u2019t be much) and, if desired, some fat. Carefully strain the stock, discarding everything except for the chicken. (You should have 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 quarts of stock.) Set the chicken aside to cool briefly while you put together the rest of the soup. Return the strained stock to the pot and bring it to a simmer. Add the sliced carrot, sliced celery, chopped onion, sliced parsnip, chopped dill, chopped parsley and the salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the dumplings: In a small saucepan, bring the butter and 3/4 cup water to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour. Let cool for a few minutes so it\u2019s not so hot that it will cook the eggs, then whisk in the salt, sugar, nutmeg and the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated into a slightly lumpy thick batter. (It\u2019ll take a little work to whisk in the eggs.) Drop heaping teaspoons of the dumpling mixture into the simmering soup, then cover and cook until the vegetables are tender and the dumplings are cooked through; begin checking for doneness at 15 minutes. Pull the chicken meat off the bones and chop into bite-sized pieces. Season it with salt, then add it to the soup along with the ground black pepper. Taste and add more salt as needed. This is important: The amount of salt in a chicken soup can mean the difference between unappetizing chicken tea and the elixir of bubble love that it should be. So don\u2019t skip this step, and don\u2019t rush it, either. Taste your soup, and if it doesn\u2019t make you smile reflexively, add more salt, about a 1/2 teaspoon of it, and give it a few good stirs so it can dissolve. Taste and repeat, as needed, until it tastes good. Serve, garnishing with fresh parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3748,&quot;Stuffed Tomatoes 8 large tomatoes 8 ounces ground veal or pork A knob of butter 4 slices hard toast, crumbled 1 to 2 eggs, beaten 3 tablespoons chopped parsley 1 clove garlic, chopped Freshly grated nutmeg Salt Black pepper, freshly ground Oil Instructions: Cut the top off each tomato, scoop the pulp and seeds out and turn the tomatoes upside down on paper towel to drain. Leave for 1/2 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Fry the meat with the butter in a frying pan until the meat is browned and crumbly. Remove from the heat. Add the toast crumbs, eggs, parsley, garlic, nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. Stuff the tomatoes with the meat mixture and put the tomato lids back on the tomatoes. Place the tomatoes in a deep, ovenproof dish and put a drop of oil on each lid.

Set aside. For the pasta: In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta for 10 minutes (it should still be firm as it will continue to cook in the sauce). Drain and set aside, reserving about 1 cup of the pasta-cooking water. While the pasta cooks, heat a 3 1/2-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, mushrooms, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the shallots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown. Remove the cooked mushrooms to a plate and drizzle with the truffle oil. Preheat the broiler to high. Reduce the heat to medium under the Dutch oven. Add the butter and flour and mix with a wooden spoon to form a paste. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, for another minute. Slowly whisk in the milk. Bring this mixture to a simmer, whisking occasionally to prevent sticking on the bottom. Simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in the gruyere, fontina and Parmesan and stir until fully incorporated. Add the pasta, reserved pasta water, cooked mushroom mixture, 3/4 teaspoon salt and the pepper to the cheese sauce and fold everything together. Top with the breadcrumb mixture and drizzle with the olive oil and truffle oil. Broil until the breadcrumbs are golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, about 8 minutes. Allow the mac and cheese to sit for 10 minutes before serving.

In a large saute pan, add the olive oil. Add the sweet potatoes and saute for about 5 minutes over medium heat. Add the Swiss chard stems, garlic and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are tender and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the Swiss chard leaves and continue to cook until the leaves are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Once cooled, add the walnuts, olives, feta and sun-dried tomatoes to the mixture, then toss until the ingredients are evenly distributed. Season with salt and pepper. Line an 18-by-13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a sheet of phyllo on the baking sheet so the corner of the phyllo sheet is aligned with a corner of the baking sheet. Brush with butter. Place another piece of phyllo overlapping the first sheet, making sure the corner of the phyllo sheet is aligned with another corner of the baking sheet. Repeat with 2 more sheets of phyllo, brushing with butter in between so the entire baking sheet is covered with a layer of phyllo. This is the first layer consisting of 4 sheets of phyllo. Repeat twice more with the remaining 8 sheets of phyllo so you have 3 layers total. Once all the sheets are stacked, spread the filling out into a rectangle, just smaller than a 9-by-13-inch pan. Fold over the dough so it just begins to cover the filling all around the edges. Bake until the crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. For the sauce: In a small saucepot over medium heat, combine the olive oil, crushed red pepper flakes and garlic. Cook until the garlic begins to toast and becomes golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the red wine vinegar to stop the garlic from continuing to brown. Reduce by half and add the honey. Bring to a boil, then remove the mixture from the heat and let cool until thickened slightly. Add the walnuts and olives. Season with salt and pepper if needed. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving. Serve the galette with the sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 3778,&quot;Irish Soda Bread 5 cups sifted all-purpose unbleached flour 3/4 cup sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 pound (1 stick) butter 2 1/2 cups mixed light and dark raisins, soaked in water for 15 to 20 minutes and drained 3 tablespoons caraway seeds 2 1/2 cups buttermilk 1 large egg, slightly beaten Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter 2 (9 by 5-inch) bread pans. Stir together the sifted flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Cut in the butter and mix very thoroughly with your hands until it gets grainy. Stir in raisins and caraway seeds. Add the buttermilk and egg to the flour mixture. Stir until well moistened. Shape dough into 2 loaves and place in the pans. Bake for 1 hour. Test with a toothpick for doneness. Cool in the pans for 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Chenin Blanc, Sparkling wine]&quot; 3779,&quot;Gnocchi 6 large Idaho or Russet potatoes 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon salt Dash of freshly ground white pepper 2 eggs, beaten 4 cups unbleached flour Grated Parmigiano for serving Instructions: Boil the potatoes in their skins about 40 minutes, until easily pierced with a skewer. When cool enough to handle, peel and rice the potatoes, and set them aside to cool completely, spreading them loosely to expose as much surface as possible to air. (The reason for this is to allow as much evaporation of moisture as possible to avoid the need of additional flour, therefore keeping the gnocchi light.) Before proceeding further, bring 6 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of the salt to a boil. On a cool, preferably marble work surface, gather the cold riced potatoes into a mound, forming a well in the center. Stir the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the white pepper into the beaten eggs and pour the mixture into the well. Work the potatoes and eggs together with both hands, gradually adding 3 cups of the flour and scraping the dough up from the work surface with a knife as often as necessary. (Incorporation of the ingredients should take no longer than 10 minutes. The longer the dough is worked, the more flour it will require and the heavier it will become.) Dust the dough, your hands, and the work surface lightly with flour and cut the dough into six equal parts. Continue to dust dough, hands, and surface as long as the dough feels sticky. Using both hands, roll each piece of dough into a rope 1/2-inch thick, then slice the ropes at 1/2 inch intervals. Indent each dumpling with a thumb, or use the tines of a fork to produce a ribbed effect. (This facilitates adhesion of the sauce.) Drop the gnocchi into boiling water a few at a time, stirring gently and continuously with a wooden spoon, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until they rise to the surface. Remove the gnocchi from the water with a slotted spoon or skimmer, transfer them to a warm platter, adding a little sauce of choice, and boil the remaining pieces in batches until all are done. Sauce as desired, add freshly ground white pepper to taste and, if appropriate, grated cheese, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 3780,&quot;Roquefort Butter 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 ounces good Roquefort cheese 1 tablespoon chopped scallions Instructions: Place the butter and Roquefort cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed until smooth.

Trace two 8-inch circles on 2 baking sheet-sized pieces of parchment with a marker. Flip them upside down onto 2 baking sheets. Set aside. Into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the egg yolks and whisk on high until lightened in color. Slowly add the vanilla and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar and continue whisking until the mixture triples in volume and ribbons when the whisk is lifted from the batter, leaving a trail that takes a few seconds to dissolve back into the mixture, about 5 minutes. Sift the flour over the mixture and fold in to incorporate until there are no pockets of flour left. Transfer the egg yolk mixture to a small bowl and clean the mixing bowl and whisk very well. Add the egg whites to the bowl and mix on high until just foamy. Add the salt and then slowly add the remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar, whisking on high until the meringue holds stiff, glossy peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer a scant cup of the meringue to the egg yolk mixture and fold to combine and lighten. Add the remaining whites to the egg yolk mixture and gently fold into the batter until no white streaks remain. Transfer the batter to a large pastry bag fitted with a medium open tip (Ateco 806) and pipe 4 circles onto the parchment using the traced circles as guides, starting from the middle and spiraling out. Sift an even layer of confectioners&#39; sugar over the batter. Bake until the layers are gold brown and springy, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely, then trim the layers using an 8-inch cake pan as a guide and a sharp knife to make the layers perfectly round. For the filling: Whisk together the granulated sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl to combine. In a heatsafe bowl, whisk together the yolks, Marsala, salt and sugar-cornstarch mixture to combine. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl (otherwise you could scorch the eggs). Heat, whisking constantly, until the sugar is completely dissolved, the mixture thickens to the point that it coats the back of a wooden spoon and a candy thermometer inserted in the center reads 170 degrees F, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Whip the cream in a bowl with a mixer to stiff peaks. Fold together the whipped cream and cooled egg yolk mixture (zabaglione). Transfer the cream filling to a pastry bag with a large open tip. For the trifle: Place a sponge round in the bottom of a trifle dish. Using a pastry brush, brush a generous layer of the Coffee Simple Syrup onto the sponge layer. Slice half of the strawberries in half and place them cut-side out around the sides of the trifle dish. Then place a few whole strawberries in the center. Pipe an even layer of the cream filling over the layer and sift an even layer of cocoa powder on top of that. Top with another sponge round, brush with the coffee syrup and then top evenly with the raspberries. Pipe the cream filling on top of the raspberries and dust with cocoa powder. Top with another sponge, brush with coffee syrup and spread with a thin even layer of the cream filling. Dust with cocoa powder and decorate the top with more cream filling and the remaining berries. (Reserve the remaining sponge for another use.) Put the coffee and sugar in a saucepan and heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 3807,&quot;Pompano Pontchartrain 6 (8-ounce) pompano fillets, skin on Salt and white pepper 1 to 2 tablespoons oil, plus 1 to 2 tablespoons more, if needed 1 1/2 pounds jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over 10 ounces (2 1/2 sticks) butter, melted 1 ounce parsley leaves, chopped Parsley sprigs, for garnish 3 lemons, halved Instructions: Season the fish with salt and white pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add fish, skin side up, and cook for about 3 minutes or until browned. (You may have to cook fish in 2 batches, add more oil as necessary.) Flip fish and cook for an additional 3 minutes or until cooked through. Keep warm. While the fish is cooking, heat the crabmeat and melted butter in another large skillet over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper. Cook just until crabmeat is hot. To serve, place a pompano fillet in the center of each plate, and top with 3 ounces of crabmeat.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Unfold the pastry, and cut out rounds with a 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter (you should get roughly 40). Space them at least 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly score the center of each round with a 3/4-inch cookie cutter (don&#39;t press all the way through). Lightly brush each round with the egg. Invert another rimmed baking sheet on top of the dough rounds, and bake for 5 minutes. (Covering the rounds helps them puff straight up evenly.) Remove the top baking sheet, and continue to bake until golden, 8 to 10 minutes more. Let the rounds cool completely on the baking sheet, then use the handle of a wooden spoon to gently punch a hole in the middle of each round. (The baked pastry can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 1 day or frozen for up to 1 month.) Meanwhile, microwave the vinegar and sun-dried tomatoes in a small bowl, covered, for 30 seconds; let cool. Reserve 1 teaspoon of the vinegar, and finely chop the tomatoes. Finely shred the cucumber, and squeeze out all the excess moisture. Mash together the tomatoes, reserved vinegar, shredded cucumber, cream cheese, chives and 1/4 teaspoon salt with a fork in a medium bowl until smooth. Transfer the cream cheese filling to a pastry bag or resealable plastic bag (cut off the tip). (The filling can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.) Tear or cut the salmon into 40 small pieces, and roll each into a rough rosette shape. Pipe some of the filling into each puff. Top each with a piece of salmon, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 10-or 12-inch heavy ovenproof skillet over medium-low heat. Add the fennel and saute for 8 to 10 minutes, until the fennel is tender. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the tomatoes with the liquid, tomato paste, oregano, Pernod, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes. Arrange the shrimp, tails up, in one layer over the tomato-mixture in the skillet. Scatter the feta evenly over the shrimp. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, parsley, and lemon zest with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle over the shrimp. Bake for 15 minutes, until the shrimp are cooked and the bread crumbs are golden brown. Squeeze the juice of 1 lemon over the shrimp. Serve hot with the remaining lemon cut into wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 3814,&quot;Slow-Roasted Aromatic Shoulder of Pork 1 pork shoulder, skin scored (approximately 12 to 14 pounds) 6 garlic cloves 1/2-inch piece fresh ginger 2 fresh red chiles or 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 3 tablespoons olive oil (not extra-virgin) 4 tablespoons sherry or rice vinegar Instructions: The pork takes 24 hours to cook, which is no cause for alarm, because for about 23 hours and 55 minutes you are ignoring it absolutely. And it makes your house smell like a home should. So, if you&#39;re planning to eat this for Sunday lunch, at about Saturday lunchtime, preheat your (clean) oven to the hottest it will go. Sit the pork skin-side-up on a rack over a roasting pan. I like to use a mortar and pestle to make my paste but you could just grate the garlic and ginger (a microplane grater is the tool for the job) and stir in chiles, a tablespoonful of oil and 2 of vinegar if you want. Otherwise, pound together the peeled chopped ginger and peeled cloves with the fresh chiles, adding a tablespoonful of oil and 2 of vinegar when they&#39;re squished and paste-like. Using your fingers, rub this paste over the scored skin, pushing bits into the cut lines of the rind. Stagger across to the oven and put in the tray, leaving it for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, into the bowl in which you mixed the paste, pour the 2 remaining tablespoons each of oil and vinegar. When the pork&#39;s had its half an hour, remove it from the oven, and turn the temperature down to 225 degrees F. Now turn the pork over: I find it easiest to lift it by hand wearing oven mitts. It makes them dirty, OK, but there is the washing machine... Pour the oil and vinegar over the underside (which is now uppermost on the rack) and put the pork back in the low oven, leaving it there for 23 hours. (Actually, you could leave it longer. One of the joys of this is that it cannot overcook.) Anyway, after 23 hours, or 30 to 40 minutes before you actually want to eat, turn the oven back to the highest it will go, remove the pork and turn it back crackling side up. Put it back in the oven for 30 minutes, in which time it will get hot and crisp, though you can give it another 10 if you feel it needs it. Remove, slice off the crackling in a horizontal swipe of the knife and break it into manageable pieces, then start carving or pulling at the tender meat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 3815,&quot;Thai Green Curry Shrimp 8 lime wedges, garnish 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 cups diced eggplant (1/2-inch dice) 1/2 cup chopped white onions 1 cup thinly sliced green bell peppers 2 teaspoons minced garlic 2 to 4 tablespoons Thai green curry paste, depending on desired degree of heat 6 Kaffir lime leaves, or 1 tablespoon finely grated lime zest 2 tablespoons nam pla (Thai fish sauce) 1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk 1 cup shrimp stock, fish stock or bottled clam juice 1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 1/2 cup chopped Thai basil (if unavailable use 1/2 Italian basil, 1/2 mint) 1/4 teaspoon salt Steamed white rice, accompaniment Instructions: In a wok or large saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant, onions and bell pepper and cook until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the curry paste, lime leaves, and fish sauce, and cook, stirring, for 15 seconds. Add the coconut milk and shrimp stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until thickened, 3 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook until pink, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup of Thai basil and remove from heat. Season to taste with salt. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup Thai basil. Serve with rice and lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer, Riesling]&quot; 3816,&quot;Fettuccine 1 pound 00 flour, plus more for dusting 25 large egg yolks<br> Semolina flour, for dusting<br> Instructions: Place the 00 flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the egg yolks, a few at a time. Continue to mix until the dough is smooth. If it is a touch dry, add a few drops of water. The dough will be bright yellow. Turn the dough onto a smooth, lightly floured surface and knead by hand until it forms a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into three equal portions and flatten the first portion into an oval about 3/4-inch thick. Remove the dough hook attachment from the stand mixer and attach a pasta roller attachment (or use a manual pasta roller for the next step). Set the attachment to the widest setting and run the first portion of dough through the roller. Fold the dough in on itself in thirds, rolling to knead out any air bubbles, and feed it through the roller two more times on the same setting, folding the dough in on itself and rolling between each. Change the attachment to the next setting and repeat the process, working your way through each width setting twice until the pasta is almost transparent. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Remove the pasta roller attachment from the stand mixer and attach the fettuccine attachment. Cut each rolled-out pasta sheet into 12-inch pieces and feed the pieces, one at a time, through the machine. Sprinkle the cut fettuccine lightly with flour and place in bundles on a parchment-lined sheet pan that has been sprinkled with semolina flour. Set aside until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 3817,&quot;Classic Creme Brulee 3 cups heavy cream 3/4 cup sugar 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 1 tablespoon dark rum 8 large egg yolks Extra sugar for the caramel top Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, 1 tablespoon of sugar and the vanilla bean. Bring to a scald. Meanwhile, put the remaining sugar, rum and egg yolks in a large bowl and whisk just to blend. While gently whisking the yolks, drizzle the hot cream into them to gradually warm them up. Strain into a pitcher. Divide the custard among 8 ramekins. Skim any bubbles off the surface. Put the cups in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the cups. Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 35-45 minutes. They should still jiggle slightly but their surfaces should be set. Let cool to room temperature in the bath, then remove the custards and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. To serve, sprinkle on some sugar and melt with the tip of a propane torch flame. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 3818,&quot;Spanish Tortilla 2 1/2 cups sliced Yukon gold potatoes 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus 1 teaspoon 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 cup red onion, sliced 1/8-inch 1 cup chopped chorizo sausage 8 eggs 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Picante Tomato Sauce, recipe follows 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons brown sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon minced ginger 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon yellow mustard seeds 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon curry paste Pinch saffron 1/4 cup olive oil 4 cups chopped Roma tomatoes 1 1/2 cups tomato juice, fresh or bottled Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium sized pot place potatoes and 1 tablespoon salt and cover with cold water. Boil for 1 minute, remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes before draining, this cooks the potatoes gently without breaking. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil and saute the red onions and chorizo sausage until the onions are tender and lighty colored. Whisk together the eggs, fresh thyme, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Toss the egg mixture with the potatoes, onions, and chorizo. In a 10-inch oven proof skillet heat the vegetable oil over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and gently shake to evenly distribute the filling. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the eggs have set. Invert the tortilla onto a plate and cut into thick wedges to serve. Serve with the Picante Tomato Sauce. Combine the white wine vinegar, brown sugar, and kosher salt in a stainless steel pot. Boil for 2 minutes and then remove from the heat. In a small bowl combine the ginger, garlic, yellow mustard seeds, pepper, ground cumin, cayenne, curry paste, and saffron. In a medium pot heat the olive oil just until it begins to smoke. Add the spices to the pot, carefully, as the oil may spit. Simmer for 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar mixture, tomatoes, and tomato juice. Simmer for 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 3819,&quot;Avocado Salad 1 bunch watercress 2 bunches red leaf lettuce 3 avocados 1/4 cup white vinegar 1 1/4 cups olive oil 1 tablespoon lemon pepper Instructions: Wash and dry the watercress and lettuce.

Spread on the inside of both halves of all the buns. Divide the lettuce, tomato and onion evenly among the bottom buns. Divide the sausage into 4 even pieces and pat and squeeze each piece into a ball. Put each ball on its own piece of plastic wrap and flatten into a thin patty 4 to 5 inches wide. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the patties from the plastic wrap, add them to the skillet and cook until browned on both sides and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Lay a slice of Cheddar on each patty, cover the skillet and cook until the Cheddar melts, about 30 seconds. Transfer the patties to the bottom buns. Crack the eggs into the skillet, sprinkle with some salt and pepper and cook until the egg whites are set and the bottoms and edges are crispy and the yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes.

Cook until the sugar dissolves, about 5 to 10 minutes. Do not stir. Increase the heat to medium and boil uncovered until the sugar turns a warm chestnut brown (about 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer), about 5 to 7 minutes, gently swirling the pan to stir the mixture. Be careful - the mixture is extremely hot! Watch the mixture very carefully at the end, as it will go from caramel to burnt very quickly. Turn off the heat, and stand back to avoid splattering. Slowly add the cream. Don&#39;t panic - the cream will bubble violently, and the caramel will solidify. Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature, at least 4 hours. It will thicken as it sits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Port]&quot; 3827,&quot;One-Pot Cheesy White Rigatoni with Peas for Two 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 small leek, white and light green parts, thinly sliced into half-moons<br> 1 stalk celery, finely chopped, plus leaves, for garnish<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 6 ounces mezze rigatoni<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> 1 teaspoon lemon zest plus juice of 1/2 lemon<br> 1 cup frozen peas<br> 1/2 cup low-moisture shredded mozzarella (2 ounces)<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan (1 1/2 ounces)<br> 1/3 cup heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon capers<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary<br> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.

Cook&#39;s Note: Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell.

Butter and flour 3 (9-inch) cake pans. Cut 3 circles of waxed or parchment paper to fit the bottoms of the pans, then press them in. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer,) cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugar and eggs and mix until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla, cocoa, baking soda and salt; mix. Add half of the flour, then half of the sour cream, and mix. Repeat with the remaining flour and sour cream. Drizzle in the hot coffee and mix until smooth. The batter will be thin. Pour into the prepared pans and bake until the tops are firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (a few crumbs are okay) about 35 minutes. Halfway through the baking, quickly rotate the pans in the oven to ensure even baking, but otherwise try not to open the oven. Let cool in the pan 10 minutes. Turn out onto wire racks and let cool completely before frosting. To frost the cake, use a spatula to cover 2 of the cake layers with frosting. Stack them together. Flip the third cake layer over and rest it on the top to create a very flat top for the cake. Frost on the sides and top with a thin \crumb\ layer to seal all the crumbs in and chill. Repeat with a finishing layer of butter cream. Place about 2 cups of butter cream in a potato ricer and press it through onto the top of the cake moving it in a circular motion to look like spaghetti. Place chocolate truffle meatballs around on top and chill until ready to serve. Just before serving, pour on the strawberry puree. In a saucepan place the sugar and carefully pour the water around the edge. Using your finger make an X in the pan to help the water gently mix with the sugar. Bring to a boil and cook to softball stage (235 degrees F.) Meanwhile, whip the egg whites in a mixer with a whip attachment until light and fluffy. When sugar is softball slowly pour it into the bowl down the side and continue whipping, adding vanilla, until incorporated and then cooled. Add the butter 1 cube at a time while whipping until it is a thick butter cream (check flavor and consistency of butter cream before continuing to add butter, as not all of the 2 cups may be needed). Keep at room temperature while frosting the cake. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan, and as soon as it boils, turn off the heat. Meanwhile, put the chopped bittersweet chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour the hot cream into the bowl. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth, add the peanut butter and whisk until smooth. Cover and let rest in a cool place overnight--do not refrigerate. The mixture will become firm but not hard. The next day, scoop balls of truffle mixture using an ice cream scoop onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Use your palm to gently press down the point that sticks up on each truffle. Transfer to the freezer and freeze until hard, 2 to 3 hours or overnight. Melt the semisweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water. It should be liquid, but not so hot that you can&#39;t touch it. Spread the cocoa powder out on a sheet pan with sides. Working in 2 batches to avoid crowding the pan of cocoa, dip the frozen truffles one at a time into the melted chocolate, shaking off any excess. Set coated truffle on the cocoa. Gently but thoroughly shake pan containing the truffles and the cocoa after the chocolate has started to set until truffles are completely coated. Carefully remove to another pan and refrigerate, uncovered for 30 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and keep chilled. In a blender, puree the strawberries and add a teaspoon of water if necessary to adjust consistency to a thick, but not pasty consistency. Adjust sweetness to taste with sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 3836,&quot;Spinach and Kale Salad 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 red bell pepper, diced 2 garlic cloves, diced 1 bunch of Kale, chopped 1 bunch of spinach, chopped Salt and freshly-ground black pepper to taste 4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Instructions: Heat the oil in a pan and cook red bell pepper, garlic, and kale about 5 minutes, covered.

Gradually add the butter chunks and pulse until the largest chunks are pea-size. Add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time and pulse just until the dough begins to clump together against the walls of the processor. Dump the dough out onto a work surface and press together to make a cohesive ball, kneading once or twice if it is falling apart. Divide the dough in half, wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 portion of the dough for 1 hour before using. (You&#39;ll be using only 1 portion of dough for the pie, so wrap the extra piece in a second layer of plastic wrap, put in a resealable plastic bag and freeze for another time.) On a well-floured surface with a well-floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a 9- to 10-inch round and transfer to an 8-inch pie plate. (If the rolling pin and work surface quickly become sticky, refrigerate the dough until firm, or, using a large spatula or bench scraper, transfer the dough to an 8-inch pie plate and press it into shape.) Crimp the edges and prick the bottom all over with a fork. Refrigerate the pie shell for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place a sheet of parchment paper or foil in the pie shell and fill with pie weights, raw rice or dried beans. Bake until the edges are lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Remove the weights and paper and bake until golden and cooked on the bottom and sides, about 15 minutes more. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. For the pumpkin pie filling: Combine the pumpkin, cream, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves and salt in a large bowl and whisk until thoroughly blended. Stir in the bourbon, vanilla and eggs. Whisk again until thoroughly blended. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the pie shell and smooth the top with an offset spatula. Bake until the center wobbles slightly when shaken, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool completely on a rack for about 2 hours. Serve with Cinnamon-Buttermilk Whipped Cream. Add the heavy cream and buttermilk to a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add the sugar and cinnamon while beating, then continue to beat until soft peaks form. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 3855,&quot;Grilled Vegetable Skewers with a Honey Soy Glaze 1/4 cup honey 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar<br> 40 pearl onions, peeled<br> 4 scallions, cut into thin rounds Zest and juice from 1 large lemon<br> Kosher salt<br> 3 large red bell peppers, seeded, quartered and cut into bite-size pieces (about 20 pieces per pepper)<br> 3 large zucchini, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 20 pieces per zucchini)<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Sesame seeds, for garnish<br> Instructions: Make the glaze: Cook the honey in a medium saute pan over medium heat until golden brown and bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, pearl onions, scallions and lemon zest and juice. Return the pan to the heat, add 1/4 cup water and a pinch of salt and cook until the onions are tender and the sauce is reduced, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the onions and let them cool. Keep the sauce warm. Skewer the vegetables: Start each skewer with a pearl onion followed by alternating 3 pieces pepper with 3 pieces zucchini and finishing with another pearl onion. Arrange the skewers in a single layer on a baking sheet. Cook the vegetables: Preheat the grill for cooking at medium-high heat. Brush the skewers with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place the skewers in a single layer on the hottest part of the grill.

Stir the chocolate and continue to microwave for 20 seconds at a time, stirring in between, until the chocolate is smooth and shiny. Add the remaining 1/4 of the chocolate and stir until smooth. The chocolate should register 87 to 89 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Secure the mold halves together with the bulldog clips. Place the tempered chocolate in a measuring cup and pour half of it into the mold. Swirl the chocolate around to make sure all areas are covered and no air bubbles are visible. Pour any excess chocolate back into the measuring cup. Place the mold in the refrigerator, right side up, standing on the bull dog clips as feet, and allow to harden for one minute. Repeat and process, and pour the rest of the tempered chocolate back in the mold and swirl it around to coat into an even layer, pouring any excess chocolate back into the measuring cup. Place the mold back in the refrigerator, right side up, until it hardens and looks opaque, about 10 minutes. (Do not leave the mold in the refrigerator longer than 10 minutes or the chocolate will crack.) Meanwhile, fill 3 acorn and/or leaf molds with the extra chocolate, smoothing the top with a palette knife. Refrigerate for about 10 minutes to harden. Unmold the cornucopia. Using the remaining chocolate (which by now will be thickened) \glue\ the acorn and/or leaf molds to the edge of the cornucopia and allow to set for a few minutes. Fill the cornucopia with truffles, chocolate dipped cashews or chocolate dipped fruits. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 3858,&quot;Seared Pork Tenderloin with Fry Pan Quick Fruit Chutney 1 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed, cut into 8 pieces, lightly pounded Coarse salt and cracked black pepper 1 small onion, thinly sliced 1/2 cup cider 1/2 cup cider vinegar 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper flakes 1 cinnamon stick 1/2 cup frozen cranberries 1/2 cup dried apricots 1/2 cup dried prunes 1 large apple, thinly sliced 2 cups chopped rainbow chard leaves and stems 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest Instructions: Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.

Beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Switch to low speed and gradually add in the flour. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl and beater to make sure it is well mixed. The dough will be sticky. Divide the dough into three portions, wrap each in plastic wrap and flatten to a disk. Refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight.<br> For the filling: Pulse the dates with the cinnamon, ginger and cloves in a food processor, adding a tablespoon of apple juice at a time. The filling needs to be spreadable but can have few chunks remaining. Mix in the walnuts.<br> To assemble the rugelach: Dust the work surface with the flour and roll each dough portion to a 10-inch circle. Lightly brush each circle with the melted butter, then evenly spread a thin layer of the filling. Using a pizza wheel, divide each circle into four quarters. Divide each quarter into three thin triangles, for a total of 12 wedges. Roll each triangle from the curved side to the point and place on a parchment-lined or nonstick baking sheet. Refrigerate the sheets for 30 minutes while preheating the oven to 350 degrees F. Note: The rugelach can be frozen on the trays and then stored in a zip-top bag in the freezer for baking fresh later.<br> Carefully brush each rugelach with the egg wash, trying to avoid drips.

Bring the water to a boil in a large pot over medium heat. Add salt until it tastes like mild seawater. How will you know? Take a little water with a spoon and taste it, then add the sugar. Prepare an ice bath by filling a bowl, large enough to hold the asparagus, with cold water. Add some ice cubes. Plunge the asparagus into the ice bath before cooking. This will help to bring any limp stalks back to life. Remove from the ice bath, plunge them into the boiling water and allow them to cook, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the water, transferring them immediately to the same ice bath. Allow them to sit in the ice bath for a few minutes, swirling them gently in the water to assure they are all cooling quickly in the cold water. The most important step for this dish? Drying the stalks once they are removed from the ice bath. Taking care that no water gets into the final salad is the best way to assure that the maximum flavor will be enjoyed! Transfer the asparagus to a large plate or platter lined with a kitchen towel and refrigerate. In a medium bowl, combine the lemon juice, white wine vinegar, honey and mustard. Stir to blend. Whisk in the olive oil in an even, steady stream. When all of the oil has been integrated, taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed. When ready to serve, remove the kitchen towel from the asparagus and simply toss the asparagus in the dressing to coat them completely. Arrange the stalks on plates and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 3877,&quot;Short Rib Chili 3 pounds meaty short ribs, with bone Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 2-ounce package dried New Mexico chiles (about 8), stemmed, seeded and cut or torn into pieces 2 large dried ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded and cut or torn into pieces 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 6 large cloves garlic, chopped 1 large red onion, chopped 1 tablespoon freshly ground cumin 1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano 1 cup beef broth (preferably organic) 2 tablespoons dark agave 1 teaspoon instant espresso coffee One 15- to 16-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained Adobo sauce, from can of chipotle chiles, optional Chopped green onions Creamy Corn Polenta, recipe follows Coarsely grated bittersweet chocolate, such as Lindt Garnishes, such as lime wedges, sour cream, chopped cooked bacon, chopped red and/or green jalapenos 2 1/2 cups low-salt chicken broth (preferably organic) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Kosher salt 1 cup polenta (Italian cornmeal) or regular cornmeal 1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.<br> Arrange the short ribs on a large sheet of foil.

Knead the mixture until it becomes a doughy consistency. If the mixture appears to be too moist, add a bit more flour, as needed. Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rest for half an hour. Grab a handful of dough at a time and roll it into 1-inch thick logs. Cut each log into 1-inch pieces. Roll each piece of dough against a cheese grater to create ridges. These ridges will help trap the sauce on each cooked dunderi. Dust a baking tray with flour and place the dunderi on top so they won&#39;t stick together. In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the dunderi for 5 minutes, or until they float to the top.

When the coals are all ignited and the temperature has lowered to medium (hold hand about 5-inches above grill grid, over the area where coals are deepest, for 4 to 5 seconds), the grill is ready to cook. Make spice rub: Combine the ingredients for the spice rub in a small bowl and mix well. Rub the pork chops generously on both sides with the mixture and set aside while making the sauce. Make the sauce: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot, but not smoking. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 11 to 13 minutes. Add the peaches, ginger, and tomatoes and cook, stirring frequently for 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, orange juice, sugar, allspice, and salt and pepper, to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture is reduced by about 1/2 and thickened slightly, about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust for the seasoning, then transfer the sauce to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth (be careful with hot liquids). Reserve 1/4 cup sauce for basting the chops, then pour the remaining sauce into a small serving bowl. Put the chops on the grill over the coals and cook, turning once, until desired doneness; 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium. During the last 30 seconds of cooking on each side, baste the chops generously with the sauce. Check for doneness. Serve the chops hot with extra barbecue sauce on the side. Cook&#39;s note: The spice rub and barbecue sauce contains sugar, which might burn while cooking on the grill. If the chops start to burn on the outside, move them to cooler part of the grill and cover with a metal pie pan or disposable foil to finish cooking. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 3887,&quot;Lomi Lomi Salmon 1 pound side of salmon, sliced 1-inch thick Hawaiian or kosher salt 5 tomatoes, chopped 1 Maui onion, chopped 1 bunch green onions, chopped 2 red Hawaiian chiles, chopped 1 pineapple 1 lime, juiced 2 tablespoons macadamia nut oil Fresh cracked black pepper, to taste 1 head butter lettuce, leaves separated Instructions: Cure the salmon in salt by putting a layer of Hawaiian salt in the bottom of a glass dish.

Add the golden raisins to a small bowl. Cover with 1/4 cup boiling water and allow to sit for 10 minutes to rehydrate and plump. Remove the raisins but reserve the liquid. Heat a small saucepan over low heat with the butter. Add the shallots and cook until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the pine nuts and reserved raisins and stir to combine. Cook for another 2 minutes, then add 2 tablespoons of the reserved raisin liquid. Continue to cook until most of the liquid has reduced, about 5 minutes. Add the olives and chopped lemon, toss in the chives and season with salt. If the mixture gets too thick, you can add a little more of the liquid from the golden raisins. The relish should be thick and homogenous, but not too thin or saucy. Preheat a grill pan over high heat. Drizzle the swordfish steaks on both sides with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the swordfish onto the grill and cook without moving the fish for 2 minutes. When the fish starts to pull away from the pan, you know it&#39;s ready to turn. Turn the fish 90 degrees to create a crosshatch. Grill for another 2 minutes. Flip the fish, then repeat on the other side. Remove the fish onto a sheet tray lined with a rack. Transfer into the oven and bake for 8 minutes. Drizzle the romaine lettuce with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the lettuce onto the grill, cut side down, and grill for 2 to 3 minutes.

Place asparagus in a large plastic bag. Drizzle half the olive oil over the asparagus, seal the bag and shake until asparagus is coated evenly with the olive oil. If necessary, add only enough of the remaining olive oil to coat the asparagus. Place the asparagus in a single layer on a cookie sheet, season with salt and pepper. Bake until tender or crunchy depending upon your preference, about 12 to 20 minutes. Tips: (Shortcut chef) Toss asparagus with oil, salt and pepper as directed below and store in refrigerator until you&#39;re ready to bake it off. Get into the habit of spending 5 to 15 minutes prepping tonight or tomorrow&#39;s dinner during the day and you will be eating in more than out. The weight will come off quicker with home cooked healthful meals and you know it. Tip: From mom&#39;s lips to your ears: You forgot to tell them to snap off the woody bottoms. Tell em to hold asparagus, one at a time, in their hands near the cut end and snap it like kindling. Mother Nature saw to it that the asparagus breaks in just the right spot, save the ends for stock. Morph: Serve one other simple veggie side and a piece of oven baked fish such as salmon and dinner is all done. Cook off extra asparagus and throw it into a frittata, polenta, or pasta later in the week. If the Queen&#39;s coming for dinner, toss cooked asparagus with fresh lemon, plate and garnish with thin curls of Parmesan. Tip: Asparagus starts losing its sweetness the minute it&#39;s cut, therefore, as always, look for the freshest stalks possible.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or baking mats. Cream the butter and sugar together in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until blended, for approximately 30 seconds. Sift the flour and cornstarch together in a bowl, and then add to the mixer and mix until the ingredients all come together. Finally, sprinkle over the black pepper and mix again. Tip the dough out onto a board and form it into 2 discs. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate 20 minutes. Place a piece of parchment paper on the counter, approximately 12-by-15-inch in size, and dust with flour. When the dough has rested, unwrap the first ball, put on top of the parchment paper, flour the surface of the dough and rolling pin and roll out to a 9-inch diameter circle, 1/16-inch thick. Trim the circle into an 8-by-8-inch square, discarding the scraps. Then cut down in 2-inch strips and across in 2-inch strips, making sixteen 2-by-2-inch squares. Using a small offset spatula, place the squares on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle a pinch of flaked sea salt over each cracker. Repeat the process with the second dough ball. Bake for 18 minutes. Do not allow the crackers to brown; check your oven sooner if it runs hot. Set aside to cool for 20 to 25 minutes before packaging up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 3905,&quot;Spanish Tortilla 1 cup pure olive oil 4 medium russet potatoes, peeled and sliced inch thick 1 large onion, thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 large eggs 1 cup fresh parsley 1/4 cup diced jarred piquillo or roasted red peppers Juice of 1/2 lemon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Place the whole eggs and yolks in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add 1/3 cup of the granulated sugar and the milk. Whip with an electric mixer on medium-high speed, until the mixture lightens in color and triples in volume, about 6 minutes. Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl, and whip at medium speed until foamy. Make French meringue by adding the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. When all the sugar has been added, increase mixer speed to medium-high and whip to stiff but not dry peaks, about 5 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to fold the egg mixture in batches into the meringue, incorporating it gradually so as not to deflate the meringue. When all the yolk mixture has been incorporated, place the flour in a fine-mesh sieve and sift over the mixture. Gently fold this in with the rubber spatula. Spread the batter evenly on a parchment-covered baking sheet, liberally dust the top of the biscuit with powdered sugar and place in the oven. Bake just until biscuit begins to brown on top, about 5 minutes. This will lock in the moisture, allowing you to roll the cake later without cracking it. Immediately after removing from the oven, run a knife around the inside of the baking sheet to loosen the cake from the sides. Remove cake from baking sheet and allow it to cool. PREPARE CHOCOLATE PASTRY CREAM: Make pastry cream as directed and let cool. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or a mixing bowl placed over a bowl of simmering water, stirring it occasionally as it melts. When all of the chocolate is melted and smooth, remove it from heat, and add the cold pastry cream to the warm chocolate. Mix them together with a rubber spatula. PREPARE THE ROULADE: Place the biscuit on your work surface and soak with the flavored syrup. Spread the chocolate pastry cream evenly over the cake, spreading it all the way to the edges. Start at one long end and, rolling toward you, roll it into a tight cylinder. Place the roulade on a parchment covered baking sheet and place in the refrigerator for a few hours to set. PREPARE THE MUSHROOMS: Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Whip the egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Add the granulated sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, until you have volume, then add the rest of the sugar. Increase mixer speed to medium-high and whip until you have stiff but not dry peaks. Gently fold in the powdered sugar. Place the meringue in a large pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain tip. Pipe the mushroom pieces onto a parchment covered baking sheet. Make the stems by squeezing out a dime-sized mound of meringue, then pull the pastry bag straight up, leaving a small tail. Make the caps by piping 1/2-inch mounds onto the sheet. Sprinkle the caps with a little cocoa powder and place in the oven. Bake until firm and dry, about 1 hour, leaving the oven door cracked so moisture can escape. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. PREPARE CHOCOLATE TREES: Make a cornet from parchment paper and fill half full with tempered chocolate. Pipe a long thick chocolate raindrop on a sheet of parchment paper. Draw a cake comb through the chocolate, starting at the center of the raindrop and moving from left to right. Repeat, starting at the center and moving from right to left. You should have a chocolate pine tree. Repeat for as many trees as you want. Allow the chocolate to set before peeling the parchment paper from it. PREPARE THE CHOCOLATE FENCE: Fill a cornet half full with the tempered chocolate, and pipe a 3 to 4-inch long railroad track, with the outside rails spaced about 2 inches apart and the inside rails spaced about 1/2-inch apart onto a sheet of parchment paper. Allow the chocolate to set before peeling the parchment paper from it. PREPARE THE COFFEE BUTTERCREAM: Place the egg yolks and whole egg in a large mixing bowl, and whip until thick, light, and tripled in volume, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the water and granulated sugar into a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium heat. Insert a candy thermometer into the mixture. The sugar is ready when it reaches 250 degrees, or the soft ball stage. Pour the cooked sugar down the side of the bowl into the whipping eggs. Continue whipping the mixture until the outside of the bowl is warm but not hot, about 2 or 3 minutes. Add the butter all at once, and beat on medium speed until incorporated. Now whip on medium-high speed until thick, smooth and shiny, about 10 minutes. Remove about 1/3 cup and set aside. Add the coffee extract to the remaining buttercream and whip until well combined. ASSEMBLE THE BUCHE: Place the rolled cake on the platter you will use to serve it. Use a sharp knife to slice a 11/2-inch-thick slice from each end of the roll. These will become gnarls on the log. Spread a thick layer of buttercream over the buche. Place the ends or gnarls on top of the log, 1 at each end and cover with buttercream. Run a cake comb through the buttercream along the length of the buche, to make it look like bark. Place the buche in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to let the buttercream set. MAKE THE IVY AND FLOWERS: Divide the unflavored buttercream evenly among 3 bowls and color each with 1 of the food colorings. Make 3 cornets from triangles of parchment paper, and fill one with pink buttercream, one with green, and one with yellow. Remove the buche from the refrigerator. Use the green icing cornet to make the ivy, by piping long curved lines along the length of the buche. Place small yellow dots along this stem, for the flower centers. Surround these with pink dots for the flower petals. Cut the tip of the cornet diagonally to make a point and fill it with green icing. Squeeze a dab of green buttercream out of the corner of each leaf. FINISHING THE BUCHE: Stick together the caps and ends of the mushrooms, using a dab of buttercream. Place the mushrooms, chocolate trees and chocolate fence on the buche. Dust the buche with powdered sugar and sprinkle with chocolate shavings. Refrigerate for 1 hour,then serve and enjoy! Sift together the cornstarch and half the sugar in a medium bowl, add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and remaining sugar into a 2-quart nonreactive heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. While milk is heating, slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds, and add both seeds and skin to the milk. Bring it to a boil. Carefully pour about half of the milk into the egg mixture, whisking so eggs don&#39;t scramble. Pour this mixture back into the saucepan and continue to whisk, as pastry cream thickens. Bring to a boil and continue to whisk and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat, strain through a fine-mesh sieve, and add butter in small chunks if desired. Stir butter into cream until well incorporated. Pour pastry cream into an airtight container and put plastic wrap on top to prevent a skin from forming. Store in refrigerator for up to 3 days, until ready to use. SIMPLE SYRUP: Water, scant 1 1/4 cups Granulated sugar, 2/3 cup Liqueur, 2 1/2 tablespoons Place the water and sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. The sugar should completely dissolve. Remove from heat and pour into a mixing bowl. Cool before adding the liqueur. TEMPERED CHOCOLATE: When you melt chocolate, the molecules of fat separate. To put them back together, you temper it. One way to temper is to place the chocolate in the microwave, and microwave it on high power for 30 seconds at a time until the chocolate is melted. As it recrystallizes, it becomes tempered. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]&quot; 3914,&quot;Ultimate Mashed Potatoes 3 1/2 cup Swanson?

Avoid stirring the mixture to prevent it from crystallizing. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately whisk in the cream, milk and salt. The mixture will bubble up violently. Once it has settled, add the peanut butter and whisk to combine. Pour the caramel into a glass jar and allow it to cool for at least 1 hour, by which point it should be thick and cool to the touch. The caramel can also be made the day before. For the chocolate coating: In a double boiler over medium heat, melt the chocolate and butter together. Place 10 mini cupcake liners into a mini cupcake tin. Pour roughly 3/4 teaspoon of the melted chocolate into the bottom of each cupcake liner and spread it along the sides with a teaspoon so that it coats the entire liner. Place them in the fridge for 5 minutes. Place 1/2 teaspoon of the cooled caramel into each chocolate liner. Use your finger to slightly flatten the caramel, then pour the melted chocolate over the top, filling the liners to the top. Decorate the tops with crushed peanuts or sea salt flakes if you wish!

Add the onion, curry powder, and ginger; cook and stir for a few minutes to soften the onion. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, until the tomatoes break down and soften, about 6 minutes. Mix in the cauliflower, chickpeas, tomato paste, and 1 cup of water; stir everything together. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the cauliflower is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Uncover, and continue cooking until the excess moisture has evaporated and the cauliflower and chickpeas are coated with a thick gravy. Season with salt, to taste, and garnish with cilantro before serving. Put the butter in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat, swirl the pot around to ensure that it melts slowly and does not sizzle or brown. Increase the heat and bring the butter to a boil. When the surface is covered with foam, stir gently and reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting. Gently simmer, uncovered, and undisturbed for 45 minutes, until the milk solids in the bottom of the pan have turned golden brown and the butter on top is transparent. Strain the ghee through a sieve lined with several layers of cheesecloth. The ghee should be perfectly clear and smell nutty; pour into a glass jar and seal tightly. Toast the whole spices (coriander, cumin, fennel, cloves, mustard, cardamom and peppercorns) and the chiles in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat, shaking the pan often to prevent them from burning. Toast for a couple of minutes until the spices smell fragrant. In a clean coffee grinder, grind the toasted spices together to a fine powder. Add the turmeric and give it another quick buzz to combine. Use the spice blend immediately, or store in a sealed jar for as long as 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 3917,&quot;Ice Cream Cone Favors 1 bag white chocolate morsels Ice cream cones (flat bottomed) Small chocolate candy toppings, nonpareils and sprinkles Lollipops, sugar sticks and other small packaged candies 4 by 9-inch cellophane bags 5/8-inch sheer ribbon Instructions: Melt white chocolate chips in a small double-boiler and transfer to small bowl.

Put the parsley, garlic, bay leaves, wine, and 1 of the halved lemons in a wide pot. Add 2 quarts of water and bring to a simmer. Season the broth with salt and pepper. While that&#39;s coming to a simmer, wash the artichokes under cold water. Then, using a paring knife, trim the bottom end of each stem and shave the stem down to expose the tender, light green flesh underneath. Snap or cut off the outer petals until you reach the soft, pale green leaves in the center. Slice off about 1 inch from the top of the artichoke with a large knife. Do the same to prepare the rest of the artichokes. Slide the artichokes into the simmering broth. Then cover the pan and simmer over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, until there is no resistance when a knife is inserted into the base of each artichoke. Remove the artichokes from the poaching liquid with tongs. Using a spoon, carefully scoop out the hairy choke from the center of each and discard. Try and keep the artichoke halves intact as best you can; it looks great for presentation. Put a large, deep skillet over medium heat and cover the bottom with a 2-count of oil. When the oil is smoking hot, add the sausage and cook for 7 to 10 minutes until cooked through. Take them out of the pan and set them aside. Add a drizzle of oil to the pan. Add the sage leaves and cook 2 to 3 minutes to infuse the oil with their flavor. Add the shallots, garlic, and lemon slices and cook 2 minutes. Then add the stock to the pan, bring to a simmer and simmer until reduced and thickened. Swirl in the butter to emulsify, and a drizzle of olive oil. Return the artichokes to the pan and cook over low heat for a few minutes to warm up them up.

Add the butter and pulse about 10 times until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal with a few bean-size bits of butter in it. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times more; don&#39;t let the dough form a mass around the blade. If the dough seems very dry, add up to 1 tablespoon of cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time, pulsing briefly. Remove the blade and bring the dough together by hand. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour. For the filling: Halve and core the apple. Cut each half into 8 wedges and put them in a large bowl. Slice the squash and cut the onion into wedges so that both are as thick as the apple wedges and add them to the apples. Add the butter, rosemary, and thyme and toss gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper and toss again. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch disk. Transfer the dough to a baking sheet and brush with mustard. Starting 2 inches from the edge, casually alternate pieces of apple, squash, and onion in overlapping circles--if you have extra pieces of one or another, tuck them in where you can or double them up to use all the filling. Fold and pleat the dough over the edge of the filling. Bake until the crust is brown and the apple, squash, and onions are tender and caramelized, about 55 minutes. Scatter the cheese over the filling and bake until melted, about 5 minutes more. Cool the galette briefly on a wire rack. Cut into wedges and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 3969,&quot;Beggars Purses Filled with Shrimp and Scented with Lemon and Thyme 1 1/2 cups cooked shrimp, finely diced (about 12 medium shrimp) 1 lemon, zested 1/4 lemon, juiced 1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper 20 blades fresh chives<br> Crepes, recipe follows 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup milk 1/4 cup water 2 eggs 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Pinch salt Instructions: Start by making the aromatic shrimp filling: Combine the first 5 ingredients in a small bowl and stir to combine. Season the mix with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside. In a small saucepan, bring 1-inch of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Place the chives in the water and blanch for 1 minute. Remove the chives and squeeze them dry in a paper towel. The chives will be all bunched up in a ball at this point, so carefully separate them and set them aside. To assemble your purses: take a crepe and cut it in half. Place a heaping tablespoon of the shrimp filling in the middle of each half of crepe and draw up the sides of the crepe as to make a pouch of filling resembling a purse. Carefully twist the crepe around at the top and lay it on its side, holding the crepe closed at the top. Slip a chive under the crepe and tie it around the twisted top in a knot to secure the purse. Trim away any extra crepe and length of chive. After practicing this technique a few times you will get the hang of it and they will come together nicely. These may be made ahead of time and frozen for up to 1 month. To make the crepe batter, combine the flour, milk, water, eggs, 2 tablespoons of butter, and salt in a blender. Blend on high until the batter is smooth. Cover and let the batter sit for 30 minutes. This is essential in creating strong crepes which will hold up to the stress of tying them into your beggars purses. Place a 7 1/2-inch nonstick crepe pan over medium heat. Brush a little of the remaining melted butter into the pan with a pastry brush. Ladle 2 tablespoons of crepe batter into the pan and swirl to coat the entire pan evenly. Cook the crepe until it is set and the bottom is golden brown. Using a heat-proof rubber spatula, flip the crepe over and cook on the second side until it is lightly browned as well. Continue making crepes with remaining batter. Set aside covered with a dish towel until you are ready to assemble your beggars purses.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 3970,&quot;The Big Egg Monte Cristo 5 eggs 2 tablespoons sugar Zest of 1/2 a lemon 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom Pinch salt 1/4 cup cream 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 4 pieces thick-cut brioche bread Panko (Japanese) breadcrumbs Butter, for frying 4 ounces Black Forest ham, thinly sliced 3 ounces Gorgonzola, crumbled 2 eggs Pure maple syrup Powdered sugar Instructions: For the French toast batter: Whisk the eggs, sugar, lemon zest, cardamom, salt, cream and vanilla in a bowl until blended.

Salt the eggplant and drain in colander, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a little extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add the onions, garlic, cl pepper, if using, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Cover the pan with a lid and sweat the onions 10 to 15 minutes, until very soft and sweet. Add the roasted tomatoes and stir, then let the sauce thicken 15 minutes, uncovered over medium heat. Cook&#39;s Note: The mixture should be very thick. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. While the sauce cooks make a breading station (3 sections) for the eggplant: flour, beaten egg, and panko bread crumbs mixed with cheese, corn meal, and fennel. Coat the eggplant slices in order and arrange on a plate. Heat a thin layer of frying oil in a large heavy-bottom skillet over medium to medium-high heat and cook the eggplant 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Drain the eggplant on a cooling rack, wipe out the skillet and repeat. Sprinkle the hot eggplant with a little salt. When all of eggplant has been cooked, wipe the pan clean again and heat 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil in the skillet over medium heat, add the garlic and stir 1 minute. Add the greens and wilt them, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Turn off the heat. Build stacks on cooling rack placed over baking sheet: eggplant, chard, tomato-onions, basil leaves, mozzarella, and eggplant. Place in oven 5 minutes to melt the mozzarella. Serve immediately. For the tomatoes: Heat the oven to 500 degrees F. Arrange the tomatoes on a baking sheet or baking sheets in a single layer. Scatter the garlic among the tomatoes, dress with extra-virgin olive oil to coat and season with salt and pepper.

Let cool for 10 minutes. While the cake is still in the pan, trim off the top, using the edge of the pan as a guide. This will give you a flat top. Invert the cake onto a cooling rack and let cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, transfer the frosting to a large bowl and mix with an electric mixer on medium speed, adding a couple of drops of food coloring at a time to achieve the desired shade of blue.<br> Cut the cake horizontally into 4 layers using a long serrated knife. Use a 4-inch round cutter to cut a hole in the center of the 2 largest layers on the bottom. Reserve the cutouts.<br> Place the bottom layer on a cake board or cake plate and frost the top with the frosting. Place the second cake layer on top, so that the sides and center holes line up. Fill the well in the cake with the candy-coated chocolates. Frost the top of the second layer, and place the third layer on top. Repeat with the frosting and top cake layer. Using a limited amount of frosting, frost a thin crumb coat over the cake. Refrigerate to firm up, about 30 minutes. Frost the cake with more frosting.<br> Fit a pastry bag with a coupler (or you can use multiple piping bags). Fit the bag with a large star tip and fill the bag with frosting. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Use a butter knife to lightly score 5 evenly-spaced vertical lines down the side of the cake. Using the pastry bag with the large star tip and following one of the scored lines from top to bottom, pipe overlapping diagonal 2-inch mounds of frosting, lifting and pulling down in alternating directions to make a braid. Repeat the pattern down the remaining scored lines. Switch to a smaller star tip on the pastry bag. Working from the top of the cake down, pipe overlapping semi-circles between each of the braided lines. Repeat around the rest of the cake. Switch to a small plain round tip on the pastry bag. Pipe straight lines down both sides of each semi-circle line. Next to these, pipe lines of dots, starting from the top to the bottom. Next to these, pipe straight lines. Repeat around the cake. To make the pom-pom on top of the cake, mix the reserved cake cutouts with 1/4 cup frosting in a medium bowl until mostly smooth. Form a cake ball the size of a baseball and refrigerate it on a plate until firm, about 10 minutes. Place the coconut in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag and add 2 drops of blue food coloring. Shake the bag to color the coconut. Remove half the coconut to a shallow bowl. Add 6 more drops of the food coloring to the remaining coconut in the bag. Shake the bag to color the coconut and transfer it to a second shallow bowl. Roll the cake ball in the dark blue coconut followed by the light blue coconut until fully coated. Place the cake ball on top of the cake. Press the remaining coconut around the bottom of the cake to form the trim.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3977,&quot;Taffy 1 1/4 cups corn syrup 1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon water 1 teaspoon butter 1 tablespoon white vinegar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and/or mint extract Instructions: In a large saucepan, place all the ingredients except extracts, and gently stir them to combine. Place a candy thermometer on the side of the pan and bring to a boil, stirring only to prevent burning. Cook to hardball stage (265 to 270 degrees), remove from the heat, stir in the extracts, and pour onto a silpat-lined sheet pan or buttered sheet pan. Let it cool enough to handle then start rolling it into a log and stretching or pulling the taffy to work air in and make it white and opaque. Keep pulling and twisting until it hardens. Form long ropes of taffy, then cut them into pieces. Some tips when making taffy: Oil the top 1-inch of the saucepan&#39;s wall to keep the sugar from boiling over. Always use a pan bigger than you think you need to prevent boiling over. Always use a burner as big or bigger than your pan&#39;s bottom. Never scrape the bottom of the pan at the end, just pour out the syrup. Wash down the sides of the pan with a clean wet pastry brush to avoid crystallization. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 3978,&quot;Cajun Catfish Cakes with Remoulade 4 catfish fillets, about 6 ounces each 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup canola oil 1 cup crackers, crushed 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon spicy brown mustard 1 large egg, beaten 2 teaspoons hot sauce 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon chopped garlic Instructions: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat.

Set aside. Prepare an ice-water bath in a large bowl and bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the asparagus until tender, 6 minutes. Drain and refresh them in the ice water to preserve their color. Drain again and set aside. Heat the lentils over a low flame and keep warm. Spray a grill or grill pan with nonstick spray and preheat until it&#39;s very hot (if using a grill pan, heat for at least 4 minutes). Dry the fillets and season the flesh sides with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper, then brush both sides with the olive oil. Place the fish, skin side down, on the grill and cook for 4 minutes. Flip the fish and brush the skin side with the reserved honey-mustard glaze. Continue to cook for 2 minutes. Hold the cooked trout aside. Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the walnuts and toast for about 3 minutes, shaking the pan often to prevent burning. Season the nuts with 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper, and 3 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the vinegar has reduced to a thick syrup that coats the nuts. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and stir for an additional minute. Turn the flame down to low and add the asparagus. In a small saucepan, bring the remaining 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar to a boil. Cook for about 3 minutes, until it has reduced down to 2 tablespoons. Turn the flame off under the asparagus-walnut mixture and add the baby spinach along with a drizzle of the balsamic glaze. Gently toss to combine, and allow the heat of the pan to wilt the spinach. Plate the salad by creating a small bed of the spinach-asparagus mixture in the center of the plate, surrounded by 3 dollops of warm lentils. Place 2 trout fillets, skin side up, on top of the spinach mixture.

Add the tomatoes and pine nuts. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the sauce is thick, at least 20 minutes. Remove the eggplant from the oven and use a fork to scoop out the cooked insides, leaving the skins intact. Stir the scooped eggplant flesh into the tomato mixture, then fill the eggplant boats with the mixture. Return the boats to the oven and cook until the sauce is bubbling, another 10 minutes. Mix the yogurt, dill, lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of water and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl, using a little more water to loosen the sauce if desired. Remove the eggplant boats from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.

In a saucepan over low heat, add the cream, the scraped vanilla bean and the seeds (or extract) and 1/2 cup of sugar. Whisk to combine. Bring the cream to a boil. While the cream is coming to a boil, whisk the yolks and 1/2 cup sugar together until they are a homogeneous mixture. When the cream comes to a boil, remove it from the heat and whisk in 1/3 of the egg yolk mixture, then immediately whisk in the remaining egg mixture. This is called tempering, it allows you to combine hot cream and eggs without making scrambled eggs. It&#39;s kinda fun! Reserve this mixture until you are ready to assemble the pudding. To assemble the pudding: Butter 1 side of the slices of bread and cut them into triangles. Butter an 8 by 8-inch square baking dish and put a layer of bread points, overlapping, in the bottom of the dish. Strain the raisins reserving the whiskey. Sprinkle half of the whiskey soaked raisins on top of the bread layer. Pour half of the cream/egg mixture over the bread and raisins. Repeat this process with the bread and raisins and finally finish with bread. Pour the remaining cream/egg mixture into the dish. Press down gently on the whole thing to compress and really compact the pudding. If all of the cream mixture doesn&#39;t fit into the pan, wait 10 to 15 minutes and then try again. The bread may need a little while to absorb all the cream. MMMMM&amp; don&#39;t skimp on this step. Set the bread pudding dish inside a 9 by 13-inch baking dish or roasting pan and add hot water until it reaches 1/2 to 2/3 of the way up the sides of the pudding dish. Cover the whole thing with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven until the custard has set, about 1 hour. Remove the pudding from the water bath and let it cool for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the top of the custard with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a thin even layer. Put the pudding under the broiler or use a blow torch (This is REALLY fun!) to crystallize the sugar on the top of the pudding. A little bit crusty and burnt and sweeeeeeet! YuuuuuummmY! Serve with the whiskey tea sauce. To make the sauce: While the pudding is baking, combine all the ingredients and the reserved Irish whiskey in a small saucepan and let steep for 15 minutes. Discard the tea bags and the lemon half. Bring the sauce to a boil and then lower the heat and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Taste, the sauce should be very pungent, sweet and spicy (cinnamon and clove--not spicy hot) and a perfect accompaniment to the creamy sweet pudding.

Garnish with the chives and serve with the toasted cubed bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 4033,&quot;Chicharron Pupusa 1 pound pork fat, cut into 2-inch cubes 1 pound pork butt, cut into 2-inch cubes<br> 1 large onion, quartered<br> 4 ounces garlic cloves 3 tablespoons salt<br> 2 tablespoons ground cumin<br> 16 ounces Masa, recipe follows 6 ounces Curtido, recipe follows 3 ounces Pupusa Sauce, recipe follows 1 quart masa 2 tablespoons salt<br> 6 tablespoons salt 1 large cabbage, fine julienne<br> 1 quart grated carrots 1 quart apple cider vinegar<br> 2 large onions, pureed<br> 4 ounces sugar<br> 3 tablespoons oregano<br> 3 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes 5 bay leaves<br> 4 ounces garlic cloves 1 large onion, quartered<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> 2 quarts canned tomatoes<br> 4 ounces sugar<br> 2 tablespoons oregano<br> 3 bay leaves<br> Instructions: Render pork fat in a saucepan on low heat until golden brown, about 20 minutes, then remove the crispy chicharron from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to air dry for 24 hours. Cook pork butt in the same saucepan on medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 20 minutes. (Note: Do not drain the fat from the saucepan since it will be a great flavor enhancer.) Add onions and scrape the pan very well with a wooden spoon to get most of the drippings. Grind chicharron, pork butt, onions and garlic together in a meat grinder. Adjust seasoning to taste with salt and cumin, then refrigerate for 6 hours. Using your hands, grab 3 ounces of Masa and mound it on one hand, making a well. Grab 3 ounces chicharron mixture and cover the well, simultaneously surrounding the chicharron mixture with the Masa until everything is covered. Use both of your palms and press gently until you achieve a uniform 1/4-inch-thick disc. Use small amounts of water as needed to assist in releasing the Masa from your hands. Once the discs are made cook them on a hot griddle, 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Top with Curtido and Pupusa Sauce. Combine masa, salt and enough water to incorporate the masa (up to 1 quart) in a large mixing bowl. Knead together until masa does not stick to your hands. Boil 3 quarts water in a large saucepan and add 3 tablespoons salt. Add cabbage and let cook 30 seconds, then immediately pull it out and set aside. Reserve 1 quart cooking water. Add cabbage to a large mixing bowl, then add carrots, vinegar, onions, sugar, oregano, pepper flakes, bay leaves, remaining 3 tablespoons salt and reserved cooking water and mix together. Transfer to a 6-quart container and let sit in a dry and cool place for 5 days. Note: Curtido needs to be submerged in liquid, so place a plate over the top if necessary. Saute garlic and onions in oil in a saucepan, then immediately add tomatoes, sugar, oregano, bay leaves and 1 quart water. Cook at low heat for 45 minutes, then let cool down. Remove bay leaves and blend. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 4034,&quot;Chocolate Dessert Lasagna 1 (8-ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles 2 pounds ricotta cheese 1 cup powdered sugar 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa 2 large eggs 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips 1 orange, zested 1/2 cup roasted pistachios 4 ounces white chocolate, coarsely grated Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to the boil and cook the noodles for 1 minute. Drain them and put them into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain again and lay on paper towels to dry. Whisk together the ricotta, sugar, cocoa powder, and eggs on medium speed with a hand or stand mixer, scraping down the sides of the bowl, until it is well blended. Stir in the chocolate chips and orange zest. Spread 1/4 of the cheese mixture into the bottom of an 8 by 8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle some of the pistachios over the top and press on a layer of noodles. Repeat, ending with the ricotta mixture and pistachios. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the lasagna has risen. Remove the pan from the oven and evenly sprinkle the white chocolate over it. Let cool, cut, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Malbec]&quot; 4035,&quot;Ranch Chicken Taquitos 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs<br> 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 small onion, sliced<br> 2 tablespoons ancho cl powder<br> 1 tablespoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> One 8-ounce can tomato sauce<br> Juice of 1 lime<br> 1 cup sour cream 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 3 tablespoons milk<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill 1/2 teaspoon ancho cl powder<br> 1 clove garlic, grated<br> Dash of hot sauce<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> Vegetable oil, for frying 1 1/2 cups grated Colby jack cheese<br> 18 small corn tortillas<br> Instructions: For the chicken: Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken until browned well, 1 to 2 minutes per side; set aside. Add the garlic and onions to the skillet and cook briefly. Add the cl powder, cumin, salt, tomato sauce, 2/3 cup water and the seared chicken back to the skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the sauce has reduced by about half, 12 to 15 minutes. For the sour cream ranch dip: Meanwhile, whisk together the sour cream, mayonnaise, milk, cilantro, dill, cl powder, garlic, hot sauce and salt in a mixing bowl until smooth. Cover and place in the refrigerator to chill until ready to serve. Once the sauce for the chicken is reduced, remove the chicken to a cutting board with a slotted spoon. Using 2 forks, shred the chicken, then return it to the skillet and toss to coat thoroughly. Stir in the lime juice and adjust the seasoning as needed. Set aside and allow to cool slightly, 10 to 12 minutes. For the taquitos: Fill a large Dutch oven halfway with vegetable oil and heat to 375 degrees F. Mix the cooled chicken with the Colby jack cheese. Divide the mixture among the tortillas, then roll the tortillas tightly, securing them with a toothpick. Add the taquitos to the hot oil in batches of 8 to 10 and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Remove the taquitos to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with the remaining taquitos. Remove the toothpicks and serve alongside the sour cream ranch dip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 4036,&quot;Pumpkin Lasagna Rolls Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 lasagna noodles 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small yellow onion, chopped 3 cloves garlic, sliced 10 whole sage leaves and 2 tablespoons chopped sage, plus more leaves torn for serving (optional) 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 1/2 cups whole milk 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 1 (15-ounce) can pure pumpkin 1 cup grated Parmesan 1 large egg 2 cups whole-milk ricotta 3 cups shredded mozzarella Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles 1 minute longer than the package directions for al dente. The pasta should be tender enough to roll without cracking. Rinse with cold water and drain well. Lay in a single layer on a baking sheet. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and whole sage leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, 6 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and cook, stirring, until sandy in consistency and lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the milk, pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 cup of the pumpkin, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce is smooth and thickens to the consistency of gravy, 6 to 8 minutes. Add 2/3 cup of the Parmesan and cook, stirring, until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the sage leaves and discard; allow the sauce to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Beat the egg in a large bowl then stir in the ricotta, 2 cups of the mozzarella, the remaining pumpkin, chopped sage, crushed red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Brush a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with the olive oil. Spread 1 cup of the sauce onto the bottom of the dish. Lay half of the cooked lasagna noodles on a clean work surface and spread 2 heaping tablespoons of the ricotta mixture evenly over each. Starting with a short end, roll each noodle up and transfer to the prepared baking dish seam-side down. Repeat with the remaining noodles and ricotta mixture. Spoon the remaining sauce over the lasagna rolls and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella and 1/3 cup Parmesan. Cover with foil and bake until the rolls are heated through and the sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the cheese is browned on top, 18 to 20 minutes. Garnish with the torn sage leaves, if using, and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Gavi]&quot; 4037,&quot;Butternut Squash Noodles with Prosciutto and Sage 1 large butternut squash (about 3 pounds) 2 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes 2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto (about 4 slices) 5 fresh sage leaves 1/2 cup shaved Parmesan (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut the bulbous end off the squash and reserve for another use. Remove the stem, then peel the remaining squash and cut in half crosswise. Using a spiralizer, shave the squash into ribbons. Put the squash on a baking sheet and toss with the oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and roast until tender but still firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat until melted. Add the prosciutto in a single layer and cook until golden and curled around the edges, flipping with tongs halfway through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool, then coarsely crumble. Add the remaining 5 tablespoons butter to the drippings in the skillet along with the sage leaves and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring often, until the butter is a dark brown color, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. Put the squash on a serving platter and drizzle with the butter and sage leaves. Top with the Parmesan and coarsely crumbled prosciutto. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 4038,&quot;Quick Avocado-Sprout-Vinaigrette Salad 1/2 cup watercress leaves 1/2 cup arugula leaves 2 ripe avocados, halved, pitted and peeled Assorted sprouts: clover, alfalfa, radish, etc. 1/4 cup minced onion 1/2 cup tomatoes, seeded and diced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil Juice of 1/2 lemon 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar 1/3 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste Instructions: Cover a platter with watercress and arugula.

(It\u2019s important not to use your hands to make the dough because the natural heat of your hands will make the dough release oil, resulting in dry dough.) Mix in the ghee. The mixture will feel and look like crumbs. Add the milk slowly (2 tablespoons at a time) and mix to combine until you have a soft dough that you can make into small balls. It\u2019s best to add the milk slowly so the dough doesn&#39;t come together before all the milk is added. For the date filling: Put the baking dates, ghee, cinnamon and cardamom in a medium bowl and mix with a spoon until the ghee and spices are combined well with the dates. Rub some ghee or vegetable oil on your palms to avoid sticking and shape the date filling into 40 to 45 small balls for a small ma&#39;amoul mold. If using a larger mold, shape the balls accordingly. Preheat the oven 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the semolina dough into 40 to 45 balls as well. Flatten a semolina dough ball and place a date ball in the middle of it. Bring the dough together to cover the date ball and roll in your hands to smooth the cracks. Place the ball in the ma&#39;amoul mold and gently press it so the pattern prints on it. Bang the mold against a cutting board to release the cookie and place it smooth-side down on the prepared baking sheet. If you don\u2019t own a mold, simply flatten the stuffed dough ball into a 1/2-inch-thick disk and make a simple pattern by pressing a fork gently on the dough to make a crisscross. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. You can place the cookies quite close to each other since they won\u2019t spread. Bake until the cookies are slightly golden brown around the edges, 18 to 20 minutes.

Keep warm while you prepare the caramel. Combine the sugar and water in a medium saucepan over high heat and cook (do not stir) until it becomes a deep amber brown color. Slowly whisk in the warm milk mixture and continue whisking until smooth; add the vanilla seeds and corn syrup. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the sauce is reduced by half and is the consistency of a caramel sauce, about 55 minutes. Once the sauce is reduced, remove from the heat and whisk in the cold butter, vanilla extract, salt and rum and whisk until combined. Transfer the sauce to a medium bowl and stir in the pecans and coconut. Let the frosting cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally before frosting the cake. For the ganache: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat. Put the chocolate into a medium bowl, add the hot cream and the corn syrup and let sit for 30 seconds. Gently whisk until smooth. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before pouring over the cake. For the chocolate cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter 2 (9-inch) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Melt the 12 tablespoons of butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the cocoa powder and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the sugars and whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Add the coffee, buttermilk, eggs and vanilla extract and continue whisking until smooth and just combined. Slowly add the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture until combined. Divide the batter evenly between the 2 pans and bake on the middle rack until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 42 minutes. Let cool in the pans on a baking rack for 20 minutes. Then invert the cakes onto the baking rack and let cool for at least 1 hour before frosting. Slice each cake in half horizontally. Put 1 cake layer on a cake round or platter and spread 1/3 of the frosting evenly over the top, repeat to make 3 layers and top with the remaining cake layer, top side up. Pour the chocolate ganache over the cake and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before slicing.

Allow to stand for about 3 minutes. Add the honey, pumpkin puree, milk, egg yolks, cornmeal, and 1 2/3 cups (8 ounces) of the high-gluten flour to the yeast mixture. Stir briskly with a whisk until the ingredients are well combined. Let this sponge stand for at least 15 minutes but not longer than 30 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk the remaining 2 1/3 cups (11 3/4 ounces) high-gluten flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt together to mix well. Add to the sponge and stir with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Knead the dough in the bowl until it becomes smooth and somewhat elastic, about 5 minutes. Gradually add the melted butter, kneading it in gently until well incorporated. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until it is very smooth, silky, and elastic, about 5 minutes. The dough will be sticky, so keep the work surface and your hands lightly floured, but don&#39;t overdo it. The dough should be soft, supple, and springy. Shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Flatten the dough and stretch it gently with your fingers to form a rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the toasted pecans evenly over the rectangle. Fold the whole mass into an envelope and knead it gently until the nuts are well distributed, about 2 to 3 minutes. If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading it. Some of the pecans may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise, when the dough has softened. Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, along with any loose pecans. Turn to coat the dough with oil, then cover the bowl tightly with oiled plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature (75 degrees to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 2 hours. While the bread is rising, make a cornstarch wash: Put the cold water in a small saucepan and whisk in the cornstarch. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently until it thickens. Remove from the heat and cover to keep a skin from forming. Set aside to cool. When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the floured work surface, pressing in any loose nuts. Flour your hands lightly and gently divide the dough into 2 equal pieces (each weighing about 24 ounces). Shape each piece into a knot. Generously dust a peel or the bottom of a baking sheet with flour or coarse cornmeal. Carefully place the shaped loaves on the peel or sheet, leaving several inches between them so they won&#39;t grow into each other as they rise. Cover the dough with oiled plastic wrap and allow it to rise at room temperature until it has just doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan directly below the stone. When the loaves have doubled, use a pastry brush to paint each loaf with the cornstarch wash. Brush gently so you won&#39;t deflate the loaves. (Reserve the remaining cornstarch wash.) Shake the peel or pan gently to be sure the loaves aren&#39;t sticking and slide the dough onto the baking stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately shut the door. After 1 minute, using a plant sprayer, mist the top and sides of the oven 6 to 8 times, then immediately shut the oven door. Repeat the misting procedure 1 minute later. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature 350 degrees F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the loaves are golden brown and the surface feels firm but not hard when you press it lightly. These should have a thin soft crust, not a hard crunchy one. Transfer the loaves to a rack and paint them again with the cornstarch wash. Allow to cool completely before serving. This bread is best eaten the day it is baked, but it also freezes exceptionally well if you wrap it in aluminum foil and then a heavy duty plastic freezer bag.

Butter the bottom and sides of two 8-inch round cake pans. Cut two 8-inch circles out of parchment paper and line the bottoms of the cake pans with the parchment. Stir together the butter, sugar, vanilla and eggs in a medium bowl. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Stir in 1 cup of the regular chocolate chips and divide the batter between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops. Bake until a crust begins to form around the edges, the edges pull away from the pan and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, halve the candy chews lengthwise. Use your fingers to shape each half into a teardrop shape for the reindeer&#39;s ears and set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons of the remaining regular chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl in a microwave in 20 second intervals.<br> Use a dab of the melted chocolate to stick a red candy-coated chocolate onto each of the vanilla wafers to make noses and set aside.<br> Cut each mini marshmallow in half crosswise. Insert one mini chocolate chip, pointed-side down, into the flat, cut side of each marshmallow piece to make eyes and set aside. As soon as the brownies come out of the oven, sprinkle the top of each brownie round evenly with half of the remaining regular chocolate chips (7 tablespoons each) and let stand until the chips melt, about 5 minutes. Spread the chocolate evenly over the top of the brownies with a spatula.<br> Let the brownies cool fully in the pans on cooling racks, about 1 hour. Cut each circle into 8 equal triangles with a knife. Use a small offset spatula or pie server to lift each triangle out of the pan. To assemble: Arrange the brownies so that the longest, sharpest point faces you and gently press a cookie-nose on that point of each brownie. To make antlers: Using the tip of a paring knife or a skewer, poke two small holes in the top side of each brownie, about 1/2 inch from the corners, and insert a mini candy cane in each hole.<br> For the ears, press a piece of candy chew on each corner below the candy cane antlers Press 2 of the mini marshmallow eyes next to each other in the center of each brownie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4056,&quot;Jalapeno Cornbread 2 cups yellow cornmeal 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 3 large eggs 1 1/3 cups milk 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted 1 cup sweet corn kernels, canned and drained (if you are using frozen corn, make sure it is thawed) 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese 1/2 cup grated carrots 1/2 cup grated onion 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh jalapeno pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Use an oven thermometer to be sure your oven temperature is accurate.<br> Place the filet on a sheet pan and pat it dry (all over) with paper towels. Brush the filet all over with the oil, reserving about half a tablespoon. Sprinkle it all over with the salt and pepper (it will seem like a lot but believe me, it makes a difference). Place the tarragon branches around the beef, tying them in 4 or 5 places with kitchen twine to keep them in place, and then brush the tarragon with the reserved oil.<br> Roast the filet of beef for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, until the temperature registers 125 degrees in the center for rare and 135 degrees for medium-rare. Cover the filet with aluminum foil and allow to rest for 20 minutes. Slice thickly and serve warm or at room temperature with Basil Parmesan Mayonnaise. Place the egg yolks, lemon juice, Parmesan, mustard, basil, garlic, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process for 20 seconds, until smooth. Combine the vegetable oil and olive oil in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup. With the processor running, slowly pour the oil mixture through the feed tube to make a thick emulsion. Taste for seasonings -- the mayonnaise is a sauce so it should be highly seasoned.

Put the bread crumbs, flour, and eggs each in separate shallow, lipped plates. Pour the oil in a medium skillet to a depth of 1/2-inch, and heat over medium-high heat. Dredge the eggplant in the flour, shake off any excess, and then dip in the eggs. Add the eggplant to the skillet and fry, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and season with salt and pepper. Season the veal with salt and pepper, and dredge in the bread crumbs. Lay 1/2 of the prosciutto over each veal cutlet, place 1 rectangle of the mozzarella along the center of each, and roll tightly. Tuck in the ends of the rolls and press to seal. Dip each roll in the eggs, add to the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, spread about 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce on 1 side of each eggplant slice, and sprinkle with some of the Parmesan.

Saute the onions in it for 5 to 10 minutes or until transparent and just starting to brown. Using a knife, cut the tomatoes coarsely inside their cans. Drain off the juice and reserve. Add the tomatoes to the saucepan, along with a dozen basil leaves, very coarsely chopped. Season with salt and red pepper flakes to taste. Let the sauce come to a boil, then lower heat, simmer for 45 minutes. It should have a medium-thick consistency; keep adding back some of the reserved tomato liquid to maintain the correct consistency. While the sauce is cooking, boil the spaghetti in a large amount of salted water. When ready to serve, add another dozen very coarsely chopped basil leaves to the sauce, and whisk in the butter. Drain the cooked spaghetti in a colander, draining all water from the pasta cooking pot, then return the spaghetti to the pot. Add about 2/3 of the sauce to it, or just enough to lightly coat the spaghetti with sauce. Stir well for one minute over medium heat. Divide spaghetti among eight bowls, placing a few small basil leaves on each spaghetti bowl. Top each with a few tablespoons of sauce. Serve immediately.

In a cast iron skillet large enough to hold 1 of the pizza rounds, heat about 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, turn heat off and add 1 of the pizza rounds. Use a spatula to press gently on the top of the round to keep it relatively flat as it cooks. When you see it is slightly brown on the underside, season the top lightly with salt and pepper and flip the round on its second side. Season it with salt and pepper and top with the onion sausage-onion mixture and place the skillet in the center of the oven until the pizza has finished cooking, 5 to 8 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough and topping. In a large bowl, combine the yeast and warm water. Stir to dissolve the yeast and allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes. Using a sieve or strainer, \sift\ about half of the flour over the yeast mixture and blend until smooth with your hands. Add the salt, pepper and honey and mix to blend. Sift in the remaining flour and mix to blend. Lightly flour a cutting board or flat surface. Turn the pizza dough onto the floured area and knead for 3 to 5 minutes. The flour should feel smooth and the ingredients fully integrated. Place the dough inside a lightly oiled large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in a warm place, about 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume. Press gently on the dough and turn it onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts, rolling each quarter into a loose ball. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow the dough to rest for an additional 15 minutes. Flatten each ball, 1at a time, and roll into a 6-inch round. Place each round in a single layer on a lightly greased baking sheet. In a medium skillet over high heat, heat the olive oil and cook the sausage, breaking it into small pieces as it cooks, until golden brown and crispy. Using a slotted spoon, remove the sausage from the pan onto a paper-towel lined plate. Drop the onions into the pan and cook over medium heat until caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the honey. Add the caramelized onions to the pizza fried pizza dough and top with mozzarella, sausage, basil, and a drizzle of good extra-virgin olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 4074,&quot;Blueberry Buckle 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup butter 1 egg 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup whole-wheat flour 2 teaspoons baking powder Few gratings fresh nutmeg 1/2 cup milk 1 cup blueberries 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup whole wheat flour 1/4 cup butter 2 teaspoons cinnamon Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes; drain. When they are cool enough to handle but still hot, carefully cut the potatoes in half (try not to pull off the skins) and transfer to a large bowl. Finely chop the garlic and add it to the potatoes along with 2 tablespoons each vinegar and olive oil; season with salt. (It is important to do this while the potatoes are still warm so they absorb the vinegar and oil and are seasoned all the way through.) Meanwhile, bring another pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat. Set up a bowl of ice water and season it generously with salt. Add the haricots verts to the boiling water and cook until tender, 5 to 6 minutes (bite a bean to be sure they are properly cooked); drain and immediately put in the ice water to \shock\ them, or stop the cooking. When they are cold, drain the haricots verts and let them dry a little. Cut them in half. Add the haricots verts, olives, oregano, scallions and red pepper flakes to the bowl with the potatoes. Stir to combine well; taste and adjust the seasoning. Add the remaining oil and vinegar, if needed. This salad is good now, but it will be even better if you let it sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 4080,&quot;Sweet Semolina: Halva 4 ounces olive oil 4 ounces finely ground semolina 4 ounces coarsely ground semolina 2 ounces blanched and finely chopped almonds Ground cinnamon 12 ounces water 10 ounces sugar 1/2 lemon 1 teaspoon whole cloves 1 cinnamon stick Instructions: Heat oil in a medium pot on medium-high heat.

Sprinkle on both sides of the steaks and let rest at room temperature for up to 2 hours. In a large pan with straight sides, add the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the steaks and sear on both sides until a deep golden color is on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook about 4 minutes more. Remove to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. For the gravy: Using kitchen twine, tie the thyme and rosemary together. In the same pan you seared the steaks in, add the herb bundle and the butter. Lower the heat to medium, melt the butter and then add the onions. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of black pepper. Cook on medium heat until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes, and then add the garlic. When the garlic becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes, add the stone-ground mustard and beef stock. Stir to blend and then add the heavy cream. Taste and season with more salt, if needed, and raise the heat to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce has thickened to a gravy, lower the heat and stir in the sour cream. Add the reserved steaks back into the pan and bring to a simmer while spooning the sauce over the steaks. Cook this way until desired doneness; it should take only a minute more for medium-rare. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Place the slices on a serving plate and pour the gravy over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 4100,&quot;Linzer Doily Wreaths 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 1/2 cup almond flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened<br> 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon grated orange zest<br> 1 large egg, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/2 cup raspberry jam<br> 1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar<br> Green gel food coloring<br> 24 small red candy bows Instructions: Whisk together the all-purpose flour, almond flour, cinnamon, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl.

In a small saucepan, melt half the butter over medium-low heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the milk solids in the butter smell toasty and nutty and have turned golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the stove and cool to room temperature. In a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add half of the graham crackers and salt. Process into fine crumbs. Add the cooled brown butter and process until the mixture starts to clump. Dump the graham cracker mixture into a pie dish. Using the flat bottom of a glass or dry measuring cup, press the crumbs in an even layer on the bottom and up the sides. (At this point, you can freeze the crust for 30 minutes to firm up, or continue with the next step.) Warm half the hot fudge sauce (1 1/4 cups) to an easily spreadable consistency (it shouldn\u2019t be hot). Pour the fudge over the graham cracker crust and, using an offset spatula, gently spread the fudge in an even layer on the bottom and up the sides of the crust. Place in the freezer for 1 hour until firm. Repeat the process for the brown butter graham cracker crust and fudge application for the second pie. To toast the marshmallows: Use a br?le torch to toast. Alternatively, you can place an oven rack in the upper third position and preheat the oven to broil. Space the marshmallows 2 inches apart on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil until toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the oven to cool completely, then place in the freezer while you make the ice cream. To make the ice cream: In the chilled bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream to stiff peaks. Add the condensed milk, marshmallow creme, vanilla and salt and beat on high speed to fully combine, 30 seconds (it\u2019s a-okay if there are little bits of marshmallow in the cream). Working quickly, transfer half of the no-churn ice cream to a frozen pie crust, saving the remaining half for the second pie. Top each pie with 8 toasted marshmallows, pressing them into the ice cream. Freeze until very firm, at least 6 hours or up to overnight. Shave the chocolate on top to garnish. Slice and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 4104,&quot;Mascarpone and Wild Berry Tart 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup sugar Kosher salt Zest of 1 lemon 1 vanilla bean 2 sticks (1/2 pound) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and chilled, plus more for greasing the tart pan 3 large organic egg yolks 1/4 cup grappa (or rum or water) 8 ounces mascarpone 1/2 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons grappa (or rum or water) 3 tablespoons sugar 1 vanilla bean, seeded 1 pint raspberries 1 pint blackberries Shaved dark chocolate, for garnish Instructions: For the crust: In a stand mixer, add the flour, sugar, pinch of salt and lemon zest. Mix together for about 30 seconds.<br> With a sharp knife, open the vanilla bean, remove the seeds and add them to the other ingredients in the mixer. With the mixer on a medium speed, add the cold butter and mix until it looks like coarse crumbs.<br> In a small bowl, beat together the yolks and grappa and add it to the mixture. Keep the machine running on medium speed. The dough will come together (it only takes a few seconds) and as soon as it starts leaving the sides of the bowl, turn off the machine, and by hand on a flat surface, work into shape of a disk. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about an hour.<br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Butter an 11-inch tart pan very well.<br> On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thick, and then gently lay it into the tart pan. Press the dough lightly into the round edges, then, using your fingers, press on the edges of the pan, cutting off the excess.<br> With a fork, poke the dough several times, all the way through to the pan. The tart will try to \rise\ in the oven, so poking the tart helps it breathe in the hot air.<br> Bake in the oven until golden and crisp, about 20 minutes. Set aside on a cooling rack for about 30 minutes.<br> For the filling: Use a hand mixer to whip together the mascarpone, cream, grappa, sugar, and vanilla seeds in a large bowl. Whip until you have soft peaks.<br> Spread the filling on top of the cooled crust. Add the berries by just dropping them on the cream, there is no need to push the fruit. If the cream is light and fluffy they will slowly drop into the filling.

Serve the chili in bowls over Double-Fried French Fries and garnish with crackers, green onions and Cheddar. Peel the potatoes on the sides, leaving the ends with the skin on. Cut the potatoes into 1/3-inch slices and then slice into 1/3-inch sticks. Fill a large bowl with water and soak the potatoes, submerged, at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. This will help remove the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing. Fit a heavy stockpot with a deep-fry thermometer and heat the oil to 325degress F. Remove the potatoes from the water and pat dry to remove excess water. Carefully place two handfuls of potatoes into the hot oil. There should be at least 1 inch of oil above the potatoes. Parcook until the potatoes are light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the potatoes, gently shaking off the excess oil and let them drain on a rack.

For the cake: Grease a 13-by-18-inch sheet pan with butter, line bottom of the pan with parchment paper and generously butter and flour the paper. In a small bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, nutmeg, and salt and stir to combine. Place the eggs and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until light, thick and pale, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low, add the carrot, then slowly add the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake until the top springs back when gently touched, about 15 minutes.<br> While the cake is baking, lay a clean, thin cotton dish towel out on a flat surface and sift 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar evenly over it. (This will prevent the cake from sticking to the towel.) As soon as you remove the cake from the oven, loosen it around the edges and invert it squarely onto the prepared towel. Peel away the parchment paper. Starting at one of the short ends, gently roll the warm cake and the towel together. Allow the rolled cake to cool completely on a wire rack. For the candied carrots: Combine the grated carrot, sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring often, and cook until the carrots are bright orange, glossy and almost dry, about 12 minutes. Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon and let cool. (The candied carrots will be in clumps.) For the frosting: Beat the cream cheese, butter and salt together with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined and smooth, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the confectioners? sugar, vanilla and 1 teaspoon milk. Continue to beat until completely combined, about 2 minutes. (If needed add the second teaspoon of milk, the mixture should be fluffy not runny.) Increase the speed to high and beat until fluffy, about 4 minutes more.<br> To assemble: Place 1/2 cup of the frosting in a small bowl and set aside. Carefully unroll the cake onto a cutting board with the towel underneath. Using a small offset spatula, spread half the frosting evenly over the cake. Sprinkle the frosting evenly with walnuts, raisins and golden raisins, making sure to go all the way to the edges. Disperse teaspoons of candied carrots across the frosting. Carefully reroll the cake, using the towel as a guide. Place the cake roll on a platter. Frost the sides and ends of the cake with the remaining frosting and press shredded coconut all over the surface.<br> Combine the reserved 1/2 cup frosting with 2 to 4 drops orange food coloring and mix well. Transfer the tinted frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip. Pipe 12 carrots evenly down the center of the cake roll and top each with a small piece of reserved carrot frond.

Add the smoked fish, the tomato paste, and 1/4 cup of the salted water. While the onion mixture is browning, prepare the stuffing for the sea bass steaks by placing the parsley, garlic, cl, and scallions in a food processor and pulsing until they form a thick paste. When the paste is ready, score the sea bass steaks and poke the stuffing into the slits. Place the sea bass in the stockpot with the onion mixture, allow it to cook for 5 minutes, and add the remaining water. When the fish mixture comes to a boil, cover the pot, lower the heat, and add the vegetables in the order given, finishing off with the pricked habanero cl, which you will remove (and reserve) when the thiebou dienn is spicy enough for you. Cook for 20 minutes. Remove the sea bass steaks keeping them whole, and place them on a serving platter. Cover them with a bit of the cooking liquid, and keep them warm. Continue cooking the thiebou dienn for an additionaly 15 minutes, then remove the vegetables and arrange them on a platter and keep them warm. Reserve 2 cups of the cooking liquid to make the sauces. Return the remaining liquid to a boil, add the rice, cover, and cook for 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is done. While the rice is cooking, pulverize the habanero cl that you have reserved and add it to 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid. Heat it, stirring occasionally, and place it in a sauceboat. Heat the remaining cup of reserved cooking liquid and place it in a separate sauceboat. This will give you a regular sauce and a fiery hot one. When ready to serve, mound the rice on one platter and the fish and vegetables on another.

Brush both sides of the salmon with 1 teaspoon lemon juice and sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside. Warm 2 tablespoons oil in 2 separate skillets over medium-high heat. Add half of the onion and half the garlic to each pan. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and thyme into 1 pan and the spinach, lemon zest and remain lemon juice in the other pan. Stir the spinach until it wilts, then transfer it to a bowl and set aside. Saute the mushrooms until they are reduced and tender, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the sour cream. Set aside. Trim the thinner ends of the salmon fillet so you have 4 pieces of even thickness. Unroll a pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Pass a rolling pin lightly over 2 or 3 times to seal the seams and lengthen slightly. Cut the pastry sheet into 3 equal strips, using the natural seams as a guide. Roll out the second puff pastry sheet to get 1 more strip. Save remaining puff pastry for another use. Lightly prick the 4 strips with a fork. Put 1 heaping spoonful of mushroom mixture on 1 half of each pastry, top with salmon, then layer with a heaping spoonful of spinach mixture. Wet the edges of the pastry with water and fold over the other half, pressing lightly and folding to seal the edges. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling. Cut 2 vents on the top of each pastry packet and arrange them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until the pastry is golden and fish is just opaque in the center, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat. Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks. Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream, to the hot cream. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees F. on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine. Freeze according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. After the ice cream is made, transfer to an airtight container. Cover tightly and freeze until ready to serve. Garnish with chocolate curls. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 4189,&quot;Salsa Roja Taquera (Red Taco-Stand Style Salsa) 8 to 10 dried arbol chiles 2 guajillo chiles 3 medium cloves garlic, unpeeled 2 ripe plum tomatoes Salt to taste Instructions: 1 Snip off the stems of the chiles and shake out their seeds as best you can. If the chiles are too dry and brittle, warm them slightly on a gently heated comal, and then remove the seeds. Alternately, keep the seeds in to make a very hot salsa.<br> 2 Heat the comal on low to medium-low and place the unpeeled garlic cloves near the edge of the pan, away from direct heat. Turn occasionally until soft and blackened in spots, 5 to 7 minutes. Peel the garlic cloves once cool enough to handle and set aside in a blender jar.<br> 3 To toast the chiles, work with one at a time so they don&#39;t burn. Place each cl near the edge of the comal-again, away from the hottest part of the pan-and turn constantly for 5 to 10 seconds, pressing any wrinkled or folded spots lightly so all parts of the cl skin come into contact with the pan. They are done when the color lightens up in spots and they emit a spicy aroma. (This is a very quick process!) Remove all toasted chiles to a separate bowl and cover with water. Let sit 15 minutes or until the skins are soft. Reserve the soaking water.<br> 4 While the chiles sit, heat the comal to medium or medium-high. Cook the whole tomatoes, turning often with tongs, until soft and blackened in spots. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.<br> 5 Add the hydrated chiles to the blender jar (with the garlic), with 2 tablespoons of the reserved cl water and a generous 1/4 cup water. Blend until smooth. Add the tomatoes and 2 tablespoons more water, plus 3/4 teaspoon salt. Blend again, adding more water and salt if desired. (Note that the saltiness will mute when the still-warm salsa cools.) Serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 4190,&quot;Toasted Spiced Ham Drizzled in Honey 1 boneless country ham 2 cups honey, for glazing ham 2 tablespoons Toasted Spice Rub, recipe follows 1 tablespoon thyme, chopped fine 6 celery stalks 1/4 cup fennel seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon peppercorns 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1/4 cup (1-ounce) pure California sweet chili powder* 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place ham on an open brown paper bag for easy clean up. With the tip of a paring knife carefully score a 1-inch grid pattern around the outside of the ham. Brush the entire surface of the meat on all sides with some of the honey. Season the entire surface of the meat on all sides with the toasted spice rub and thyme. Add about a half cup of water to the base of the roaster. Place ham on several celery sticks in the roasting pan. Cook for 1 hour. Every 15 minutes, baste ham with juices that collect in the base of the roaster and the honey. Let rest for 15 minutes before carving as desired. Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. (Toasting freshens spices, releases their oils, and makes them more fragrant, as well as adding a new dimension of flavor.) When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan; add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put in a blender with the sweet chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill blender or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. *Chef&#39;s Tip: Taste your chili powder and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chiles are almost sweet, not hot.

Process until partly smooth but not completely pureed (it should have a little texture). Hold a wonton wrapper in your hand. Dip a tablespoon measure in cold water and then scoop 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the center of a wrapper (dipping the spoon in cold water first will make the filling come off easier). Lightly moisten the edge of the wrapper with some water and fold over to form a half moon. Holding the edge in your hands, crimp and pinch around wrapper to create a fluted edge. Flatten the bottom so that the edge is facing upwards. Repeat for the remaining filling and wrappers. Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat and add the peanut oil. Add the gyoza flat-side down to the pan, and cook until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add 1/4 cup water. Return the pan to the heat and cover with a lid. Remove the lid and cook until the water evaporates and the gyoza are golden brown and crispy.

Add the water and salt to the center of the well. Using a fork, slowly start to incorporate the flour into the water to form a rough dough. Add a teaspoon of water if the dough is too dry or a dusting of flour if it is too wet. Lightly flour a smooth work surface and pour the dough onto the flour. Knead the dough until it springs back when you press a finger into it, 8 to 10 minutes. Flatten the dough into an even square. Wrap the dough well in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour. Cut the dough into 6 pieces. Roll a piece into a 1/3-inch-thick rope. Cut the rope into 1/3-inch pieces. Press one piece of dough firmly with your thumb against a gnocchi board or the back tines of a fork, rolling the dough as you pull it along to create a shell shape. Continue with the remaining dough, dusting the pasta with 00 flour as needed to prevent sticking. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 4194,&quot;Watermelon Salsa 1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest (from about 1 lime) 1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from about 3 limes) 1 tablespoon sugar Freshly ground pepper 3 cups seeded and finely chopped watermelon 1 cucumber, peeled, seeded and diced 1 mango, peeled and diced 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced 1 small red onion, finely chopped 8 fresh basil leaves, finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt Tortilla or pita chips, for serving Instructions: Stir together the lime zest, lime juice, sugar and 3/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl.

In a medium bowl, mix together the pineapple juice, vinegar, sugar, and adjust the seasonings with salt, and pepper. Transfer the lamb to a bowl and pour over half of the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set the meat in the refrigerator to marinate for 1 hour or up to 4 hours. Soak the wooden skewers in cold water for at least 30 minutes prior to cooking the kebabs. The water will help prevent them from burning. Dice the bell peppers and onions into 1 1/4-inch cubes. Using a sharp knife, remove the skin from the pineapple, quarter the fruit lengthwise and discard the hard central core from each piece. Cut the pineapple flesh as well as the banana into similar-sized chunks. Thread the bell peppers, onions, pineapple, banana, and lamb evenly onto the soaked skewers to make 10 to 12 generously laden kebabs. Heat a griddle pan over high heat or preheat a grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates, or preheat the broiler. Brush the kebabs with some oil. Place the kebabs onto the grill, turning frequently, and using the remaining marinade for basting. They should be done after around 10 minutes, turning frequently. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 4203,&quot;Mustard Rouille for Soup 1/4 cup of chicken bouillabaisse liquid 1/4 teaspoon powdered saffron 2 parboiled garlic cloves, pureed until it is pasty 3/4 cup crustless good quality French bread, cut into cubes 2 teaspoons mustard 1 tablespoon chopped pimiento 1/3 cup commercially prepared mayonnaise 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/4 cup vegetable oil Salt and cayenne pepper to taste Instructions: Whisk the liquid, saffron, and garlic together.

Squeeze the citrus juice into the marinade then stuff the cavity of the duck with the citrus halves. Place the duck in a 2 gallon freezer bag, then pour in the marinade. Seal and refrigerate for 24 hours. The next day, remove the duck from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towel. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place the duck on a rack in a roasting pan. Fold the wing tips back and tie the legs together. First, roast the duck for 20 minutes, the high temperature will caramelize the sugars on the outside of the duck and set a rich mahogany color. After 20 minutes, drop the temperature down to 325 degrees F and roast for 1 hour. Duck heaven baby! You can start the bok choy when the duck has about 10 minutes left in cooking. Preheat a large skillet on medium high. Add peanut oil. Saute cut side down for about 1 minute until golden. Discard the oil. Take the back-side of a knife and give the ginger a good whack. Bruising the ginger will release a ton of flavor. Add the ginger to the pan with bok choy then add the mirin, soy, and chicken stock. Stir in the miso, careful not to damage the food. While you have the spoon in your hand, stir in the cornstarch mixture, then let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few minutes. Finish with the fresh cherries, a pinch of salt, and fresh cracked white pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 4225,&quot;Hazelnut Sugar Cookie Cereal 1 batch Mini Sugar Cookie Hearts, recipe follows 1 batch Mini Meringues, recipe follows 1 cup dried cherries or cranberries<br> 1 cup milk chocolate chips<br> 1 cup toasted coconut flakes<br> 1 cup toasted hazelnuts, coarsely chopped<br> Milk, for serving<br> 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 cup sugar<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened<br> 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 large egg<br> 3/4 cup sugar 2 large eggs whites<br> 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br> A tiny drop of red food coloring<br> Instructions: Gently combine the Mini Sugar Cookie Hearts, Mini Meringues, cherries, chocolate chips, coconut flakes and hazelnuts in a large bowl. (I ended up only using about two-thirds of the meringues because I liked that cookie-to-meringue ratio. The remaining meringues were kept aside for noshing and cake decorating!) Serve in a bowl with milk. Keep in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. The cereal should keep for a couple of weeks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. In a food processor, process the hazelnuts until finely ground. Add the flour and salt and pulse to combine. Using an electric mixer, cream the sugar and butter until pale and fluffy. Add the vanilla and egg and beat well to combine. With the mixer on low, gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, beating until combined. Turn the cookie dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out until it&#39;s 1/4 inch thick and use a cookie cutter to cut out tiny hearts. Place the hearts on the baking sheets (they can be pretty close together) and bake until lightly browned on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Reduce the oven to 250 degrees F and bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes to really crisp them up. Let cool on the baking sheets. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Distribute the sugar in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the edges start to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. While the sugar is baking, add the egg whites to a stand mixer. Once the sugar has been in the oven for a few minutes, begin beating the egg whites on high until foamy. Reduce the mixer and gradually sprinkle in the warm sugar. Once all of it has been added, add the almond extract and food coloring. Beat on high until the meringue is stiff, glossy and cold, just a few minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 225 degrees F. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/8- or 1/4-inch round tip with the egg white mixture. Pipe tiny dollops onto the parchment and bake for about 20 minutes, until the mini meringues are no longer shiny and crispy all the way through. Let cool on the baking sheets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 4226,&quot;Cheesesteak Potstickers 1 pound shaved wagyu beef Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, plus additional for cooking potstickers 1 red onion, slivered<br> 1 tablespoon garlic, minced<br> 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced<br> 4 ounces shredded Cheddar 4 ounces shredded mozzarella<br> 1 package gyoza or thin egg roll wrappers Serving suggestion: Dijon mustard Instructions: Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper. Add the oil to a wok or a large cast-iron or saute pan over high heat. Once heated, add the seasoned beef and sear, stirring quickly, until cooked through, about 2 minutes, then remove from the wok and set aside. In the same pan, add the onions, garlic and ginger over medium heat and cook until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the hot onions to the cooked beef. Taste for seasoning, adjusting if needed. Store in the fridge to cool, at least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour. Fold in the cheese prior to making dumplings. To form potstickers, line a sheet tray with parchment paper and set aside. Lay out a dumpling wrapper on your work surface. Using your finger or a pastry brush, wipe water around the top edge of the wrapper. Spoon about 1/2 tablespoon filling in the center. (Make sure not to get filling on the edges of the wrapper, which prevents proper sealing.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half-moon shape. Seal the top center by pressing between fingers and starting at the center, then making three pleats, working toward the bottom right corner. Repeat, working toward the bottom left corner. Press the dumpling gently on a work surface to flatten the bottom. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Hold the dumplings on the lined sheet tray. Heat a large saute pan over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil and swirl to coat. When the oil shimmers, add the potstickers, flat-side down, in 2 snug rows of 5 and cook, in batches, without disturbing, until the bottoms have browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add about 1/2 cup water and immediately cover the pan to avoid splattering. Lift the cover and make sure about 1/8 inch water remains; if not, add a bit more. Steam until the potstickers are puffy, yet firm, and the water has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. If the water evaporates before the potstickers are done, add more in 2- to 3-tablespoon increments. If the potstickers seem done but water remains, drain the water and return the pan to the stovetop. Continue to cook over high heat to allow the potstickers to re-crisp on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve hot with Dijon mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4227,&quot;Broadway Diner - Broadway Festival (Seafood Pasta) 3/4 pound linguini Four 5-ounce lobster tails, each cut into half&#39;s, shells on 1 cup olive oil 10 ounces large sea scallops 8 U-12 jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined 1/2 medium-sized onion, peeled and diced 10 cloves garlic, sliced 12 mussels, scrubbed and bearded 12 cherrystone clams, scrubbed 1/2 cup white wine 2 large ripe tomatoes, diced 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes 4 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves 2 tablespoons freshly chopped oregano leaves 1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons ground black pepper 1 cup chicken stock 6 ounces calamari (tubes only), cut into rings 1/3 cup grated Romano cheese Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Add 2 tablespoons of the water and pulse 8 to 10 times, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice. Add 2 more tablespoons of water along with the salt and pulse until a dough begins to form. If the dough is still dry and somewhat crumbly, add the remaining tablespoon of water and pulse several times. Turn the dough out onto the counter and shape into a ball. Wrap the ball of dough in plastic wrap and allow to sit for 30 minutes. *You may also make tortillas from pre-ground masa flour following the directions on the bag. Preheat a cast iron griddle over medium-high heat until it reaches 400 degrees F. Divide the dough into 1 1/2-ounce portions, shape into balls, and keep covered with a damp tea towel. Cut a 1-gallon zip-top bag in half and line the base of a tortilla press with the plastic. Place 1 ball at a time onto the press and top with the other half of the plastic. Close the press and push down firmly several times until the tortilla is flattened. Remove the plastic wrap from the tortilla and place onto the cast iron skillet and cook for 1 minute on each side. Remove the tortilla to a plate lined with a tea towel. Cover the tortilla with a second towel to keep warm. Repeat with all of the dough. Use immediately or store in a zip-top bag in the refrigerator for up to a week. Nixtamal: Rinse the corn under cool water; drain and set aside. Place the water and the lime into a 3 1/2 to 4-quart, non-reactive stockpot, set over medium-low heat, and stir to combine. Add the corn and bring just to a boil, stirring occasionally. Make sure that it takes at least 30 to 45 minutes to come to a boil. Once the mixture comes to a boil, remove from the heat, cover, and allow to sit at room temperature overnight. Do not refrigerate. Drain the corn in a large colander and rinse under lukewarm water for 5 to 6 minutes while rubbing the corn kernels between your fingers in order to remove the outer coating. Place the corn into a large bowl, cover with lukewarm water, and allow to soak for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, rinse, and repeat.

The flavors are amazing. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil and drop in the chopped broccoli and cauliflower. Boil for 5 to 6 minutes, until cooked, then drain in a colander, reserving the cooking water. Heat a wide saucepan, pour in a couple of good glugs of olive oil and add the garlic. Fry for a few seconds, then add the thyme leaves, anchovies, anchovy oil and chiles and continue frying for a few seconds more before adding the cooked broccoli and cauliflower with around 4 tablespoons of the reserved cooking water. Stir everything together, put a lid on the pan leaving a little gap, and cook slowly for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring regularly - overcooking the vegetables not only intensies their flavor but gives you the texture that you need for this recipe. Remove the lid for the last 5 minutes to let the moisture evaporate, then use a potato masher to crush the vegetables. Take the saucepan off the heat, taste the vegetables and season carefully with salt and pepper. Spread the mixture on a baking sheet to cool. Meanwhile, get yourself another baking dish or roasting pan (the right size for fitting the cannelloni tubes snugly side by side - I test this by actually laying the tubes into the dish, then remove them and put to 1 side) and pour in the tomato sauce with a pinch of salt and a swig of red wine vinegar. Now, to make a really quick and easy white sauce, mix the creme fraiche with half the Parmesan, a sprinkling of salt and pepper and a little of the reserved cooking water to thin it down. Spoon your cooled broccoli and cauliflower mixture into a large sandwich bag and cut off the corner. Twist the top of the bag and squeeze it to pipe the filling into the cannelloni tubes. (If you prefer, use a teaspoon to push the mixture into the cannelloni or use a piping bag.) Fill the tubes up - don&#39;t be stingy! - and place them in a single layer on top of the sauce. Lay the basil leaves over the cannelloni and spoon your white sauce evenly over the top. Season with black pepper, sprinkle over the remaining Parmesan and tear over the mozzarella. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and bubbling on top. Dress the arugula leaves with a squeeze of lemon juice and about 3 times as much extra- virgin olive oil. Serve the cannelloni with the arugula and some good crusty bread. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

For the mayonnaise: Combine the ingredients in a small bowl. Refrigerate until serving. For the patties: Combine the turkey and eggs in a large bowl. Add the almonds, ginger, cinnamon, garlic, salt and pepper. Combine, mixing gently so that the meat does not get compacted. Divide into 6 equal portions and gently shape into patties that equal the size of the rolls. Refrigerate until grilling. For the onions: Heat the butter in a medium-sized fire-proof skillet on the grill. Once the foam subsides, add the onions, saffron and salt. Sprinkle with the sugar and saute until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Cover and set aside. When the grill is ready, brush the grill rack with oil. Place the patties on the rack, cover, and grill approximately 4 minutes, until golden brown on the bottom. Turn the patties gently and grill an additional 4 minutes, or until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the grill and let rest tented with foil, about 3 minutes. While the patties rest, place the rolls, cut side down, on the grill and toast lightly, about 2 minutes. To assemble the burgers: Thinly spread the roll tops and bottoms with the mayonnaise, place the patties on top of the roll bottoms, and top the patties with equal portions of the onions. Add the roll tops and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 4277,&quot;Roasted Peach and Rosemary Turkey Breast with Stuffing 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons apple cider 1/4 cup kosher salt, plus more for the turkey 3 to 5 sprigs fresh thyme 3 sprigs fresh rosemary One 3-pound boneless turkey breast with skin 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for the turkey One 10-ounce bag frozen peeled and sliced peaches, chopped 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Freshly ground black pepper One 12-ounce bag stuffing mix \u2013 Sunny did the Stuffing Cubes (some come crushed) 1/4 cup loosely packed chopped fresh parsley 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup chopped celery 1 cup chopped onion 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 5 to 6 fresh sage leaves, chopped 4 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp grater Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 cups turkey or chicken stock Instructions: For the turkey: In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups apple cider, 1/4 cup salt, the thyme and rosemary. Add the turkey breast and enough cold water to cover the bird. Cover and let brine in the refrigerator 2 hours. Position the oven racks in the top and bottom of a countertop oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. (For Ninja Foodi \u2013 the setting is \u201cAir Roast 425 degrees F) Saute the onions in 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the peaches, honey, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and remaining 2 tablespoons apple cider. Bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook until the peaches break down and the glaze thickens, about 12 minutes. Remove the turkey from the brine and pat dry with paper towels (discard the brine). Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with pepper. Place the turkey in an 11.5-by-14-inch roasting pan. Cook on the bottom rack until the skin begins to turn golden, about 15 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and brush the top generously with the glaze (For the Ninja grill it was \u201cAir Roast 350 degrees F). Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Let the turkey rest at least 10 minutes. Its temperature will continue to rise. For the stuffing: Meanwhile, mix the stuffing mix with the parsley in a large bowl and set aside. Add the butter, celery, onion, thyme, sage and garlic to a large pan over medium heat. Season with a pinch of salt and a nice grind of pepper. Cook until the onions and celery are tender, but the garlic is not browned, about 10 minutes. Remove to the bowl of bread cubes. Pour the stock over the bread and veggie mixture and stir to combine (this is a wet dressing, so it should be very moist). Transfer the mixture to a 12-by-8-inch baking dish. Press down to make it compact, and then cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake on the top rack at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes, then raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and bake, uncovered, until golden brown on top, about 15 minutes more.

Prepare the peppers: Lay each pepper sideways on a flat surface and cut off the top so it\u2019s like a little hat for the rest of the pepper. Use a paring knife to carefully cut away any seeds stuck to the top. Use the paring knife or a small spoon to scoop any seeds from inside the pepper. In a large bowl, toss the pepper tops and bottoms with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon salt. Heat a large saute pan over medium heat. When it is hot, drop in the pepper tops and bottoms and cook until they are browned and slightly wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Tilt the pan so the peppers spill out onto a baking sheet. Set aside to cool. Prepare the filling: Use a rubber spatula to spread the goat cheese over the bottom and up the sides of a medium bowl so that you can season it evenly. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt, the scallions and the pine nuts all over the cheese. Mix to blend. Taste to make sure the flavors are balanced.<br> Fill and bake the peppers: Use a small spoon to stuff the peppers with the cheese mixture and then arrange them on a baking sheet with room between them. (Reserve the tops.) Bake until the filling is hot in the center, 8 to 10 minutes (test the center with the tip of a knife).<br> Make the dressing and finish the dish: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Remove the peppers from the oven and drizzle with the lemon dressing. Top the peppers with the reserved tops. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4291,&quot;Apple Pie Coffee Cake 2 large eggs 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 cup sugar 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice or nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 cups peeled, cored, and thinly sliced firm tart apples (about 1 1/2 pounds) 1 tablespoon turbinado (raw) sugar, for sprinkling on top Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (350 degrees if using a Pyrex or dark-finish pie plate). Grease a 10-inch pie plate. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, oil, vanilla, and sugar, beating with a wooden spoon until thick, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg, and salt. Beat vigorously until the batter has a crumbly consistency, about 1 minute. Fold in the apples and mix until the apples are evenly coated and the batter becomes moist and smooth. There will be lots of apples, held together by a relatively stiff batter. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth into an even layer with a metal spatula. Sprinkle the top evenly with the sugar. Bake on the center rack of the oven 30 to 35 minutes, until the center is firm when gently pressed. A cake tester inserted into the center should come out clean, the top and bottom of the cake should be deep brown, and the apples should be tender when pierced with a knife. Remove from the oven and cool at least 1 hour in the pan on a folded tea towel. Serve warm or room temperature, cut in wedges from the pie pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 4292,&quot;Blender Hollandaise 1 large egg yolk 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice Pinch cayenne pepper 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Put the egg yolk, lemon juice, and cayenne in a blender. Pulse a couple times to combine. Put the butter in a small microwave-safe bowl and melt in a microwave until just melted. With the blender running, gradually add the melted butter into the egg to make a smooth frothy sauce. If the sauce is very thick, blend in a teaspoon of lukewarm water to loosen it up. Season with the salt and serve immediately or keep warm in a small heat-proof bowl set over hot (but not simmering) water until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 4293,&quot;Pan Seared Scallops with a Tomato and White Chocolate Beurre Blanc 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 large shallots, chopped Kosher salt 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1/4 cup dry white wine 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 ounces white chocolate, such as Ghiradelli, broken into pieces 1 tablespoon canola oil 12 large sea scallops, muscles removed from sides if needed Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Fresh pea tendrils Chopped tomatoes 1/2 lemon, juiced Olive oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: For the beurre blanc: Heat the oil in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and sweat with a pinch salt until just softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring to combine. Add the wine and vinegar and simmer until the liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cream (this will help stabilize your sauce and keep it from breaking) and simmer until reduced by one-third, 5 to 7 minutes. Strain the sauce into another warm saucepan over low heat. The sauce should remain warm, but never hot, or the sauce will break. On low or no heat, whisk in a few pieces of the butter at a time. Wait until each addition is incorporated before adding more butter. Once all of the butter is incorporated, add the lemon juice and combine. Set aside in a warm spot to hold. Just before serving, whisk in the white chocolate. For the seared scallops: In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it has a nice sheen and you can feel the heat coming off of the skillet. Dry your scallops well using paper towels, sprinkle each side with salt and pepper and add them to the hot skillet. Once the bottom of the scallops start to brown around the edges, add the butter to the skillet to help them caramelize. Let the butter melt, flip the scallops and cook until golden brown on each side and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Toss some pea tendrils and tomatoes with the lemon juice and some olive oil, season with salt and pepper and serve with the scallops and beurre blanc. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 4294,&quot;Guinness Float 2 cups milk 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup sugar 1 vanilla bean, scraped 1 1/4 cups egg yolks 1 cup Guinness beer 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup glucose* 1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut 24 ounces Guinness beer (2 bottles) Instructions: To make the ice cream: Combine the milk, heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla bean in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Pour 1/4 cup of the hot mixture in a steady stream over the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Repeat until all the milk mixture has been added. Strain the ice cream base through a fine sieve and cool in an ice bath. When the mixture is cool add the beer, transfer to an ice cream maker, and process according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Spoon the ice cream into a plastic container and freeze for at least 1 hour before serving. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. To make the coconut straws: Combine the butter, sugar, honey, and glucose in a heavy-bottomed pan. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat until a candy thermometer indicates a temperature of 280 degrees F. Stirring constantly, remove the pot from the stove. Add the coconut, then quickly and carefully spread the mixture out on a parchment lined baking sheet. Cool the mixture then cut 4 1/4-inch wide strips. Place the strips on a non-stick baking sheet (preferably a silpat) then bake until golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool the strips for 5 minutes (the strips should be firm but pliable) then roll them into thin straws. Fill 4 tall, chilled beer glasses with 3 scoops of ice cream each. Pour beer into each glass then top with another scoop or 2 of ice cream. Garnish with the coconut straws and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 4295,&quot;Stuffed Tomatoes 4 large heirloom tomatoes Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces 80/20 ground beef 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated 1 small red onion, diced Zest of 1 lemon 1/2 cup finely chopped mint 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley 1 1/2 cups cooked long grain rice 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts 4 ounces goat cheese 2 tablespoons panko breadcrumbs Instructions: Set up your grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Cut the tops off of each tomato and scoop out the inside flesh into a bowl. Set aside the tomato shells. Roughly chop the inside tomato flesh or break it up with your hands, yielding 1 cup. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place a large saute pan over the direct heat side of the grill and add a drizzle of olive oil. Season the ground beef with salt and pepper. When the oil is hot, add the ground beef and cook until it begins to brown, breaking it up into smaller pieces as it cooks, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, onions, lemon zest, another drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Give it a stir and cook until fragrant and the onions are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Then stir in the reserved tomato insides. Cook for about 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pan for any brown bits. Add the mint and parsley. Give it one more stir and remove from the heat. Add the rice, pine nuts and goat cheese. Fill each reserved tomato shell to the top with the beef mixture and place into a cast-iron skillet. Sprinkle with the panko and drizzle with olive oil. Place on the indirect heat side of the grill and close the lid. Bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes.

Knot one end of the floss. Thread the needle through the softer part of each piece of popcorn, avoiding the harder shell. (Threading through the shell may cause the popcorn to break.) Slip off the needle and knot the other end of the floss to make a popcorn string. For the pepper garland: Poke a hole in one side of a pepper with a chopstick about 1/2 inch from the stem end, taking care not to pierce through the other side of the pepper. Twist the stick to slightly widen the hole. Repeat with the remaining peppers. Mix together the goat cheese, thyme, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with an 1/8-inch round tip. Carefully pipe the cheese filling into each pepper through the hole; do not overstuff the peppers or they may split. Refrigerate until ready to use. (This step can be done a day ahead.) Separate the kale into small, medium and large leaves. Using the largest leaves, start at the bottom of a 24-by-6-inch Styrofoam cone and begin to cover the cone with the leaves stem-end up. Overlap each leaf slightly and secure with a toothpick through the widest part of the stem, leaving about 1/2 inch of the toothpick showing. Work your way up the cone in rows, going from the larger leaves to the smaller leaves and overlapping the leaves and rows slightly, until only about 1 row of the cone remains exposed. To make the last row, position the kale leaves stem-end down, forming the top of the tree and covering the tip of the cone. Cover any thin areas or exposed Styrofoam with the remaining leaves. Chill until ready to decorate.<br> Cut twenty 18-inch-long pieces of narrow decorative ribbon. Tie each piece around the stem of a pepper in a secure knot.<br> Wind a 12-foot-piece of wider decorative ribbon around the tree, starting at the bottom and working your way up. Attach a pepper to the wider ribbon on the tree using the narrow ribbon to tie a decorative bow, so the pepper dangles from the wider ribbon (it should be secure but also be easy to untie and remove). Continue with the remaining peppers, spacing them about 6 inches apart on the wider ribbon. As you&#39;re working, hook each pepper bow to a toothpick end for support, adding additional toothpicks if necessary, until the tree is covered on all sides with the peppers. Decorate with the popcorn strand.

Scoop out the lemon slices and set aside. Add the caper berries and olives and cook, stirring gently for about 4 minutes. Pour in wine and bring to a boil. Cook until the wine is reduced by half. Add the chicken stock and boil until slightly syrupy. Return the scallopini to the skillet and coat each piece in the sauce. Add parsley and swirl into sauce. Divide scallopini onto separate plates. Spoon the sauce over, and add the caper berries and olives around scallopini. Add some of the spinach on the side. Finish by decorating each plate with reserved lemon slices on top of the scallopini. Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium heat. Crush garlic cloves with the side of the knife and add to the oil. Cook until golden brown, approximately 2 minutes. Add the spinach in handfuls, and season lightly with salt and pepper, and cover pan. Cook until spinach releases its liquid. Uncover pan, and cook stirring until spinach is wilted and water has evaporated. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 4308,&quot;Red Wine Sangria 2 bottles red Spanish table wine 1 cup brandy 1/2 cup triple sec 1 cup orange juice 1 cup pomegranate juice 1/2 cup simple syrup, or more to taste (equal parts sugar and water, heated until sugar dissolves, cooled) Orange slices Apple slices Blackberries Pomegranate seeds Instructions: Mix all ingredients together and let stand in a tightly sealed container or pitcher for at least 24 hours in the refrigerator before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 4309,&quot;Smore Pizza, Not Just for Kids 2 store-bought pizza doughs 1/2 cup bench flour 1/4 cup cornmeal 1/4 cup slivered almonds 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 sleeve graham crackers, crushed 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 cups mini marshmallows 2 bars dark chocolate Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Place a sheet of nori on the bamboo mat with the wider part along the rolling edge of the mat. Spread 1/2 cup of the rice over the surface of the nori, leaving about 1/2-inch of nori on the furthest edge uncovered so you will be able to seal the roll. Press the rice down firmly but gently. Place a dab of wasabi - about 1/4 teaspoon - on your finger and spread a thin ribbon of wasabi from left to right along the centerline of the rice. On top of the line of wasabi, lay a length each of fish, cucumber, and scallion. Begin rolling the edge of the bamboo closest to you, using the mat to press down on the sushi roll firmly but gently as you roll. The nori should stick to itself when the roll is complete; if it doesn&#39;t, use the cornstarch slurry to moisten it. Dip a knife in vinegared water and cut the roll into 6 even slices. Repeat for each maki. Arrange the rolls cut side up on a plate and top each roll with 1/4 teaspoon tobiko. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 4318,&quot;Ceviche (Shrimp and Grouper) with Serrano Chiles, Mango, Smoked Tomatoes, Crispy Plantain Chips 1 pound fresh grouper or pink snapper, skinned and cut in half lengthwise, then cut into small dice 12 large cooked shrimp, shelled, deveined and halved 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 1/2 cup fresh orange juice 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro, plus leaves for garnish<br> 1 or 2 serrano chiles, finely diced depending on how spicy you like 1 small ripe mango, peeled, halved, pitted and finely diced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving 1/4 cup Pickled Red Onions, recipe follows, for garnish Lime zest, for garnish Crisp plantain chips, for garnish 1 pint grape tomatoes 1 tablespoon canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, for seasoning 1 1/2 cups red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon mustard seeds Kosher salt<br> 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced Instructions: Place the grouper and shrimp in a large bowl. Toss with the lime and orange juice and let stand for 30 minutes. Strain the grouper and shrimp and place in a separate bowl.<br> Add the Cold-Smoked Grape Tomatoes, cilantro, onions, chiles, mango, salt and pepper and toss gently to combine. Drizzle with the olive oil and toss.<br> Place the ceviche on a serving platter or on individual plates. Drizzle with a bit more olive oil. Garnish with Pickled Red Onions, lime zest and plantain chips. Put a handful of hot coals in the bottom of a smoker. Scatter the hickory chips over the top. Put a try of ice on the bottom grate. Put the cooking grate above the ice tray. When the temperature of the smoker reaches 100 degrees F, toss the tomatoes with the canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes on the top grate. Close the smoker and smoke the tomatoes for 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how smoky you want them. Bring the vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil in a small saucepan and cook until the sugar and salt dissolves, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool for 10 minutes. Add the onions and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 4319,&quot;Vegan Rosca de Reyes One 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon vegan granulated cane sugar 1/2 cup oat milk, such as low-fat Oatly 4 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 cup vegan butter, at room temperature, plus more for the bowl 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce Zest of 2 medium navel oranges 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup vegan butter, at room temperature 1/3 cup vegan granulated cane sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 12 to 14 strips candied orange peel (see Cook&#39;s Note) 6 to 8 dried figs 6 to 8 maraschino cherries 1 teaspoon oat milk 1 teaspoon maple syrup or agave syrup Instructions: For the dough: First, bring your yeast to life by mixing the yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 tablespoon flour in a bowl with a spoon or whisk. In a small pot, warm up your oat milk to around 100 degrees F. Add the warm oat milk to the yeast mixture and stir until there are no lumps left. Let it sit and expand. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl) begin to toss in your dry ingredients for your rosca dough. This includes the remaining 4 cups all-purpose flour, the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, salt and cinnamon. Mix using your electric mixer or by hand using muscle power.<br> Once your dry ingredients are combined, mix your apple cider vinegar and baking soda together in a small bowl; this will give your bread more airiness. Now you can begin to incorporate your wet ingredients. Add the vinegar mixture, 3/4 cup vegan butter, applesauce, orange zest, vanilla and the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl and you can form a ball, 5 to 10 minutes. If the mixture is too wet, add a little flour until the desired texture is achieved. The dough should not stick to your hands.<br> Remove from the machine and knead it with your hands to ensure it is fully incorporated and transfer to a large, lightly buttered mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let the dough rest somewhere warm until it has about doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. I like to turn my oven on now, to 350 degrees F, so that the warmth from the oven radiates out and helps proof my dough. (You can also turn your oven on at a later time if you have a warm enough place to let your dough rest.)\u202fWhile you wait, get started on your sugar paste and prep your toppings.<br> For the sugar paste: Using your electric mixer and paddle attachment, mix your flour, butter, sugar and vanilla on low until you can form a ball, 3 to 5 minutes. Don\u2019t expect it to be firm, it should be soft to the touch and pliable. If you\u2019d like to make the paste a bit firmer, put in the fridge to chill slightly until you\u2019re ready to decorate your rosca after its second proofing.<br> Prepare your sugar strips once you\u2019re ready with 1 to 2 tablespoons of sugar paste. Roll out rectangular strips, about 1 inch wide and 3 inches long, tenderly with a light glass cup or small rolling pin, pressing lightly to flatten \u2013\u2013 you\u2019re not going for paper thin, give them a little bit of thickness, about 3 to 4 millimeters, and finish by cutting the edges clean with a sharp knife. Repeat the process to make 6 to 8 strips.\u202f<br> For the toppings: Gather the topping ingredients. Cut your dried figs in half, slicing them lengthwise from the tip to the base, exposing the inside. Drain 6 to 8 maraschino cherries and let them sit on a paper towel to absorb excess moisture, this will help your bread stay dry wherever you decide to place the cherries.\u202f After the dough has risen, use your hands to gently stretch it out on a clean, unfloured surface as if massaging it, section by section, into a log approximately 2 inches thick and 30 to 40 inches long. It needn\u2019t be perfectly smooth as long as the shape is right. Connect the opposing ends by placing one side about three to four inches over the other to form an oval shape, sealing it as best you can using your hands and distributing the weight so it\u2019s even all around. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and place your dough on it to let it rest and proof again for another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Again, don\u2019t expect your dough to look completely smooth, it\u2019ll be a little wonky and that\u2019s okay. If you didn\u2019t preheat your oven before, do so now, to 350 degrees F. For the vegan \egg\ wash: Once your dough has proofed, beat the oat milk and maple syrup in a small bowl and brush all over your rosca. To decorate, lay down your sugar paste strips first as symmetrically as possible, leaving about 2 inches between each strip. Then frame the sugar paste arches with your thin strips of candied orange peel (or quince paste) on both sides. Place the figs, cut-side up, and set them with a light press. Lightly press a shallow indentation with your index finger or thumb into the dough to set the cherries in place.\u202f<br> Finally, slide your rosca into the oven and bake until golden on the bottom and nearly doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes. Let it sit for about 1 hour on a cooling rack before enjoying, but I find it\u2019s best if left overnight.\u202f Once fully cooled, gently stick the plastic babies into the rosca from the bottom, piercing through the bread. Leave at least 3 inches of space between babies.\u202f<br> Enjoy your rosca de reyes with a warm cup of champurrado or cool glass of rompope. And remember, the first person to find a baby must make the tamales on February 2nd \u2013\u2013 or not. At the very least, say you will\u2013\u2013it\u2019s kind of our thing. Salud! &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 4320,&quot;Potato Latkes 2 pounds potatoes 2 large eggs Salt Oil for frying Instructions: Peel and finely grate the potatoes. Put them straight into cold water, then drain and squeeze them as dry as you can by pressing them with your hands in a colander. This is to remove the starchy liquid, which could make the latkes soggy. Beat the eggs lightly with salt, add to the potatoes, and stir well. Film the bottom of a frying pan with oil and heat. Take serving-spoonfuls, or as much as 1/4 cup, of the mixture, and drop into the hot oil. Flatten a little, and lower the heat so that the fritters cook through evenly. When one side is brown, turn over and brown the other.
