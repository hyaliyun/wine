Drain and shock in ice water. Drain and set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter and sugar together. Stir in mustard, honey, and carrots. Bring to a simmer and toss to combine. Add chopped thyme, salt, and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 69326,&quot;Whole-Wheat Apple Pancakes 1 cup low-fat buttermilk 3/4 cup nonfat milk 2 large eggs 1 tablespoon honey 6 tablespoons pure maple syrup 1 medium apple, diced 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 cup whole-wheat four 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250. Put the apple in a microwave-safe bowl and tightly cover with plastic wrap; microwave on high until softened, about 2 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk the flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a small bowl, whisk the buttermilk, nonfat milk, eggs and honey, then slowly add the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Heat a large nonstick griddle or skillet over medium heat. Spoon 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle for each pancake and sprinkle each with apple, then drizzle a little more batter over the apple. Cook until the tops are bubbly and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 more minutes. Keep the pancakes warm on a baking sheet in the oven while making the rest. Place 2 pancakes on each plate. Drizzle with the syrup. Recipe adapted from Ellie Krieger&#39;s book, So Easy: Luscious Healthy Recipes for Every Meal of the Week (Wiley) &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69327,&quot;Caesar Salad 1 egg yolk* 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 anchovy fillets, mashed Scant 1 cup vegetable oil 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large head romaine lettuce, cleaned and cut into 1 to 2-inch pieces Freshly grated Parmesan 2 cups croutons Instructions: In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, lemon juice, garlic, Worcestershire, pepper flakes, mustard, and anchovies. Slowly whisk in the oils to emulsify. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Place the lettuce in a large bowl. Sprinkle with Parmesan and black pepper. Drizzle with desired amount of dressing and toss well. Sprinkle top with croutons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69328,&quot;Italian Soba Noodle Salad 3 tablespoons mirin 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons light soy sauce 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 9 ounces dried soba noodles Few dashes sesame oil 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 6 shiitake mushrooms, sliced 1 teaspoon light soy sauce 6 sun-dried tomatoes, sliced 1/4 cup sliced kalamata olives 2 tablespoons peanuts, toasted and very finely chopped Large handful arugula leaves Instructions: For the dressing: In a small bowl, combine the mirin, olive oil, soy sauce and vinegar and mix well. For the salad: Cook the noodles according to the instructions on the packet. Drain and refresh under cold water, then add a few dashes of sesame oil to keep them from sticking and set aside. Heat a wok over high heat and add the vegetable oil. Add the garlic and mushrooms and stir-fry until the mushrooms begin to soften, 1 to 2 minutes (adding a splash of water if necessary to facilitate cooking). Season with the light soy sauce and remove from the heat. In a large serving bowl, add the noodles, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Toss, and then pour the rice vinegar dressing over the salad. The dish is best kept refrigerated and served chilled. When ready to serve, sprinkle with ground peanuts and arugula. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 69329,&quot;Spinach, Pear and Chicken Salad 1 large skinless, boneless chicken breast (about 12 ounces) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1/3 cup dried cranberries 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard 8 cups baby spinach (about 5 ounces) 4 endives, cut lengthwise into thin wedges 1/3 cup almonds, toasted and roughly chopped 1 pear, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 cup shredded gruyere cheese Instructions: Slice the chicken breast in half horizontally to make 2 thin cutlets; season with salt and pepper. Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until lightly golden and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool, then thinly slice.<br> Meanwhile, combine the cranberries, vinegar and 1 tablespoon water in a small microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave 45 seconds to plump the cranberries. Let cool.<br> Whisk the cranberry-vinegar mixture, lemon juice, mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a slow stream until blended. Add the chicken, spinach, endives, almonds, pear, about half of the cheese, and salt and pepper to taste; toss to combine. Divide among bowls and top with the remaining cheese.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69330,&quot;Three-bean Soup with Turkey Meatballs and Dijon Mustard Dumplings 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 1 large onion, diced (2 cups) 1 large carrot, diced 2 sticks celery, diced 2 quarts beef stock 1/2 cup orange lentils 1/3 cup barley 1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed 1 can roman beans, drained and rinsed 1 recipe Turkey Meatballs, recipe follows 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 3/4 cup water 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, diced (about 3/4 cup) 2 cups dry broken-up white bread 1 cup milk 1 pound ground turkey meat 2 large eggs, well beaten 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup golden raisins, hydrated in warm water 1/2 cup pine nuts, slightly toasted Flour 1 cup vegetable oil Instructions: Add the olive oil and butter in a Dutch oven and place over medium heat. Saute the onions, carrots and celery for 5 minutes. In a saucepan add beef stock and bring to the boil on a medium heat, once the vegetables have softened add the simmering stock to the Dutch oven. (We should never add a cold liquid to an already heated pot as it dramatically drops the heat and slows down the cooking process.) As the stock is at temperature, add the lentils, barley and stir the broth. Place the lid back on and let the mixture cook for 5 minutes. Then add the drained and rinsed beans and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Add the browned turkey meatballs to the stock. Meanwhile, begin making your dumplings. In a mixing bowl add the flour, salt, baking powder and Dijon mustard. Sparingly add the water to the mixture and fold mixture until it forms a dough. With 2 tablespoons mold your dumplings 2 inches in diameter then drop them into the already simmering turkey meatballs and bean soup. Cook together for an additional 25 minutes with the lid on. Once the dumplings have risen and expanded, serve! In a heated skillet add olive oil and onions. Slightly cook them for about 5 minutes (we want the onions softened not colored). Place into a bowl and let cool. Take the 2 cups of broken up bread and place into a bowl with the milk. Let the bread soak for 5 minutes. Squeeze and drain the bread then place it into a large mixing bowl. Add the turkey meat, beaten eggs, chopped parsley, salt, black pepper, golden raisins and toasted pine nuts. Fold all ingredients together. Do not over work the turkey meat. Fill a Dutch oven with vegetable oil and place on low heat. Dust a baking sheet with about an inch of flour. In your hands scoop up a two-finger portion of the turkey mixture and with the palm of your hands shape the balls a little larger than a golf ball. As you make the balls add them to the baking tray with the flour and roll them until evenly coated. Carefully add the meatballs to the oil and brown for about 6 minutes. Transfer turkey meatballs to a plate and set aside for bean soup. Pour excess oil into a bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69331,&quot;Smooth Poblano Salsa 2 fresh poblano chiles, stemmed, seeded, and chopped 2 fresh jalapeno chiles, stemmed but chopped with seeds 1 fresh serrano cl, stemmed but chopped with seeds 2 large or 3 small ripe Hass avocados, peeled and pitted 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, both leaves and stems included 3 green onions, chopped with green tops included 2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce 1 tablespoon salt 1/2 tablespoon granulated garlic 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 cup water Instructions: Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Add additional water if needed for smoothness. This salsa is a delicate green and smooth, but it is not tame! Adjust types and amounts of hot peppers, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 69332,&quot;Classic Coleslaw 1 small head green cabbage 1/2 small head red cabbage<br> 3/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/4 cup white wine vinegar, such as Chardonnay<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> 2 teaspoons celery seeds<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup matchstick carrots<br> 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves<br> Instructions: Remove and discard tough outer leaves from the green cabbage. Cut the head in half, cutting through the core. Use the tip of the knife to remove the core from both halves, then cut each half into quarters. Slice each quarter thinly into short strips. Repeat with the red cabbage and place both in a large bowl. Whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar and celery seeds in a small bowl, then season with salt and pepper. Add more sugar as desired. Toss the cabbage with half the dressing, then lay in a shallow dish (a 9-by-13-inch baking dish works well). Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Once cabbage has marinated in the dressing, taste and add reserved dressing as desired.

Coat two 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray. Prepare the cake mix as directed; divide the batter between the pans and bake as directed. Let cool 15 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool completely. Trim the domed tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level. Spread frosting on one cake layer, then invert the other layer on top. Spread a thin layer of frosting around the outside of the cake and on top. Reserve 1/4 cup frosting for the wasabi. Melt the candy melts in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth. Add the cereal and stir. Mark a 3 1/2-inch circle in the middle of the cake with a paring knife. Arrange the dried mango in half of the circle, trimming as needed. Toss the apple with the lemon juice and arrange cut-side up next to the dried mango, pushing it into the cake. Wrap a 5-by-26-inch strip of parchment around the cake so that it is slightly taller than the cake. Spread the cereal mixture around the apple and dried mango (the parchment will create a wall for the cereal mixture). Refrigerate the cake. To make the seaweed, microwave the marshmallows and 1/4 cup water in a bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Transfer to a stand mixer. Beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar with the paddle attachment, then gradually beat in the cocoa powder until smooth. Beat in the butter. Dust a piece of parchment with cocoa powder and roll the chocolate mixture into a 5-by-26-inch strip. Trim the long sides to make them straight. Remove the parchment from the cake. Carefully wrap the chocolate strip around the cake, making sure the top of the strip aligns with the top of the cereal mixture. Trim the bottom edge so it&#39;s flush with the bottom of the cake. If the strip tears, just press it back together. Transfer the cake to a board. For the wasabi, tint the reserved frosting with green food coloring and freeze until stiff, 15 minutes; scoop onto the board. For the pickled ginger, flatten the Starburst candies, shape into curvy pieces and place on the board. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 69342,&quot;Turbo Broccoli Cheddar Soup 2 tablespoons butter 1 head broccoli, stems and florets separated and chopped 1/2 small yellow onion, diced<br> 2 teaspoons dry mustard Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons dry sherry<br> 1 cup chicken stock<br> 2 cups fresh spinach<br> 1 cup grated sharp Cheddar 1/4 cup heavy cream, plus more if needed 1 teaspoon hot sauce Croutons, for serving<br> Instructions: Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat.

Beat together the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer starting on low and increasing speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl down as needed. Beat in the molasses until combined, then the egg. (The mixture will look curdled.) Turn to low speed and beat in the flour mixture a little at a time until the mixture comes together, then increase speed and beat until all of the ingredients are well incorporated and you have a sticky dough. Divide the dough in half, flatten into 2 disks and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least two hours and up to overnight. Position 2 racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Keeping the other disk refrigerated, roll one disk to an 1/8-inch thickness on a well-floured surface, sprinkling flour on and under the dough as needed and sliding a spatula underneath every so often to prevent sticking. If the dough looks crackly or breaks apart, press it back together from the outside edge in. With a 4-inch gingerbread man cookie cutter, cut out gingerbread people as close together on the dough as possible. Pull away the extra dough around each shape and use a small spatula to transfer the people to the prepared cookie sheets about 1 inch apart. Gather together the scraps, leaving behind the excess flour, and knead them a few times to form a smooth dough again. Reroll them in the same way. (If there are any pieces of dough stuck on your surface, scrape them away with a spatula, flour the surface again and then continue to roll the dough.) Check to see if the cutter fits inside the mugs. If the legs are too wide, gently push the legs of the dough cut-outs closer together to make them fit. Freeze the cookies to firm them, about 15 minutes. Bake the cookies in the center of the oven racks, rotating the sheets from top to bottom and also turning them 180 degrees around halfway through baking, until they are slightly firm to the touch but not brown, about 12 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Cool the cookies 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely before icing. The cookies will continue to firm as they cool. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons water and beat with a hand mixer on low speed until the frosting thickens. The icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. (If the frosting is overbeaten, it will get aerated, which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit for a bit to settle, then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the icing.) Separate the icing into bowls and color as desired. Put the icing into piping bags or resealable plastic bags and snip the corners to the desired size. Use the icing to decorate the cookies, piping on bathing suits and sunglasses. Pipe a little white icing on the widest end of each gumdrop to make a drink with foam. Dot some icing on 1 hand of each gingerbread person and press the drink into the dot to make it stick. Let the cookies set at room temperature, at least 1 hour. For the hot chocolate: Combine the milk, cocoa powder, sugar, molasses, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar, cocoa powder and spices are dissolved and the milk is steaming, about 5 minutes. Do not let the mixture come to a boil. Whisk in the chopped chocolate a little at a time until smooth. To serve, divide the hot chocolate among 6 to 8 mugs. Insert a gingerbread person with its arms resting on the rim. Add whipped cream and marshmallows as bubbles in the hot tubs. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 69384,&quot;Bulgur Wheat with Pineapple, Pecans and Basil 2 cups water 1 cup bulgur 1 can (20 oz.)

Mix until everything is well mixed. Season, to taste, with salt. If using right away, keep the butter at room temperature. If making ahead, reserve in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before using. Preheat grill to medium. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature. Season with salt and coat with olive oil. Brush and oil the grill. Place the salmon, skin side down, on the clean, preheated grill. After 2 to 3 minutes, rotate the salmon 90 degrees to create cross-hatch grill marks on the salmon skin. Cook the salmon for another 3 to 4 minutes. As the salmon cooks it will turn from translucent orange to opaque pink. Turn the salmon over and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. If the salmon starts to burn, or the flames flare up move the fish to a cooler part of the grill.* Remove from the grill and top with the room temperature compound butter. The butter should act as a sauce and melt over and coat the grilled salmon. What a delish fish! *Tip: It is a general rule to cook fish for 8 minutes per inch of thickness.

F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the milk, peanut butter and chickpea flour in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix until smooth (or mix the dough by hand). Roll out the dough on a floured surface until about 1/4 inch thick. Cut out 24 squares using a 2 1/2-inch fluted square cutter. Prick each square with a fork in 2 places to resemble a graham cracker and to allow steam to escape. Arrange the dough squares on the baking sheet and bake 18 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake until the graham crackers are golden brown around the edges, 4 to 10 more minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheet. Make the carob filling: Combine the carob chips and vegetable oil in a bowl. Melt in the microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring. (Keep an eye on it \u2014 carob burns faster than chocolate.) Spread about 1 tablespoon of the melted carob mixture on the underside of 12 of the crackers, spreading it almost to the edges. Let cool and harden. Make the marshmallow filling: Mix the gelatin powder with the water in a small microwave-safe bowl and set aside until fully bloomed, 3 to 5 minutes. Microwave the mixture until pourable, 10 to 15 seconds. Clean out the mixer. Beat the egg whites in the mixer with the whisk attachment on medium speed until foamy.

Combine all the butter, herbs and lemon juice ingredients in a medium-large bowl, and, using a rubber spatula, mix until well combined. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. On a work surface, spread out a piece of plastic wrap, about 10 inches long. Put the herb butter across the bottom center of the plastic wrap, and form into a log-like shape, about 4 inches long. Fold the bottom edge of the plastic wrap over the butter and roll the enclosed butter forward until completely wrapped, to form a tube about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Twist the ends together, like a party favor, and freeze until very firm. Prepare the chicken. On a work surface, place 1 breast half between 2 layers of plastic wrap or wax paper and, using a meat-tenderizing mallet, pound to a 1/4-inch thickness. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Unwrap the butter and cut lengthwise into four equal pieces. Lay out each breast half and season both sides assertively with salt and pepper. Place 1 piece of butter across the bottom center of each breast. Fold the bottom edge of a breast over the butter, fold in the sides, and roll the just enclosed butter forward until completely wrapped, to form a tight rolled package. Repeat with the remaining breasts. In a large bowl, whisk together the breadcrumbs, 1 teaspoon salt, and the thyme and season generously with pepper. Place the flour and eggs in separate flat bottomed bowls or lipped plates. Working with one chicken roll at a time, dredge it in the flour, dip in the egg, and roll in the breadcrumb mixture. Shake off the excess. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 12.

Slice a thin sliver off the narrow end of each egg so the eggs can stand upright when plated. Cut off the wide end of each egg and use a small spoon or the tip of a butter knife to gently scoop out the egg yolk into a mini food processor or mixing bowl. Process the yolks (or smash with a fork). Add the mayonnaise, vinegar, salt and pepper and mix until smooth. Spoon or pipe the yolk filling into the egg white cups. Place the egg white cups upright on a serving platter. Sprinkle a pinch of paprika on top of the yolks. Finish each egg with a sprig of fresh dill. Serve chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69400,&quot;Basic Bruschetta 1 round loaf country bread, not too dense 6 cloves of garlic, peeled and cut in half 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil Instructions: Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire. Cut the middle portion of the round loaf into 6 long slices, each one almost an inch thick. Cut these slices in half, making half-slices that are roughly 3x3x1 inches. When fire is ready, place the 12 slices over it in a single layer. Cook, turning once, until the outsides of the bread are golden brown (with grill marks, if possible). This should take about 2 minutes per side-but check frequently to make sure the bread isn&#39;t burning. When the bread slices are done, rub the edges of each one, on both sides, with a cut clove of garlic-lightly or heavily, depending on your garlic preference. Place the slices on a large platter in a single layer. Sprinkle each slice with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, breaking the surface of the bread lightly with a spoon to let the oil soak in. Season with salt and pepper. Turn the slices over and repeat the procedure. Let the slices sit in the olive oil for 10-15 minutes. Serve as is for simple bruschetta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69401,&quot;Cranberry Kir 2 ounces cranberry juice 1 tablespoon smooth cranberry sauce 2 teaspoons honey Juice from 1/2 lemon 16 ounces Champagne or sparkling wine Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the cranberry juice and the cranberry sauce and whisk until fully blended. If too thick to mix with the Champagne, thin it out slightly with a little more cranberry juice. Stir in the honey and the lemon juice.<br> Divide the cranberry mixture between 4 glasses and pour in the Champagne, stirring with a spoon as you pour so the cranberry integrates and doesn&#39;t just sit on the bottom of the glasses. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Prosecco, Cava]&quot; 69402,&quot;Halloween Extra-Dark Hot Cocoa Black and orange nonpareils, for coating 2 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate, plus more for melting 4 cups milk 2/3 cup sugar 2/3 cup black cocoa powder Pinch salt Instructions: Place the nonpareils on a shallow plate.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Trim the stem ends from the Brussels sprouts, and halve lengthwise. Put them in a medium bowl, and toss with 1 teaspoon salt. Lay the bacon strips next to each other on a work surface. Brush liberally with about 1/2 the maple syrup, then halve crosswise. Wrap each Brussels sprout half with 1 strip of bacon, syrup-side out, so the seam is on the flat side. Place the sprouts seam-side down on the parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, leaving a bit of space between them. Brush them with a bit more syrup, and grind a little black pepper on top. Roast, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until the bacon is crisp and the sprouts are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the mayonnaise, most of the lemon zest and all the lemon juice in a small serving dish. Sprinkle the remaining lemon zest on top. Put about 1/2 cup maple syrup in a second small serving dish, and stir in as much black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes as you like.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself.<br> Cut a piece of 2 colors. Make into 2 big cigars. Combine the 2 colors by twisting them around each other. Roll to a thickness of about 1/2-inch. Use the scissors to cut the pieces of candy from the end. Cut a 1/2-inch piece, give the roll a half turn, cut again and continue until you&#39;ve used the whole roll. Be careful the candy does not touch the other pieces or it will stick together. That&#39;s Berlingot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69411,&quot;EJ&#39;s Simple Oven-BBQ Ribs 2 racks baby back ribs 6 tablespoons Emeril&#39;s Rustic Rub, recipe follows 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon celery salt Emeril&#39;s Bam B Q Sweet Original Barbecue Sauce 8 tablespoons paprika 3 tablespoons cayenne 5 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 6 tablespoons garlic powder 3 tablespoons onion powder 6 tablespoons salt 2 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano 2 1/2 tablespoons dried thyme Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with a piece of aluminum foil large enough to cover the pan twice (you will be folding this over the ribs and sealing.) Place the ribs on the prepared baking sheet in 1 layer. In a small bowl, combine the Rib Rub, salt, pepper, and celery salt and stir to combine. Divide the seasoning evenly among both slabs of ribs, coating well on both sides. Fold the sides of the foil over the ribs and seal tightly on all sides. Place the ribs in the oven and bake, undisturbed, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until ribs are very tender. Remove the ribs from the oven and peel back the foil so that the ribs are exposed. Using a pastry brush or the back of a spoon, coat the racks lightly on the meaty sides with barbecue sauce. Return to the oven until sauce is thickened and lightly browned, about 20 minutes longer. Remove the ribs from the oven and set aside to cool briefly before cutting between the ribs and serving. Serve with more barbecue sauce, if desired.

Salt and pepper the ribs, then dredge them in the flour. Set aside. In a large Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until completely crispy and all the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon and set aside. Drain off any excess fat. Add the olive oil to the pan with the bacon fat and raise the heat to high. Brown the ribs on all sides, about 45 seconds per side. Remove the ribs and set aside. Lower the heat to medium. Add the carrots, shallots and onions to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Splash in the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan to release all the flavorful bits of glory. Add the broth, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper and bring to a boil. Taste and add more salt if needed. Add the ribs to the liquid; they should be almost completely submerged. Add the thyme and rosemary sprigs (whole) to the liquid. Finally, add the cooked bacon. Put on a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook until the ribs are fork-tender and falling off the bone, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove the pan from the oven and allow to sit for at least 20 minutes with the lid on before serving. At the last minute, skim the fat off the top of the liquid. (You can also refrigerate the mixture, then remove the solid fat from the top.) For each serving, arrange 2 ribs on a bed of the grits, spooning a little juice over the top. Cook the grits according to the package instructions, adding the salt with the water. Turn off the heat just before the grits are done. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs. To temper the eggs before adding them to the hot grits, throw a couple of spoonfuls of the hot grits into the eggs. Begin stirring immediately and continue stirring until the mixture is well combined. Pour the egg mixture into the grits. Stir constantly to incorporate the eggs into the grits. Add the butter and stir until melted. Next, add the cheese and stir until melted. Add the cayenne and garlic and stir well to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt or cayenne if necessary. You could also add more cheese if you think that will bring happiness to your life, but keep in mind that some cheeses increase the salt content more than others. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and pour the grits into the dish. Bake until the grits are hot and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. The grits will become firmer as they cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah]&quot; 69419,&quot;Red Grape Soup 4 quarts seedless red grapes 1 vanilla bean 1 cinnamon stick 1 teaspoon star anise 1 orange, peeled and juiced 1 lemon, peeled and juiced 1 lime, peeled and juiced 1 cup spring water 2 cups cranberry juice 1 cup champagne Simple syrup (equal ratio sugar to water), to taste Pomegranate seeds, to garnish Instructions: In a large pot place the grapes, vanilla bean, and bouquet garni made from the cinnamon, anise, and zests.

Cut off a small flat piece of rind from the bottom of each half so the watermelon is stable, then stand each half flesh-side up. Use a ratcheting pineapple corer to remove the central flesh from each half; the remaining flesh will help the liquor bottles fit snugly. (Reserve the cored flesh for another use.) Use a paring knife to make zigzag cuts around the edges of the watermelon bowls. Freeze each watermelon half until solid, 6 hours or up to overnight. For the garnish bowls: Set a watermelon on its side (stem end facing left or right) and cut the watermelon in half crosswise. Cut off a small flat piece of rind from the bottom of each half so the watermelon is stable.<br> Insert an immersion blender into the flesh. Gently push and move the immersion blender down and around in the watermelon to puree the center. As more of the watermelon becomes pureed, move the blender to the sides to puree almost all of the flesh, leaving a thin wall of flesh lining the rind. Strain the juice into a large bowl. Repeat the process with the remaining watermelons. Reserve the strained juice.<br> Use a paring knife to make zigzag cuts around the edges of the watermelon bowls. Pat the watermelon bowls dry with paper towels and set aside.<br> For the Bloody Mary mixer: Set the remaining 20-pound watermelon on its side (stem end facing left or right) and cut off a small flat piece of rind from the bottom so that the watermelon is stable lying on its side.

Beat the oil and egg together and mix into the flour. Slowly add the water while stirring until a ball of dough forms. Dust a clean work surface with some flour. Knead the dough intensely until it is smooth and silky. Lay a large smooth kitchen towel on a clean work surface and generously flour the towel. Place the dough in middle of the towel and roll out into a large thin rectangle. Brush the dough with some butter and sprinkle with the breadcrumbs to cover the entire dough surface.<br> For the apples: Put the apples into a large bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar and cinnamon and gently toss to mix well.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Brush a baking sheet with butter and set aside. Place the long side of the dough closest to you. Mound the apples into a log along the bottom edge of the rectangle, leaving about a 2-inch border from the sides and the edge of the dough closest to you. Roll up the strudel jelly-roll style using the towel as an aid and beginning at the edge closest to you. Gently tuck in the sides and transfer the strudel seam-side down to the baking sheet. Brush generously with butter. Bake until lightly golden, 50 to 60 minutes.<br> Let the apple strudel cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing.

Transfer steak to the marinade and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes or in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours. Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium-high heat and brush with olive oil. Cook the steak, turning occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest on a plate covered with aluminum foil for 10 minutes. Cut the meat against the grain into 1/2-inch pieces. On the same griddle used to cook the steak, over medium-high heat, place 3 (1/4 cup) mounds of cheese spaced 2 inches apart. Let cook for 3 minutes (the cheese will spread flat like a tortilla, make sure they don&#39;t stick together). After the cheese browns on the bottom (the cheese will stay white on the top side), add 1/4 cup sliced meat over half of the cheese and fold the other half over like a half moon-shaped quesadilla. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Repeat the procedure with the remaining ingredients. Serve each cheese taco with sliced avocado and salsa or hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 69451,&quot;Champagne Cake Cooking spray 1 box (1-pound 2 1/4-ounce) moist white cake mix 1 1/4 cups extra dry Champagne 1/3 cup vegetable oil 3 large egg whites 1 can whipped white frosting 1/4 teaspoon Champagne flavoring Silver mini disco balls, optional Silver Dragees, optional, if available in your area Silver edible glitter, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat the bottom of a 9 by-13-inch cake pan with cooking spray. In a large mixing bowl combine the cake mix, Champagne, vegetable oil, and egg whites. Beat on low speed with an electric mixer until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and continue beating on medium speed for 2 minutes.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the oil, sugar and eggs. Combine the wet and dry ingredients in one bowl and splash in the buttermilk. Stir until just combined. The mixture will be slightly lumpy. Pour into the prepared pots (or 9-by-13-inch pan if using) and put them on a baking sheet. Bake until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes; do not over bake. (If using a 9-by-13-inch pan, bake for 25 to 30 minutes.) For the icing: While the cake is baking, make the icing. Combine the sugar, buttermilk, butter, corn syrup, baking soda, vanilla and salt in a medium saucepan. Stir to combine. Bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat without stirring. Continue boiling until the icing turns a light caramel color, 5 to 7 minutes. Important: The icing should be the color of caramel, but not yet firm and sticky. It needs to be pourable. Remove the cakes from the oven. While they are very warm, pour the icing evenly over the tops. Work fast, as it will quickly start to soak into the cakes. Serve with ice cream if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69466,&quot;Spiced Avocado Toast with Citrus-Cured Salmon and Poached Egg 4 ounces kosher salt 2 ounces granulated sugar 1 tablespoon lemon extract 1 tablespoon lime extract One 1 1/2-pound skinless salmon fillet 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar 2 teaspoons paprika 1 teaspoon garlic powder 4 large eggs Sea salt 2 cups arugula or other mixed greens 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon capers 2 teaspoons dried oregano<br> 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon dried thyme Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 slices bread, from a whole-wheat sourdough boule 2 ripe avocados 2 teaspoons lime juice<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, such as chervil, chives, cilantro or parsley 2 tablespoons poppy seeds 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds, toasted 1 tablespoon dried minced onion, toasted 2 teaspoons dried minced garlic, toasted 1 teaspoon pretzel salt or other coarse salt 1/4 cup olive oil 1/8 teaspoon lemon extract 1/8 teaspoon lime extract Instructions: For the salmon: In a bowl, whisk together the salt, sugar, lemon and lime extracts. Lay an 18-inch-long piece of plastic wrap on a work surface. Mound half of the seasoning mixture in the center of the plastic wrap and press it into a rectangle slightly bigger than the piece of salmon. Place the salmon on top of the mixture and cover with the remaining mixture. Wrap tightly in the plastic and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Remove the salmon from the cure and quickly rinse under cold water. Pat dry and refrigerate until ready to serve. For the spice-poached eggs: In a shallow dish, combine the vinegar, paprika and garlic powder and whisk until dissolved. Carefully crack the eggs into the dish with the vinegar and let stand 5 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a wide pot approximately 3 inches deep with water. Bring the water to a simmer and season to taste with salt. Adjust the heat so the water maintains a simmer. Carefully lift the eggs from the vinegar mixture with a slotted spoon and place into the simmering water. Cook the eggs until just firm, 3 to 4 minutes. Lift eggs out with a slotted spoon and gently blot with clean paper towels to remove excess moisture. Serve immediately or transfer to ice water to hold (see Cook&#39;s Note). For the arugula salsa verde: Combine the arugula, oil, capers, oregano, vinegar, garlic and thyme in a food processor and pulse to chop well, but do not puree it. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the toast: Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over both sides of the bread slices. Toast or grill the bread until lightly browned on both sides, but still tender and soft in the center. Set the toast on a rack to cool. Meanwhile, cut the avocados in half and carefully remove the pits. Scoop the flesh from the skin and place in a mixing bowl. Add the lime juice, garlic powder, salt and remaining tablespoon olive oil. Mash the avocado with a fork until well mixed, but not smooth. Fold in the herbs. For the everything spice mix: Stir together the poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion, garlic and salt in a small bowl and set aside. For serving: Stir together the olive oil and the lemon and lime extracts in a small bowl and mix thoroughly. Cut the salmon into slices approximately 1/4-inch thick. Lightly brush the slices with the oil and pound lightly with the side of the knife to thin them out. Divide the avocado mixture equally among the slices of toast and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle each with the everything spice mixture. Top half of the toast with the some of the sliced salmon and the other half with the spice-poached eggs and arugula salsa verde. Cut each slice in half and serve. Reserve any leftover salmon for another use; it will keep wrapped in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 69467,&quot;Whole Roasted Garlic 1 head garlic Olive oil Instructions: Cut off the top quarter of the garlic with a sharp knife. Place garlic in the middle of a large piece of foil, and drizzle with oil. Crimp the foil around the garlic. Enclose foil completely. Bake in the middle of a preheated 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69468,&quot;Roasted Vegetable Sandwiches 1 acorn squash, halved, seeded and sliced into 1/2-inch-thick half moons (leave the skin on) 1 pound rainbow baby carrots (about 16), halved lengthwise if large 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 7.5-ounce container chive-and-onion cream cheese 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill 8 slices multigrain bread 4 cups baby spinach 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 cup pickled beets (about 6 ounces), drained and sliced 1/4 inch thick Instructions: Place a baking sheet in the upper third of the oven and another in the lower third; preheat to 450?. Toss the squash, carrots, olive oil, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Put the squash on one of the baking sheets and the carrots on the other, spreading the vegetables in a single layer. Roast, switching the pans halfway through, until the vegetables are lightly browned and tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the cream cheese with the dill in a small bowl. A few minutes before the vegetables are done, toast the bread, then spread with the cream cheese mixture. Toss the spinach with the vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Lay out 4 slices of bread, cream cheese\u2013side up. Top each with a layer of beets, then the squash, carrots, spinach and another slice of bread. Cut in half. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 69469,&quot;Phyllo Chips with Lemon Curd Dip 2 large eggs 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 lemon, zested 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped 3 sheets thawed phyllo dough 4 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted 6 tablespoons sugar Instructions: Lemon curd: Bring 2 inches of water to a simmer in a large saucepan. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk the eggs and sugar together until very light yellow and fluffy. Whisk in the lemon juice and lemon zest. Rest the mixing bowl in the saucepan, with the bowl&#39;s base above the simmering water (pour out some of the water if necessary). Cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is thickened and custardy, about 15 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the butter. Let cool, cover, and refrigerate until cold. Fold in the whipped cream. Phyllo triangles: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on the pan and brush with melted butter. Sprinkle evenly with 2 tablespoons of sugar, then place another sheet of phyllo on top. Brush with melted butter, sprinkle with sugar, lay another sheet of phyllo on top, brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with sugar. With a small sharp knife, cut the stacked phyllo into rows, then cut the rows into triangles, making about 36 triangles. Cover with parchment paper. To keep the phyllo from buckling during baking, place a pan on top of the parchment paper that is slightly smaller to weight it down. Bake until the phyllo is golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool between the pans. To assemble the dessert, place a spoonful of the lightened lemon curd on 8 plates or place it in a bowl in the center of a serving platter. Stick 3 to 4 phyllo triangles in the curd decoratively or just place them in a ring around the bowl of lemon curd. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 69470,&quot;Mille-Feuille of Foie Gras and Pain d&#39;epice with Spiced Red Wine and Poached Pear 1 pound 2 ounces foie gras, deveined 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon Madeira 1/2 teaspoon cognac 1/4 teaspoon pink salt 1/4 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper 1 cup egg whites 2/3 cup flour 2/3 cup butter, softened 1 3/4 tablespoons gingerbread spice 1 tablespoon baking soda 2 cups honey 8 cups medium-bodied red wine 4 cups port 2 1/4 cups honey 1/2 cup sugar 2 cups simple syrup, made by boiling 1 1/2 cups sugar with 1 1/2 cups water for 3 minutes 3 vanilla beans 1 stick cinnamon 3 pieces star anise 1/2 teaspoon gingerbread spice Zest from 1 orange 4 Seckel pears, peeled and core removed Mache leaves, for garnish Instructions: Pass the foie gras through a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl. Add the salt, Madeira, cognac, pink salt, sugar, and white pepper, and mix well. Cover very tightly with plastic wrap and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Let the foie gras mixture soften at room temperature. Place in between two sheets of acetate. Use a dough sheeter or rolling pin to uniformly flatten it to about 1/2-inch. Set the foie gras on a baking sheet and refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat. Beat the egg whites and flour in a heavy-duty mixer. Incorporate the butter, gingerbread spice, and baking soda. Warm up the honey and beat it in. Using an offset spatula and a tuile template, spread the batter evenly on the lined baking sheet. Bake until just done; it&#39;s better to underbake than overbake. Place the tuiles on a cooling rack. You will need 12 tuiles in total, but make extra to allow for breakage. In a large stockpot, bring the red wine and port to a boil and then light it on fire with a long match to flambe it, or else just simmer and let it reduce by one-quarter. In another large stockpot, heat the honey and sugar and stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the simple syrup and the wine mixture and bring to a boil. Add the vanilla, cinnamon, star anise, gingerbread spice, and orange zest. Add the pears and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cut out a circle of parchment paper (a cartouche) and set it over the liquid. Remove the pan from the heat and let the residual heat of the liquid poach the pears. Leave the pears in the liquid overnight at room temperature to obtain as much color from the wine as possible. Transfer the pears to a plate and cool in the refrigerator. The leftover poaching liquid can be frozen and re-used - or you can reheat it, add some brandy, and have a great holiday cocktail! Cut the foie gras into eight 1x3-inch rectangles. Lay four tuiles out flat, center a rectangle of foie gras onto each tuile. Cover each with a tuile. Center another rectangle of foie gras on top of the tuiles, and cover with the remaining tuiles. Lay the mille-feuille of foie gras and pain d&#39;epice on its side on a plate and place a single poached pear next to it. Alternatively, the pear can be cut into slices, if you like. If you have extra tuiles leftover, crumble them up and use Pain d&#39;epice Crumble as an additional garnish or as a base for the poached pear. Finish the plate with mache leaves.

Reserve.<br> Roll or stretch the dough into 4 (8-inch) circles. Place the pizzas on a lightly floured wooden peel. Brush the center of each pizza to within 1 inch of the edge with olive oil and sprinkle it with some of the red onion. Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake 8 to 12 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven.<br> Mix the dill with the sour cream or creme fraiche and freshly ground pepper to taste. Transfer the pizzas to heated dinner plates and spread them with the sour cream mixture.<br> Divide the salmon, and arrange decoratively over the cream. Place a spoonful of golden caviar in the center of each pizza, then spoon a little of the black caviar into the center of the golden caviar. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water.<br> In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled).<br> Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.<br> To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle.

Dredge the filet, the quail and the lamb in the flour. Remove from the flour, shaking off excess, and give the pieces a good swim in the buttermilk. Take out of the buttermilk and dredge again in the flour. Add quail carefully to hot oil. Let fry for 2 minutes, then add the lamb and the filet mignon. Cook until all is golden brown and delicious, about 4 more minutes. Serve with the Bacon Serrano Gravy. Cook bacon until crispy in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve. If there isn&#39;t 1/4 cup bacon drippings in the pan, add oil to get to 1/4 cup. Heat oil over low heat, then add flour and cook, stirring quite often, to make a roux. (Don&#39;t answer the phone, don&#39;t start a new game on your phone. Watch the roux. It can burn quickly. Nobody likes burned roux.) Cook the roux until you have a color like milk chocolate; this can take awhile, at least 20 minutes. Add the reserved bacon and the serranos and cook for a couple of minutes more. Slowly whisk in the milk, beef stock and cream. Gently bring to a simmer, then cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Adjust seasoning if needed with salt, pepper and sugar. Set gravy aside and commence with the goodness. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69484,&quot;Sweet Potato Pie Cookies with Orange Glaze 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick (1/2 cup) salted butter, room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup light brown sugar 1 egg, room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup sweet potato puree 1 cup chopped pecans 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and adjust racks to the middle position.

Simmer for 20 minutes, then taste for seasoning. Add more salt and pepper, if desired. Remove and discard the thyme and bay leaves. Stir in the basil leaves and shut off the heat to allow the sauce to \rest.<br> Pasta: Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Add the salt and the lasagna sheets. Cook for 4 minutes, drain and rinse under cold water. The pasta should still be very firm to the touch. Separate the sheets carefully so they don&#39;t stick together. Divide the tomato sauce in half and reserve half for the Bolognese and half for the lasagna. Assemble the lasagna: Spoon a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of the baking pan. Arrange a layer of pasta sheets over the sauce. Sprinkle some of the mozzarella and Parmesan over the pasta and another thin layer of sauce. Repeat the layering process 2 more times. It is important there be remaining cheese and sauce for the top. Cook&#39;s Note: I love to get a corner piece from the pan and pick at the crispy edges of the top layer. When you finish, there should be 4 layers of pasta and 5 layers of filling. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and put it in the center of the oven. Bake for 45 minutes. Raise the temperature of the oven to 450 degrees F and remove the aluminum foil. Bake until the top browns slightly, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Heat the cream until the butter melts, but do not allow the mixture to boil. Keep the mixture warm until you are ready to add it to the potatoes.<br> When the potatoes are fully cooked, drain in a colander for 5 minutes to remove all excess moisture. It is important to rice the potatoes while they are still hot, because cold potatoes will become rubbery and starchy. Fill the ricer no more than half full. Squeeze the hot potatoes through the ricer and into a stainless steel bowl, being careful that the potatoes do not squeeze out the top of the ricer, which would cause lumps in the mashed potatoes. When all of the potatoes have been riced, stir in the hot cream and butter mixture with a wooden spoon and fully incorporate the seasoning, cream, and butter into the potatoes. Add the chopped chives and serve promptly. If the mashed potatoes must be held a few minutes, keep warm in a double boiler or in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and placed over hot water.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 69501,&quot;Grape Expectations 1 scoop vanilla ice cream 6 ounces grape soda 2 ounces grape vodka Pinch exploding candy, such as Pop Rocks Instructions: Put the ice cream into a pint glass.

Place the butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, preferably fitted with a flat beater. Cream the butter on medium speed until the butter is smooth and lighter in color, about 30 to 45 seconds. Reduce the speed to low, add the sugars in a steady stream. When all the sugar is added, stop the machine, and scrape the mixture clinging to the side of the bowl into the center. The mixture will appear sandy. Increase the speed to medium again, and cream until the mixture is light in color, is fluffy in texture, and appears as one mass, about 5 to 7 minutes. With the mixer still on medium speed, pour the eggs slowly at first. Continue to cream, scraping the sides of the bowl at least once, until the mixture appears fluffy and velvety. Stop the machine and spoon in the cooled cocoa mixture, resume at medium speed and mix just until incorporated. Using a rubber spatula, stir in one-fourth of the flour mixture. Then one-third of the buttermilk mixture, stirring to blend together. Repeat this procedure, alternating dry and liquid. With each addition, scrape the sides of the bowl, and continue mixing until smooth, never adding liquid if any flour is visible. Pour the batter into the pans and spread it level. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the baked surface springs back slightly when touched lightly in the center and the sides contract from the pan. Place the cake pans on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. With mitts, tilt and rotate pans gently tapping them on the counter to see if the cake releases from sides. Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream just to the boil. Remove from heat. Pour over chocolate and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth and shiny. ASSEMBLING THE DESSERT: Split each layer of cake in half horizontally and place one layer, cut side up, on a cardboard round. Spread with one-third of the ganache filling. Center a second layer on top of the first, and spread it with one-third of the ganache filling. Place another layer, cut side up, on top, and spread with remaining filling and turn he last layer upside down, and center it over the filling. Frost the cake with the whipped cream. Place the cake on a wire rack, then set it on a sheet pan that will fit the dimensions of your freezer. Place in the freezer for 40 minutes only, (this is just enough time to chill the whipped cream frosting so it&#39;s firm to the touch, not soft.) While the cake is in the freezer, prepare the dark chocolate glaze. Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream just to the boil. Remove from heat. Pour over chocolate and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth and shiny. Set aside to cool to body temperature. Set the cake on its wire rack over a baking pan with sides (like a jelly roll pan) on top of a turntable (or lazy susan.) Pour almost all of the chocolate glaze over the center of the cake. Using a long, flexible metal icing spatula, use just a few strokes to spread the glaze over the top of the cake so the glaze runs down over the sides. Rotate the turntable as you spread. Use the spatula to scoop up excess glaze to touch it to any bare spots on the sides of the cake to cover them. Place the cake on a serving plate. Refrigerate until 30 to 60 minutes before serving. Using a serrated knife, dipped into hot water after each slice, cut dessert into wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 69504,&quot;Wok Stirred Mussels and Rice Stick Noodles Spicy Black Bean Sauce Canola oil to cook 2 pounds Prince Edward Island Mussels, cleaned and prepped 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced ginger 4 fresh serrano chilies or fresh Thai bird chilies, de-stemmed, minced with seeds 1 tablespoon fermented Chinese black beans 1/2 cup white wine 2 tomatoes or 4 canned tomatoes, diced 1 tablespoon 3 Crab fish sauce 2 cups chicken stock 8 ounces rice stick noodle, soaked in warm water until al dente 1 bunch picked Thai basil 1 bunch chives 2 ounces butter (optional) 2 limes cut in half Salt and white pepper to taste Instructions: Coat a very hot wok with oil, add mussels and stir until they start to open.

Add the sliced garlic and cook until the garlic is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon, leaving the oil in the pot. Carefully pour the tomato sauce into the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer while you prepare the meatballs. For the meatballs: In same skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat and add the garlic and onions. Saute 5 minutes, and then remove from the heat to cool. In a bowl, combine the milk and breadcrumbs and stir until the crumbs look like wet sand. Add a little more milk if it looks too dry. In a large bowl, combine the ground meats, sausage, parsley, basil, eggs, some salt and pepper, the cooked onion-garlic mixture and the breadcrumbs. Stir with your hands until just mixed, and then form 24 small meatballs. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet or plate. Reheat the large skillet over medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the oil is hot, add half the meatballs and cook until browned on all sides, turning a few times during cooking, about 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining meatballs. Transfer all the meatballs to the simmering tomato sauce and cook for a few minutes, until cooked through. To serve, place 2 meatballs on each slider roll and spoon some sauce on top. Top the meatballs with a slice of cheese and serve. You may have leftover sauce. This recipe was created by a contestant during a cooking competition.

Tie with kitchen string. (Alternatively, you can secure all the spices in a large tea ball.). Pour 10 cups of water into a big soup pot. Add the bouquet garni, all of the leek, carrot and ginger; season lightly with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Now add the chicken. Return the soup to a boil, then turn down to a simmer, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through and tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Using a pair of tongs, remove the chicken and set aside to cool. You now have a choice: I like to pluck out the dark green leek leaves and bouquet garni but leave the rest of the vegetables in the soup because this Indian lady can\u2019t stand the sight of wasted veggies! But if that doesn\u2019t bother you, or if it seems like too much of a hassle, just strain the stock and discard all the solids. Return the soup to medium heat. Add the corn, bouillon cubes, white and light green scallions and sesame oil; keep the soup at a gentle simmer. Meanwhile, remove the chicken from the bones and shred with a fork. (Alternatively, slice the chicken really thinly.) Turn up the heat under the pot to high and bring the soup to a boil. In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix the cornstarch with 1/4 cup cold water until a smooth slurry forms. Add half of the slurry to the soup, stirring constantly. The soup will thicken as it boils; if it doesn\u2019t thicken to the consistency of your liking, add the remaining slurry. Reduce the heat under the pot to medium. In another small bowl, beat the egg whites with a little water. Stir the soup in circles as you add the egg whites in a steady stream; it should form pretty white wisps on the surface of the soup. Add the shredded chicken and rice vinegar and cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and a splash of soy sauce. Top with the reserved scallion greens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69517,&quot;Shrimp en Papillote with Couscous 2 tablespoons white wine 1 tablespoon grape seed oil<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 1 tablespoon freshly minced parsley leaves<br> 1 tablespoon minced garlic<br> 1 tablespoon freshly minced cilantro leaves<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1 teaspoon curry powder<br> 1/2 pound Israeli couscous, cooked according to package directions 1 1/4 pounds raw shrimp, peeled, deveined and tails removed (21/25 count) 1 teaspoon powdered ginger 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 2 lemons, juiced 1 tablespoon minced thyme leaves 1 tablespoon minced parsley leaves<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> In a medium bowl, whisk together the wine, grapeseed oil, lemon juice, parsley, garlic, cilantro, cheese and curry. Add the cooked couscous and toss well.<br> Fold and crease the parchment in half and lay the folded sheets on a flat surface. Open and divide the couscous into center of each paper, leaving 3-inch edge clean and free of couscous. Portion the raw shrimp* over the couscous, making sure that the shrimp is not stacked on top of each other, because this would prevent even cooking. In separate bowl, whisk together the ginger, grapeseed oil, lemon juice, thyme and parsley.

Pour the milk over the bread and allow it to soak in for several minutes. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, salt, some pepper, seasoned salt and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in the eggs. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a foil-lined broiler pan, which will allow the fat from the meat to drain. Lay the bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf to give the meatloaf some support. Next, make the tomato sauce: Pour the ketchup into a bowl. Add the brown sugar and dry mustard, and splash in the hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Stir the mixture until well combined. Pour one-third of the sauce over the top of the meatloaf. Bake for 45 minutes, and then pour over another one-third of the remaining tomato sauce over the meatloaf.

Sprinkle the ground duck with salt and pepper, then add to the heated pan. Allow the ground duck to brown all over, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots, green cabbage, onions and mushrooms to the same pan. Cook the vegetables down until most of the liquid is removed and the cabbage is a light brown color, about 10 minutes. Add the soy sauce and stir to combine. Turn off the heat and fold in the basil, cilantro and mint. Pour the filling onto a sheet tray and allow to cool for 5 minutes at room temp, then refrigerate until completely cool. Preheat the oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. Place 2 sheets spring roll pastry on a work surface on top of each other with a pointed end facing you. Place 1/3 cup filling in the middle of the spring roll pastry sheet. Dip 1 finger in a small bowl of water and run along the edge of the spring roll pastry sheet. Fold in the sides to meet in the middle over the filling.

Set aside. Combine the balsamic, soy sauce, fish sauce, cornstarch and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Whisk with a fork to incorporate well, then add the garlic and ginger, and stir to combine. Put the wok over high heat, add the canola oil and when it just begins to smoke, add the onions, bell peppers and tomatoes. Saute until the onions begin to soften, about 5 to 6 minutes. At this point, drop the prepared French Cut Fries into the oil for a final fry. Push a hole in the center of the wok and add the beef. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then deglaze the wok with the beer and add the vinegar-soy mixture. Stir frequently for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add the lime juice and toss. Remove the French fries from the oil and toss them into the stir-fry mixture. Serve on a warm plate with the white rice. Garnish with the parsley and serve immediately. Pass hot pepper sauce at the table. Peel the sides of the potatoes, leaving the skin on both ends. Cut them into 3/8-inch slices, then stack the pieces and dice them into 3/8-inch squares. Put the potatoes in a bowl with the water and let them sit submerged for 30 minutes to 24 hours. This will help leach the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing. Heat the oil in a heavy stock pot to 275 to 300 degrees F. Use a candy thermometer to assure proper temperature. Drain the potatoes and pat them dry of excess water. Add about 2 handfuls of the potatoes to the hot oil. (Chefs Note: There should be at least 1-inch of oil covering the potatoes.) Cook until they are partially cooked and lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the potatoes, shake off any excess oil and let them cool on a rack. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. After all of the potatoes have cooled, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Add 2 handfuls of the potatoes to the oil, and fry until they are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove them from the pot, shake off the excess oil, and season lightly in a bowl with the salt and pepper. Repeat this method until all the potatoes are fried. Keep warm until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 69552,&quot;Roasted Sunchokes with Salsa Verde 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2/3 cup parsley, roughly chopped (about 1 small bunch) 2 tablespoons capers, drained 4 oil packed anchovies, chopped 2 cloves garlic, peeled 1/2 lemon, juiced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds sunchokes, scrubbed very well, and cut into even size 1/2- to 1-inch chunks 5 cloves garlic, peeled 1/4 cup olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the salsa verde: Add the olive oil, parsley, capers, anchovies, garlic and lemon juice to a food processor.

Remove from the heat, transfer to a shallow plate and allow to cool completely. Transfer to a coffee grinder or spice mill and process until very finely ground. Reserve 6 tablespoons of the spice mixture separately and transfer the remainder to an airtight container and save for another purpose. In a mixing bowl combine the chicken, 2 tablespoons of the curry powder, 1 teaspoon of the salt and 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and set aside, covered, for 20 minutes. In a large Dutch oven, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and, when hot, add the chicken pieces and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, thyme, hot pepper if using, and remaining 4 tablespoons curry powder and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft, about 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth, coconut milk, and brown sugar and bring to a simmer. Add the remaining teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is very tender and falling from the bone and the sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the cilantro and adjust seasoning, if necessary. (Note: traditionally, curried chicken roti is eaten with the chicken still on the bones. If you prefer otherwise, at this point you can remove the chicken from the sauce and remove the meat from the bones and then return the meat to the sauce before serving.) Serve the chicken and sauce ladled into the center of the roti breads, then fold both sides over the filling. Fold the top and bottom ends over the sides to form a neat square package, and serve.

Place in oven for 30 to 40 minutes (150 degrees on a meat thermometer). Rest meat on rack until cool. Slice meat 1/4 inch thick and set aside. FOR THE COATING: Combine onion and bay leaves in a sachet. Add into saucepan with milk. Bring to a boil and let cool for 5 minutes. After cooled, remove the sachet. In another pan, melt butter over medium heat, sprinkle flour in the pan and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly to form a roux. Add milk mixture slowly to roux with a wooden spoon. Next, add beef stock slowly. Cook for a few minutes until the mixture is well incorporated and coats the back of the spoon. Add cayenne, nutmeg, and remaining 1 teaspoon white pepper. **It is very important not to stop stirring until you are ready to incorporate the seasonings. COATING: Grease large tray with 5 tablespoons olive oil and set aside. Using two forks, dip one slice of meat in milk mixture and cover completely. Place carefully on tray. Repeat with rest of meat. Refrigerate for one hour. Next, prepare three separate trays: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with bread crumbs. Dip each slice consecutively into flour, egg, and breadcrumbs. Set aside. TO COOK: In a pan, heat oil to a medium heat. Place coated veal slices in pan carefully as not to splash. Cook slowly to avoid burning. Once brown, turn to the other side and cook same way. (Approx. one minute on each side). Serve with tomato concass, potatoes, or a simple green salad.

F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl until combined. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla, beating well after each addition. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat half of the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. Beat in the sour cream, then beat in the remaining flour mixture. Using a large ice cream scoop or 1/4 cup measure, scoop mounds of dough and place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets (6 cookies per pan). Bake, rotating and switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are puffed and the bottoms and edges are just starting to brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the pans, then remove the cookies to a rack to cool completely. Make the icing: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons milk, the corn syrup and vanilla and whisk until smooth and very thick but still spreadable. Remove half of the icing (about 1/2 cup) to a separate bowl and stir in the cocoa powder until smooth, thinning with up to 1 tablespoon milk, if needed. Turn the cookies flat-side up. Using a small offset spatula, spread the white icing on half of each cookie, making a straight, clean line in the center of the cookie. Return the cookies to the rack, and let sit, preferably in a cool place, until the icing is firm with a matte finish, at least 30 minutes. Spread the chocolate icing on the other half of the cookies. Let the icing set at room temperature, at least 2 hours and up to overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69574,&quot;Gravlax Sauce 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon honey mustard<br> 1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons good white wine vinegar<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons good olive oil<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh dill<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Whisk together the Dijon mustard, honey mustard, whole-grain mustard, ground mustard, sugar, and vinegar in a medium bowl.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Wash the mushrooms thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. Toss in a bowl with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. The mushrooms will be very coated, but that&#39;s good! Divide the mushrooms between 2 cookie sheets and roast in the upper half of the oven for at least 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through roasting. Remove from the oven when the mushrooms are deep brown. Set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. In a large skillet, crumble and brown the sausage over medium-high heat. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set aside. Pour off any excess grease and, without cleaning the skillet, add in the diced onions and brown for 5 minutes. Increase the heat to high and add the diced apples, brown sugar and some salt. Cook until deep golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Decrease the heat to medium and pour in the wine (be careful if you&#39;re using an open flame). Stir and cook to reduce the liquid by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the apple/onion mixture into a bowl and set aside. Return the skillet to medium heat (again, without washing) and add the chicken broth, rosemary, sage, thyme, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Heat for a few minutes, and then set aside. Add the bread to a large bowl, and then add the browned sausage, mushrooms and apple/onion mixture (and any juice that might have accumulated). Next, add the broth mixture gradually as you toss the ingredients, being prepared to not use all of the liquid according to your taste. Check the seasonings at the end and add in minced parsley. Pour into a large baking dish (I used an iron skillet) and bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes. (Or you can stuff the turkey if you&#39;re into that kind of thing.)

Remove the veggie mixture from the pan, then add the ground beef to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until it&#39;s totally browned. Drain the excess fat, then add 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, the veggie mixture and 1 tablespoon each parsley and basil and stir to combine. Let the mixture simmer over low heat, 30 minutes. Make the filling: Combine the ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella, 3/4 cup parmesan, the eggs, 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper and the remaining 3 tablespoons each parsley and basil. Stir to combine. Assemble the lasagna: Spoon a thin layer of sauce onto the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch pan or five 6-inch disposable foil loaf pans. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons ricotta filling on each lasagna noodle, then roll them up so that the cheese is on the inside of the roll. Lay them sideways in the pan(s). (Four roll-ups will fit in each loaf pan, or you can fill a 9-by-13-inch pan.) Top with the remaining sauce and plenty of grated mozzarella and parmesan.

Add 1/2 cup of salt and agitate gently to combine. Let stand for 20 minutes, then drain and pat dry with paper towels. While the eggplant is soaking, heat 1/2 cup of the olive oil in a large skillet and, working in batches, add the potato slices and cook until lightly golden on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper-lined plate to drain and repeat with any remaining potato slices. Season lightly with salt. Place 1 cup of the flour in a bowl and dredge the eggplant slices in the flour. Shake to remove any excess flour. Add 1/4 cup of the remaining oil to the skillet and, working in batches, fry the eggplant slices until golden on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add more oil to the skillet as needed in 1/4 cup increments. Repeat until all eggplant has been cooked. Transfer to a paper-lined plate to drain. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet and, when melted, add the onions. Cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Add the ground meats, garlic, and oregano and cook, stirring to break up any lumps, until meat is browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the red wine and cook until evaporated. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes, water and parsley and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost all liquid is evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and set aside. In a medium saucepan melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and, when hot, whisk in the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring until smooth and thick. Season with salt, to taste, and whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese and set aside, covered, while you assemble the casserole. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Butter and sugar a 9 by 2-inch round baking pan or 6 ramekins (4-inch diameter). Melt 1/2 stick butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Heat until butter begins to turn brown. Remove pan from heat, add vinegar and brown sugar, and mix well. (A sauce whisk is a good tool to use here.) Return to heat to melt sugar, if necessary. Pour a little of the brown sugar sauce in the bottom of the ramekins or baking pan. Cut each pineapple ring into pieces, maintaining the shape of the ring (see Chef&#39;s Note). Add 1 pineapple ring to each ramekin or line the bottom of the large pan with pineapple. Add mango around the pineapple. Drizzle pineapple with remaining brown sugar sauce and sprinkle with chopped nuts. Make the batter: In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Put 1 stick of softened butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on medium to high speed with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy. Add 1/2 cup superfine sugar and beat very well, until mixture is white and very light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Alternately mix 1/3 cup milk, then 1/3 of flour mixture into butter-egg mixture in 3 portions. Do not overmix. In another bowl, beat egg whites with clean beaters or a balloon whisk. When whites begin to foam, add remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat until they hold soft peaks. Scrape 1/2 the whites into batter and mix gently until blended. Fold in remaining whites carefully, until just blended. Divide batter among ramekins or pour into baking pan. (If using ramekins, place them on a baking sheet.) Place cake in preheated oven. Bake until a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 20 to 30 minutes for individual cakes or about 50 minutes for the large cake. Remove from oven and let cool about 10 minutes in the pan. Run a knife around the edges to loosen the cake(s) and invert onto deep dessert plates or a deep platter (otherwise, the sweet syrup may overflow the plate!). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 69600,&quot;Orange Sweet Rolls 2 cups whole milk 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 rounded teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter, melted 8 tablespoons orange marmalade 1 cup lightly packed brown sugar, plus more as needed 1/4 teaspoon salt Zest and juice of 2 oranges 4 cups powdered sugar, sifted Dash of salt 1/2 cup whole milk, more if needed for a pourable consistency 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) butter, melted Instructions: For the dough: In a large saucepan over a low heat, heat the milk, oil and granulated sugar until warm but not hot (if you have a candy thermometer, it should be 125 degrees F). Add the yeast and 4 cups of the flour and stir together. Cover the pan and leave to rise for at least an hour. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup flour, the baking powder, baking soda and salt. For the filling: Roll the dough into a long rectangle, about 30 inches wide by 10 inches deep. You&#39;ll want it to be as thin as you can get it so you can add plenty of goo. Drizzle the melted butter all over the surface of the dough. Use your fingers to smear it all around so that it coats evenly. Spread the orange marmalade all over the buttered dough, distributing as evenly as you can. Sprinkle plenty of brown sugar all over the marmalade. Finish with a light sprinkling of salt to offset the sweetness. Using both hands in a back-and-forth motion, gradually roll the dough towards you into one long log. Pinch the seam to seal it. Then slice the log-o&#39;-dough into 1/2-inch pieces. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the rolls in a buttered baking dish and allow them to rise for 20 minutes.<br> Bake for 15 to 17 minutes. While the rolls are baking, make the icing: Add the orange zest and juice to a bowl. Add the powdered sugar and salt. Splash in the milk. And some more melted butter because the recipe doesn&#39;t already have enough. Just kidding on that last part. Whisk it together until it&#39;s nice and smooth and lovely. Your kitchen smells like oranges! Pull the rolls out of the oven when they&#39;re golden brown, and drizzle on the icing right off the bat.

With a slotted spoon, remove bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour any excess fat from the pan, leaving about 1 tablespoon. Saute the leeks, celery, thyme, and bay leaf until the vegetables start to soften. Gradually add the chicken stock, and salt and pepper, to taste. Simmer for about 30 minutes, then remove bay leaf and blend vegetables right in the pot with an immersion blender. Create a beurre manie (reverse roux) by blending the butter and flour together until they look like coarse crumbs. (Flour molecules would normally clump together in a hot liquid. This combination of butter and flour works to thicken already cooked sauces without making them lumpy.) Add this to the soup and blend again until smooth.

Dust the ramekins with 1 tablespoon superfine sugar, dividing it evenly among the ramekins. In a medium saucepan, combine the raspberry liqueur, lemon juice, 1 cup raspberries and the remaining 2 tablespoons superfine sugar and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until the raspberries have cooked down to a jam-like consistency, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Transfer 1 cup of the sauce to a large bowl and set aside. Reserve the rest in the pan. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F; position the rack in the middle. Divide the remaining 1/4 cup raspberries among the ramekins and top evenly with the raspberry sauce from the pan. Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on low speed until foamy, 1 minute. Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat on low speed for 1 minute. Raise the speed to medium and slowly add the powdered sugar. Continue to beat until the whites hold firm peaks, about 7 minutes. Fold a third of the beaten whites into the reserved 1 cup raspberry sauce to lighten it. Fold in the remaining egg whites. Spoon the souffle batter into the ramekins, smoothing it over if you want a tidy finish (see Cook&#39;s Note) or mounding it, like cotton candy, if you want a more rustic look. (If you are going for a classic souffle look, be sure to carefully and thoroughly wipe around the ramekin edges.) Place the ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the souffles are puffed and dark golden, about 15 minutes; they should remain pudding-like on the inside.

Top the brownies with 1 cup of pudding, spreading it to an even layer with an offset spatula. Follow by spreading 1 1/2 cups of the peanut butter whipped cream atop the pudding layer. Repeat twice with the remaining brownie bites, pudding and whipped cream, creating 9 layers total and ending with a whipped cream layer. Sprinkle with the remaining chopped peanut butter cups. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 69607,&quot;Gameday Guacamole 1 ear corn, shucked 1 red bell pepper<br> 1 orange bell pepper<br> 1 poblano pepper<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 large ripe avocados<br> 1 cup diced tomato<br> 1/2 cup lime juice (from 4 to 6 limes)<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1 to 2 tablespoons adobo sauce from canned chipotles<br> Tortilla chips, for serving<br> Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to broil.

Combine the cookie crumbs and melted butter. Stir well to combine. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, and then butter the sides of the springform pan for the cheesecake mixture.<br> For the filling: In a stand mixer, beat the cream cheese. Scrape down the sides of the bowl several times. Add in the sugar and beat it some more; scraping down the sides once or twice. Add the eggs in one at a time, mixing in between each addition, until thoroughly combined. Mix in the sour cream on slow speed while pouring the hazelnut liqueur into the bowl in a slow stream.<br> Wrap the bottom of the springform pan with aluminum foil. Scrape the filling onto the chocolate crust in the pan. Wrap the outside of the pan in 3 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil and put in a larger pan. Add enough hot water to the outer pan to come up halfway. Bake for 1 hour. The cheesecake should be set around the edges but still a little jiggly in the middle.<br> Allow to set up overnight. Run a thin knife around the edge and open the springform pan. Decorate the top of the cheesecake with chocolate drizzles and hazelnuts dipped in chocolate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]</p><p>&quot; 69609,&quot;Strawberries and Cream Stuffed French Toast 6 ounces cream cheese, softened 2 tablespoons strawberry jam<br> Kosher salt<br> Four 1-inch-thick slices Orange Juice Challah, recipe follows 2 extra-large eggs<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Sweetened condensed milk, for serving<br> Fresh sliced strawberries, for serving<br> 6 cups (780g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup (50g) sugar<br> 2 1/4 teaspoon (1 packet) instant yeast<br> Zest of 1 orange<br> 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup (236ml) warm water<br> 1/2 cup (118ml) orange juice, from about 2 oranges<br> 2/3 cup (132g) flavorless oil, such as canola or vegetable oil<br> 3 large eggs<br> Poppy seeds, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the cream cheese and beat until smooth. Add the jam and a pinch of salt and continue to beat until thoroughly combined. Using a paring knife, make a slit in each bread slice about 2 to 3 inches long and deep; this pocket will hold the filling. Using an offset spatula, divide and stuff the filling equally into the pockets, making sure it\u2019s not a big lump. Set aside. In a shallow dish, add the eggs, milk, vanilla extract and almond extract. Mix with a fork until combined. Dip the challah into the mixture, turning to coat both sides. Let sit and soak while you heat your butter. In a large nonstick skillet, add the butter and heat over medium heat until it begins to foam. Add the challah, allowing any excess egg mixture to drip off, and cook until golden brown and cooked through, flipping once, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place the French toast on a serving dish. Serve with a drizzle of sweetened condensed milk and garnished with strawberries. In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, orange zest and salt and whisk together. In a medium bowl, whisk together the water, orange juice, oil and 2 of the eggs. Add the wet to the flour mixture; stir to combine. Knead, either by hand on a floured surface or with a dough hook on medium speed for 7 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary (but resist any urge to add too much!), until you have a smooth and slightly sticky dough. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours. (Alternatively, chill the dough in the refrigerator overnight, then let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before shaping.) Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Divide each into 3 logs and braid. Place on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper, spacing them evenly apart. Cover loosely and let rise 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining egg and 1 tablespoon water. Brush the loaves with egg wash and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake until they are golden and have an internal temperature of 190 degrees F; begin checking for doneness at 18 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly and enjoy. (Challah is best eaten within 24 hours. After that it\u2019s ok if you toast it or use it for French toast. It also freezes well!) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69610,&quot;Amangani Breakfast Potato 2 gallons water 2 tablespoons salt, plus additional for seasoning 2 pounds small red bliss potatoes 2 tablespoons olive oil Pinch minced garlic 1/4 cup julienne zucchini 1/4 cup julienne red onion 1/4 cup julienne squash 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme, rosemary, or parsley leaves Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Bring the water and 2 tablespoons salt to boil. Meanwhile, cut potatoes into desired shape (we cut into sixths). Add potatoes to boiling water and lower temperature to a simmer. Cook potatoes until tender and then drain and dry. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add potatoes to the oil and cook until almost browned. Add the garlic and vegetables and saute until squash is cooked through. At the last minute, add the fresh herbs and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 69611,&quot;Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Cup Cookies 14 to 15 organic peanut butter cups One 17.5-ounce chocolate chip cookie baking mix<br> Instructions: Unwrap the peanut butter cups, place on a plate and freeze for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Prepare the cookie mix according to package instructions and chill in the fridge about 10 minutes. Slightly dampen hands with cool water and wrap each peanut butter cup in a heaping tablespoon of cookie dough, being sure to enclose the peanut butter cup completely. Shape into a disc. Place 6 cookies on each baking sheet spaced about 2 1/2 inches apart, and freeze for 15 minutes. Bake the cookies until the edges are golden brown and crispy with soft-looking centers, 15 to 18 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes before moving to a plate, then serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 69612,&quot;Red Rice 1/2 pound bacon 2 cups Carolina Gold Grain rice or long-grain white rice 2 cups vine-ripened tomatoes, peeled and chopped, or 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can peeled tomatoes, chopped, with their juice, or 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 teaspoon salt 1 quart chicken stock, recipe follows 2 pounds chicken backs, necks, and scraps, with the fat, or a chicken carcass, with the bones cracked 1 large unpeeled onion, quartered 1 carrot, broken into pieces 1 celery rib, broken into pieces Bouquet garni of fresh parsley, thyme, and a bay leaf 2 quarts water Instructions: Cut bacon into small pieces and fry until crisp in a large skillet or saucepan that has a tight-fitting lid. Remove bacon and reserve for garnish. Pour off some of the bacon grease, leaving about 1/4 cup of it in the pan. Add the rice and saute over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. It will begin to turn white after a few minutes; do not let it scorch or brown. Add the tomatoes and continue to saute until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add the salt and stock (omit salt if you are using canned stock). Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes or until the rice is tender. Remove from the heat and allow to sit for a few minutes before serving. Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with the reserved bacon. Brown the chicken pieces in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, taking care not to burn them or let them stick to the pan. Add the vegetables, herbs, and water and simmer, uncovered, for about 1 1/2 hours or until liquid is reduced by half, skimming any scum from the surface from time to time. Strain out the solids, cool, and refrigerate the stock. Remove and discard the chicken fat when it congeals on the surface. Fill an ice cube tray with some of the stock and freeze it to use later. Use the remaining stock in a soup recipe, to cook rice in, or for sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 69613,&quot;Cheesy Corn Pudding 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for coating 2 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped 1/2 white onion, finely diced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 large eggs 1 cup half-and-half 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 3 cups fresh or defrosted frozen corn kernels 1 cup shredded Gruyere (about 4 ounces) 1/4 cup all-purpose flour Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and arrange a rack on the bottom rim. Coat a 2-quart baking dish with butter and set aside. Bring a large pot of water, over low heat, to a simmer. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium frying pan over medium heat. When it foams, add the garlic, onions, salt, and black pepper. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, separate egg yolks and whites. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, half-and-half and nutmeg together. Stir in the corn, cheese, and cooled onion mixture. Finally mix in the flour and combine well. Beat the egg whites until they just hold onto the whisk, (soft peaks). Stir in about 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then gently fold in the rest of the whites. Turn the batter into the prepared dish and set inside a roasting pan or baking dish. Fill the pan halfway with simmering water and put in the oven. Bake until the pudding is golden brown and set in center, about 30 to 45 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69614,&quot;Poppin&#39; Pork Chop Sandwiches 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons seasoned salt<br> 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne<br> 12 boneless breakfast-style pork chops<br> 1/2 cup vegetable oil<br> 3 tablespoons salted butter 12 slider buns<br> 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise 3/4 cup jarred sliced hot cherry peppers, drained and diced<br> Juice of 1 lemon<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 12 slices pepper jack cheese 1 head green leaf lettuce, leaves separated<br> 3 fresh tomatoes, sliced<br> Spicy pickles, store-bought or homemade, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups rice wine vinegar 1/2 cup honey<br> 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1 tablespoon mustard seeds<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill<br> 1 English cucumber, thinly sliced into rounds<br> 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced Instructions: For the pork chops: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. In a baking dish, mix together the flour, seasoned salt, pepper and cayenne. Dredge both sides of the pork chops in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess, and set aside on a plate. Add the vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter to the skillet and heat until the butter is melted. Working in 2 batches, sear the pork chops on both sides until golden brown and cooked through, 2 minutes per side. Remove to a paper towel-lined baking sheet. In a separate pan and working in batches, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and toast the cut side of the buns until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Re-assemble the buns and set aside. For the cherry pepper mayonnaise: Mix together the mayonnaise, diced peppers, lemon juice and some salt and pepper in a medium bowl until well combined. For the sandwiches: Smear the cherry pepper mayonnaise onto each bottom bun, top with a pork chop, cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, more mayonnaise spread and the top bun. Serve hot or wrap in sandwich wrap/foil for transport. To a small saucepan, add the rice wine vinegar, honey, crushed red pepper flakes, mustard seeds, dill and 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Toss together the cucumber and red onion slices and transfer them to a wide-mouth quart-size mason jar. Carefully pour over the warm vinegar mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 7 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69615,&quot;Beets and Brussels Sprouts Salad-in-a-Jar 1 cup walnut halves 1 cup pearled barley 2 large pink grapefruits 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 small shallot, finely chopped 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon honey Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 large cooked and peeled beets, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 10 ounces) 8 cups baby spinach (about 5 ounces) 1/2 pound Brussels sprouts, thinly sliced 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds Instructions: Special equipment: four 32-ounce wide-mouthed glass jars with lids Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the walnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until golden and toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool, and roughly chop. Meanwhile, make the barley: Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the barley, and simmer until plumped and tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Strain and rinse under cold water. (The barley can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days ahead.) Prepare the grapefruit: Remove the peel and pith from the grapefruits with a sharp knife. Cut the grapefruits into pieces, and remove the seeds. Make the vinaigrette: Whisk the vinegar, shallots, mustard, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking constantly, until blended into a vinaigrette. Assemble the salads: Using four 32-ounce wide-mouthed glass jars with lids, divide the beets evenly among the jars, then add the following in separate layers: the spinach, Brussels sprouts, barley and grapefruit. Sprinkle the toasted walnuts and pomegranate seeds on top. Pack the vinaigrette in a separate container (about 3 tablespoons per salad). Just before serving, transfer the jarred ingredients to a large bowl, toss with the vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 69616,&quot;Crepes Suzette au Beurre d&#39;Orange 13 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour 1 large pinch salt 1 3/4 cups milk, plus 1 3/4 cups 4 eggs 10 ounces unsalted butter, melted Orange butter, recipe follows Zest, recipe follows 18 ounces unsalted butter 12 ounces caster sugar 12 oranges, juiced 1 lemon, juiced 1 big splash Grand Marnier 3 oranges 4 teaspoons syrup (made by boiling 1 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan) Instructions: In a big bowl, mix the flour, salt, and 1 3/4 cups milk, in that order. Whisk vigorously by hand until it is the consistency of heavy cream. Break eggs and fold them in with a whisk. Add the remaining 1 3/4 cups of the milk to the melted butter and pour into the mixture. Continue mixing the batter until it becomes shiny and smooth. Finally sieve the batter to get rid of any lumps. Leave to rest for 2 to 3 hours. Dip a piece of kitchen paper in vegetable oil and grease a small frying pan. Ladle a spoonful of batter into the pan. With a flick of the wrist swivel the pan in order to get a nice even covering all over. A good crepe should be paper- thin. Cook on a high heat and flip it over when you see the edge turning golden brown. Remove crepes from pan and keep aside in a warm place. Fold the crepes in 4 and put them into a deep frying pan. Spoon in enough orange butter to barely cover them and, on a high heat, reduce the liquid, turning the crepes over to make sure that they absorb the orange butter. To serve, place the crepes on a dessert plate. Spoon the orange butter over them and garnish with a sprinkling of the zest. Melt the butter in a big saucepan on a high heat. Add the sugar and cook for about 10 minutes until it caramelizes. It should be a golden color. Combine the lemon with the orange juice and pour it in when the caramel is bubbling. Be careful not to burn the butter or yourself. Add Grand Marnier and continue whisking as the mixture curdles a little and let it cook for 10 minutes to reduce. Finally mix with an electric hand-mixer to ensure that the butter is fully integrated. Peel the zest from the oranges and cut it very thinly. Blanch in boiling water 3 times and drain it to remove the bitterness. Put the zests in a saucepan with the syrup. Simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 69617,&quot;Sea Bass Napoleon with Galangal Blackened Scallops and Smoked Salmon, Blackened Tomatoes and Coconut Lemon Grass Reduction One 6-ounce sea bass cut into 2 thin slices 2 tablespoons Guajillo cl Marinade, recipe follows 1/4 cup Coconut Lemon Grass Reduction Sauce, recipe follows 10 to 20 scallops sliced into 2 thin pieces 1 teaspoon blackened seasoning, galangal powder blend Neutral oil 1/3 cup currant, stemmed or yellow and red pear tomatoes 1/2 ounce baby spinach, fresh 1 ounce enoki mushrooms One 1-ounce thinly sliced smoked salmon 1 sprig rosemary, 4-inches in length 1/4 avocado, diced 1 teaspoon orange tobiko (Japanese flying fish roe) 1 1/4 pounds dry guajillo chiles, cleaned 1 to 2 quarts rice vinegar 1 cup brown sugar 12 ounces shiracca chili paste (Thai chili paste) 1 pint Ginger Oil, recipe follows 8 ounces ginger, bruised 1 cup olive oil 1 quart coconut milk 3 1/2 stalks lemon grass, trimmed, cleaned and bruised 1 ounce chipotle puree 4 ounces sugar 1 cup lime juice 1/4 cup rice vinegar Heavy cream, as needed if sauce breaks Instructions: Baste raw bass pieces with Guajillo cl Marinade and set aside.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Finely chop 1/2 cup of the walnuts and set aside. Process the remaining 3/4 cup walnuts with 1/2 cup of the sugar in a food processor until very finely ground, about 1 minute. Add the butter and vanilla and process until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the flour, cocoa powder and salt and process until most of the dough forms a ball and is completely combined. Scrape the dough into a bowl with a rubber spatula and fold in the chocolate chips and reserved chopped walnuts. Roll mounded teaspoons of the dough into 1-inch balls and space evenly apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the cookies, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until cracked on top and mostly firm but still slightly springy when pressed, about 18 minutes (they will firm up out of the oven). Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes; you want them to be slightly warm for the first tossing in sugar. Meanwhile, put the remaining 3/4 cup sugar in a shallow bowl or pie plate. Toss the warm cookies very gently in the sugar until evenly coated. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes, then toss again in the sugar so they are very white. The cookies will keep in a little bit of extra sugar in an airtight container for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 69619,&quot;Poison Candied Apples 8 small Granny Smith apples 3 cups sugar<br> 1/2 cup light corn syrup<br> 1 teaspoon blue gel food coloring 1 teaspoon red gel food coloring Instructions: Wash and dry the apples and remove the stems.

Preheat your oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a cooling rack or paper towel and set aside. Place the potatoes into a Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot. Cover the potatoes with about 1 centimeter (1/2 inch) of canola oil, place a lid on the pot and bring to a boil over high heat; this should take about 5 minutes. When boiling, remove the lid and cook, without stirring, for 10 minutes. Carefully stir the fries, gently scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any that are stuck and cook for another 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Remove the fries from the oil and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Season immediately with salt and transfer to the oven to keep warm. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the steak dry with paper towel. Rub with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add to the pan and sear for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Add the butter into the pan along with one clove of unpeeled garlic and 2 sprigs of tarragon. Carefully tilt the pan slightly and spoon the butter over the steak for 1 to 2 minutes for medium, or until the steak is cooked to your liking. Remove the steak from the pan and set aside to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and mince the remaining garlic, finely chop the remaining 2 sprigs of tarragon and add to a bowl along with the mayonnaise and lemon juice, to taste.

Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, then add the onions and garlic and sweat for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to a second medium skillet over medium-low heat, then add the mushrooms. Cook slowly until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the onions to the mushrooms. For the steaks: Heat a 10-inch cast-iron pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Add the olive oil. Sprinkle the steaks heavily with sea salt and pepper. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the steaks and saute until rare (internal temperature of 135 degrees F), 3 minutes per side. Remove and set aside. Turn the heat to medium and add the garlic and spinach to the pan. Saute, stirring occasionally, until the spinach is just wilted. Remove to a cutting board and chop. Add the spinach to the onions and mushrooms. Turn heat to low to keep warm. For the eggs: Whisk the eggs and heavy cream together in a medium bowl until very smooth. Melt the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the eggs and cook, stirring constantly using a wooden spoon, until they reach a soft, custard-like consistency, 5 to 7 minutes. For the lettuce: Heat a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil. When smoking slightly, add the lettuces and cook, tossing, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushroom mixture to the wok and toss. Turn the heat to low and gently mix in the scrambled eggs. Put the lettuce, egg and mushroom mixture on a large serving platter. Slice the steaks and arrange around the vegetables. Place the Shoestring Potatoes on top and serve. Peel the potatoes and julienne into thin matchsticks using a mandoline. Fill a large bowl with cold water and soak the potatoes for 1 hour. Drain and dry the potatoes in a salad spinner. Heat the oil to 325 degrees F in a Dutch oven. Fry the potatoes in batches until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Let drain on paper towels, 5 to 10 minutes. Refry until golden brown, another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69628,&quot;Leftover Roast Turkey Pho Broth:<br> 1 leftover turkey carcass, including any leg bones and reserved turkey parts (such as the neck, wings, etc.), plus 1 pound leftover turkey meat (about 4 cups), shredded into large bite-size pieces 3 large yellow onions, halved One 6-inch piece fresh ginger root, halved lengthwise 1 head garlic, halved crosswise 3 tablespoons vegetable oil Kosher salt 4 star anise pods 3 tablespoons whole black peppercorns 2 cinnamon sticks 12 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 to 1/3 cup fish sauce 1 pound flat rice noodles 4 cups fresh bean sprouts 1 large bunch Thai basil 2 jalapeno peppers, thinly sliced 1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced Hoisin sauce and/or sriracha (Asian cl sauce), for serving Lime wedges, for serving Instructions: For the broth: Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Toss the turkey bones and parts, onions, ginger and garlic with the vegetable oil in a large bowl. Lightly sprinkle with salt and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, spreading everything out into a somewhat even layer (it is okay if some items slightly overlap). Roast turning the bones and vegetables halfway through until the vegetables are slightly charred, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, add the star anise pods, peppercorns and cinnamon sticks to a large pot. Set over medium heat and toast until very fragrant, shaking the pot occasionally, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the chicken broth, fish sauce, according to taste, and 8 cups of water. Add the roasted turkey bones and vegetables to the pot, scraping any browned bits off of the baking sheet and adding them in as well. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 1 hour. Remove from the heat and strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and into another large pot. (The broth can be made to this point up to 2 days in advance; let cool, then refrigerate in a covered container.) Stir the shredded turkey meat into the hot broth. For the soup: Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Divide the noodles among 6 bowls then top with the broth and shredded meat. Serve with the bean sprouts, Thai basil, jalapenos, red onion, hoisin sauce, sriracha and a lime wedge on the side so that guests can top their pho as they like. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69629,&quot;Chocolate Flowers/Ribbon Decoration Chocolate plastic Cocoa powder Instructions: Note: 1 pound of chocolate plastic will decorate 2 to 3 cakes, depending on what you make and the size To make roses: Dust the work surface with sifted cocoa powder. If necessary, use a rolling pin to give the chocolate plastic a few quick raps to make it pliable. Roll out the chocolate plastic until it is 1/16-inch thin. Use a 2-inch round cutter to cut circles from the chocolate plastic. Use your fingers to make a small chocolate football shape. This will be the center of the rose. Press the first circle into the 1 end of the football. Use your fingers to shape the top of the circle into a petal. Continue to create more petals and wrap them around the base. Let your eye guide you to make the size of flower that will fit your presentation. To make ribbon: Dust the work surface with sifted cocoa powder. If necessary, use a rolling pin to give the chocolate plastic a few quick raps to make it pliable. Roll out the chocolate plastic until it is 1/16-inch thin. Use a sharp paring knife to cut long strips. Use your fingers to bunch the strip into a ribbon. Wrap this around the cake. *Tip: You can also use the pasta machine to roll out the chocolate ribbon. To make chocolate cigarettes: Use any size rectangle of chocolate ribbon. Just roll it up tightly from one of the long ends. Use a large piece of thinly rolled chocolate plastic to cover an entire cake. Finish with a light dusting of cocoa powder or powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Malbec]&quot; 69630,&quot;Ropa Vieja 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 pound pork shoulder, 1/2-inch cubes 1 pound Tri-Tip beef, sliced 1/4-inch thick 6 ounces onions, julienned, caramelized 3 ounces celery, finely diced 3 ounces carrot, finely diced 6 ounces Poblanos, roasted, peeled and julienned 6 ounces red peppers, roasted peeled and julienned 3 tablespoons garlic puree 2 cups chicken stock 12 ounces black beans, cooked with juice 6 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/2 cup cilantro, chopped Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: In hot oil quickly saute the pork and then the beef, making sure to caramelize well. Add the julienned caramelized onions, the diced vegetables, the chilies, garlic puree and cook a minute or two. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil then simmer for a few minutes. Add the black beans and finish with the red wine vinegar and chopped cilantro, salt and pepper. Serve and garnish with salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 69631,&quot;Burnt Orange Bread Pudding Butter, for the pan 6 brioche hamburger buns, split 6 large eggs 3/4 cup sugar 4 cups whole milk 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon salt Zest of 2 oranges Zest of 1 lime Zest of 1 lemon Ice cream, for serving Burnt Oranges, recipe follows Caramel Sauce, recipe follows Whipped cream, for serving 2 navel oranges, cut into wedges Granulated sugar 2 1/2 cups sugar 1/4 cup light corn syrup 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/3 cups heavy cream, warmed 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-5-inch glass loaf pan or an 8-inch square glass baking pan. Arrange the brioche on a wire rack to dry out. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until blended. Add the sugar and whisk until smooth. (Whisk really well or you&#39;ll get scrambled eggs when placed in the oven.) Add the milk, vanilla and salt and whisk until completely blended. Pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into another bowl. Whisk in the citrus zest. Place the brioche in the prepared pan, cutting to fit as needed. Pour the custard evenly over the bread, filling the dish to the top. You may not be able to add all of the custard at this point. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes, so that the bread can absorb the custard. Just before baking, top off the dish with more of the remaining custard if the previous addition has been completely absorbed. Cover the dish with foil and bake until it has just set (no color is necessary), about 1 hour 15 minutes for a loaf pan and 35 to 45 minutes for an 8-inch square pan. To test for doneness, uncover the dish, slip a knife into the center and push the bread aside. If the custard is still very liquid, cover the dish and return the pudding to the oven for another 10 minutes. If only a little liquid remains, the pudding is ready to come out of the oven. The custard will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven and it will set up as it cools. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving. You can serve the bread pudding by slicing it and removing each slice with an offset spatula, or by scooping it out with a serving spoon. Divide the bread pudding among plates. Add a scoop of ice cream. Top with Burnt Oranges and drizzle with Caramel Sauce. Top with a dollop of whipped cream. Preheat the grill to medium. Dust the orange wedges with sugar. Grill until char marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, 1/2 cup water, the corn syrup and salt. (Use a good-size pan because the caramel will boil vigorously and the volume will increase dramatically as soon as the hot cream is added.) Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Let the mixture boil, without stirring, until amber colored. Watch the sugar mixture carefully as it cooks to avoid burning the sugar. From the time the mixture started to boil, it takes over 15 minutes to reach an amber color. Remove from the heat. The mixture will continue to cook off the heat and become darker, so make sure to have the cream close by. Carefully and slowly add the warm cream to the caramel. The mixture will boil vigorously at first. Let the mixture simmer down and then whisk until smooth. Add the lemon juice and vanilla. Cut the butter into 1-inch chunks and add to the caramel sauce, one piece at a time, whisking constantly after each addition. Whisk the caramel periodically as it continues to cool. Pour the caramel sauce into an airtight container such as a glass jar and store in the refrigerator. This will keep for up to a month.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 69632,&quot;Red Cabbage Chips 8 red cabbage leaves salt mustard powder Instructions: Cut away any large white ribs from 8 red cabbage leaves.

Heat in the microwave on high for about 5 minutes or until the butter is completely melted. Stir and heat until mixture is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 10 minutes. Let stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes until slightly thickened. Hints for success: - Be sure to heat the griddle before pouring your pancake batter. - Using a copper bowl to whisk the egg whites will give you more volume. - Do not whisk the whites until they appear dry. They should be stiff, yet moist. - Fold the whites and the squash mixture gently. If you over do it you will deflate the whites and have tougher, flatter pancakes. - The syrup is rich and full of flavor. You can make it the night before, refrigerate it and reheat the next morning. - Use the freshest apple cider you can find. If you use apple juice, try to use one that is not overly sweet. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Gewrztraminer, Brachetto]&quot; 69641,&quot;Hot Brown 5 slices bacon 1 small onion, chopped 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/4 cups milk 1 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 1/4 cups grated muenster or Monterey Jack cheese Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 thick slices white bread, toasted Dijon mustard, for spreading 1 tomato, sliced 3 cups shredded or sliced roast turkey<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

In a large stainless steel or other heatproof bowl or the top pan of the double boiler, whisk together the egg yolks, honey and Marsala until well blended. Set the bowl or pan over, but not touching, the simmering water and whisk vigorously until the mixture lightens in color and thickens and the whisk leaves a trail, about 3 to 5 minutes. To test, draw the whisk through the center of the mixture; it should leave a clean trail on the bottom of the bowl or pan. Add the wine and continue whisking constantly until the mixture is pale, thick, and greatly expanded in volume, about 10 minutes. Do not let the mixture boil or the eggs will curdle. When the zabaglione is light and fluffy and holding a soft peak, remove from the heat and let cool at room temperature for 10 minutes, whisking occasionally. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a bowl using a mixer or a whisk, whip the cream with the granulated sugar until stiff peaks form. When the egg mixture has cooled for 10 minutes, using a rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the zabaglione, being careful not to deflate the mixture. You should have 6 to 7 cups. Add the biscotti to a 10-inch gratin dish. In a small bowl, combine the raspberries, lemon juice, and salt and toss lightly. Arrange the berries over the biscotti. With a large spoon, scoop the zabaglione over the raspberries, and sift the sugar over the top. Arrange the gratin dish on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake the gratin until the tops are golden brown in spots about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, let rest for 5 minutes and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69648,&quot;Gina&#39;s Spicy Potato Wedges 3 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 8 wedges 1/4 cup butter, melted 1/4 cup olive oil 1 tablespoons seasoned salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon freshly chopped parsley leaves 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish Salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the melted butter, olive oil, seasoned salt, cayenne, parsley, and 3 tablespoons of the Parmesan. Arrange in a single layer on 2 sheet trays. Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 45 minutes. Turn the potatoes halfway through the cooking with flat spatula. Remove from oven and taste for seasoning.

Spray a 10-inch ovenproof skillet with nonstick cooking spray.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs with the milk and baking mix. Stir in the reserved au gratin and ham. Pour the mixture into the skillet. Place in the oven and continue to cook until the center is firm and the top is golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9 by 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a small pot, heat the milk with the thyme over medium-low heat until hot. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter with the canola oil. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the flour and cook stirring constantly until the flour is lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the hot milk. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until very thick. Stir in the Cheddar, pumpkin pie spice and salt and pepper to taste. Coat the bottom of the prepared baking dish with a thin layer of the sauce. Place one layer of carrots slightly overlapping in the bottom of the baking dish. Top with an overlapping layer of the parsnips. Pour a third of the sauce over top. Repeat with two more layers each of the carrots and parsnips, ending with the sauce. In a small bowl, stir together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Evenly sprinkle over the top of the gratin. Bake until the gratin is bubbling and the topping is browned, and when pierced through the vegetables yield easily, about 1 1/2 hours. If the top begins to brown too quickly, cover with foil. Let rest for 10 minute before serving. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the ham in a roasting pan fat-side up. Score the fat with a crisscross pattern. Cook the ham for about 1 hour to allow the scored fat to open up. In the meantime, in a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together the brown sugar, apple jelly, mustard, vinegar, ginger and garlic along with 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 2 minutes until it has a smooth syrupy consistency. Remove the ham from the oven. Generously brush the ham with half of the glaze. Place back in the oven and bake an additional 1 hour and 30 minutes, basting with the remaining glaze every 20 minutes. If the ham starts to get too brown, cover with foil. Remove from the oven, cover and allow the ham to rest for 30 minutes before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69651,&quot;Football Party Dip 1 lb.

Quickly blanch the lobsters just long enough so the shells turn red and the meat isn&#39;t fully cooked but can be removed from the shells, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the lobsters to an ice bath to stop the meat from cooking. Separate the tails and claws from the bodies, reserving the bodies for the broth. Remove the tail and claw meat from the shells and roughly chop. Set aside until ready to use. For the seafood broth: In an 8-quart Dutch oven over high heat, add the oil. Let get hot, then add the onion, celery and carrots and allow to saute and brown, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, parsley, rosemary and basil and stir to combine. Allow to bloom for 1 minute. Add the reserved lobster bodies and shrimp shells and stir to combine. Add the butter, habanero, cl flakes, tomato paste, lobster base, bourbon, white wine, chicken stock and salt and stir combine. Allow this to come to a simmer and cook until mildly thick, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Strain the broth through a wire mesh strainer into a large bowl or saucepan. Pour the broth into a blender and blend until smooth. Reserve until ready to use or keep warm in a saucepan over low heat. For the seafood: Heat a 14-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add 1/4 cup neutral cooking oil. Sprinkle the scallops with salt and pepper and add to the heated oil to sear, without moving them, about 4 minutes. Flip the scallops, then add the butter and rosemary. Once the butter has melted, add the shrimp and lobster meat to fully cook the shrimp and warm the lobster through, about 4 minutes. For the roasted fennel: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Spread the fennel on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with the olive oil. Roast until caramelized, about 12 minutes. Reserve until ready to plate. For the garlic bread: Preheat a grill on high heat. Char both sides of the bread aggressively and evenly, about 3 minutes per side. Rub each piece of grilled bread with 2 to 3 swipes of raw garlic and place on a platter. Drizzle each piece with 2 tablespoons finishing oil and season with salt. (Yes, it&#39;s a lot of oil, I know. It&#39;s good.) Assemble and arrange all the seafood in the bottom of a large serving bowl or large shallow dish. Spread the roasted fennel all around and put the herbs on top. Nestle some of the garlic bread in the dish and serve the remaining on the side. Pour the broth all around the dish and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 69653,&quot;Tomato Sandwiches with Blue Cheese Mousse 1 loaf ciabatta, sliced in half horizontally Olive oil<br> 1/2 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 8 ounces blue cheese (something really good, not prepackaged crumbles)<br> 4 ounces whipped cream cheese<br> 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar<br> 4 ounces heavy cream<br> 2 large heirloom tomatoes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 medium white onion, thinly shaved on a mandoline<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.

Rub oil on the skin and season the inside and outside with salt and pepper. Place in large roasting pan and roast in oven until brown, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a rice cooker, wash rice until clear, fill water to Mt. Fuji, add scallops, sausage and cook. When fully cooked (45 minutes), break up scallops and spread rice out to cool. In a large wok coated with oil, stir fry onions, carrots, celery, ginger and garlic for 1 minute. Add shiitakes, lotus, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts, and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes. Add oysters and mix in. Set aside to cool. Mix with rice and check for seasoning. Turn oven down to 275 degrees. Pull turkey out and stuff with rice mixture. (There will be extra stuffing which should be heated separately in a covered dish.) Place turkey back in oven, cover loosely with foil to prevent burning, and roast 3 to 5 hours more 20 minutes per pound, until juices run clear and legs move around easily. For jus: Add shallots to pan and deglaze pan with wine. Add honey, stock and check for seasoning, reduce by 20 percent and reserve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Pinot Noir, Chianti, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 69655,&quot;Vanilla Snow with Hot Maple Syrup 2 cups water 6 tablespoons sugar 1/2 vanilla bean, split 1 cup maple syrup Instructions: In a small saucepan bring the water, sugar and vanilla bean to a boil.

Heat on high flame (do not brown garlic). Pull pan away from flame. Add whiskey, return to flame, and add salt and pepper. Add the demi-glace and brown gravy. Let reduce and add the butter in slowly, off the heat to thicken the sauce. Keep warm. Clean rack thoroughly (remove all silver skin). Season lightly with salt and pepper. Place sizzle pan upside down on the grill. Put lamb, meat-side-down next to the sizzle pan with the bones resting on the pan. This will keep the bones from burning. Make the cross-brand mark on the meat side, then turn and cook for a few minutes on the bone side. Finish in oven, if you prefer well done. When presenting, cut the lamb into 2 pieces. Stand up and cross the bones as if to build a tee-pee. Top with Irish Whiskey Rack Sauce.

Add the shallots and minced garlic and saut, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the whole garlic cloves and deglaze the pan with the wine. Add the Cooked Chorizo and chicken stock. Let the mixture simmer until reduced slightly. Add the Tomato Sauce and heavy cream and simmer 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the pasta and stir until well coated and heated through. If the pasta becomes dry, add a splash of stock. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the butter until combined. Divide the pasta between 2 bowls. To finish the dish, top with the mozzarella and pesto. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a sheet pan. Place the pork in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, thoroughly mix the oregano, smoked paprika, Spanish paprika, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne (if using), 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the spice mixture to the pork, then add the garlic, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 cup water and thoroughly mix. Spread out the chorizo on the prepared sheet pan and bake until just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Using a spatula, form crumbles by chopping and stirring. Add more spice or salt to taste. Let cool completely before use. Heat a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, then add the oil. Add the onions, basil and oregano and stir until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, stir for 1 minute, then deglaze with the wine. Add the tomatoes, vinegar, sugar and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, stirring, then reduce the heat to low. Add the tomato paste and stir until well combined. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste for seasoning, then lightly blend with an immersion blender. Do not puree. Combine the flour, egg yolks, oil, 1/4 cup water and 2 1/2 teaspoons salt in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Mix on low speed until the dough pulls away from the sides of bowl. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead to form a uniform ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour (or overnight in the refrigerator). When the dough is ready, bring 1 to 2 gallons of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, set up your pasta machine, unwrap the dough and dust with flour. Cut the dough in half and rewrap the half you&#39;re not using. Flatten the dough enough to fit into the roller. Open the pasta roller to widest setting (#1). Pass the dough through the roller, dusting with flour as needed now and as you continue to roll out the dough to prevent sticking. Narrow the roller to the #2 setting and pass the dough through. Continue to the #4 setting, then the #5 setting. Trim the ends and cut into 12-inch sheets. Repeat the process with the remaining dough half. Dust the finished sheets with flour, then fold into thirds. Keep the folded sheets as straight as possible and, using a sharp knife, cut into 1/4-inch strands to form tagliatelle. Dust the pasta with flour if needed to prevent sticking. Blanch the pasta in the boiling water until it floats, about 4 minutes. (The pasta will be cooked lightly in the chorizo tomato sauce, so do not overcook it during the blanching phase. No one likes mushy pasta.) Drain and transfer to an ice bath to slow the heating. Drain well and toss with oil. Divide into nine 6.5-ounce portions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Gavi, Barbera]&quot; 69658,&quot;Meatloaf Croque Monsieur (Leftovers) 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons sambal or sweet cl sauce Soft butter to spread 8 slices whole wheat bread 8 thin slices cold meatloaf 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced 8 thin slices gruyere Instructions: Mix together the mustard and sambal.

When it reaches a boil, remove from the heat, and add the ganache. Let sit for 1 minute, then stir well until combined, about 4 minutes. Stir in the Tia Maria or vanilla. Serve the hot chocolate right away as is or store it covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. It can be reheated easily on the stovetop or in the microwave. If you wish, top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Can deep, dark, intense, rich, velvety smooth chocolate be a spiritual experience? It certainly is heavenly when mixed with cream. Praise the pastry angels and pass the bonbons! This is the basic ganache recipe. Use it for truffles, tarts, fillings, you name it. Follow the same technique when adjusting the recipe for firm and soft ganache. An alternative food processor method is given, which can be applied to any ganache recipe in this chapter. My desire is not only to introduce you to ganache but also to make it a staple in your refrigerator. As long as you don&#39;t eat it all as a midnight snack, it can be available to help you throw together dessert at a moment&#39;s notice. Using a serrated knife, finely chop the chocolate into 1/4-inch pieces. Don&#39;t be lazy here. Big chunks will not melt. Traditional method: Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boiling means the cream will actually rise up in the pan and threaten to boil over. Immediately pour the boiling cream over the chopped chocolate. Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream, then let it sit for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir in a circular motion, starting from the center of the bowl, and working out to the sides. Be careful not to add too much air to the ganache. Stir until all the chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. It may look done after 1 minute of stirring, but keep going to be sure it&#39;s emulsified. Food processor method: Place the chopped chocolate in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat (or bring to a boil in the microwave.) Immediately pour the hot cream into the food processor, on top of the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then pulse the machine 3 times. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and pulse 3 more times, until all the chocolate is melted. This smooth, silky chocolate is now ganache. Transfer the ganache to a bowl. Let the ganache sit at room temperature until it cools to 70 degrees F. In a 65 degree F room, this will take approximately 4 hours or 2 hours in the refrigerator. You can speed up the process by pouring the ganache out onto a clean baking sheet (thinner layers cool faster.) Once the ganache reaches 70 degrees F, it is ready to be used.

Refrigerate overnight.<br> The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Saute the carrot, celery, and onion in the butter and oil. Caramelize lightly, then deglaze the pan with the brandy. Transfer to the bottom of an ovenproof pan that will just hold the chicken legs. Arrange the legs skin side up. Add the bay leaves, garlic, peppercorns, and chicken stock. The bottom half of the meat should be immersed in the liquid, but the skin should be exposed. Braise on the top rack of the oven, checking after 45 minutes, until the meat is tender and the skin crispy.<br> Before serving, pour off some of the braising liquid with the vegetables. Degrease the liquid and reduce by a third. Taste as it is reducing to ensure that the salt doesn&#39;t intensify too much. If it is too salty, add a little plain reduced stock. Finish with the parsley. To prepare the greens: Lightly brown the onion in the oil and the butter. Chop the greens into manageable pieces and saute slowly until wilted. Add a little water to prevent sticking if necessary. When the greens are cooked through, add the anchovy and garlic and cook a minute more. Turn off the heat and season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and lemon juice.<br> Serve the braised chicken with the greens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]&quot; 69681,&quot;Chocolate Surprise Stripe Cake Vegetable shortening, for greasing cake pans 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups granulated sugar<br> 3/4 cup extra-dark cocoa powder<br> 2 teaspoons baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 2 eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten<br> 1 cup buttermilk<br> 1 cup espresso<br> 1/2 cup vegetable oil<br> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/2 cup pasteurized egg whites 1 pound powdered sugar<br> 2 pounds salted butter, softened 2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract<br> 2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup vegetable shortening, such as Crisco<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> Raspberry jam, for filling Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottom and sides of two 2-by-9-inch round cake pans with shortening. Line with parchment cut to neatly cover the bottom and sides of the pans. In the bowl of an electric mixer with a paddle, sift the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add the eggs, buttermilk, espresso, vegetable oil and vanilla; mix on medium speed. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the pans and continue baking until an inserted skewer comes out clean, another 15 minutes. Cool on a rack, unmold and return to the rack to cool completely. For the buttercream icing: With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the egg whites and powdered sugar for 5 minutes. Add the butter and vanilla and beat for 10 minutes, until fluffy. (Makes 3 pounds.) For the caramel icing/crumble: Mix the sugar, buttermilk, shortening, butter and baking soda in a 3- or 4-quart cast-iron Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook to the softball stage (235 to 245 degrees F on a candy thermometer), swirling the pan to keep the ingredients moving. Remove from the heat and beat with a wooden spoon until creamy and spreadable. Spread on a silicone mat and set aside. When cool, break into a crumble. To create the striped filling: Put one-third of the vanilla buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a 1/3-inch tip. Put an equivalent amount of raspberry jam into a second piping bag, also fitted with a 1/3-inch tip. When the cakes are completely cool, pipe a dollop of buttercream into the center of one of the layers. Pipe concentric circles around the first dollop, working outward and alternating between circles of raspberry jam and buttercream?this will be your bottom layer. Lightly place the remaining cake layer on top of the &#39;piped&#39; bottom layer. Use the remaining buttercream to ice the entire cake. Add the crumbled caramel by patting small handfuls onto the top of the iced cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 69682,&quot;Whipped Sweet Potatoes and Bananas with Honey 5 sweet potatoes 4 bananas, unpeeled 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup honey Kosher salt 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups pecans, roughly chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Prick the sweet potatoes all over with a fork, put in a roasting pan and roast 30 minutes. Toss the bananas into the pan and continue roasting until the bananas and potatoes are very soft, 10 to 15 more minutes. Remove from the oven but don&#39;t turn off the oven. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut in half and scoop out the flesh into a large bowl. Peel the bananas and add them to the bowl along with 1 stick butter and the honey. Season with salt and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until everything is well combined and the mixture is fluffy. Spoon into a shallow 2-quart baking dish; smooth the top. Use your fingers to rub the remaining stick of butter, the brown sugar, flour and pecans in a bowl until the mixture is combined. Sprinkle over the sweet potatoes and return to the oven until the topping is golden brown, about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 69683,&quot;Rainbow Cookies 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pieces and softened, plus more for the pans 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans 8 ounces almond paste 1 cup sugar 4 large eggs, separated 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Red and green food coloring (gel preferred)<br> 1 15-ounce jar smooth apricot jam Cooking spray 1 pound bittersweet chocolate, chopped Instructions: You&#39;ll need three 9-by-12-inch jelly roll pans or rimmed baking sheets to make these layered cookies. Prep the pans: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour three 9-by-12-inch jelly roll pans or rimmed baking sheets and line with parchment paper. Make the batter: Combine the almond paste and 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until the mixture is in fine crumbles. Beat in 2 1/2 sticks butter, a few pieces at a time, until well combined. Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, until smooth. Sift 2 cups flour onto a sheet of parchment and sprinkle the salt on top; add to the mixer bowl and beat until just combined. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy; while whisking, slowly add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and whisk until firm peaks form (or use a hand mixer). Fold about one-third of the egg white mixture into the batter with a rubber spatula, then gently fold in the rest. The batter should be fluffy. Color the batter: Divide the batter evenly among 3 bowls. Stir enough red food coloring into 1 bowl to make a deep salmon color. Stir enough green food coloring into another bowl to make a medium green color. Leave the third bowl uncolored. Bake the layers: Transfer the batter to the prepared pans (one pan for each color). Dip an offset spatula in water and spread the batter to the edge of each pan, smoothing the tops. Bake, switching the position of the pans halfway through, until the cakes are cooked through and just beginning to brown around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool completely in the pans on wire racks. Assemble the layers: Spread half of the jam evenly over the green cake layer almost all the way to the edges. Unmold the plain cake layer by inverting it onto another pan or cutting board; peel off the parchment. Carefully slide the plain layer onto the green layer (use a wide offset spatula to help you, if necessary). Spread the remaining jam on top of the plain layer. Unmold the red cake layer and slide it onto the plain layer. Cover the cake with plastic wrap and top with one of the empty pans; place several heavy cans on top to weigh down the layers. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Unmold the cake: Remove the cans and plastic wrap. Place a cutting board on top of the cake and flip to unmold it onto the cutting board. Remove the parchment from the top of the green layer. Trim the cake: Trim the sides with a knife to make straight edges. Spray a wire rack with cooking spray; set the rack over a baking sheet. Carefully slide the cake onto the rack, using a wide offset spatula to help you, if necessary. Cover in chocolate: Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water; pour over the cake. Dip an offset spatula in the hot water and smooth the top and sides. Let set slightly. Scrape wavy lines into the chocolate with a fork; let cool a few more minutes until the chocolate is mostly set but still slightly tacky. Cut into pieces: Slide the cake back onto the cutting board. Slice crosswise into 6 strips, then cut each strip into 8 rectangular pieces. For clean edges, dip the knife in warm water and wipe it with a cloth between cuts. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. If the lines in the chocolate don&#39;t hold their shape, let the chocolate set a little longer and try again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69684,&quot;Pumpkin Cake Classic Genoise, recipe follows 6 gelatin sheets 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons canned pumpkin 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch nutmeg Pinch allspice 3 1/2 cups heavy cream, whipped<br> 2 tablespoons rum<br> Simple Syrup, recipe follows 2 ounces cream cheese, softened 1 cup heavy cream, whipped Raspberry Sauce, store bought Chocolate Sauce, store bought 8 large eggs 3 large egg yolks 1 cup granulated sugar 2 1/2 tablespoons honey 2 cups unbleached, unbromated pastry flour, sifted 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup water 1/2 lemon, juiced Instructions: Make the Genoise according to the recipe and set aside. Bloom the gelatin in cold water to cover. Squeeze the excess water from the gelatin and set aside. Place the pumpkin, sugar and spices in a large glass bowl and stir to combine. Place about 1/4 cup of the pumpkin mixture into a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the bloomed gelatin to the pan and stir to combine. The heat will melt the gelatin. Add the warm pumpkin to the remaining pumpkin mixture. Fold in the whipped cream. Use round cutters that are slightly smaller than the pumpkin mold to cut the cake. The pieces need to fit just inside the mold. Add the rum to the Simple Syrup and place the syrup in a squeeze bottle. Add a few spoons of the pumpkin Bavarian to the mold. Place a cake layer on top of the Bavarian and gently press into place. Soak the cake layer with the rum simple syrup. Repeat with another layer of pumpkin Bavarian, cake and simple syrup. Place the mold in the freezer for about 2 hours. When the cake has frozen, place the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl and whip until softened. Use a rubber spatula to fold the cream cheese into the whipped cream. Place the whipped cream cheese into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. To unmold the cake, dip the mold into hot water. Put raspberry and chocolate sauces in squeeze bottles. Fill the pumpkins mouth with raspberry sauce and his eyes and nose with chocolate sauce. Pipe the whipped cream cheese around the rim of the cake using any decoration. Place a 1-quart saucepan half filled with water over high heat and bring it to a simmer. Make a double boiler by setting a large mixing bowl over the simmering water. Place the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and honey in the mixing bowl and make an egg foam by whisking the mixture to 113 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 7 to 10 minutes. The egg foam passes through various stages becoming foamy, then smooth and finally it thickens. When it is thick, it will be hot to the touch, tripled in volume, and light in color and the sugar will have completely dissolved. If you dip the whisk into the mixture and pull it out, the batter should fall back into the bowl in a thick ribbon. Remove the mixing bowl from the heat and whip the batter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until it cools, increases in volume, stiffens slightly and becomes pale yellow, about 7 to 10 minutes. Take the time to whip it well; if the mixture is underwhipped, the baked genoise will be dense. Very, very carefully, fold in the flour with a rubber spatula until the flour is no longer visible, making sure to fold to the bottom of the bowl. Do not overmix or the batter will deflate. Bake the genoise on a baking sheet: Spread the batter over a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven until lightly and evenly browned and springy to the touch, about 10 minutes. Let the genoise cool slightly. Unmold and finish cooling on a wire rack to allow the air to circulate evenly around the cake. The baked genoise can be stored in the freezer for 2 to 3 weeks if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Return it to room temperature before using it.

Add the water and shortening and mix 10 minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl and let sit until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. For the filling: While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spread the bok choy, scallions, garlic, cl peppers, onion, ginger and red cabbage in an even layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle over the peanut oil and season with the salt and pepper. Roast until cooked down and roasted, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl, add the basil, sesame oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar and toss to combine. Refrigerate the filling until you are ready to form the buns. When the dough has doubled, transfer it to a work surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, dusting with flour if sticky. Divide the dough into 10 even pieces. Cover with plastic and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. To form the dumplings, flatten each dough piece into a 4-inch circle and fill with a heaping tablespoon of filling. Pinch the edges together to seal and twist (it will seem like too much filling, but the dough is stretchy enough to hold it). Cover with plastic wrap or a clean towel and let rest on a sheet tray for 30 minutes. For the veggie buns: Heat the peanut oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. When the oil is shimmery, add the buns seam-side down. Sear until golden on the first side, 3 to 4 minutes, then flip, add about 1 cup water (carefully because it will get a little spitty), cover immediately and let steam until puffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the cover and continue to cook until the water is gone. Serve with soy sauce and black vinegar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 69706,&quot;Strawberry and Raspberry Tart with Meyer Lemon Pastry Cream 1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold, unsalted butter 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 4 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk Ice water, as needed 2 tablespoons cornstarch 2 1/4 cups heavy cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Peel of 1 Meyer lemon (strips removed with a peeler) 3 tablespoons apricot preserves 1 cup raspberries 5 strawberries, hulled and sliced Freshly whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grate the butter on a box grater and add to the bowl of a food processor with the flour, 1/4 cup of the sugar and the salt. Pulse to combine until the mixture resembles Parmesan cheese. Add the egg yolk and 3 tablespoons of ice water. Pulse to combine until the dough comes together and holds its shape when pressed between your fingers. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Gently knead a few times and bring the dough together into a ball, then flatten into a disc. Roll the dough out evenly into a 1/4-inch-thick circle. Transfer the dough onto a sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap. Place into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll evenly in all directions, making sure it doesn&#39;t stick to your work surface and dusting with flour as needed. The dough should be about 1/8-inch thick. Slice the dough in half and transfer to two nonstick 6-inch fluted tart pans with removable bottoms. Press the dough snuggly into the edges ensuring the dough runs fully up the side. Use a rolling pin to trim the excess dough. Line each tart with a piece of foil and fill with baking beans (or I use rice!), making sure the foil is tightly packed to the corners. Transfer the dough to the oven to blind bake for 6 minutes. Rotate the pan, then bake for another 6 minutes. Remove the foil and baking beans and place the tart back into the oven until lightly golden, another 4 minutes. Set aside to cool. Set up an ice bath. Add the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the heavy cream to a small bowl. Mix to create a slurry and set aside. Add 1/2 cup of the sugar and the 4 whole eggs to a large bowl and beat with a whisk until pale yellow and foamy. Add the remaining 2 cups heavy cream, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, the vanilla extract and lemon peel to a small saucepan and whisk to combine. Turn the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, then pour half of the mixture into the bowl with the eggs and sugar and immediately whisk vigorously to combine and temper the mixture. Pour the contents of the bowl into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Add the cornstarch slurry and whisk to combine. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to whisk until the mixture begins to thicken and it reaches the texture of pudding, 3 to 4 minutes. You want to continuously whisk to avoid scorching the mixture. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl. Set the bowl over the ice bath to cool. Place the apricot preserves and a splash of water into a small saute pan. Turn the heat to medium and stir to gently melt the preserves, about 5 minutes. Set aside. To assemble the tart, spoon an even layer of the lemon pastry cream into each tart shell, but not fully to the top. Line the outside of the tart with raspberries and working inward, arrange the inside of the tart with the sliced strawberries. Repeat this process alternating with more raspberries and strawberries. Glaze the top of each tart with the apricot mixture. Serve the tarts with a dollop of whipped cream.

Add the peas and simmer 5 minutes longer just to cook through. (As you are simmering, be sure to keep the level of the water constant so that it does not evaporate too much.) When the vegetables are tender, puree the mixture (vegetables and liquid) through a food mill or blender. (If you puree it with a food processor or a blender, pass the puree through a sieve to remove any tough bits.) In a clean saucepan heat the butter. Add the remaining onion and cook for 5 minutes, over low heat or until very tender but not brown. Add the flour and cook for a few seconds. Whisk in the strained puree, bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring on occasion to make sure the flour does not stick to the bottom of the saucepan. Gradually add the half and half or evaporated milk and adjust it to the texture you like. Bring the liquid to just to under a boil; season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle out and garnish with chives if you wish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69718,&quot;Vegetarian Potpie 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 carrots, diced 3 stalks celery, diced 1 small onion, diced 8 ounces white mushrooms, sliced 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups whole milk Kosher salt 1 14-ounce package extra-firm tofu, drained, patted dry and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 cups frozen peas Freshly ground pepper 5 slices potato bread Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Line an 8 1/2-by-4-inch loaf pan with a sheet of aluminum foil that is as wide as the pan and about 12 inches long, making a cradle for easier removal of the ratatouille loaf. Slice the eggplant lengthwise into 1-inch-thick planks. Slice each plank lengthwise in half again. Put the eggplant, zucchini and squash on the rack in a single layer. Generously salt both sides of the vegetables and let sit for 30 minutes to draw out the moisture, then pat dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. To a small bowl, add the olive oil, rosemary, thyme, garlic and salt and cracked black pepper to taste and whisk until blended. Assemble the vegetables in layers of each type in the loaf pan with the skins facing towards the walls of the pan: yellow squash, red pepper, eggplant, onion and zucchini, brushing each layer with the herb-oil mixture and sprinkling with 1 teaspoon of cheese. Press firmly to form a tight loaf while layering. Repeat until the vegetables reach about 1/2 inch from the top of the loaf pan. Top with the tomato rounds and sprinkle with the remainder of the Parmesan and some salt. Put the loaf pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake uncovered until the vegetables are very soft and the tomatoes are soft and caramelized, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let cool completely, at least 4 hours, or refrigerate overnight. When ready to serve, toss the arugula with a little (about 1 to 2 tablespoons) of the Champagne Vinaigrette to lightly dress. Remove the ratatouille from the pan by pulling it up with the ends of the foil cradle. Slice the ratatouille crosswise into 4 even pieces. For the sandwich build: Split the rolls in half lengthwise, brush both sides with butter, toast on a griddle and rub with the cut side of the garlic. Spread some of the butter on the cut side of the rolls and sprinkle with the flaky salt. Add a slice of the ratatouille and top with the arugula. Cut each sandwich in half on the bias. In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar, parsley, mustard, oregano, sugar, thyme and garlic. While whisking, slowly add the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and you&#39;re ready to rock.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 69722,&quot;Basic Sheet Pan Cake Nonstick baking spray, for the baking sheet 4 large eggs, cold (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 1 cup sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature<br> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Lightly coat an 18-by-13-inch sheet pan with nonstick baking spray. Line the bottom with parchment. Set aside.

For the cutlets: Begin by pounding out the chicken cutlets. Working with 2 cutlets at a time, place between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, gently pound out each piece of chicken to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Work gently from the center outwards so as to keep it even and not tear the chicken. Repeat with the remaining cutlets. Set up a breading station. Place the flour in a shallow bowl, season with salt and pepper and mix well. In a second shallow bowl, add the buttermilk, season with salt and pepper and mix well. In a third shallow bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, season with salt and pepper and mix well. Take each cutlet and dredge lightly in the flour. Shake off any excess, and then dip in the buttermilk. Finally, dredge in the breadcrumb mixture. Cover evenly on both sides, gently patting the crumbs into the chicken to help it stick. Place the breaded cutlets in a single layer on a platter and place uncovered in the fridge for 15 minutes - this will help the coating stick to the cutlet and prevent tearing when it comes time to cook them. To cook the cutlets, set 2 large nonstick saute pans, cast-iron pans if available, over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to each and cook 2 cutlets in each pan for 3 to 4 minutes per side. When done, they will be golden brown and crispy. Transfer to an ovenproof pan and keep warm in the oven. Try not to keep the chicken in the oven longer than 15 minutes, otherwise it will dry out. Now make the gravy: Set a medium saute pan with high sides over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Add the garlic, onions and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Saute until the onions are lightly caramelized and tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Deglaze with the white wine and reduce for 1 minute before adding the chicken broth. Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, and then add the cold butter cubes to the sauce. Remove from the heat and swirl the pan to melt the butter evenly - this will thicken the sauce and give it a nice sheen. Serve the chicken schnitzel with the garlic-onion gravy. Wine paring: Riesling or sparkling wine. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 69735,&quot;Grape Fruit Leather 10 cups green, red or black seedless California grapes, stemmed and rinsed (about 3? lbs) ? cup sugar 2 tablespoons lemon juice Instructions: Puree the grapes in a blender or food processor, in batches if necessary, until very smooth. Pour the puree into a fine sieve and press hard with a spatula to extract as much juice as possible. Puree the grapes again and put them back into the sieve. Press again and reserve the juice for another recipe. There should be about 2 cups of grape puree. Pour the puree into a small saucepan with the sugar and lemon juice and bring to a boil. Simmer, stirring often and scraping the sides, until the puree turns glossy and darkens slightly, about 30 to 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200°F using convection mode if available. Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with a silicon baking sheet. Pour the puree onto the mat and spread into an 1/8-inch thickness using an offset spatula, leaving a 1-inch border of space around the edge. Bake 1½ to 3 hours, rotating the tray halfway through, until the puree is tacky and not quite dried in the center. Let stand at room temperature until fruit leather peels easily from the tray, 24 hours to 48 hours. Place a piece of parchment paper over the fruit leather and invert. Peel off the silicon baking sheet and starting at the long end, roll up the fruit leather and parchment. Using scissors or a sharp knife, cut the fruit leather roll into 1-inch segments.

Leave the brine to cool. Clean a stoneware crock or plastic bucket and its lid with a solution of 1 tablespoon baking soda to 1 gallon boiling water. Rinse well and leave to drain dry. To test the saltiness of the brine put egg, in shell in the cooled brine. If it doesn&#39;t float, add enough salt until it does. To draw off any excess blood and to help the brine penetrate, pierce the beef all over with a trussing needle or skewer and place meat in cold water for about 45 minutes. Remove the meat from water and place in crock or bucket. Pour the cooled brine over the brisket. Add garlic to the brine. Place a plate on top of the brisket to submerge. Place a lid or plastic wrap over container. Store in a refrigerator or dry place, at a temperature below 60 degrees. Salting time depends on the thickness of the meat. Allow 3 to 10 days for salting time for brisket. When removing meat from brine, always use clean tongs: this way the brine will stay good longer and be reused with the same kind of meat. It is possible to strain off the brine and reboil it, adding a refresher of about half the above quantities. Naturally the crock or bucket will need a complete cleaning. This should be done before mold appears. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]</p><p>&quot; 69743,&quot;Grilled Prosciutto Wrapped Shrimp and Arugula Salad with Pickled Onions, and Balsamic Reduction 3/4 cup dry white wine 3 garlic cloves, minced<br> 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Salt 1/2 lemon, juiced 1/2 cup olive oil 1 pound (U-15) jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined 1/4 pound thin prosciutto slices, cut into 1 or 2-inch strips (depending on the size of the shrimp) 10 (8-inch) skewers, soaked in warm water 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 cup water 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced 1 cup balsamic vinegar, plus 2 tablespoons 1/4 cup olive oil 1 pound baby arugula Instructions: To prep the shrimp: Whisk together the wine, garlic, red pepper, salt and lemon juice.

Add the onions and cucumbers, shake again, and let sit for at least 1 hour. (You&#39;re making pickles here, and this step can totally be done ahead of time-like yesterday!) Put the bread in a large bowl with 1/2 to 1 cup water to soften. Squeeze and knead the bread with your hands, and then let it sit for 30 minutes. Squeeze out any excess water from the bread again, put the bread back in the bowl, and crumble it through your fingers. Toss in the tomatoes, add the pickled onions and cucumbers (strain these out and reserve the liquid), and stir to combine. Add the basil and some finishing oil; taste it to make sure it&#39;s delicious. Sprinkle in a few drops of the pickling liquid or a bit more oil if needed. Reserve. For the blossoms: Wiggle your finger into the blossom down to the base, where the flower meets the stem, and carefully break off and remove the stamen (be gentle, you don&#39;t want to rip through the blossom while doing this). Repeat with all the blossoms. In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmigiano and parsley and season with salt. Taste and re-season if needed. Put the ricotta mix into a pastry bag, carefully insert the tip of the bag into the flower and fill. Then gently close your hand around the flower to secure it. Place the stuffed blossom on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining flowers. Pour peanut oil into a large saucepan over medium-high heat; the oil should come 1 1/2 to 2 inches up the sides of the pan. While the oil heats, set up your drying situation next to the stove by putting a couple layers of paper towels on a baking sheet. To see if the oil is hot enough, drop a bit of flour into it. If it sizzles, you&#39;re good to go. If the oil begins to smoke, it&#39;s too hot, so reduce the heat. Combine the flour and wine in a large bowl to make a very loose batter. Start with 3/4 cup of the wine and add more if needed. Working in batches, dip each blossom in the batter to coat it, and then gently put each blossom in the oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Let the blossoms cook until they turn color but stay nice and crispy on the outside, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the blossoms from the oil with a slotted spoon or fish spatula, put them on the paper towels and immediately sprinkle with salt. Divide the reserved panzanella among serving plates and top each with 2 crispy blossoms. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69754,&quot;Maple Bundt Nonstick baking spray, for the pan 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, slightly cooler than room temperature<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon sea salt<br> 1/2 cup maple syrup<br> 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons maple syrup<br> 1/4 to 1/3 cup heavy cream<br> Instructions: For the bundt: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 10-inch bundt pan with nonstick baking spray. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter until smooth. Add the granulated sugar and continue creaming, scraping down the sides of the bowl every now and again, until the mixture is light and fluffy. This can take 5 to 10 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt to combine. Transfer the flour mixture to a piece of parchment. Add the maple syrup to the butter and sugar mixture and mix to combine. Add the eggs one at time, mixing until each egg is completely incorporated and scraping down the bowl after each addition. Add half the flour mixture and mix, then the milk and vanilla and mix until incorporated. Add the remaining flour and mix until combined. Transfer the batter to the prepared bundt pan and smooth the top with the back of a spoon. Place the bundt on a baking sheet and bake until the cake springs back when gently poked, about 1 hour. Allow the cake to rest in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. For the maple glaze: In a small bowl, mix together the confectioners&#39; sugar, maple syrup and 2 tablespoons of heavy cream until smooth. Add more heavy cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin out the glaze to the desired consistency. Once the bundt is completely cooled, place onto a serving platter and pour the glaze over top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 69755,&quot;Pavlov&#39;s Punkin&#39; Bread 1 medium egg 1 2/3 cups whole wheat flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 1/2 cup applesauce 1/2 cup honey 1 cup 100 percent natural pumpkin 1/2 cup water Instructions: In a bowl, combine egg, flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Wash the mushrooms thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. Toss in a bowl with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Mushrooms will be very coated, but that&#39;s good! Divide the mushrooms between two sheet pans and roast in the upper half of the oven for at least 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through roasting. Remove from the oven when the mushrooms are deep brown. Set aside. Turn the oven down to 375 degrees F. In a large skillet, crumble and the brown sausage over medium-high heat. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set aside. Pour off any excess grease, and without cleaning the skillet, add in the onions and brown for 5 minutes. Increase the heat to high and add the diced apples, brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until deep golden brown. Decrease the heat to medium and pour in the wine (be careful if you&#39;re using an open flame). Stir and cook to reduce the liquid by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the apple/onion mixture into a bowl and set aside. Return the skillet to medium heat (again, without washing) and add the chicken broth, rosemary, sage, thyme, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Heat for a few minutes, then set aside. Add the bread to a large bowl, then add the browned sausage, mushrooms and apple/onion mixture (and any juice that might have accumulated). Next, add the broth mixture gradually as you toss the ingredients, being prepared not to use all of the liquid according to your taste. Check the seasonings at the end and add in minced parsley. Pour into a large baking dish (I used an iron skillet) and bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes. (Or you can stuff the turkey if you&#39;re into that kind of thing.)

Cook, turning once halfway through, until golden brown, about 25 minutes. For the easy hollandaise: In a small saucepan, melt the butter until sizzling. Put the egg yolks in a blender and turn to low to allow the yolks to combine. Begin pouring in the very hot butter in a thin stream; the blender should remain on the whole time, and the butter should be poured in very slowly. Keep adding the butter until it&#39;s all gone, then immediately begin adding the lemon juice. Check the blender to make sure the sauce is still liquidy and moving easily through the blades. If not, add a little more juice and give it a stir, then blend again. Add the cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Transfer to a serving pitcher and cover with foil until serving. For the lemon and pepper seasoning: In a ziptop bag, crack the peppercorns using a rolling pin.

Then mound the remaining whipped cream in the center. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour. Garnish the top with the fresh blackberries and lemon wheels before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 69783,&quot;Ginger Mango Lassi 2 mangos 1-inch piece of ginger 2 (8-ounce) containers vanilla yogurt 1 handful of ice cubes 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: To remove the flesh of the mango, cut the flesh away from the pit in 2 large pieces. Use a paring knife to cut through the flesh (but not through the peel) in a crisscross grid pattern. Use your thumbs to press against the skin side and pop the mango cubes up. Cut across the bottom, along the peel and add the cubes to the blender. Peel ginger. Grate ginger finely into bowl. Use fingers to squeeze juice out of gratings. Discard juiced gratings. Put ginger and remaining ingredients in the blender and blend until thick and smooth. If you don&#39;t have a blender you can still make the drink: Just whisk everything but the ice together in a mixing bowl. Fill glasses with ice and pour the mixture on top. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 69784,&quot;Salami and Provolone Crustless Quiche 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan 2 cups half-and-half 2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch of paprika 1 cup grated provolone 3/4 cup diced sliced salami 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, plus more for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Place them in a deep pot and cover them with cold water. Throw in the garlic, herb sprigs, bay leaves, celery stick, potato and tomatoes. Place the beans on the heat and slowly bring to the boil. Cover with a lid and simmer very gently for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on whether you&#39;re using fresh or dried, until soft and cooked nicely. Skim if necessary, topping up with boiling water from the kettle if you need to. When the beans are cooked, drain them in a colander, reserving enough of the cooking water to cover them halfway up when put back in the pot. Remove the garlic, herbs, celery, potato and tomatoes from the beans. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and pinch the skin off the tomatoes. Put the garlic, tomatoes and potato onto a plate, mash them with a fork and stir back into the beans. Season well with salt and pepper, and pour in 3 generous glugs of extra-virgin olive oil and a few splashes of vinegar. Stir in the parsley and serve on some toasted sourdough bread. Take up to 3 scallops and wrap a slice of pancetta round each. Thread them onto a skewer or a sturdy sprig of fresh rosemary and fry them on each side in a little olive oil until golden. Spoon the delicious warm home-cooked beans onto your plate and top with the scallops. Serve with a squeeze of lemon, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and any juices from the pan.

Score the rind, using long, parallel slits 1/8 to 1/4-inch apart across the width of the loin; be careful to cut only halfway to the flesh (see Cook&#39;s Note**). Rub the rind with the salt, ensuring that the salt is rubbed well into the slits. Rub the rind with 1/2 of the olive oil. Flip the loin over and rub the flesh side with the remaining olive oil. Place the garlic, thyme, and rosemary up against the flesh. Using butcher&#39;s twine, tie the herbs to the loin. Place the loin on a rack in a roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and arrange the potatoes at the bottom of the roasting rack. Reduce the heat to 425 degrees F. Return the roast to the oven to cook for 1 additional hour or until an instant-read thermometer poked into the center of the loin reaches 150 degrees F. Remove from the oven and let the loin rest for 30 minutes; the internal temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees F, and the loin will finish cooking while it&#39;s resting (see Cook&#39;s Note***). Slice the \crackling\ (crunch skin) off in 1 piece and cut into 1/4-inch strips. Slice the pork loin into 1/4-inch slices. Serve the pork loin warm with Cracklings, Hassel Back Potatoes, and Apple Chutney. Place a potato in the palm of a wooden spoon. Use a sharp knife to make cuts 3/4 of the way down the width of each potato about 1/8-inch apart. Toss the potatoes with olive oil, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Place the potatoes in the bottom of a roasting pan, evenly spaced apart. Cook underneath the roast during the last hour of cooking, until fork tender. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with additional salt and pepper, to taste. In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and 1 tablespoon of salt and cover. Saute until onions are translucent. Add the apple cider and increase to high heat. Reduce the cider until nearly evaporated. Add the vinegar and 1 cup sugar; stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the apples and star anise. Cover and reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and continue to cook until thickened, about 10 minutes; stirring frequently. Add the 1/3 cup of remaining sugar. Remove star anise and mash until smooth. Transfer to a plate to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature with pork, chicken, or curried dishes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69789,&quot;Giant Chocolate Lava Cake 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed, plus extra for buttering the ramekin 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting the ramekin<br> 10.5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> Pinch kosher salt 6 large eggs<br> 2 chocolate-coated vanilla ice cream bars, such as Klondike<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Scatter the butter and shortening over the flour mixture and pulse until it resembles coarse meal. Gradually add 4 to 7 tablespoons ice water, pulsing until the dough just comes together. Remove the dough from the machine and lightly knead on a flat surface to form a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Position a rack in the bottom of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Make the filling: Combine the peaches, brown and granulated sugars, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, peach eau de vie and cornstarch or tapioca in a large bowl and mix until well combined. Toss the blackberries with the cassis in a separate bowl. Let sit 10 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to spoon the berries into the peach mixture and toss. Divide the chilled dough in half and roll out each half into a 13-to-14-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Transfer one of the rounds to a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Spoon the fruit into the crust using a slotted spoon; add some of the juices that have accumulated in the bowl (about 1/4 cup). Scatter the butter over the top. Roll up the remaining dough round on the rolling pin, then unroll it on top of the filling. Trim the edges of both crusts to a 3/4-inch overhang. Fold the edges over; press to seal and crimp the edges. Cut 6 slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush the top of the pie with the cream and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake on the bottom oven rack until the crust is golden and the juices bubble thickly through the slits, 1 hour, 20 minutes to 1 hour, 30 minutes. (Cover the crust&#39;s edge with foil if it browns too quickly.) Let the pie cool about 3 hours before serving.

Using 1 tablespoon of the butter, grease the souffle dish. Place 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan in the dish and shake the dish so that the cheese coats the bottom and sides.<br> In a large saucepan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking continuously, until the mixtures gets a bit foamy, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cayenne, remove the pan from the heat, whisk in the hot milk, then return the pan to the heat and simmer, whisking all the while. Add the Gruyere and the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan and cook, whisking, until the cheese melts and the mixture thickens, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the mustard, salt and pepper. Whisk in the egg yolks 1 at a time, whisking quickly until they are completely incorporated.<br> In a large metal bowl, use a large whisk or an electric mixer to beat the egg whites until they start to become foamy, then add the cream of tartar and continue beating until the whites form stiff peaks with a little droop at the very tip. Transfer about one-quarter of the egg whites to the yolk mixture, stir until just blended, then dump half of the rest of the whites into the yolk mixture and use a flexible spatula to gently fold them in. Repeat with the rest of the whites, folding just until barely blended with a few streaks of white remaining.<br> Turn the mixture into the prepared souffle dish, smooth the top and run your thumb around the inside rim to remove any bits of Parmesan and also to allow the souffle to rise to its fullest height. Bake until the top has risen about 2 inches above the rim and barely jiggles a bit when you lightly shake the dish, 25 to 30 minutes.<br> Serve immediately. Use a large spoon and make sure every serving includes some of the crusty outside and top and the creamier interior. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 69804,&quot;Spicy Cocktail Salsa 4 plum tomatoes, cored and seeded 1 scant tablespoon Tabasco sauce 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 1 tablespoon brown sugar, firmly packed 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place all of the ingredients in a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade.

Add the sour cream and vanilla and beat until well combined. Stir in the miniature chocolate chips. Divide the batter among the prepared cupcake tins, filling only halfway full. Bake the cupcakes for 15 to 17 minutes, until they spring back when touched and a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean. While the cupcakes bake, prepare the buttercream. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the sugar and the butter on medium-low speed until well blended. Add the vanilla and whipping cream and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, until light, spreadable and fluffy. Beat in the cherry preserves until well incorporated. When the cupcakes have finished baking, let sit in the pans for 2 minutes and then transfer the cupcakes to wire racks to cool for 10 minutes more. While the cupcakes cool, transfer the buttercream to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Alternatively, you can frost the cupcakes with a knife or offset spatula. When the cupcakes have cooled, pipe the buttercream in decorative swirls on top of the cupcake (or swirl with a spatula). Garnish the top of each cupcake with a malted milk ball or cherry and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69806,&quot;Caramel Lady Apples and Seckel Pears 12 natural licorice sticks or bamboo skewers, each 6 inches long 6 Lady apples, stems removed 6 Seckel pears, stems removed 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup water 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 piece lemon peel, about 2 inches long and 1-inch wide 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Instructions: Insert a licorice stick or bamboo skewer into the stem end of each apple and pear. Reserve. In a medium heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, lemon juice, lemon peel and vanilla extract. Cook, stirring, until the sugar melts. Increase the heat to high and cook until the mixture is golden amber in color. (Do not stir the mixture once you have stirred the mixture.) Remove the caramel from the heat. One at a time, dip the apples and pears in the caramel, twirling and swirling them to coat completely. Transfer the coated fruit to a wire rack and let the caramel harden, about 10 to 15 minutes. Continue dipping the apples and pears until all have been coated with the caramel. Store the caramel apples in pears in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator), wrapped in cellophane if desired, until ready to serve up to 2 days.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 69807,&quot;White-Chocolate Grasshopper Pie 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 1/2 cups chocolate wafer crumbs (about 30 cookies) 2 1/2 ounces white chocolate 1 cup heavy cream 1 envelope unflavored gelatin (2 1/2 teaspoons) 1/4 cup milk 2 large egg yolks 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 cup creme de menthe 1/2 teaspoons peppermint extract, for extra zip Chocolate curls or sprinkles Instructions: For the Chocolate Wafer Crust: Coat a 9-inch pie pan with 2 teaspoons of the butter. In a food processor, chop the chocolate cookies into fine crumbs. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in the rest of the melted butter. Pat the mixture over the bottom and sides of the pan. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Bake the pie crust for 8 to 10 minutes, until set and dry. Place on a rack to cool. For the Grasshopper Filling: Finely chop the white chocolate and put it in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, over medium heat, bring 1/2 cup of the cream just to a simmer. Pour it over the chocolate and stir with a whisk until smooth and blended. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of cream and refrigerate for 30 minutes, until completely chilled. Whip to soft peaks, about 2 minutes, and place in the refrigerator until ready to use. In a small bowl, soften the gelatin by stirring in into the milk. Set aside. Combine the yolks, eggs, and sugar in a medium bowl or double boiler and place it over a pan of slowly boiling water. Whisk until very hot to the touch but not scrambled (160 degrees). Remove the bowl from the heat and continue to whisk (you may switch to an electric mixer) until mixture is thick, double in volume, and, when tipped from a spoon, holds a ribbon shape for 2 seconds, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the creme de menthe and/or peppermint extract, if using. Set the bowl of the gelatin over the pan of simmering water until gelatin has dissolved, about 1 minute, then whisk it into the egg mixture. Set aside to cool down to tepid. Whip the white chocolate cream until just thickened, then fold it into the egg mixture. Scrape the filling into the pie shell and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or overnight. Garnish with chocolate curls or sprinkles. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69808,&quot;Sesame Balls with Red Bean Paste and Bananas 1/3 cup brown sugar 2 cups glutinous rice flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup sweetened red bean paste 1/2 large ripe banana, cut into 12 small pieces 1/2 cup white sesame seeds, plus more if needed Vegetable or peanut oil, for frying Instructions: Dissolve the brown sugar in 1/3 cup boiling water. Once the sugar is dissolved, add in 1/3 cup cold water to bring down the temperature. In a large mixing bowl, add the rice flour and make a well in the center. Stir in the brown sugar water and stir to combine. Once combined, knead the dough in the bowl for 5 minutes and shape into a ball. Dough should be soft, pliable and smooth; add more flour or water if need be to adjust the consistency. Roll the dough into a log, and then divide the log into 12 even pieces. Dust your hands with a little rice flour and form each piece into a ball roughly the size of a large walnut. With the palm of your hands, flatten the dough balls into disks. Place 1/4 teaspoon red bean paste and a piece of banana in the center of each of the disks. Gather the sides toward the center and pinch close. Gently roll in the palms of your hands to reshape into a ball. Repeat with the remaining balls. Once all the balls are filled and formed, roll in the sesame seeds to coat thoroughly. Heat 3 inches of oil in a pot or wok to 350 degrees F, or until a piece of dough browns in 15 seconds. Deep-fry the sesame seed balls, a few at a time, until the sesame seeds are golden and the balls float to the surface, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Best served warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 69809,&quot;Panna Cotta with Fresh Berries 1 cup whole milk 1 tablespoon unflavored powdered gelatin 3 cups whipping cream 1/3 cup honey 1 tablespoon sugar Pinch salt 2 cups assorted fresh berries Instructions: Place the milk in a small bowl.

Heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Break the beef into large chunks with a wooden spoon. When the beef is browned all over, about 2 minutes, add the mushrooms, 2/3 of the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook for 3 minutes, then fold in the spinach to wilt, about 1 minute. This mixture should be relatively dry. Remove to a large bowl to cool completely. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil and garlic and another pinch of crushed red pepper to the skillet. Stir for a minute to lightly brown the garlic, then add the tomatoes and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Simmer until thick, about 6 minutes. Reheat this sauce when ready to serve with the calzones. Divide the pizza dough into 4 balls. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. On a well-floured surface, roll out each rested ball into a 6- or 7-inch circle 1/8 inch thick. On the bottom half of each circle, mound a quarter of the cooled beef mixture, top with 3 tablespoons of the mozzarella, fold over the top half of the dough to form a semicircle and pinch the edges to seal. Carefully transfer the calzones with a spatula to the prepared baking sheet. Lightly brush with the beaten egg. Cut 2 small slits on top of each to vent steam. Bake the calzones in the oven on the hot pizza stone or baking sheet until golden brown, about 22 minutes. Serve with the heated tomato sauce on the side. Stir together the warm water, honey and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Whisk the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl. Add the foamy yeast mixture and olive oil and mix together with a stiff rubber spatula. Form the dough into a uniform ball in the center of the bowl. Be sure to scrape and use any dough stuck to the sides. The dough will be very sticky at this stage. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on a clean, dry work surface. Scrape the dough onto the floured surface and knead for a couple of minutes, working in just enough flour to make the dough less sticky but still moist to the touch. Form the dough into 1, 2 or 4 balls, for large, medium and small pizzas. Place the dough ball(s) on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes. The dough can then be shaped and cooked as desired or wrapped well and frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw frozen dough at room temperature, shape and cook as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 69814,&quot;Ground Lamb Kebabs with Sumac Relish 2 onions, very thinly sliced 2 tablespoons sumac 2 pounds ground lamb 2 onions, finely chopped 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon kirmizi biber 1 egg white Salt 4 to 6 poblano chiles Flat bread or pitas Melted butter 4 to 6 tomatoes, halved Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the onions and sumac and toss well. Set aside until ready to serve. In a large bowl, combine the lamb, onions, parsley, garlic, and kirmizi biber, and mix thoroughly, kneading with your hand. Add the egg white and salt, and knead mixture to a paste. Divide it into 4 equal portions, and roll each portion into a flat, sausage shape. Wipe kebab skewers with oil, and using a dampened hand gently squeeze meat against the skewer. Secure meat onto skewer by squeezing mixture up and down, spreading it evenly and making sure it is firmly attached to the skewer. Preheat a grill to medium high heat and brush it with oil. Roast the poblano chiles over the grill. Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. Peel off the charred skin by hand. Cut away stems, seeds and veins, and halve them. Heat the flat bread or pita until warm but not crisp, cut into cubes and wrap in foil to keep warm. Grill the kebabs, brushing them with the melted butter, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Grill the tomato halves at the same time. To serve, place the bread cubes on a serving platter or individual plates, drizzle with melted butter, remove meat from skewers and place over bread. Top with roasted peppers and tomatoes, drizzle with more butter, and serve immediately with the sumac relish. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 69815,&quot;Eggplant and Sausage Pasta Salad Kosher salt 1 pound bowtie (farfalle) pasta<br> 2 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup olive oil 1 medium eggplant (1 pound), cut into 1-inch cubes<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 3/4 pound Italian turkey sausage, casings removed<br> 1 pint (10 ounces) grape tomatoes, sliced in half<br> 4 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1/2 large lemon, juiced<br> 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives, roughly chopped<br> 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

With the tip of a knife, make 8 (2-inch) pockets all around the pork and insert a smashed garlic clove in each. In a small bowl, combine the seafood boil seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Rub the seasoning all over the pork then let rest at room temperature up to 2 hours. Place the pork in the bottom of a roasting pan and add enough vegetable stock to fill it to an inch deep. Cover very tightly with several layers of aluminum foil, getting the seal tight is really key here. The steam being locked in breaks down the pork to make it pull-worthy. Roast the pork, covered, in the oven for 2 hours then pull back the aluminum foil a bit and prick with a fork. If it is tender, remove the aluminum foil and a place back in the oven for 1 more hour. If it isn&#39;t tender yet, cook for 30 minutes to 1 hour more, making sure to add more stock if needed. Once tender remove the aluminum foil all together.

Remove and discard the stems from the mustard greens and pile the greens together. Slice into 1-inch-wide ribbons. Add half of the olive oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the couscous. Cook until browned and toasty, 3 to 4 minutes, shaking the skillet occasionally to get even browning. Transfer to a bowl until the water is boiling. Once boiling, add the couscous and cook until tender, about 13 minutes. Save 1/2 cup of the cooking water and drain the couscous. Add the remaining olive oil and the garlic to the same skillet. Stir constantly until the garlic begins to brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stir in the greens and ham all at once, season with salt and pepper and cook until the greens have wilted and the ham is warm, about 2 minutes. Add the couscous to the skillet along with the reserved cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time; the mixture should appear loose but not soupy. Serve as a main dish or as a side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 69829,&quot;Confetti Corn 2 tablespoons butte 1/2 red bell pepper, diced 1/2 green bell pepper, dice 2 cups frozen corn 1/4 cup water Salt Pepper Instructions: Melt butter in sauce pan and cook diced peppers over medium heat for 4 minutes. Stir in corn and water. Cover and cook for 6-8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69830,&quot;Oeufs a la Neige 8 eggs whites, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup granulated sugar 8 large egg yolks 1 quart milk 1 vanilla bean Instructions: For the Simple Meringue: With a balloon whisk, beat the egg whites until soft peak. Add the sugar. Continue beating until the egg whites are glossy. The meringue should form long peaks when the whisk is lifted. Fold in the vanilla With two tablespoons, shape ovals of meringue and drop them into a large pan of simmering water. Poach them until firm, 2 to 3 minutes, turning them once. Drain them on paper towels. For the Creme Anglaise: Whisk egg yolks and sugar until ribboned. The mixture should be thick, smooth and homogenous. Pour the milk into a 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place it over medium-high heat. Use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthtwise. Separate the seeds from the skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the mixture and bring to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk mixture by carefully pouring about one third of the milk into the egg mixture. Whisk immediate to keep the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan, place over medium heat, and cook, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula. The liquid will begin to thicken. When it reaches 182 degrees and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, it is finished and should be removed from the heat. If you do not have a thermometer, you can tell that the creme anglaise is ready by using the following method: In one quick motion, dip the spatula into the creme anglaise and hold it horizontally in front of you. With the tip of your finger, wipe a clean line down the center of the spatula. If the trail keeps its shape, the creme anglaise is ready. If the trail fills with liquid, cook it for another minute and repeat the test. The objective is to remove the creme anglaise from the heat just before it boils. If the creme anglaise boils, the egg yolks will scramble. If this happens, you can still use the mixture as an ice cream base if you strain it. You will not be able to use it as a sauce, because once the eggs are scrambled, they lose their ability to hold a sauce together. Strain the creme anglaise through a chinois or fine-mesh sieve into the bowl placed in the ice bath, to remove the vanilla bean and any cooked egg. Stir occasionally to allow the creme anglaise to cool evenly. Once it has cooled completely, pour it into a clean container. Place plastic wrap directly on top of the creme anglaise to prevent a skin from forming and store in the refrigerator for up to three days. Pour the custard into a shallow bowl and pile the meringue \eggs\ in the center. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69831,&quot;Lemon-Garlic Skillet Chicken and Potatoes 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 3/4 pounds) Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 pound small red potatoes, quartered (about 8 potatoes) 1 small lemon, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices and halved 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, chopped 4 cups baby arugula Instructions: Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken skin-side down and cook until golden brown and crispy and the skin releases easily from the skillet, 6 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and flip the chicken over. Scatter the potatoes, then lemon and then the garlic around the chicken. Add 1 cup water, red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook until the potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes.

In a bowl stir the salt and water together and add flour for some extra binding. Froth up the egg whites with a fork, add to the salt and flour and blend until the mixture forms a stiff paste resembling wet snow while holding its shape when you squeeze it together. Spread the mixture to form a salt bed in the bottom of a large roasting pan, and lay the roast on top, fat-side down. Cover it all over with the rosemary, thyme and cracked black peppercorns, pressing into the roast to make sure it adheres well. Coat it completely with the salt dough, patting it well so that when it roasts it will solidify into a solid casing. It needs to be about 1/4-inch thick. Roast the beef for 20 minutes per pound for medium-rare. Transfer the beef to a cutting board, let it rest for 15 minutes and then, cut the casing open and slice in between the bones for nice manly servings. You can also remove the bones and slice thinner if you want. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 69836,&quot;Vegan Pie Dough 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons vegan granulated sugar 2 tablespoons white vinegar Fine salt 1 cup unrefined virgin or extra-virgin coconut oil (packed) 8 to 10 tablespoons ice water Instructions: Put the flour, sugar, vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor, and pulse to combine. Add the coconut oil in small spoonfuls, and pulse until the largest pieces are pea-size. Add 8 tablespoons ice water, and pulse until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together; it should just hold its shape. If the mixture is very powdery, pulse in an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water. Divide the dough between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap, pat each into a 1/2-inch-thick disc and chill for at least 1 hour up to overnight. To make rolling easier, let the dough soften up a bit-it should be slightly soft when pressed-at room temperature (this may take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69837,&quot;Caramel Apple Monster Munch 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/3 cup popcorn kernels Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the bowl and spatula 1 cup salted cocktail peanuts 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter 1/4 cup light corn syrup 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups lightly crushed red and/or green apple chips Instructions: Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottom pot over medium heat until very hot and shimmering.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt 2 tablespoons butter. Toss the squash with the melted butter, maple syrup, chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste on the prepared baking sheet. Roast until golden and soft, about 20 minutes. Set aside and let cool. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and toss to coat. Cook, without stirring, until the onion begins to develop a deep brown color, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir and add the balsamic vinegar, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, until the onion mixture thickens and develops an intense sweetness, about 15 more minutes. Sandwich build! Butter 1 slice of bread. On the unbuttered side, add the ingredients in this order from the ground up: manchego, squash, caramelized onion, sliced almonds and more manchego. Close with another buttered bread slice, buttered side up. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 3 more sandwiches. Heat a heavy griddle or flat pan over medium heat. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the pan. Lightly cook each sandwich, in batches if necessary, until the cheese starts to melt, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Low and slow is the key here so you don&#39;t kill your bread before the delicious innards get gooey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 69851,&quot;Sourdough \u201cDiscard\u201d Chocolate Chip Cookies 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 2/3 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup sourdough starter discard at 100% hydration (fed equal parts flour and water) 1 cup chopped semisweet chocolate (about 5 ounces) Instructions: Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.

Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods. Tips: Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed. To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes. Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes. As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands. After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 69857,&quot;Tuna Poke 3 tablespoons Indonesian sweet soy sauce 1 tablespoon soy sauce 12 ounces sushi-grade tuna, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 4 teaspoons seaweed 4 tablespoons finely minced Vidalia onion 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Splash sesame oil Sea salt Jalapeno coins, for garnish Fried garlic chips, for garnish Instructions: Mix the soy sauces together.

Pulse 5 times. Add the butter and pulse again until the butter pieces are the size of BBs. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse just until the dough holds together. If the dough is still crumbly, add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until it reaches the right consistency. Turn the dough out onto a large piece of waxed paper. Roll the dough into a log, 9 to 10 inches long, and square off the ends. Refrigerate, well wrapped, for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. Or freeze it for up to 1 month. (You may want to cut the log in half or in thirds to freeze if you think you will want to defrost a smaller amount at a time.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To make the crackers, cut the log into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet 1-inch apart. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the crackers are a light golden color. Turn the crackers and bake for 3 to 5 more minutes, or until they are golden around the edges. Cool on a rack.

Gently float the butter atop the drink and sprinkle some nutmeg over that. &quot;,&quot;[Rum, Brandy, Port, Sherry]&quot; 69869,&quot;My Favourite Paella Olive oil 2 raw chorizo sausages (approximately 9 ounces/250 g in total), thickly sliced 11 ounces/300 g pork belly, skin removed, the best quality you can afford, cut into 1 green pepper, deseeded and roughly chopped 1 red pepper, deseeded and roughly chopped 5 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped 1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped A small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and roughly chopped, stalks finely chopped Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper A good pinch of saffron 14 ounces/400 g clams or mussels, scrubbed clean and debearded 11 ounces/300 g paella rice 7 ounces/200 g jarred red peppers in oil, drained and torn into pieces 1 (14-ounce/400 g) tin (can) chopped tomatoes 34 fluid ounces/1 litre chicken or vegetable stock, preferably organic 12 large prawns, shells on 5 1/2 ounces/150 g squid, cleaned and finely sliced 5 1/2 ounces/150 g green beans, sliced very thinly at an angle 1 lemon, cut into wedges Instructions: Heat a large wide-based pan over a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil, the sliced chorizo and the pork belly. Fry for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. As soon as the chorizo starts taking on colour and the fat is beginning to cook out of it, add the chopped green pepper, chopped red pepper, garlic, onion, and parsley stalks along with a good pinch of salt, pepper, and the saffron. Fry gently for another 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have begun to soften. Meanwhile, pick through the shellfish and get rid of any clams or mussels that aren&#39;t tightly closed. Add the rice and jarred peppers and keep stirring for a few minutes until the rice is coated in all the lovely flavours, then pour in the tinned tomatoes and 3 1/3 cups (27 ounces)/800 ml stock, seasoning again with salt and pepper. Bring everything to the boil, then turn down to a medium to low heat and stir constantly for about 15 minutes. This combination of flavours will be absolutely beautiful, but you&#39;ve got to help the dish along by doing your job and making sure each grain of rice gets the same amount of love. So every now and then, stir from the outside of the pan into the middle so you get a sort of pile of rice in the centre, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. Flatten the pile out with your spoon, then start the whole process again. After 15 minutes, the rice should be cooked, but still have a bit of a bite, so add the mussels or clams and the prawns. Keep stirring, and as the clams and mussels start to open and the prawns begin to turn pink, add your squid and green beans and cook for a further 5 minutes or so. Discard any clams or mussels that don&#39;t open. Stir in the chopped parsley leaves and the juice from 1/2 the lemon wedges, and bring to the table with the remaining lemon wedges on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Cava, Prosecco]&quot; 69870,&quot;Corn Salsa 1 15-ounce can yellow corn, drained 1 15-ounce can white corn, drained 1 4-ounce can chopped green chiles, drained 1 2.5-ounce can sliced black olives, drained 4 scallions, finely chopped 2 tomatoes, finely chopped 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped 3 tablespoons white vinegar 1/3 cup olive oil Kosher salt 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Mix the yellow and white corn, chiles, olives, scallions, tomatoes, jalapenos, vinegar, olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.

Saute until the mushrooms are tender and wilted, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the peppers and cook until they soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the mustard and move it around the pot so it basically coats everything and disappears. Add the stock and beans. Lower to a simmer and cover. Let cook, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the sprig of thyme, then add the kale, if using, and stir.

Fill the bowl with the guacamole and smooth the top with a spoon or offset spatula. Fill a squeeze bottle or pastry bag with Mexican crema or sour cream (thin it out with some lime juice if needed). Pipe 4 concentric circles of crema onto the guacamole. Using the tip of a knife or skewer, pull lines from the center circle out, creating a spider web pattern. For the spider: Slice 1 olive in half lengthwise and use one of the halves for the spider body. Slice 8 long spider legs from the remaining 1 1/2 olives. Arrange the spider on the web. Surround the bowl of guacamole with the tortilla chips. For the skull: Using a paring knife, make 2 eyes on the wide end of the avocado, cutting through the skin and flesh all the way down to the pit; discard the skin and flesh. Cut an upside-down heart shape just through the skin for the nose, then remove the skin, leaving the flesh showing. For the mouth, cut a long rectangle just through the skin and remove it.

Cut each zucchini in half crosswise. Using a melon baller, carefully scoop out zucchini flesh, leaving about 1/4 inch flesh intact on all sides and leaving zucchini closed at the bottom of each half. Reserve zucchini flesh for another use, or discard. Reserve zucchini tubes. Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring, until they are soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes more. Add ground beef, cumin, coriander and red pepper flakes and cook until meat is just done and no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes. Add bulgur, and diced tomatoes and currants and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in pine nuts and parsley. Let mixture cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Using a small spoon or clean hands, gently stuff zucchini halves with beef-mixture. Place zucchini halves in a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish.

Whisk in the white pepper and stir the mixture occasionally to make sure it does not scorch on the bottom. When the mixture reaches a simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the still-hot cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F, it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you do not have a thermometer, test it by dipping the wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Strain the mixture into a smaller bowl to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Rest the smaller bowl in the ice water and let the mixture cool, stirring often, then continue according to the directions of your ice cream maker. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 69896,&quot;The Best Turkey Meatballs 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons canola oil 3/4 cup finely ground fresh breadcrumbs (from 3 to 4 slices white bread, crusts removed) 1/2 cup milk 1 pound ground turkey (93/7 ratio) 1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1 clove garlic, grated 1/4 cup packed parsley leaves, finely chopped (about 2 tablespoons chopped) 1 teaspoon dried oregano Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Place the coconut onto a folded towel set down in a large bowl. Find the 3 eyes on 1 end of the coconut and using a nail or screwdriver and hammer or meat mallet, hammer holes into 2 of the eyes. Turn the coconut upside down over a container and drain the water from the coconut. Store the water in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Place the coconut onto a 1/2 sheet pan and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. The coconut should have cracked in several places. Using an oyster knife or other dull blade, separate the hard shell from the brown husk. Using a serrated vegetable peeler, peel the brown husk from the coconut meat. Rinse the coconut meat under cool water and pat dry. Break the meat into 2 to 3-inch pieces. With the grater disk attached to a food processor, grate the coconut. Place 1 1/2 ounces of the coconut into a 1-cup glass jar with lid and pour the vodka over it. Seal and shake to combine. Place in a cool dark place for 5 to 7 days, shaking to combine every day. Strain the coconut and discard. Return the vodka to a clean jar or to its original bottle and store in a cool place for up to a year. Reserve the remaining coconut for another use. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 69906,&quot;Coconut Cake with 7-Minute Frosting 1 coconut (see Cook&#39;s Note) Vegetable oil, for cake pan 14 1/4 ounces cake flour, plus extra for pans, approximately 3 cups 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup fresh coconut milk 1/2 cup fresh coconut cream 8 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature 16 ounces sugar, approximately 2 1/4 cups 1 teaspoon coconut extract 4 egg whites 1/3 cup coconut water 3 large egg whites 12 ounces sugar, approximately 1 3/4 cups 1/3 cup coconut water 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon coconut extract 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Grated coconut from 1 coconut, approximately 8 to 10 ounces Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil 2 (9-inch) cake pans. Line the bottom of each pan with parchment paper. Oil the parchment paper and then flour the pan. Set aside. Place the flour, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Combine the coconut milk and coconut cream in small bowl and set aside. Place the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer and using the paddle attachment, cream on medium speed until fluffy, approximately 1 minute. Decrease the speed to low and gradually add the sugar slowly over 1 to 2 minutes. Once all of the sugar has been added, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides. Turn the mixer back on to medium speed and continue creaming until the mixture noticeably lightens in texture and increases slightly in volume, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the coconut extract. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture alternately with the milk mixture to the butter and sugar in 3 batches, ending with the milk mixture. Do not over mix. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the batter, just until combined. Divide the batter evenly between the pans and bang the pans on the counter top several times to remove any air and to distribute the batter evenly in the pan. Place in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 40 minutes or until the cake is light golden in color and reaches an internal temperature of 200 degrees F. Cool the cake in the pans for 10 minutes then remove and transfer to a cooling rack. Once the cakes have cooled completely cut across the equator of each to form 4 layers. Place the 1/3 cup coconut water into a small spritz bottle and spray evenly onto the cut side of the 4 layers. If you do not have a spritz bottle you may brush the coconut water on with a silicone pastry brush. Allow to sit while preparing the frosting. For the frosting: Bring 1 quart of water to a boil in a 4-quart saucepan over high heat. Decrease the heat to medium to maintain a steady simmer. In the meantime, place the egg whites, sugar, coconut water, cream of tartar and salt into a medium size-mixing bowl. Place the bowl over the simmering water and immediately begin beating with an electric hand mixer set to low speed. Beat for 1 minute and then increase the speed to high and continue to beat for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and beat in the coconut and vanilla extracts for 1 minute. Allow the frosting to sit for 5 minutes before using. Place approximately 3/4 cup of the frosting on the first layer of cake, sprinkle with 1/2 cup coconut and top with the next layer. Repeat until you reach the top layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake and sprinkle with the remaining coconut. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 69907,&quot;Streusel 3/4 cup (102 grams) all-purpose flour 1/3 cup (67 grams) sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons; 3 ounces; 85 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: To make the streusel: Put the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl and mix everything together by running the ingredients through your fingers. Drop in the butter and squeeze and rub the cubes into the mixture until you have a sandy mix. If you press a little streusel together, you&#39;ll get lumps, which is just what you want. Drizzle the vanilla over the streusel and toss, squeeze and rub to distribute it. Cover the bowl and chill the streusel until needed.

While the motor is running, add water in tablespoon increments until dough comes together to form a ball. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and shape into a flat disk. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or at least for 1 hour. Remove pie crust from refrigerator and preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the pie crust on a lightly floured surface to fit a deep 9 or 10-inch pie pan. Place the dough in the pie pan and crimp edges decoratively. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes, then line with aluminum foil. Fill with pie weights and blind bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly golden around the edges. Remove foil and pie weights and return to the oven for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the surface of pie crust with a light coating of egg white and allow to cool. For the filling: In a saute pan melt the remaining tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat. Add the ham, or bacon, and cook until browned. Using a slotted spoon, remove the ham from the pan and drain briefly on paper towels, then scatter ham over the bottom of the blind-baked crust. To the fat remaining in the pan, add the sliced onions and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are very soft and lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes. Scatter the onions over the bacon in the pie crust and top with the grated cheese. In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Pour the egg mixture over the ham, onions, and cheese in the pie shell, adding just enough of the egg mixture to come within 1/4-inch of the top of the shell. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the custard is set and quiche is golden brown on top. Allow to cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 69918,&quot;Indoor-Grilled Salmon Four 5-ounce center-cut salmon fillets (about 1-inch-thick), skin-on 2 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring the salmon to room temperature 20 minutes before grilling.<br> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Set a large cast-iron grill pan over low heat and pre-heat for 1 minute.<br> Meanwhile, brush the salmon lightly with the oil and season with salt and pepper.<br> Raise the heat under the grill pan to medium-high. Place the salmon, skin-side up on the grill, at an angle across the ridges of the pan. Cook until the fish has distinctive grill marks, about 3 minutes. To make cross-hatched grill marks, use a spatula to re-position the fillets about 45 degrees (keep the skin-side up). Cook 2 minutes more. Turn the salmon over, and transfer the grill pan to the oven. Continue cooking the fish in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes for pink inside, 5 minutes for medium, and 7 minutes for well done.<br> Remove the fish from the pan, and let rest for 2 minutes, to finish cooking.

Lay a butterflied chicken breast, cut side up, on the plastic wrap. Fold the plastic wrap over to cover. Using a meat pounder, pound out the thicker parts of the breast so that it&#39;s uniformly thick. Fold the plastic wrap open and brush the chicken breast with the molasses; season with generous pinches of fennel, salt and pepper. (This will be the inside part of the breast that gets stuffed.) Fold the plastic wrap back over and flip the breast over. Fold plastic wrap open and season the other side of the breast with salt and pepper. (This is the outside that will later get seared in the pan.) Re-cover with the plastic wrap and place on a plate. Repeat this process with the remaining chicken breasts. Refrigerate for 1 hour or up to overnight. Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper, and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and pecans, and cook another 2 minutes. Add the tarragon and cook another minute. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Remove a butterflied breast from the plastic wrap. Place it on a cutting board, molasses-side up. Place 1/4 cup of the filling on half of the chicken breast. Fold over the other half to enclose the filling. Using a bamboo skewer, close up the opening by threading the skewer through one end of the opening to the other to secure. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts and filling. Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the stuffed chicken breasts and cook for about 3 minutes per side, until nicely browned. Add the wine, chicken broth and crushed tomatoes. Turn down the heat to low, cover, and poach until the chicken is cooked through, another 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, remove the skewers, cover the chicken with foil and let rest for 5 minutes. While chicken is resting, turn up the heat on the poaching liquid to medium, add the crushed red pepper, and let simmer until thickened and reduced by a third, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Strain the sauce into a small pot and keep warm over low heat until ready to serve. To serve: Slice the chicken, if desired, and arrange on a serving platter. Pour some sauce over the top. Serve immediately, with extra sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69923,&quot;Bermuda Fish Cakes 3 ounces chopped onion 1/2-ounce chopped garlic 1 tablespoon olive oil 1-ounce curry powder 1-ounce fresh chopped thyme 1-ounce fresh chopped parsley 1 pound cooked, roughly smashed potatoes 8 ounces salted cod fish (soaked and rinsed 3 times over the previous 24 hours in the refrigerator, poached in water for 8 minutes) Salt and pepper, to taste Cream 2 ounces flour Oil, for frying Instructions: In a heavy bottom pan, saute the onion and garlic until cooked.

Swirl the pot over the burner to dissolve the sugar completely. Do not stir. Increase the heat and boil to soft-ball stage (235 to 240 degrees). Use a candy thermometer for accuracy. Wash down the inside wall of the pot with a wet pastry brush. This will help prevent sugar crystals from forming around the sides, falling in and causing a chain reaction. Prepare your meringue. In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the eggs whites on low speed until foamy. Add the cream of tartar, increase the speed to medium, and beat until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, pour the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream over fluffed egg whites. Beat until the egg whites are stiff and glossy. Spread the meringue over a hot cake or pie, and bake as directed.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/teaspoon chopped fresh thyme.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/teaspoon%20cayenne%20pepper.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>teaspoon cayenne pepper</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/teaspoon%20chopped%20rosemary.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>teaspoon chopped rosemary</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
