large pinch saffron 1 lemon, zested 1 bay leaf 1 cup water 4 extra-large (U-10) shrimp head-on unpeeled 1 dozen littleneck clams 1 cup cooked or canned cannellini beans, drained 2 cups escarole leaves, washed and torn into pieces Instructions: Coat a large saucepan with extra-virgin olive oil and bring to a medium-high heat. Add the diced onion, season with salt, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the fennel and crushed red pepper and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat for 1 to 2 more minutes. The veggies should look soft and wilted, be very aromatic, but not have any color. Add the white wine and cook until it has reduced by half. Stir in the tomatoes, saffron, lemon zest, bay leaf, and 1 cup of water. Taste for seasoning, and season with salt. It should not taste done but it should taste good. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes. Taste again; it should taste really good now. Add some more salt, if needed, (it probably will). Turn off the heat and reserve. Coat a large skillet with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Season the shrimp generously with salt. When the oil is sizzling, add the shrimp and cook them on both sides until they turn pink, about 1 minute on each side. Remove the shrimp from the pan to a plate and reserve. Remove the oil from the pan and put over medium-high heat. Add the clams and the cooked tomato mixture. Cover and cook until the clams begin to open, about 5 minutes. If the tomato mixture starts to become too thick add some water. Taste to make sure it tastes good and season with some salt, if needed. Add the beans, escarole, and the cooked shrimp. Cover and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the clams and shrimp from the pan to a bowl. Spoon the tomatoes and beans into 2 large bowls. Arrange the shrimp and clams on top. Garnish with the reserved fennel fronds and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Call yourself a super star! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 61824,&quot;English Breakfast One 14.5-ounce can white beans, drained 2 tablespoons ketchup 1 tablespoon maple syrup 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard 3 strips bacon, chopped Kosher salt Canola oil, as needed 4 large button mushrooms, halved 1 Roma tomato, sliced 2 black pudding sausage links 2 thick-cut slices brioche 4 large eggs Freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup arugula leaves 2 tablespoons sliced fresh chives 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: For the beans: Add the beans, ketchup, maple syrup, Worcestershire, mustard, bacon and 2 teaspoons salt to a small pot, bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Heat an indoor grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush lightly with canola oil. Arrange the mushrooms and tomatoes on the pan and sprinkle with salt. Grill until they begin to brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until just heated through. Remove from the heat and set aside. Add the sausage links to the pan. Cook, turning as needed, until crispy and browned on all sides and cooked through in the center, about 7 minutes. Set aside and keep warm. Grill the brioche until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Add enough canola oil to coat the bottom of a large nonstick skillet and heat over medium. Crack the eggs into the skillet and adjust the heat to low. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper. Cover the skillet and cook until the whites are firm but the yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes. Arrange the grilled tomatoes and mushrooms over the cooked whites of the eggs. Slide the eggs off onto a large plate. Top with the arugula leaves, sprinkle with most of the chives and drizzle with the extra-virgin olive oil. Serve the black pudding and toast on a side dish and the beans in a small cast-enamel pot. Sprinkle the beans with the remaining chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 61825,&quot;Ruston Peach Crumb Pie and Vanilla Ice Cream 1 1/2 cups water 3/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar, divided 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon nutmeg Pinch of black pepper 2 pounds peaches, peeled, pitted and cut into wedges (about 3 cups) 1/2 cup flour 1 cup ground pecan pieces 1/2 stick butter, cut into small pieces 1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust Vanilla Ice Cream, recipe follows 1 quart of heavy cream 2 cups sugar 8 egg yolks 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a saucepan, combine the water, 1/2 cup brown sugar, cornstarch, salt, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of grated nutmeg, and pepper, whisk until smooth. Place the pan over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Place the peaches in a mixing bowl and pour the syrup over the peaches. Toss well and cool for 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, remaining nutmeg, 1/4 cup brown sugar, flour, pecans, and butter. Using your fingers, work the mixture together until it resembles a coarse crumb-like mixture. Pour the peaches into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the topping over the top of the peaches. Bake for 1 hour, or until the crust is golden. Remove the pie from the oven and cool for 15 minutes before slicing. Serve each slice, warm, with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. In a saucepan, combine the cream and sugar. Whisk until smooth. Place the pan over medium heat and bring to a gentle boil. In small mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, vanilla, and remaining 2 teaspoons of cinnamon together. Add 1 cup of the hot liquid to egg yolks. Whisk until smooth. Whisk the egg mixture back into the hot cream. Continue to cook for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool completely. Strain the liquid. Pour the liquid into the electric ice cream container and process according to manufacturer&#39;s directions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 61826,&quot;Mama&#39;s Red Tamales 4 large size pork shoulder roasts (about 24 pounds) 8 tablespoons garlic salt 4 pounds New Mexico dried chili pods Whole cumin seeds, crushed (about 4 tablespoons after crushing) Salt, to taste 3 to 4 bags dried cornhusks, cleaned and soaked in water 25 pounds prepared masa Instructions: Prepare pork roasts by boiling the meat with about 2 tablespoons of garlic salt per roast. Use as many pots as you need to accommodate the roast. Cook the meat until fork tender and comes apart with no resistance. This usually takes about 2 hours. Reserve pork broth. Pull meat apart into chunks and refrigerate until ready to use. While the meat is cooking, clean dried chilies by removing the tops and discarding the seeds. Place pods into a bath of water and soak for a few minutes. While pods are soaking, fill a large pot halfway with water. Place your clean chili pods in the water and push them down until the water covers all. Bring to a boil and then simmer 34 to 45 minutes. When done, remove from heat. Transfer small bunches of the tender chili pods to a blender and blend on high until the pods turn to a liquid mixture. (The seed and skins will make the mixture seem a little chunky but that will be removed in a food mill.) Pour the chili sauce into a food mill which should be attached to a bowl or saucepan. Run the sauce through the mill until no more liquid is left in the top of the mill. Discard the leftover seeds and skin. Repeat this process for the remaining chili sauce until all of it has been run through the food mill. Next, add the ground cumin to the chili sauce. This sauce uses quite a bit of salt; add small amounts at a time, to taste. Once chili sauce is properly seasoned, add pork to the chili sauce. Stir until thoroughly mixed. No need to heat, just put the mixture in the refrigerator until ready to use. Open packages of cornhusks and remove the silk from each husk. Place cornhusks into a sink filled with warm water. Let the husks soak for about 3 minutes. Remove the husks from the water and place on a cookie sheet and cover with damp towel to keep moist. Prepare masa according to the directions on the package, or buy pre-made masa, available at specialty ethnic food stores. Also try calling a Mexican restaurant, they may make it for you. To soften up the masa before you work with it, add approximately 2 cups of the reserved pork broth. Once softened, divide masa into deep bowls amongst the people helping. Press masa flat, down into the bowl, creating a flat surface. Take 1 cornhusk and lay it flat, add a large dollop of the masa onto the husk. Spread the masa out onto the leaf with the back of a spoon to create a thin paste like coverage, being sure to leave no holes. Place 2 tablespoons of the chili sauce/pork mixture onto the masa. (It?s best to keep a bowl of the sauce next to you at all times.) Fold the tamale bringing two sides together so that they slightly overlap, then fold the bottom up over the folded sides. Press down slightly on top of tamale while holding everything in place and the masa will act as a glue to seal the filling. Place tamales standing upright into a large double steamer. Steam for 2 hours. Remove tamales from steamer and let stand about 5 minutes. Pull off husk and eat. If desired, tamales may be frozen in plastic storage bags. To steam frozen tamales, just add 1 hour to the cooking time. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 61827,&quot;Four-Way Slow Cooker Shredded Beef 1 beef Shoulder Roast, Arm Chuck Roast Boneless or Blade Chuck Roast Boneless (2 to 2-1/2 pounds) 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (optional) 1 large onion, chopped 2 tablespoons minced garlic Salt and pepper Instructions:</p><ol><li>For optional browning, heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot.

Butter a deep 9 by 2-inch pie plate. Drizzle the crushed vanilla wafers with the melted butter and stir until blended. Press on the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate. Pop in the oven and bake until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 30 minutes. Toss the banana slices with the orange juice, making sure all the slices get coated. (This helps keep the bananas from browning.) Place the slices on a paper towel-lined plate and pat any excess juices dry. Arrange half the banana slices in a single layer over the cooled crust. Cover completely with the Chocolate Pudding, spreading it with an offset spatula or butter knife. Top with the rest of the bananas. Sprinkle the peanut brittle crumbs over the bananas. Place dollops of the Peanut Butter Cream on top, spreading it out evenly. Chill the pie in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Whip the cream until stiff peaks are just about to form. Whip in the almond extract and sugar until stiff peaks form. Take the pie out of the refrigerator. Place dollops of the whipped cream on top and spread it out evenly. Scatter pieces of peanut brittle on top and serve. Whisk the sugar, cocoa powder and flour in a bowl until there are no lumps. Crack the eggs into the bowl, add the yolks and whisk into a paste. Slowly whisk in 1 cup milk until it is fully incorporated, and then whisk in the remaining 1 cup milk. Put the milk mixture into a saucepan and put over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until it starts to look like pudding, 10 to 15 minutes. It will begin to bubble and it will hold soft peaks when you lift the whisk out. Take off the heat and cool to room temperature. Beat the cream cheese and confectioners&#39;sugar with an electric mixer until completely smooth. Add the vanilla and peanut butter, beating until fully incorporated. In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Working in batches, taking care not to deflate the whipped cream, fold a large spoonful of whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture. Fold in the remaining cream in 2 additions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61830,&quot;Cinnamon Rolls 1 loaf frozen white bread dough, thawed in refrigerator Flour, for dusting surface 1 cup packed brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 2/3 stick butter, softened 1 stick unsalted butter, softened 1 cup powdered sugar 1/3 cup cream cheese 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the lentils, garlic cloves and bay leaves with 4 cups water or just enough to cover. Bring the water to a simmer and lower the heat. Simmer the lentils, uncovered, until they are tender, 25 to 30 minutes. (If you need to add water for the lentils to finish cooking, add a little at a time \u2014there will be more flavor in the lentils if you cook them and end up with very little liquid at the end of the process.) Once the lentils are cooked but still somewhat al dente, set them aside to cool. Remove and discard the garlic cloves and the bay leaves. Season with just a touch of salt and pepper to taste. Retaste, but hold off on reseasoning until serving. Add the duck fat to a large saut pan over medium heat. Add the onions, season with salt to taste and allow them to caramelize, about 5 minutes per side.<br> When you are ready to serve, add the lentils to the sauted cipollini onions.

Add in the cooked squash and gently toss together. Remove to a plate and set aside. For the risotto: Heat the broth in a saucepan over low heat. Keep warm. Add the butter to the same skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir, cooking for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low. In 1-cup increments, begin adding the broth to the skillet, stirring to combine and gently stirring as the broth is absorbed. As soon as the liquid disappears, add in another cup to cup-and-a-half of broth. Continue this process, stirring gently as the broth incorporates and the rice starts to become tender. Add salt and pepper along the way. Taste the rice after about 5 cups of broth have been absorbed and see what the consistency is. Add another 1 to 2 cups of broth as needed to get the rice to the right consistency; it should be tender with just a little bit of \bite.<br> When the rice is tender, add in the cooked squash and kale plus the turmeric and stir gently. Add the Parmesan shavings and cream and stir until it&#39;s just combined. Taste and add more salt and pepper as needed.

In a wide shallow pan (in which the pears will fit in 1 layer - otherwise cook them in batches) put 1 1/4 cups water, the sugar, and the vanilla bean, if using. Bring to a boil, stirring every now and again to make sure the sugar dissolves, then lower the heat slightly and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the vanilla extract, if using. Put the pears into the liquid, cut side down, and raise the heat again so that the syrup boils up and the pears are covered by it. You may need to spoon the syrup over. After half a minute or so, lower the heat, then cover the pan and simmer for 10 minutes; turn the pears, cover the pan again, and simmer for another 10 minutes. Continue poaching until the pears are cooked and translucent; they should feel tender (but not soggy) when pierced. They may need more or less cooking time - it depends on the pears. Take off the heat, keep covered, and leave to cool. Now the chocolate sauce: place the chocolate, broken up into small pieces, in a thick-bottomed pan with the coffee and sugar and melt over a low heat, stirring occasionally. Then pour in the cream, still stirring, and when it is very hot pour into a warmed sauceboat or a bowl with a ladle. To serve, arrange pears cut side down on a big flat plate and pour some syrup over. (Any remaining syrup will keep in the refrigerator or freezer and can be used to pour over apples or other fruit when making pies or crumbles. You can wash the vanilla pod, wipe it and put it in a canister of sugar.) Offer with ice cream, sauce, and pistachios, if using, served separately; allow diners to help themselves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 61851,&quot;20 Clove Brisket 4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 tablespoons garlic oil 1 tablespoon oriental dry hot mustard 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 20 cloves garlic 2 (1 1/2-pound) cuts beef brisket 6 (1/2-inch) thick onion slices 2 cups beef broth (approximate) 2 cups Merlot red wine (approximate) 1 cup baby carrots 1 stalk celery, chopped Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. In a large plastic bag add Worcestershire sauce, oils, dry hot mustard, salt, peppercorns and garlic. Mix and add brisket then seal making sure marinade covers all parts of the meat. Marinate for 2 hours. In a Dutch oven or roasting pan place 3 of the onion rings in a circle to form a trivet for the brisket (if using a roasting pan place all onion rings out in a single layer). Place the garlic in the spaces not occupied by the rings, then add one slab of brisket making sure to place it evenly on top of the rings. Add another layer of onion rings then the second slab of brisket (if using roasting pan, place brisket side by side in single layer on top of onons). Pour over the remaining marinade, the broth and wine in equal parts until the meat is just covered. Cover and cook for 3 hours adding the carrots and celery 30 minutes before the end of cooking. Check the brisket a few times while cooking and add salt, as needed, and broth and wine in equal parts if the level of the liquid falls below the meat. The brisket is done when it is tender to the fork and easy to pull apart. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 61852,&quot;Broccoli, Tomato Sauce and Smoked Mozzarella 8 oz. penne 2 cups florets steamed 2 tablespoons virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 2 cups plum tomatoes, drained and purees through a food mill 2 oz. smoked mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch dice freshly grated Parmesan cheese Salt Instructions: Boil salted water and cook the pasta for 10 minutes or until aldente.

Let stand uncovered for 10 to 20 minutes, or until it begins to ferment and puff up slightly. Whisk the 2 eggs, oil, salt, and sugar into the puffed yeast slurry until the eggs are well incorporated and the salt and sugar have dissolved. With your hands or a wooden spoon, stir in the remaining 3 cups flour all at once. When the mixture is a shaggy ball, scrape it out onto your work surface and knead it until smooth and soft, no more than 10 minutes. (Soak your mixing bowl in hot water now to clean it and warm it if you would like to use if for fermenting the dough). Place the dough in the warm cleaned bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Let the dough ferment until it has at least doubled in bulk, about 2 hours, depending on the temperature in your kitchen. Line 1 or 2 large baking sheets, depending on how many breads you are making, with parchment paper or oil them. Divide the dough into 2 (1-pound) portions for loaves, 1 (1 1/2-pound) portion for a large loaf (you will have enough dough left to make 3 rolls also), or 16 (2-ounce) portions for rolls. Braid or shape them as desired, position them on the prepared sheets, and cover well with plastic wrap. Let proof until tripled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, 30 minutes before baking, arrange the oven racks in the upper and lower third positions if using 2 baking sheets, or arrange 1 rack in the upper third position if using 1 baking sheet, and remove any racks above them. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg with a pinch of salt for glazing the breads. When the loaves have tripled in size and they do not push back when gently pressed with your finger but remain indented, brush them with the egg glaze. If desired, sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds. Bake rolls for 15 to 20 minutes, the 1-pound loaves for 25 to 35 minutes, or the 1 1/2-pound loaf for 35 to 45 minutes, until very well browned. After the first 20 minutes of baking, switch the loaves from front to back so that they brown evenly. If the large loaf is browning too quickly, tent it with foil. When the loaves are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool on a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61855,&quot;Mini Bacon Quiches 1 14-ounce package refrigerated pie dough (2 sheets) All-purpose flour, for dusting 4 slices bacon 4 large eggs 1/4 cup heavy cream Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Chopped fresh chives, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350?. Roll out 1 sheet of pie dough on a lightly floured surface until very thin and about 14 inches in diameter. Cut out 12 rounds with a 2 3/4- to 3-inch cookie cutter. Repeat with the remaining sheet of pie dough. Press the rounds firmly into each cup of a 24-cup mini-muffin pan (preferably nonstick). Lightly prick the bottoms and sides with a fork. Bake the crusts until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly.<br> Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a small skillet over medium heat, turning, until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain, then finely chop. Whisk the eggs, heavy cream and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a bowl until well combined. Sprinkle the bacon in the bottom of each crust. Fill with the egg mixture and top with chives. Bake until just set, about 15 minutes (it\u2019s OK if some egg leaks through the pastry). Let cool 10 minutes, then remove from the pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 61856,&quot;Maple Baked Beans 2 pounds beans, either kidney or navy pea variety 8 (1-inch) cubes salt pork 1 Spanish onion, sliced 1 quart Bean Goop, recipe follows 2 1/2 cups very hot water 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/2 cup molasses 1/2 cup ketchup 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1/4 cup pure maple syrup (recommended: Parker&#39;s Maple Barn Pure Maple Syrup) 1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Fill a stockpot with the beans and enough cold water to cover them. Bring the water to a boil and parboil the beans for approximately 20 minutes. Drain the water and reserve for later use. Place 4 salt pork cubes and half of the onion on the bottom of the bean pot. Fill the pot 3/4 full with beans. Add the Bean Goop. Fill the rest of the pot with the reserved water. Place the remaining cubes of salt pork and onion on top of the beans. Cover first with a layer of plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil. Bake in the oven for 10 hours. Check beans at that time, blowing on them to see if the skin peels back. If so, they are finished. Time will vary depending on your oven and how long the beans were parboiled in the beginning. Cooking time could increase to as long as 12 hours total. In a large bowl or medium-size saucepan, mix the hot water with the sugars and molasses to dissolve the sugars. Then mix in all remaining ingredients. Set aside for use in the Baked Beans. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Riesling]&quot; 61857,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Sambal and Pineapple-Glazed Bacon 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 4 ounces canned crushed pineapple, drained<br> 1/4 cup sambal oelek<br> Kosher salt<br> 12 strips thick-cut bacon<br> Coarse freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Mix together the brown sugar, pineapple, sambal and a nice pinch of salt in a small bowl. Set aside. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the bacon strips on top; sprinkle with pepper.

Place the remaining carrots, onion, and celery in the center of a roasting pan just large enough to accommodate the chicken. Brush the entire chicken with the butter; season with salt and pepper. Set the bird breast-side up on top of the vegetables. Roast the chicken for 45 minutes. Then increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F., cooking until an instant-read thermometer stuck into the chicken thigh registers 160 degrees F., about 15 minutes more. Tip the chicken so the juices run into the pan. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and loosely tent with foil while making the gravy. Discard the vegetables and pour the fat and juices in the pan into a small bowl. Transfer about 2 tablespoons of the fat back into the pan, skim and discard the rest. Add the roasting juices to the broth. Place the pan directly on the burner over medium-high heat. Scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Whisk in the broth and continue to stir. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened, about 3 minutes. Pour the sauce into a gravy boat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Carve the chicken and serve with gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61871,&quot;Miso Glazed Grilled Japanese Eggplant 1/2 cup white miso (also called shiro miso) 1/4 cup cup mirin 2 tablespoons sugar 6 Japanese eggplants, halved lengthwise 1/4 cup canola oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Chopped fresh mint, for garnish Instructions: Preheat a charcoal grill or kamado-style ceramic charcoal cooker for direct grilling over high heat.

Arrange the poblanos skin-side up on a baking sheet. Add the spring onions and broil until the poblano skins are charred and the onions are blackened around the edges, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer the poblanos to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a plate and let cool 10 minutes. Rub off the skins with your fingers, then pat dry. Roughly chop the poblanos and onion bulbs, then toss with the masa harina in a medium bowl; set aside while you fry the tortillas. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a high-sided skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the tortillas, stirring, until stiff but not browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the paper towels to drain. Spread half of the fried tortillas in a 3-quart baking dish. Top with half of the poblano-onion mixture and half of each cheese. Layer the remaining tortillas, poblano-onion mixture and cheeses on top. Whisk the eggs and milk in a large bowl; whisk in 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, pepper to taste and the chili powder. Pour the egg mixture into the baking dish. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Remove the dish from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking and uncover. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until they are translucent and beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the chardonnay, bring to a lively simmer, and reduce until only about 2 tablespoons of liquid remains. Add the cream and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and reduce to 2/3 cup. Remove from the heat, stir in the white pepper, and set aside. Preheat the oven broiler to 500 degrees F. Arrange the top oven rack so a roasting pan will fit below the heating element. Prepare appetizer plates by placing a bed of rock salt on each, to hold the oysters. Distribute the rock salt evenly between to roasting pans large enough to hold the oysters. If the fishmonger shucked your oysters, return the oysters to their cleaned shells one by one, and add about 1/2 teaspoon of the oyster liquid to each, nesting the shells carefully in the rock salt so the contents don&#39;t spill. Otherwise, arrange freshly shucked oysters in the rock salt-filled roasting pans, ensuring that their liquid doesn&#39;t spill. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the shallot-cream mixture on top of each oyster. Coat each oyster well, without having the shell overflow with liquid. Put one roasting pan in the oven and broil just until the liquid bubbles and the oysters&#39; edges begin to curl, about 3 minutes, watching closely to prevent burning. Repeat with the other roasting pan. Carefully lift 4 oysters in their shells onto each appetizer plate. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 61875,&quot;Jerk Chicken Thighs with Tropical Chutney 2 tablespoons ground allspice 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons garlic powder<br> 1 tablespoon onion powder<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1 cup orange juice 4 tablespoons olive oil<br> 3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (8 to 10 thighs)<br> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1/4 cup honey<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1 cup medium-diced mango<br> 1 cup medium-diced papaya<br> 1 cup medium-diced pineapple<br> 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1 jalapeno, small-diced<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: For the jerk chicken: In a gallon-size ziptop bag, mix together the allspice, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, cumin, ginger, nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne, cinnamon, cloves, orange juice and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.

Pour them on a pan or tray lined with several thicknesses of paper towel to drain for 5 minutes. Hull the strawberries with the point of a stainless steel paring knife, then slice them into a bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar and lemon juice, then set aside, covered at room temperature for an hour or two. Whip the cream (add a couple of tablespoons of sugar, if you like) until it holds a soft peak, cover and refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and set rack in the middle level. In a food processor combine the self-rising flour and sugar and pulse to mix. Add the butter, cut into 8 to 10 pieces, and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and make a well in the center. With a fork stir in the buttermilk, being careful not to over work the dough. Let the dough stand for a minute or 2 to let the flours absorb the liquid. Flour the work surface and turn the dough out onto it. Fold the dough over on itself 2 or 3 times, until it is smooth and less sticky. For a large shortcake, pat the dough into a 9-inch disk on parchment-lined cookie sheet. For individual shortcakes, pat the dough into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle and cut into 8 (3-inch) biscuits with a sharp, floured round cutter. Transfer to a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Paint the tops with the buttermilk and sprinkle with the sugar. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until well risen and golden brown. Check the center of the large shortcake with a toothpick to make sure it has baked through. If the pick emerges with dough clinging to it, lower temperature to 350 degrees and bake another 5 minutes. Slide the large shortcake onto a platter immediately after it is baked. Use a sharp, serrated knife to slice through the middle, making two layers. Slide the edge of a cookie sheet between the two layers and lift the top layer off. Butter the bottom layer and pour on all but 1/2 cup of the berries. Slide the top back on and pour the remaining berries on the top. Split the small shortcakes in the same way and place the bottoms on individual dessert plates. Butter them and top with about 1/3 cup berry mixture. Replace tops and pour a tablespoon or so on the top. Serve immediately, passing the cream in a bowl for the guests to help themselves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61883,&quot;Lobster Boil Kosher salt 5 small onions, quartered<br> 1 large bulb fennel, trimmed and thinly sliced<br> 20 small tri-colored potatoes<br> 1/2 head garlic<br> One 12-ounce bottle light beer, such as pilsner<br> 1 pound kielbasa sausage, cut into 2-inch pieces<br> 12 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 4 ears corn, husked Four 1 1/2-pound live lobsters<br> 2 1/2 pounds fresh hard-shelled clams, such as littlenecks<br> Salted butter, melted, for serving<br> Lemons, cut into wedges, for serving<br> Crusty bread, for serving<br> Instructions: In the bottom of a steamer pot, put 4 cups water and 2 tablespoons salt.

Add the onion and cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the thyme sprigs, bay leaf, cayenne, 1 cup of the potato, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper and cook, stirring, until the potatoes are well coated, 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in the broth and 1 1/2 cups water and bring to a simmer. Reserve two florets (about 2 inches in diameter) of the cauliflower. Add the fennel and the remaining cauliflower and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a simmer. Remove from the heat and let cool at least 5 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme and bay leaf and stir in the parsley. Carefully puree until smooth with a handheld immersion blender or in 2 to 3 batches in a blender (do not fill the blender more than halfway full per batch). Meanwhile, place the remaining 1/4 cup potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and heat in the microwave for 4 minutes. Carefully unwrap and set aside to cool. Slice the reserved cauliflower florets thinly, about 1/8 inch thick. (You need about 12 pieces.) Heat 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower pieces in a single layer and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip the pieces over and cook until tender and golden brown on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the same skillet. Add the microwaved potato and season with salt. Cook, stirring, until golden brown all over, 8 to 10 minutes. Reheat the soup if necessary. Adjust the consistency and seasoning with water, salt and pepper. Serve hot sprinkled with some pan-fried cauliflower and potato and fresh parsley leaves. Note: When blending hot liquid, first let it cool for 5 minutes or so, then transfer it to a blender, filling only halfway. Put the lid on, leaving one corner open. Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters and pulse until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 61886,&quot;Lemon-Garlic Chicken Thighs 8 chicken thighs with bones and skin, about 3 1/2 pounds 1 3/4 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup olive oil 3 cups thinly sliced onions 30 cloves (about 2 heads) garlic, peeled and smashed 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1 bay leaf 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 1/2 cups chicken broth 1 pound angel hair pasta 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves, plus more for garnish 3 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Season the chicken thighs with 1 1/4 teaspoons of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the freshly ground pepper. Place the flour in a shallow dish. Lightly dredge the chicken in the flour and set aside. In a large wide saute pan with 2 to 3-inch sides, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the thighs and brown well on both sides, about 6 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. Add the onions to the oil and cook, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the chicken until wilted, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, crushed red pepper, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the bay leaf and cook 1 minute. Add the lemon juice, chicken broth, and browned chicken thighs to the pan. Bring the mixture to a simmer, cover tightly, and place in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, remove the lid and cook an additional 15 minutes, or until cooked through and tender. While the chicken is baking, cook the pasta until al dente, 4 to 5 minutes for dry pasta. Drain well and toss in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons of the parsley and the butter. To serve, place a portion of pasta in the center of 4 large plates. Arrange 2 thighs around each serving of pasta and drizzle lemon garlic cooking liquid over the pasta.

In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, 1 teaspoon cornstarch and baking soda. Slice the beef against the grain into thin strips and add it to your marinade. Let it sit for at least 20 minutes, or as long as overnight in the refrigerator. In a separate small bowl, stir together the stock, rice wine, oyster sauce and remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch until the cornstarch is fully dissolved. Heat a wok or large skillet on high heat and add the oil. When a wisp of white smoke appears, toss the marinated beef and garlic into the pan. Cook for about 1 minute, continually moving the beef so it browns on all sides but is still rare. Once the beef is seared, add the broccoli and cook for an additional minute. Stir in the sauce and keep it all moving. Don&#39;t be afraid to scrape any bits off the bottom of the pan before they start to burn. Once the sauce has turned into a nice thick glaze, about 1 minute, serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 61889,&quot;Focaccia with Rosemary and Olive Oil Topping 1 oz. fresh yeast or 3/4 oz. active dry yeast 2 tablespoons honey (or sugar) Just over 2 cups tepid water Just over 1 lb. bread flour (3 1/2 to 4 cups) Just over 1 lb. durum semolina flour 2 tablespoons salt Some extra flour and semolina for dusting Instructions: This is my favorite Italian flatbread. Stage 1: Dissolve the yeast and honey (or sugar) in half the tepid water. Stage 2: On your largest available clean surface (even a big bowl will do if surfaces are limited), make a pile of flour in the center of the flour, semolina flour, and salt. With one hand, make a well in the center. (If possible, it is preferable to warm the flour and semolina flour.) Stage 3: Pour all the dissolved yeast mixture into the well and with four fingers of one hand make circular movements, from the center working outward, slowly bringing in more and more of the dry ingredients until all the yeast mixture is soaked up. Then pour the other half of the tepid water into the center and gradually incorporate all the flour to make a moist dough. (Certain flours may need a little more water, so don&#39;t be afraid to adjust the quantities.) Stage 4: Kneading! This is the best bit, just rolling, pushing and folding the dough over and over for 5 minutes. This develops the structure of the dough and the gluten. If any of the dough sticks to your hands, just rub them together with a little extra flour. (You can do Stages 2, 3 and 4 in an electric mixer if you like, using the dough hook attachment.) Stage 5: Flour both your hands now, and lightly flour the top of the dough. Make it into a roundish shape and place on a baking tray. Score the dough with a knife--this allows it to relax and proof (rise) more quickly. Stage 6: Leave the bread to rise for the first time. Basically, we want it to double in size. (This is probably the best time to preheat the oven: 475 degrees F for focaccia.) You want a warm, moist, draft-free place for the quickest rise, for example near the stove, or just in a warm room. You can cover with plastic wrap if you want to speed it up. This process matures the flour flavor and should take approximately 40 minutes to an hour and a half, depending on the conditions. Stage 7: Right, it&#39;s double the size and time to punch it down. Knead and punch the dough, knocking all the air out of it, for about a minute. Then split the dough into half or quarters.

Wash husks and lay flat in a dish of water to keep moist. Remove silks from corn and cut corn off cobs deeply. A corn cutter can be used, but I stand each ear upright in a large shallow bowl and cut from top to bottom with a sharp knife. The corn can be chopped in a food processor, blender, or food grinder - or with a metate, a three legged grinding stone that still is in use in the Southwest and Mexico. Grind the corn until it is doughy, though small pieces of fiber will remain. Season with salt and butter. Stir in enough corn meal to form a dough that holds its shape when pressed in the hand. If too crumbly, add more butter or a little water. Line a well greased 2 quart baking dish with corn husks, letting ends extend above rim. Spread a thin layer of the corn mixture over husks to anchor them. Sprinkle cheese over corn, then distribute chiles evenly in baking dish. Cover with remaining corn dough, fold husks over tamale, and press into top. Press additional husks into tamale. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake until firm but not dry, about 45 minutes. If top dries out before tamale is set, cover with foil.

Put one-third of the mixture into a piping bag with a star tip. With a serrated knife, trim the sides of the boule until it is an even cylinder. Cut the cylinder across the radius into four 1-inch slices. Choose a serving platter and place a slice of bread in the center for the bottom layer. Position 4 squares of parchment underneath the bread to keep the serving platter clean once you begin icing. Spread 1 tablespoon of the mustard onto the top of the bread. Top with the Cheddar, then the ham and turkey. Add half of the lettuce on top of the turkey. Spread the remaining 1 tablespoon mustard on one side of another slice of bread, then place it mustard-side down on top of the lettuce. Spread the top of the bread with 2 tablespoons mayonnaise. Top with the bacon, tomato and remaining shredded lettuce. Spread the remaining 2 tablespoons mayonnaise on a third slice of bread, then place it mayonnaise-side down on top of the lettuce. Next, cover the top of the bread with the potato chips in a single layer. Top the potato chips with the chicken salad and then the last slice of bread. With a knife or offset spatula, spread the cream cheese mixture along the top and sides of the cake evenly. Pipe rows of stars onto the top and bottom edge of the cake. Decorate the cake using radish and cucumber slices in a ring around the top and bottom of the cake. Shape the remaining radish and cucumber slices into roses and press into the top of the cake.

For the batter: In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar and beat until light and fluffy. One at a time, add the eggs, mixing each one in completely before adding the next. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. In another bowl, sift or whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. With the mixer running, add a third of the flour mixture and then the milk, beating just to incorporate. Beat in the remaining flour mixture. Divide the batter between two bowls and set one bowl aside (this will be the white cake batter). Mix the cocoa powder into the remaining bowl of batter (this will be the chocolate batter). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Divide the white cake batter evenly among the muffin cups, and then do the same with the chocolate batter. Bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool slightly, then transfer to a wire rack to cool while you prepare the buttercream. For the strawberry buttercream: Puree the strawberries in a blender until completely smooth. Press through a fine-mesh sieve into a small saucepot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until reduced by half, about 10 minutes; you&#39;ll need at least 1/2 cup. Cool completely. In a mixing bowl, add 3 cups of the confectioners&#39; sugar, the butter and the vanilla and beat with a hand mixer until combined. Add the strawberry reduction, beat until incorporated, and then gradually add the remaining 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round tip and pipe the buttercream onto the cupcakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 61917,&quot;Chocolate Sandwich Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/4 cups unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups powdered sugar A pinch of kosher salt Instructions: For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking soda. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla extract. With the mixer running on low speed, add the flour mixture and beat until just combined; it will still be a bit crumbly. Pour the mixture onto a work surface and give it a few kneads to bring it all together. Divide in half, shape into flat discs, wrap in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for an hour (or up to two days). Dust your surface and the top of the dough with plenty of cocoa powder. Roll out the dough to 1/2 inch thickness and cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds. Transfer them to the baking sheets, 1 inch apart (using a small offset spatula helps with this step). Re-roll the scraps and cut out more rounds.<br> Bake the cookies until the tops are no longer shiny, about 20 minutes. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely. For the filling: With a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together the butter, powdered sugar and salt until combined. Fill a piping bag with the filling. Place half of the cookies on a plate or work surface. Pipe a blob of filling onto the tops of each of these cookies and then place another cookie on top, pressing slightly. Refrigerate for a few minutes to allow the filling to firm up. Enjoy!

Over medium heat, swirl in the butter, currants and almonds and season with salt and pepper, to taste.; Potato-Black Truffle Gratin Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place the cream in a small saucepan with a few shavings of the black truffle and bring to a simmer. Remove and let steep for 10 minutes. Butter a baking dish and place a layer of potatoes in the bottom of the pan. Ladle 1/4 cup of the cream over the potatoes, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with 1 teaspoon of the black truffle oil. Repeat 4 times. Bake the gratin for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through. Remove from the oven and let rest 10 minutes before cutting into squares. Garnish each square with a shaving of black truffle. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 61937,&quot;Burnt Alaska 2 ounces rum, such as Smith and Cross 2 ounces half-and-half 1 ounce dry oloroso sherry<br> 1 scoop rocky road ice cream<br> 1/3 cup Italian Meringue, recipe follows 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Put the rum, half-and-half, sherry and ice cream in a blender and blend until smooth. Pour into a rocks glass. Pipe the meringue on top of the drink, then use a kitchen blowtorch to brown the meringue. Place the whites in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. In a heavy-bottomed saucepot, combine the cream of tartar, 1 cup of the sugar and 1/4 cup water and place over medium-high heat. Cook until the syrup registers 245 degrees F on a candy thermometer. While the syrup is cooking, whip the egg whites to soft peaks, then gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and whip to stiff peaks.<br> When the syrup reaches the correct temperature, turn the mixer to medium high and slowly pour the syrup down the side of the bowl (avoiding the whisk) into the meringue. Beat for 1 to 2 minutes, then lower the speed to medium and mix until the meringue is cooled, 6 to 8 minutes. Mix in the vanilla extract. Use the meringue to top a pie or for baked Alaska. Or bake into meringue cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Rum, Brandy, Port, Madeira]&quot; 61938,&quot;Grilled Seafood Pasta Fra Diavolo 1/2 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon red chili flakes<br> 1 pound Campari tomatoes, halved 1 Anaheim cl pepper, halved and seeded<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 lobster tails 1 pound linguini<br> 8 ounces large shrimp, shelled and deveined<br> Kosher salt 2 shallots, finely chopped<br> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped<br> 1/2 cup white wine<br> 8 ounces clams, scrubbed<br> 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan<br> 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> Zest of 2 lemons<br> Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the chili oil: Combine the oil and crushed red pepper flakes in a heavy small saucepan. Cook over low heat until a thermometer inserted into the oil registers 180 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Strain the oil into a heatproof container. For the spicy tomato sauce: Heat a large nonstick grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle the tomatoes and cl with 2 teaspoons of the chili oil and sprinkle with the salt. Grill until charred and softened, 4 minutes per side. Transfer the tomatoes to a bowl. Coarsely chop the cl, then add to the bowl with the tomatoes. For the pasta: Bring a large saucepan filled with salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the lobster tails and cook until the shells turn red and the meat is opaque, 4 minutes. Transfer the tails to a cutting board. Continue to boil the water and add the linguine. Cook until the pasta has begun to soften but is still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 6 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water. While the pasta is cooking, prepare the seafood. Gently cut through the top of the lobster shells using scissors to remove the tail meat, then slice each tail in half lengthwise. Transfer to a large bowl and add the shrimp. Drizzle over 1 1/2 tablespoons of the chili oil and 1 teaspoon salt and toss to coat. Heat a large nonstick grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the lobster tails and shrimp until cooked through, 4 minutes per side. Transfer the shrimp to a large bowl. Chop the lobster into 2-inch pieces and combine with the shrimp. Heat 2 tablespoons of the chili oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the spicy tomato sauce and white wine and bring to a boil. Add the clams and cook, covered, until they open, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the pasta and reserved cooking water to the pan along with the Parmesan and toss to coat. Stir in the parsley, butter, lemon zest and salt and black pepper to taste. Add in the shrimp and lobster and drizzle with the remaining chili oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 61939,&quot;Roasted Acorn Squash Agrodolce Vegetable oil, for frying 15 fresh sage leaves Pinch kosher salt 2 large acorn squash 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> Kosher salt 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese<br> 1/4 cup smoked almonds<br> Instructions: For the fried sage leaves: Heat a small saucepan with 1 inch oil over medium-high heat. Test the oil by touching the tip of a sage leaf in the oil; if it bubbles, the oil is ready for frying. Fry the leaves, 3 to 4 at a time, until the bubbles subside and the leaves become crisp. Drain on a paper-towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. For the squash: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Using a chef&#39;s knife, cut off a small amount off the top and bottom of each squash. Set the squash, cut-side down, and cut in half. Using a large spoon, scoop out and discard the seeds. Cut each half into 5 wedges and place them in a large bowl. Add the olive oil, cayenne, cinnamon and 1 teaspoon salt. Toss with your hands to coat well, then transfer the squash to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and fork tender, 35 minutes. Place the butter in a small skillet and melt over medium heat until the foam subsides and the solids begin to smell nutty and turn brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Allow the butter to cool for 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar and sugar until the sugar is dissolved, then whisk in the brown butter, using a rubber spatula to get all the brown bits out of the pan. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Lay the squash on a serving platter and spoon the vinaigrette over. Dollop with the mascarpone and sprinkle with the almonds and fried sage. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]</p><p>&quot; 61940,&quot;Gateau a l&#39;Orange Heaping 1/2 cup superfine sugar 6 tablespoons soft unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing 2 extra-large eggs 2/3 cup self-rising flour 1 scant teaspoons baking powder 1 large juicy orange 1 tablespoon Cointreau 5 tablespoons orange juice 1 tablespoon Cointreau 7 to 8 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the sugar and butter together until creamy. Beat in the eggs. Sift the flour and baking powder over the mixture and fold them in lightly. Grate the zest of the orange and squeeze out the juice. Stir zest, juice, and Cointreau into the batter. Then grease a 5-cup bread pan and spoon in the batter. Knock the pan against the countertop to settle the contents. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the cake is firm but bouncy to the touch and the blade of a knife inserted into it comes out clean. Leave it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then unmold onto a dish. Meanwhile, prepare the glazing. In a small saucepan, gently warm the orange juice and Cointreau. Stir in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Using a pastry brush, paint the glaze over the cake--some of the glaze will seep in, the rest will form a light crust. Serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 61941,&quot;Chocolate Cake for Two Cooking spray 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 1/3 cup buttermilk 1 large egg, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/3 cup hot water 10 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 4 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar Pinch fine salt 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-by-2-inch round cake pan with parchment paper, and spray with cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat together the buttermilk, egg and vanilla in a measuring cup. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and beat with a wooden spoon until well combined, scraping the side and bottom of the bowl once or twice with a rubber spatula. Stir in the hot water until it is all absorbed and the batter is smooth (it will be thin). Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake until the top is shiny, the cake is just beginning to pull away from the side of the pan and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a crumb or 2 attached, about 20 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 20 minutes. Turn the cake out of the pan, remove the parchment paper and let the cake completely cool on the rack, right-side up, about 1 hour. (The cake will be thin, but don&#39;t worry-it will magically be OK once it&#39;s stacked with frosting.) For the frosting: Pulse the butter, cocoa powder, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a food processor 10 times, stopping halfway through to scrape the bottom and side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the corn syrup and vanilla, and pulse 5 times. Scrape the bottom and side of the bowl, drizzle in the chocolate and pulse 5 more times to combine. Transfer the frosting to a small bowl. To assemble: Cut the cooled cake into 4 even quarters. Frost the top of each quarter with about 2 tablespoons of the frosting (an offset spatula helps spread the frosting evenly). Stack the frosted quarters directly on top of each other on a serving plate, resulting in a 4-layer wedge of cake with frosting between layers and on top. Frost all 3 sides of the cake with the remaining frosting until completely covered. Let sit for 30 minutes. Halve and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 61942,&quot;Ham and Cheese Scone Sandwiches 1 1/2 cups (210 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Roasted Garlic, recipe follows 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 1 large egg, beaten<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cubed<br> 3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> 1 tablespoon heavy cream<br> 1 teaspoon flaky salt<br> 3 tablespoons apricot jam 1/2 pound sliced deli honey ham<br> 1/4 pound sliced sharp white cheddar<br> 1 head of garlic Olive oil<br> Instructions: For the scones: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk together. In the bowl with the Roasted Garlic, add the sour cream and egg. Whisk together and set aside. Using your fingers or a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it forms pea-size bits. Toss in the chives. Add the sour cream mixture and mix just until a sticky dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a liberally floured counter and press together to form a 6-by-6-inch square. Trim each side (keep the trimmings and bake off for a little snack) and cut into 9 squares. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops with heavy cream, sprinkle with flaky salt and bake until lightly browned and crackly on top, 15 to 20 minutes. For the sandwiches: Split open the scones and toast the insides on a griddle or pan. Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of the apricot jam on each of the toasted sides. On the bottom halves, layer on the ham, cheese and then the tops of the scones and eat right away. The scones will keep for a couple days in a plastic bag or airtight container at room temperature. Toast and spread with butter or jam. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Slice off the top of the head of garlic, drizzle with olive oil and wrap in foil. Roast for about an hour. Remove from the oven and allow the garlic to cool inside the foil. When cool, open the foil and squeeze the roasted garlic from each clove into a small bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 61943,&quot;Filet of Beef with Madeira Sauce 4 pound filet 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 cup Sercial Madeira 1 1/2 cups beef broth 2 teaspoons arrowroot dissolved in 1 tablespoon water 2 tablespoons chopped parsley Instructions: Sprinkle the filet with salt and pepper. To a heated pan add the oil, salt and pepper. Brown the meat on all sides. Place into a 350 degrees F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the meat thermometer registers 120 degrees F. to 125 degrees F. (for rare). Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, covered loosely with foil. Make the sauce while the beef is resting. Pour off the fat from the pan, add the Madeira, and boil it, scraping up the brown bits, until it is reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Add the broth and boil the mixture, stirring for 1 minute. Stir the arrowroot mixture, add it to the skillet, whisking, and simmer the sauce, whisking, for 1 minute. Slice the filet and transfer to a platter. Spoon sauce around the meat and serve the remaining sauce separately.

Rub on the brisket, cover and refrigerate overnight.<br> Remove the brisket from the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking and let sit at room temperature. Soak a few handfuls of mesquite or hickory wood chips in water 30 minutes; drain.<br> Preheat a grill to low, then prepare for indirect heat: For a gas grill, turn off the burners on one side; put the wood chips in a smoker box and position under the grate over the heated burners. For a charcoal grill, push the coals to one side; once the temperature registers 200 degrees F (you should be able to hold your hand 5 inches from the coals for 6 seconds), scatter the wood chips on top. Position a drip pan under the grate on the cooler side of the grill. Put the brisket fat-side up on the grill above the drip pan. Cover and grill, undisturbed, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 185 degrees F to 200 degrees F, 3 hours, 30 minutes to 5 hours. If using a charcoal grill, leave the vents nearly closed and scatter 6 to 8 unlit charcoal briquettes and a handful of prepared wood chips on top of the lit coals every 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the brisket from the grill, wrap in foil and let rest at least 30 minutes. Pour the drippings from the drip pan into a bowl and let cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, make the barbecue sauce: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add the chili powder and cook, stirring, until brick red, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1 1/2 cups water, the vinegar, ketchup, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, mustard, allspice and 3/4 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a low simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Whisk the reserved drippings, then whisk 1 to 2 tablespoons into the barbecue sauce. Thinly slice the brisket against the grain.

Combine the meat, panko, milk, bell peppers, onion, garlic, herbs, Worcestershire sauce, coriander, onion powder, salt, black pepper, white pepper and eggs in a large mixing bowl. By hand, fold all the ingredients together until thoroughly mixed. Remove a small amount of the mixture and sear it in clarified butter in a skillet over medium heat until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes, to test for flavor and consistency. The meat may appear under-seasoned; this is okay. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the mushrooms and Bistro Sauce and mix thoroughly. Place the mushrooms in a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl and let the excess sauce drain off and collect in a bowl; reserve for the glaze. Line a sheet pan with the bacon in a crisscross weave pattern. Put approximately half the meatloaf mix into the pan and spread out evenly. Make a vein of mushrooms that runs down the entire center of the pan. Take the rest of the meatloaf mix and cover the mushrooms in an even layer. Fold the bacon over the meatloaf. Flip the meatloaf over onto a lined sheet pan. Bake the meatloaf for 20 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Cover the meatloaf with foil and continue baking until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, about 20 additional minutes.

Let cool, then grind the toasted spices in a spice mill or clean coffee grinder. Transfer the ground spices to a bowl. Add the ginger, garlic, brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine well. Pat spice rub generously all over the skin of the ducks, place them on a rack over a roasting pan, and refrigerate them, uncovered, for at least 2 hours, or, preferably overnight. Preheat a grill. When you are ready to cook the ducks, place them on a rotisserie over a grill with a drip pan set directly under the ducks. Keep the fire fairly low to avoid flare ups. Cook the ducks until the juices run clear and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thigh reads 175 degrees F, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

For the dipping sauce (tentsuyu): Bring the Dashi, mirin and soy sauce to a boil in a small saucepan. Set aside until ready to serve, then divide among 4 small bowls. Place the grated daikon in a small dish. For the shrimp and vegetables: Assemble the chilled shrimp, green beans, mushrooms, shishitos, sweet potatoes and onions on 2 large plates. Heat about 2 inches of oil in a large wok or deep, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 360 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels or a wire rack and place near the wok. For the batter: When the oil is almost ready, sift the cake flour and potato starch into the chilled bowl. Whisk the water and egg in a small bowl (or in the water measuring cup) until completely combined. Using chopsticks or a large fork, stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture until barely combined and lumps of flour still remain. (Better to undermix than overmix, so err on the side of caution.) The batter should be the thickness of cream; add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water if needed. Mix in the ice cubes. Working with several pieces of the shrimp and vegetables at a time, dip them into the batter, then gently lay them in the oil away from you. (It\u2019s important not to overcrowd and to maintain the temperature of the oil; adjust the heat, as needed.) Fry, flipping them once or twice, until pale golden brown and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes (some ingredients may take longer than others); transfer to the lined baking sheet. Serve the tempura immediately (ideally, one person will continue frying while the lucky others get to eat the tempura at its best!) with the bowls of dipping sauce and grated daikon on the side for people to stir into the sauce, if they like. Continue with the remaining ingredients, skimming the surface of the oil as needed. Combine the kombu and 3 cups cold water in a medium saucepan and let sit for about 30 minutes. (You can skip this step if you\u2019re short on time, but it does lend a little extra flavor.) Heat the mixture over medium heat until the water comes to a near boil but doesn\u2019t actually boil, about 5 minutes. Discard the kombu. Add the katsuobushi evenly over the water and bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately remove from the heat. Let steep for about 10 minutes without stirring. Pour the dashi through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl or quart measuring cup. Do not press down on the katsuobushi, which can make the dashi cloudy or bitter. Dashi is best used the day it is made, but it can be cooled and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61951,&quot;Herby Snap Pea and Radish Salad Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound snap peas, strings removed and cut in half vertically 1/2 cup Greek yogurt 2 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 5 to 7 radishes, (about 1 bunch) cut into 1/3-inch-thick matchsticks Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add the snap peas and cook until the snap peas are bright green but still tender-crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the snap peas to a bowl of ice water. Set aside. Add the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, dill, chives, mint, oil, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to a large bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside. Drain the snap peas and add them to the bowl with the dressing. Add the radishes to the bowl and toss well to thoroughly coat the vegetables in the dressing.

Pour the brining liquid into a one gallon zipper-topped bag and place the pork in the brining liquid. Place the bag in a large bowl to prevent leakage, and keep in the fridge for 1 hour. For the pork: After 1 hour, remove the pork and dry off with paper towels. Cut into 1-inch medallions, making about 8 medallions. Gently pound each medallion with a meat mallet until the pork is about 1/4-inch thick. Sprinkle with pepper and set aside. Set a wire rack inside a baking sheet. Set up a standard breading procedure in three shallow pie tins. Put the flour in one, the beaten egg in another and the panko in the last one. Dredge each medallion in the flour, shake off any excess, then in the egg, let the excess drip and then coat fully in the breadcrumbs. Set aside the wire rack. Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F. Heat up the oil in a heavy-bottomed skillet to medium heat. Place half of the medallions in the oil and fry on each side until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes a side. Set the cooked medallions aside on another wire rack and place in the oven to stay warm. Repeat with the remaining medallions.<br> For the sandwich build: Carefully split the Grapevine KY Buttermilk Biscuits and lay a medallion or 2 on the bottom portion. Slather the biscuit tops with Raspberry Mayo and then top with some Cider-Braised Red Cabbage. Serve any remaining cabbage on the side. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place heavy cast-iron skillet into oven to preheat. Chill a large mixing bowl, pastry cutter, flour and 1 stick butter in the freezer 15 minutes before assembling the biscuits.<br> Add the flour to the chilled mixing bowl. Working quickly, cut 1 stick butter into the flour using the chilled pastry cutter (or your fingers); the goal here is pea-size balls of butter. In batches, add in the buttermilk until the dough is cohesive yet still moist. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly press into a 1-inch-thick round. Using a biscuit cutter or business end of a dry-measuring cup, cut out 8 biscuits. (Use the extra dough to cook up a big piece of shortcake for dessert....strawberry shortcake!) Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and add the oil. Place the dough rounds into the hot skillet, right up against each other, and brush with the 3 tablespoons melted butter. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Mix the mayo, lemon juice, raspberry preserves, lemon zest and pepper in a bowl. Heat a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the butter until melted. Add the caraway seeds and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the cabbage in batches until slightly wilted, 5 minutes. Add the cider and vinegar and simmer for 15 minutes until the cabbage is soft and supple. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 61955,&quot;German Chocolate Cupcake 2 cups cake flour (not self rising), sifted 1 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/3 cup sugar 3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature 3 large eggs, room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 cup buttermilk 5 ounces German chocolate, melted and cooled 2 1/3 cups sweetened coconut flakes 1 1/2 cups pecans, chopped 1 1/2 cups sugar 12 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 4 large egg yolks, room temperature, slightly beaten One 12-ounce can evaporated milk 1 cup unsalted butter 1/2 cup cocoa powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup milk, plus more 4 cups powdered sugar Instructions: For the batter: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Remove with a slotted spoon and return to the rack to drain. Season with salt. Serve hot or at room temperature with the spicy honey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 61957,&quot;Campfire Skillet Cookie 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 7 red hard candies, such as Jolly Rancher, crushed 7 pink hard candies, such as Jolly Rancher, crushed<br> One 16-ounce can vanilla frosting 3 drops leaf green gel food coloring 14 chocolate wafer sandwich cookies (1 sleeve), crushed 3 pirouettes cookies, cut into thirds 6 milk chocolate-covered caramel and biscuit candy bars, such as Twix (three 1.79-ounce packages) 6 marshmallows 6 pretzel rods Instructions: For the skillet cookie: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottom and sides of a 10-inch cast-iron skillet with about 1 tablespoon of the butter. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the sugar and remaining butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg, beating to incorporate. Add the flour mixture in 2 additions, beating on medium-low speed until incorporated. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the dough into the prepared skillet, gently spreading it to the edges and smoothing the top. Bake until the edges are brown and the top is golden but still slightly soft, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool on a wire rack 15 minutes. For the decorations: Lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.<br> Sprinkle the crushed red and pink candies on the baking sheet in a single layer but touching. Bake until melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet, then break into large shards for the candy fire. Meanwhile, remove one-quarter of the frosting to a small bowl and combine with the green food coloring. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a medium grass tip. Spread the remaining frosting in the center of the cookie, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around the edge. Sprinkle the crushed chocolate cookies over the frosting, covering all of the white.

Cut off the top of each head of garlic, then wrap individually in foil. Toss the tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt. Toss the onions, poblanos and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil on another baking sheet. Roast the garlic, tomatoes, onions and poblanos, switching the pans halfway through, until the vegetables have softened and are browned in spots, about 45 minutes. (Remove any vegetables early if they?re getting too charred.) Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins. Remove the skin and seeds from the poblanos; set aside the poblanos and half each of the roasted garlic and onions for the albondigas. Puree the tomatoes, the remaining garlic and onions and the chopped chipotles in a blender, scraping down the sides as needed. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Melt the lard in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the roasted vegetable puree and cook until reduced by about half, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour in the stock, reduce the heat to medium and cook until slightly thickened and smooth, about 10 minutes. Gradually stir in the butter until incorporated; add the adobo seasoning and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. While the sauce is simmering, make the albondigas: Pulse the carrot in a food processor until finely chopped. Add the reserved roasted poblanos, remaining roasted garlic and onions, chipotle puree, hot sauce, eggs, Cotija and cilantro and pulse until evenly and thoroughly mixed. In a large mixing bowl, combine the beef, carrot mixture, panko, masa harina, adobo seasoning, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Mix well with your hands (do not overwork the meat). Form the meat mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls (about 40). Arrange on 2 baking sheets and bake until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Toss into the sauce. To assemble the tacos, heat up the tortillas on a griddle, then spread some chipotle mayonnaise on each. Top with 2 or 3 meatballs and a little of the sauce. Garnish with the pickled onions, queso fresco and cilantro. Pickled Onions Combine 3/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup water, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt, 3 whole cloves, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon each dried oregano and pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then add 1 thinly sliced large red onion (separated into rings). Return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and cook until the onion softens, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and let the mixture cool completely. Refrigerate in a covered container for at least 2 hours and up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 61963,&quot;Unicorn Cake 4 ounces mini marshmallows (about 2 cups) 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted Solid vegetable shortening, as needed Blue gel food coloring, for the ears and horn 1 thin strand black licorice, about 12 inches long 1 strip rainbow-striped sour candy belt, about 24 inches long Mix of pink and blue candies, for decorating 2 ounces cotton candy (several large handfuls), preferably a mix of pink and blue<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the cake pans All-purpose flour, for the cake pans Two 16-ounce boxes white cake mix (plus required ingredients) 1/3 cup rainbow sprinkles 4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter, at room temperature Pinch of fine salt 8 cups sifted confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 2 to 4 tablespoons milk Instructions: For the unicorn decorations: First, make the horn and ears. Put the marshmallows in a large microwave-safe bowl and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons water. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until the marshmallows are melted, about 1 1/2 minutes total. Add 1 1/2 cups of the confectioners&#39; sugar and stir to make a stiff mixture. Grease your hands and a work surface with some shortening. Knead the mixture, adding up to 1/2 cup more confectioners&#39; sugar and greasing your hands as needed to keep it from sticking, until the mixture is very smooth and pliable, 4 to 5 minutes. (The mixture should form a tight but very smooth ball. If you poke a finger into it, the indentation should remain.) Break off three-quarters of the marshmallow mixture, add 1 drop blue gel food coloring and knead it into the mixture until evenly distributed. Remove one-quarter of the blue mixture and roll out to a thickness of a little less than 1/4 inch. With a sharp paring knife, cut two 2-inch-tall triangles for the inside of the unicorn ears. Roll the remaining blue mixture into a thick, tapered strand, about 2 feet long. Brush an 8-inch lollipop stick with water. Starting about 3 inches up from the bottom of the stick, roll the strand around it, starting with the thickest part first, into a tapered horn. Press gently all around to adhere it to the stick. Stick the horn upright in a jar filled with dried beans or rice to dry.<br> Roll out the remaining plain marshmallow mixture to a thickness of a little less than 1/4 inch. With a sharp paring knife, cut two 3-inch-tall triangles for the outside of the unicorn ears. Brush the larger ears on one side with a small amount of water. Stick on the smaller blue ears. Drape the ears, with the smaller pieces face down, over the rolling pin to dry. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat four 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Prepare the cake mixes according to the package directions. Stir in the sprinkles. (If you don&#39;t have 4 pans, make 1 box of cake mix at a time and use half of the sprinkles in each). Divide the batter among the 4 prepared pans and bake, rotating the pans from top to bottom halfway through baking, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 28 minutes. Let cool on a rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the pans and cool completely.<br> For the buttercream: Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and light, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat on low to incorporate, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla and then the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is easily spreadable.<br> Cut the domed tops from the cakes to make them flat. Frost the top of one cake layer with about 1/2 cup frosting. Set another layer on top and frost again. Repeat with the third layer, then end with the last layer bottom-side up on top.

Set the cake on a cake stand and spread all but 1/2 cup of the remaining frosting on the cake in a smooth layer.<br> Cut two 3-inch strands from the licorice and stick to the cake about halfway down in wide U shapes for the eyes. Cut ten 1/2-inch licorice pieces and press 5 along the bottom of each eye for eyelashes. Wrap the rainbow candy belt around the base of the cake. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup frosting in a strip along the base of the cake to adhere the candies. Stick the candies around the cake in a decorative fashion. Pull the cotton candy apart to make it fluffy and stick on the top and sides of the cake as a mane. Add the horn and ears and serve immediately. (Most of the cake can be decorated in advance; the cotton candy needs to be added at the last minute.)<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 61964,&quot;Glazed Pineapple Ham 2 1/2 pounds boneless cooked ham, sliced into 18 slices Two 20-ounce cans pineapple slices<br> 18 maraschino cherries<br> 3/4 cup packed brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons apple juice<br> 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Cut each potato lengthwise into 4 or 5 pieces, then cut each piece into sticks. The thinner these are, the crispier they will be. Place the fries in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, then allow them to soak 2 or 3 hours (or you can stick them in the fridge and let them soak overnight).<br> When you&#39;re ready to make the fries, drain the water and lay the potatoes on 2 baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot with paper towels to dry.<br> Heat a few inches of vegetable oil to 300 degrees F in a heavy pot. In 3 or 4 batches, fry the potatoes about 4 to 5 minutes per batch, or until soft. They should not be brown at all at this point-you just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain them on new, dry paper towels.<br> Once all the potatoes have been fried at 300 degrees F, turn up the heat until the oil temperature reaches 400 degrees F. When the oil is hot, start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until golden and crisp. Remove from the oil and drain on fresh paper towels. Sprinkle the fries with sea salt and dive in with the ketchup-mayo mixture.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61972,&quot;Brown Sugar Pecan Bears 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, at room temperature 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 68 pecan halves (about 1 1/4 cups) 2 ounces milk chocolate, chopped (not chips) Instructions: Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Beat the brown sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the egg, then the vanilla until completely combined, scraping the bowl as necessary. Add the flour mixture and mix on medium-low speed until completely incorporated, about 1 minute. Divide the dough in half, then pat or roll each piece into 1/4-inch thick sheets between pieces of plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour and up to overnight. Position 2 oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, remove the plastic wrap and transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper. Place a second piece of parchment on top and roll out the dough between the parchment to 1/8-inch thick, being sure to smooth out any creases. Cut out 20 to 22 bears by pressing a 2 3/8-inch bear cookie cutter into the dough, sliding a small offset spatula underneath the cutter and dough and lifting to release from the paper. Place the bears on one of the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart. (If the dough becomes too soft, put it in the freezer to firm up a little so it is easier to work with.) Reserve the dough scraps wrapped in plastic at room temperature.) Place a pecan between the arms of each bear and fold the arms up around the pecan to make it look like the bear is hugging the nut (the arms may crack at the shoulder; that&#39;s okay as long as they sit on the nut). Put the baking sheet in the freezer to firm up, 10 minutes. Repeat with the second piece of dough, adding the scraps to the reserved scraps to roll later. After 10 minutes, take the first baking sheet out of the freezer to bake it and put the second baking sheet in to chill.<br> Bake, 1 baking sheet at a time, rotating it 180 degrees halfway through, until the cookies are beginning to become golden at the edges but are still slightly soft to the touch, 14 to16 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes. The cookies will firm as they cool.<br> Knead together the reserved scraps and reroll, chilling if necessary; repeat the forming, chilling and baking process until all the dough has been used.<br> Melt the milk chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave at 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval, about 2 minutes total. Use a toothpick to draw chocolate eyes, noses, ears and feet on the bears. Alternatively, put the melted chocolate in a resealable plastic bag, snip off a corner and pipe the features onto to cookies. Let the chocolate set completely before serving, about 30 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61973,&quot;Huggy Buggy Bread Pudding 3 tablespoons melted butter 3 eggs 1 cup sugar 1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk (not low-fat) 3 cups whole milk 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger Pinch salt 1 baguette, cut into 1-inch chunks (about 7 cups) 6 dried figs, soaked in hot water for at least 15 minutes, thinly sliced* Handful roasted unsalted cashew nuts, whole or chopped Vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the bell pepper and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Pour in the wine and let bubble 1 minute, stirring and scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the butternut squash, beans, tomatoes and their juice, salsa, 1 cup water, the chili powder, cumin, cocoa, cinnamon and cayenne, if using. Bring the chili to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender and the chili begins to thicken, about 1 hour. (If the soup looks too thick while cooking, add up to 1 cup more water.) Serve topped with a dollop of Greek yogurt and some avocado cubes. Cook&#39;s Note: If you&#39;re using dried beans, soak in water overnight, then simmer until just tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours (or cook 4 to 5 hours in a slow cooker on high). &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 61975,&quot;Sweet Potato Pie 1 recipe Sweet Pie Crust, recipe follows 1 egg white, lightly beaten 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup maple syrup 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup heavy cream 4 large eggs 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons bleached all-purpose flour 1 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and chilled 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening 3 tablespoons ice water, or as needed Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle. Carefully transfer the dough to a 9-inch deep pie pan and ease the pastry into the bottom and sides of the pan. Press the dough into the shell and crimp the edges in a decorative pattern. Using the tines of a fork, lightly dock the base of the shell. Place the shell into the oven and bake until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the bottom with the egg white. Set aside until ready to use. Rub the sweet potatoes with the vegetable oil and roast in the oven for 45 to 60 minutes, until very tender. Remove and set aside to cool. Peel the potatoes and pass the flesh through a fine mesh sieve using a rubber spatula. You should have about 1 1/2 cups of smooth sweet potato puree. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the sweet potato puree with the sugar, maple syrup, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt. Whisk to combine. In a separate bowl, combine the heavy cream with the eggs and whisk to combine. Add the cream and egg mixture to the sweet potato mixture and stir to blend. Pour the batter into the prepared pie shell and place the pie on a sheet pan. Bake until the center is set and the tart is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove the tart from the oven and allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before serving. Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and shortening. Rub the fats between your fingertips and thumbs, or use a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 1 tablespoon at a time, work in enough ice water just until the dough comes together, being careful not to overmix. Shape into a smooth ball of dough, flatten into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61976,&quot;Pistachio Lace Cookies 3 ounces (3/4 stick) unsalted butter 1 1/4 cups shelled pistachios 7/8 cup (3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons) sugar 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur Instructions: For the cookie dough, melt the butter and cool until tepid or barely warm to the touch, for about 40 minutes. Grind the pistachios and sugar in a food processor, pulsing on/off until the nuts are coarsely chopped, or chop the nuts by hand and mix them with the sugar. Blend the flour and the pistachio/sugar mixture using an electric mixer. Add the tepid butter, orange juice and Grand Marnier and mix just until evenly moistened. The dough will be wet and sticky. Spread the dough out into a 1-inch wide log on a sheet of plastic wrap. Using the wrap as an aid, roll the dough up in plastic. Refrigerate or freeze until firm, for about 6 hours. (This can be prepared ahead and refrigerated 1 week or wrapped in freezer paper and frozen several months. Defrost in the refrigerator before continuing with the recipe.) To bake, preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice the dough into 1/8-inch-thick coins. Arrange as many as will fit on the prepared sheets, leaving 2 inches between the cookies. Dip a fork in water, shake dry and use it to flatten the cookies. Bake the cookies until well browned, for about 12 minutes, exchanging the position of the baking sheets in the oven halfway. Let the cookies cool on parchment until firm enough to dislodge with a spatula, for about 5 minutes. Gently transfer to racks in a single layer. Arrange and bake the remaining coins in the same manner. Cool the cookies completely on racks. Store in an airtight container at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61977,&quot;Celebration Centerpiece 7 cups sugar Scant 2 cups corn syrup 2 cups or 450 grams water Food color, liquid or paste, blue and white White vinegar Magic Flowers, recipe follows One 8-inch Classic Genoise, recipe follows Basic Buttercream, recipe follows Simple Syrup, recipe follows Rolling Fondant, recipe follows Royal Icing, recipe follows 7 cups sugar Scant 2 cups corn syrup 1 1/4 cups water Food color, liquid or paste, red and green 8 large eggs 3 large egg yolks 1 cup granulated sugar 2 1/2 tablespoons honey 2 cups unbleached, unbromated pastry flour, sifted Scant 1/2 cup water 2 1/4 cups plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 5 large egg whites 2 1/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon cold unsalted butter, cubed Raspberry jam, for assembly 2 1/2 cups sugar Full 1 cup water 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon gelatin 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup corn syrup 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 tablespoons shortening 8 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted Cornstarch, for dusting 1 large egg white* 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar 1/2 lemon, juiced and strained Instructions: Cook the sugar, corn syrup and water to light caramel color (about 320 degrees F). Add 2 to 3 drops of the white food color mixing gently to make the sugar opaque. Add 2 to 3 drops of blue food color, do not mix completely. This centerpiece uses a 12-inch ring, a 10-inch ring, 2 (8-inch) rings, and a 4-inch cake ring. Spray each cake ring with vegetable cooking spray. Place the 12-inch ring on the baking sheet lined with silpat (a silicone baking mat). Then place the 8-inch ring inside the larger ring so that the sides touch. This will leave a crescent shape inside the 12-inch ring. Place the remaining cake rings on the baking sheet. Pour the sugar into the crescent shape (including the circle beside the crescent shape) and all of the cake rings completely filling the circles until they are about 1/4-inch thick. Reserve a small amount of sugar and pour on a second silpat lined baking sheet in a free form. This will be used to \glue\ the centerpiece together. When the sugar has cooled, which will take 10 to 15 minutes, remove it from the rings. Break the free-formed piece into small pieces and place in a heatproof glass bowl. Use a clean towel dipped in white vinegar to clean any remaining cooking spray from the edges of the sugar circles and moon piece. Use the melted sugar to \glue\ the Magic Flowers into your desired positions all over the moon and the base it rests on. Now, the centerpiece is ready to accept the Celebration Cake. Jacques&#39; tips: The ideal work surface for this centerpiece project is silpat placed on top of a piece of marble or granite. Stainless steel as a surface will absorb the heat and expand/contract with the temperature changes. If you do not have marble, work on a wood surface instead. Silpat will keep the surface of the sugar shiny. If you work on parchment paper, the sugar surface will be matte. Assemble the cake and centerpiece: Use a serrated knife to slice the cake into 3 layers. This task will be easier if you use a turntable. Flavor 1/3 of the buttercream with raspberry jam, to taste, and use this as a filling. Set the first cake layer on the cardboard cake circle. Douse the layers with some of the Simple Syrup. Apply the raspberry buttercream filling between the cake layers. Frost the cake with a thin layer of the unflavored buttercream. The first application does not have to be perfect. Place the cake in the refrigerator for about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and apply the second layer of unflavored buttercream. It is easier to get a smooth appearance if you apply the buttercream in two applications. Cover the cake with the Rolling Fondant as described in the recipe. Place the Royal Icing into a cornet and decorate the top and side of the cake in any way that you desire. If you make a mistake, simply wipe away the royal icing and begin again. Carefully place the cake on the sugar cake stand part of the centerpiece.; Assemble the centerpiece: You need to first make the glue to stick everything together. Place the extra sugar pieces (those are remnants of the sugar that you poured freeform on to the silpat) in the microwave and heat until it begins to bubble. Watch carefully to be sure it does not burn. Next you need to make the sugar supports to hold the moon vertically and to support the 8-inch sugar circle that will be resting on and in the moon, creating the level stand for the cake. You will need 4 support pieces in order to build the centerpiece. To make the supports, heat a metal triangle or metal scraper on the burner of the stove. Place the heated edge on the 4-inch sugar circle allowing the heat of the metal to \cut\ the 4-inch sugar circle into quarters. Use the heated metal scraper to also cut 2 to 2 1/2 inches off 1 of the 2 pointed tips of the moon. You will need to do this on an angle of about 90 degrees, in order to create a somewhat flat edge. This flat edge will provide a level landing spot for the 8-inch sugar circle that will be the cake stand attachment of the moon. Pour some of the melted sugar into the center of the 12-inch circle and \glue\ the moon vertically into place. The end of the moon that you cut off is now the bottom of the moon. Hold the moon straight until the sugar sets. \Glue\ the first 2 support pieces (these are the pieces that you cut by quartering the smallest sugar circle) at the wide, face of the moon, gluing 1 on either side. These 2 supports should be touching both the face of the moon and the base the moon rests on vertically. These supports will steady the moon in its vertical position on the round sugar base. Glue your third support piece on the narrow backside of the moon. This will create a bridge of support in the back, from the moon to the base. In other words it will prevent the moon from rolling backwards. Once all 3 supports have hardened you can \glue\ the 8-inch sugar circle to the cut edge of the moon, creating a level cake stand inside the moon. The circle will be sitting on both the cut level area and the inner curve of the moon. Additionally, you might find that you need the fourth support piece to steady the 8-inch level stand. Glue it into place wherever you think more support is required. Make sure the molds are clean and dry. Place molds in freezer for at least 10 minutes before filling. Cook the sugar, corn syrup and water to light caramel color (about 320 degrees F). Divide the caramel into 2 heatproof glass bowls. Add a few drops of food color to each bowl. You can use any color that you like. Dip the flower mold into the hot sugar. I dipped the flower molds in the red sugar and the leaf mold into the green. Set the sugar coated mold onto a silpat lined baking sheet. Repeat this process using the other molds. After a few minutes, the sugar will set and cool. To remove the sugar flower from the mold, gently push at the edge of the flower. It should pop off from the mold. Repeat the same process until you have made as many flowers as you want for your centerpiece. If you want to stick different shapes together, use more melted sugar to \glue\ the pieces into place. Remember, the sugar is very hot and will burn if it comes in contact with your skin. It is a good idea to keep a bowl of cold water readily available. If you get any sugar on your skin, dip your skin in the cold water to stop the burn and easily remove the sugar. Place a 1-quart saucepan half filled with water over high heat and bring it to a simmer. Make a double boiler by setting a large mixing bowl over the simmering water. Place the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and honey in the mixing bowl and make an egg foam by whisking the mixture to 113 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 7 to 10 minutes. The egg foam passes through various stages becoming foamy, then smooth and finally it thickens. When it is thick, it will be hot to the touch, tripled in volume, and light in color and the sugar will have completely dissolved. If you dip the whisk into the mixture and pull it out, the batter should fall back into the bowl in a thick ribbon. Remove the mixing bowl from the heat and whip the batter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until it cools, increases in volume, stiffens slightly and becomes pale yellow, about 7 to 10 minutes. Take the time to whip it well; if the mixture is under whipped, the baked genoise will be dense. Very, very carefully, fold in the flour with a rubber spatula until the flour is no longer visible, making sure to fold to the bottom of the bowl. Do not over mix or the batter will deflate. Fill buttered and parchment paper-lined 8-inch round cake pans 3/4 full with batter. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven until well-risen and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let the genoise cool slightly. Unmold, remove parchment paper and finish cooling on a wire rack. The baked genoise can be stored in the freezer for 2 to 3 weeks if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Return it to room temperature before using it. The first step is to start cooking the sugar. Pour the water and sugar into a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. When the bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan, insert a candy thermometer in the mixture. Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until foamy and slightly holding soft peaks. The sugar is ready when it reaches 250 degrees F, what is known as the soft ball stage. Make an Italian meringue by pouring the cooked sugar down the side of the bowl while you continue to whip the egg whites. Do not pour the hot sugar onto the beaters, or it will splatter. Continue whipping the meringue on medium-high speed until the outside of the bowl is warm but not hot, about 5 minutes. Add the butter all at once and beat on medium speed until incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and whip until the buttercream is thick, smooth, and shiny, about 10 minutes. At his stage, you can add flavoring, if desired. The buttercream can be used immediately or can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or in the freezer for several weeks if held in an airtight container. If it has been chilled or frozen, allow the buttercream to come to room temperature before using, then whip it with an electric mixer on medium speed until it returns to its initial volume and is once again thick, smooth, and shiny. Recipe courtesy of Jacques Torres, Dessert Circus Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home, 1998 Combine all 3 ingredients in a nonreactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. All the sugar crystals should completely dissolve. Remove from the heat and pour into a clean medium-size bowl. Let cool completely before using. If you are short on time, you can cool the syrup over an ice bath. Simple syrup can be stored in the refrigerator, indefinitely, if kept in an airtight container. Place gelatin and water in a small saucepan over low heat and melt it. Combine the remaining ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the melted gelatin to the mixer and beat at low speed until combined. This will form a paste or dough. Place in the refrigerator for a few minutes to let harden slightly. Combine the egg white and powdered sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until opaque and shiny, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and continue whipping until completely incorporated, about 3 minutes. The lemon juice whitens the royal icing. The royal icing should be light, fluffy, and slightly stiff. You may need to adjust the consistency by adding more egg whites if the icing is too dry or more powdered sugar if it is too wet. To make decorations, fill a cornet half full with royal icing and cut a small opening at the tip. Use the cornet to draw decorations.

Remove and place on absorbent paper and season with salt and pepper Add more oil, if needed, to saute pan and when it is hot, add onions, peppers, and garlic, and saute until onions become translucent. Add meat and saute until meat crumbles and browns. Add tomatoes and season lightly. Cook until meat is tender or about 10 more minutes. If meat releases too much moisture, dust with flour and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from stove, add the olives and capers, and season with vinegar Mix well and adjust seasonings as needed. Heat a 6-inch non-stick omelet pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons oil. When hot, add 3 to 4 ounces of meat mixture to pan and heat thoroughly. Pour about 6 ounces (2 beaten eggs) over meat mixture in the pan to make a sort of omelet. Reduce heat to low-medium to allow egg to cook evenly. When \omelet\ is firm, flip it over and let cook until firm on the other side. Remove pan from heat and slide \omelet\ out of pan onto a clean cutting board. Using a 6-inch round metal cutter, cut a neat circle out of the cooked egg. Using an offset metal spatula, place any scrap pieces cut from the egg onto the center of a heated dinner plate. Carefully place the circle of egg on top. Make a criss-cross of fried plantains on top of egg. Continue making \omelets\ until all the mixture and eggs are used.

In a non-stick pan over medium heat, melt half of the butter. When it begins to foam remove from heat and add 2 ounces of the liquor and 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Always add alcohol off of the heat to avoid a jumping flame. Use tongs to gently lay crepes into the pan. Turn the crepes to coat. Lay the crepes out on a plate and top with ice cream. Pour remaining sauce over the ice cream. Serve immediately. In a blender, combine all of the ingredients and pulse for 10 seconds. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours. Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone. After they have cooled you can stack them and store in sealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months. When using frozen crepes, thaw on a rack before gently peeling apart. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 61980,&quot;Oma&#39;s Hackbraten 2 1/2 pounds ground beef 2 1/2 pounds ground pork<br> 2 Roma tomatoes, boiled and peeled 1/4 cup beef stock<br> 2 tablespoons granulated onion<br> 1 tablespoon yellow curry powder 1/2 teaspoon white pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic<br> 1 teaspoon caraway seed<br> 1/2 teaspoon marjoram<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley<br> 2 cups panko bread crumbs<br> 1 1/2 cups diced bacon<br> Ketchup, to cover<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Cover the exposed fat cap with cracked black pepper. Place the roast, rib side down, on a wire rack. Place the wire rack in the oven on the center rack. Place a drip pan on the bottom rack of the oven. This will catch all of the drippings from the roast. Roast for 1 1/2 to 2 hours for medium rare. Remove the roast from the oven and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Using knife, cut away the butchers twine. Carve the roast into individual servings. Reserve the drippings for later use. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container. Recipe from \New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch.

Over medium-low heat, slowly whisk in the milk. In a separate mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks. Once the pastry cream starts to boil, transfer 1/2 cup of the pastry cream to the egg yolks and whisk to temper. Return the mixture to the saucepan. Continue whisking until the mixture coats the back of a spoon and is smooth and thick. Strain. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, and vanilla. Stir in 1 cup sliced bananas. Allow the mixture to cool. Stir the custard to loosen, if necessary. Cover the bottom of the prepared crust with more sliced bananas and drizzle with 1/4 cup Salted Caramel Sauce. Top with half of the sliced bananas, then 1 cup custard, covering the bananas completely. Repeat layering with the remaining bananas and the remaining custard. Chill the banana cream pie until the filling is set, about 2 hours. For the topping: In a medium bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form. Add the sugar, and vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form. Top the chilled pie with the fresh whipped cream. Drizzle with additional caramel sauce, just before serving. For the Perfect Pie Dough: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, salt and vanilla; cut or work the butter into the flour mixture with your fingers or a cold pastry cutter until you have large pea sized chunks scattered throughout. Alternatively, pulse the dough in a food processor, or mix in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on low speed. Add the ice water slowly while stirring with a fork, or in the food processor or mixer, until just combined. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, flatten and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. Roll out one chilled pie dough to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Reserve the second pie dough disc for another use. Transfer dough to pie plate, pressing the dough lightly into the plate; trim the edges. Dock the dough with the prongs of a fork evenly over the bottom of the pie plate. Line the docked dough with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the pie crust until the edges are brown and golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the weights. Return crust to the oven to finish baking for another 5 minutes. Yield: 1 (9-inch) pie crust To make the salted caramel sauce: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat and bring to a boil without stirring. If necessary, use a wet pastry brush to wash down any crystals on the side of the pan. Boil until the syrup is a deep amber color, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and carefully whisk in the heavy cream. The mixture will bubble. Stir in the unsalted butter, and salt, to taste. Transfer the caramel to a dish and cool. Cook&#39;s Note: This recipe will last in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Reheat before serving.

With a sharp knife, make 3 deep incisions in each breast, 3 in each thigh and 2 on each drumstick. Then with a butcher knife, cut each chicken into quarters. First, cut the chicken in half down the middle. Second, cut the legs off where the thigh meets the body. Lastly, remove each breast, keeping the wings attached. Place the pieces of chicken on a large plate. To prepare the spice rub: In a small bowl, combine the salt, chili powder and lemon juice to make a thick paste. Rub the paste evenly over the chicken legs and breasts. Set the chicken aside for 15 minutes to let the flavors absorb. To prepare the tandoori sauce: In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, heavy cream, ginger paste, garlic paste, cumin, garam masala, and saffron. Whisk everything together until it is well mixed. Rub the sauce evenly over the chicken legs and breasts, thoroughly covering the chicken. Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 4 hours. Preheat an oven or charcoal grill to 350 degrees F. To prepare the garnishes for the dish: Wash and drain the salad greens and slice the onion and the lemon. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator. Skewer the legs starting from the drumstick end, through to the thigh so that the leg is spread out straight for even roasting. Skewer the breasts starting from the wing, through the breast so that the wing is spread out straight for even roasting. If cooking the chicken in an oven, place the chicken in a shallow roasting pan lined with foil to catch the drippings. If cooking the chicken on a grill, place the chicken directly on the grill with a pan underneath it to catch the drippings. Roast for 10 minutes, then remove and baste with the melted butter and drippings from the bottom of the pan. Return the chicken back to the heat and roast for another 30 to 40 minutes, or until juices run clear when pierced with a fork, basting a couple more times during cooking. To serve: Arrange 1 leg and 1 breast on each plate, with mixed salad greens, a lemon wedge, and onion slices in the middle. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 62010,&quot;Avocado-Poblano cl Vinaigrette 3 whole ripe avocados, peel into 1- inch cubes 1/2 cup red onion, peeled and julienned 1 fresh poblano cl, roasted, seeded, peeled and julienned 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped 1/2 cup seasoned rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon olive or peanut oil 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes - optional Salt, to taste Instructions: Combine all ingredients in non-reactive bowl and toss gently to mix.

Cover with cold water and 1 teaspoon of the salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes until the potatoes are tender. Drain. Peel potatoes while they are still warm. (Not too hot, or you might burn your hands.) Place the peeled potatoes in a ricer over a small bowl and push through. Alternatively, using the back of a spoon or a rubber spatula, mash the potatoes through the holes in a colander into a bowl set below it. You can mash the potatoes by hand, but the dumplings won&#39;t be as fluffy. Add the ham, Parmesan, beaten eggs, butter, nutmeg, and the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt to the mashed potatoes. Mix well to combine. Line a small baking sheet with paper towels, and place the flour in a small mixing bowl. Roll the potato mixture into little balls, about 2 rounded teaspoonfuls each. Toss each dumpling in the flour, shake off the excess flour and place on the prepared baking sheet. Set aside. In a 6-quart soup pot or stockpot, combine the beef broth, chicken broth, water, onion, carrots, parsley and cilantro. Bring to a boil and boil for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover to keep warm. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add 1/3 of the potato dumplings to the skillet, leaving enough room to turn them. Brown the dumplings on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes, until golden, and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Continue to brown the remaining dumplings, using 2 tablespoons of the oil for each batch. Heat the beef-chicken stock over medium-high heat until simmering, Using a ladle, carefully place the dumplings into the simmering stock. Simmer dumplings for 3 to 5 minutes.

Pour orange marmalade into a bowl and add about 1/2 of the coke. Let it set while you prepare the ham. Remove visible fat from ham and crisscross cut the ham. Place in a 9 by 13-inch baking pan and pour the marmalade/coke mixture over the ham. Place in the oven uncovered and bake for 20 minutes. This allows the marmalade to set or crisp on the ham. After 20 minutes cover the ham with foil and bake for an additional 30 to 45 minutes. Baste with the pan drippings every 15 minutes. If there are not enough pan drippings, mix up some more marmalade mixture to baste on the ham. Uncover the ham for the last 20 to 30 minutes and baste every 7 or 8 minutes. Allow the marmalade mixture to brown until dark brown in color. Remove from oven. Put ham onto a platter to cool before cutting. Total cook time is about 1 hour 5 minutes to1 hour 35 minutes. Use the left-over ham in red beans the next day. Mix flour and shortening together in bowl until the shortening is well blended into the flour. Make a \well\ or hole in the center of the flour/shortening mixture. Add a portion of the milk to the well. Use a fork or your fingers and work from the center of the bowl to the outside of the bowl and blend the milk into the mixture. Add more milk as needed. The dough will be slightly sticky. To make the biscuits coat your hands with flour and pinch off enough dough for 1 biscuit, about 2 tablespoons. Roll and knead the biscuit in your hands just until it looses its stickiness. Place in a cast iron skillet. Continue to make the rest of the dough in this manner. After all biscuits are made put a little water on finger tips and gently rub the tops of each biscuit, this removes any bumps on the top of the biscuits. Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62037,&quot;Our Favorite Fried Chicken 4 cups (1 quart) buttermilk 2 tablespoons dried thyme 2 tablespoons dried oregano 1 tablespoon hot sauce 2 cloves garlic, smashed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 3 1/2- to 4-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces 4 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sweet paprika Solid vegetable shortening or vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Whisk the buttermilk with the thyme, oregano, hot sauce, garlic and 1/4 cup salt in a large nonreactive bowl (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add the chicken pieces, turn to coat, cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight. When ready to fry, shake the flour, paprika and 1 tablespoon black pepper in a large, clean plastic or paper bag. Set a large rack over a baking sheet. Drain the chicken in a colander. Shake 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the flour mixture, then shake off any excess and transfer to the rack. Place a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add enough shortening to come halfway up the sides. Heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. Working in 2 batches, carefully add the chicken pieces to the Dutch oven. The oil temperature will drop precipitously to about 250 degrees F as you slip in the chicken. Adjust the heat as needed to keep the temperature right around 250 degrees F. The oil should be bubbling gently around all of the chicken. Fry the chicken until it is a deep golden brown, about 20 minutes for white meat and 25 minutes for dark meat. Transfer the chicken to a paper towel-lined platter.

Spray and flour three 8-inch cakes pans and line the bottoms with parchment circles. Combine the chocolate and 4 tablespoons of the butter in the top of a double boiler and heat until melted. Stir until smooth, then stir in the milk. Set aside to cool slightly. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Whisk the egg whites in a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment to firm peaks. In a new mixer bowl, combine the sugar and remaining 1 1/2 sticks butter. Beat with the paddle attachment on high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. On medium speed, add the egg yolks one at time and beat until smooth. Beat in the vanilla. Add the chocolate mixture and beat just to combine. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour. Beat just until the batter is smooth. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Add the egg whites and fold with a spatula just to incorporate (there should be no streaks of egg whites, but fold gently so as not to deflate too much). Divide the batter among the prepared pans. Bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a rack in the pans for about 10 minutes, then remove and cool completely. Remove the parchment. For the topping: To assemble, set a cake layer on a cake stand flat-side up. Spread 1/2 cup of the jam almost to the edges of the layer. Top with a second cake layer. Spread with the remaining jam and top with the third cake layer, flat-side up.

Arrange 6 (6-ounce) ramekins in a roasting pan. Place the chopped chocolate in a bowl. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream and instant espresso powder and bring almost to a simmer over medium heat. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Allow to sit 1 minute. Using a whisk, combine the ingredients until the chocolate melts completely and the mixture is smooth. (You could also heat the cream in the microwave until almost boiling. Pour over the chocolate and espresso powder. Let sit 2 minutes, and then whisk to combine.) Whisk the egg yolks, orange zest and sugar in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in the hot chocolate mixture and stir until the ingredients are incorporated. Divide the custard equally among the cups using either a 4-ounce ladle or a 6-ounce ladle. Using a wet paper towel, clean up the sides of the ramekins, if needed. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the cups. (You could also place the ramekins in the roasting pan, place the pan in the oven and pour the water into the pan, halfway up the sides of the ramekins.) Bake the custards until just set around the edges but still soft in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. Carefully remove the ramekins from the water. Refrigerate, uncovered, until cold. Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar evenly over each custard. Pick up the ramekin and gently swirl the sugar to evenly distribute. Working with 1 pot de creme at a time, hold a blowtorch so that the flame is 2 inches above the surface. Starting in the center and working in a circular motion, heat the sugar until it melts and caramelizes. Cook&#39;s Note: Feel free to try different chocolates or a combination of 2 or more. Milk chocolate adds mellow sweetness to the mix, while bittersweet chocolate adds a rich complexity. I find kids (and the kid in some adults) clamor for the milk chocolate and many adults adore the semisweet or bittersweet. Alternately, play with flavors. Swap out the espresso powder for a splash of raspberry liqueur, like Chambord or Framboise for a fruity finish. Experiment and find what you love-it&#39;s fun! Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat, open flame, and prolonged exposure to sunlight. They should only be used in well-ventilated areas. When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you. Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve. Light the gas jet, and blow out the match. Always turn off the burner valve to \finger tight\ when finished using the torch. Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 62063,&quot;Mozzarella In Carrozza 1 pound mozzarella ball, sliced 4 anchovy fillets 8 slices toasted bread, crusts removed 2 eggs 1 cup milk 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Salt Instructions: Sandwich a slice of mozzarella and an anchovy fillet between two pieces of bread for each carrozza.

For a smoky flavor that will add depth to the finished dish, grill the eggplants on a very hot, oiled grill pan (or barbecue) until the skins are wrinkled and black, and the eggplants shriveled and soft; turning often. (If you prefer, roast the eggplants in a preheated 400 degree F oven for 30 minutes.) When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, split them open and scoop out the flesh, discarding the skin and as many seeds as possible. In a food processor, combine the garlic, tahini, lemon juice and parsley; puree until smooth. Add the eggplant flesh; season with cumin, salt, and pepper; pulse several times to make a thick, coarse puree. Pour in the oil and pulse again to incorporate. Taste and adjust seasoning, as needed.

While the pan is heating, arrange the flour on a large dish. Season the cubed beef with some salt and freshly ground black pepper and then toss in the flour to coat. Shake off the excess flour and add the beef chunks in a single layer to the hot pan, being careful not to over crowd the pan, you might have to work in batches. Thoroughly brown all of the cubes on all sides. Once all the meat has been browned remove it to a plate and reserve. Add the wine to the pan and bring up to a simmer while you scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon being sure to loosen up all those tasty bits. Once the wine has gotten hot add the browned meat, thyme, smashed garlic, orange zest strip, ground cloves, freshly ground black pepper and salt, to taste, bay leaves and beef stock. Bring the mixture up to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook uncovered until the liquids start to thicken, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cover and cook on low heat for 2 1/2 hours. After 2 hours add halved potatoes, sliced carrots, pearl onions and mushrooms, along with a pinch of sugar to balance out the acid from the red wine. Turn the heat up slightly and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes more, until the vegetables and meat are tender. Add the frozen peas during the last minute of cooking. Season with salt and pepper and remove the thyme sprigs. To serve, place the stew in a soup bowl, garnish with parsley, drizzle with olive oil and add a dollop of Horseradish Sour Cream. Right before serving add a slice of Toasted Peasant Bread, half way submerged in the stew. Combine sour cream, prepared horseradish and a drizzle of olive oil in a small bowl and mix until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper.

Toss in the onions, half of the diced Poblanos, the salt and pepper and cook until slightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon out any excess fat. Stir in the garlic and cook briefly just to release the aroma, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, add the potatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook 20 minutes. Puree in a food processor or blender just until smooth, being careful not to over-process. Over-working will result in a gummy soup. Return to the pot, stir in the Crema, Creme Fraiche or sour cream and bring just to a boil. Stir in the remaining Poblanos for garnish. Sprinkle with grated Anejo, if desired, and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 62073,&quot;Pizza with Pineapple and Ham 1 tablespoon yellow cornmeal 2 (8-ounce) pieces of homemade or purchased pizza dough, recipe follows 3/4 cup homemade or purchased marinara sauce, recipe follows 1 1/3 cups grated pasteurized mozzarella 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan<br> 4 canned pineapple slices, coarsely chopped 4 thin slices cooked ham, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup warm water (105 to 110 degrees F) 2 teaspoons dry yeast 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 small onions, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2 stalks celery, finely chopped 2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes 2 dried bay leaves Instructions: Position 1 oven rack in the center and the second rack on the bottom of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Sprinkle the cornmeal over 2 rimless baking sheets. Roll out each piece of pizza dough into a 10 to 11-inch round. Transfer 1 dough to each prepared baking sheet. Spoon the marinara sauce over the dough, dividing equaling and leaving a 1-inch border around each pizza. Sprinkle the cheeses over the sauce. Arrange the pineapple pieces in a single layer over the cheeses. Sprinkle with the ham. Bake the pizzas until the crusts are crisp and brown on the bottom and the cheese is melted on top, about 12 minutes. Cut the pizza into wedges and serve immediately. Mix the warm water and yeast in a small bowl to blend. Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a food processor to blend. Blend in the oil. With the machine running, add the yeast mixture and blend just until the dough forms. Turn the dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm draft-free area until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour. Punch the down dough and divide into 2 equal balls. (The dough can be used immediately or stored airtight in the refrigerator for 1 day.) In a large casserole pot, heat the oil over a medium-high flame. Add the onions and garlic and saute until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the celery, carrots, and 1/2 teaspoon of each salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and bay leaves, and simmer uncovered over low heat until the sauce thickens, about 1 hour. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Season the sauce with more salt and pepper, to taste. (The sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, then cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat before using.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 62074,&quot;Duck Rillette 4 confit duck legs, meat removed 1/2 cup minced onions 1 tablespoon minced parsley 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 tablespoon Cognac 4 tablespoons butter Salt and fresh black pepper 2 tablespoons confit duck fat Instructions: In a food processor with a metal blade, combine all the ingredients together.

Sift together the flour, cornmeal, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, melted butter (can be melted quickly in the microwave), and then the eggs. Gradually whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until the batter is just mixed and not clumpy. Heat a waffle iron to medium heat, spray the iron well with nonstick cooking spray and add 6 ounces of batter. Cook according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Transfer the cooked waffles to the oven to keep warm until ready to serve. Repeat with the remaining batter. For the chicken: Remove all the meat from the bones of the chickens. In a large saute pan or skillet, toss the pulled chicken in enough of BBQ sauce to coat. Add 1/3 cup water, a pinch of salt and simmer over medium heat until the chicken is warmed through. For the bourbon butter: Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat. Whisk in the brown sugar to form a thick paste. Gradually pour in the bourbon, whisking vigorously, and then remove from the heat. Stir in the vanilla and allow to cool to room temperature. If not using immediately, pour into a jar with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate up to 2 weeks; bring to room temperature before using. In a medium saute pan, coat the fruit with enough bourbon butter to cover. Simmer over low heat until the fruit starts to sizzle and release sugars. You can also put the pan in a hot oven for 5 to 10 minutes until the same reaction occurs. To serve, quarter the waffles and shingle them along the side of a plate. Place the BBQ pulled chicken in the center of the plate and spoon the bourbon-glazed fruit over both.

To make shaving the gorgonzola easier, freeze a piece of the cheese for at least 2 hours, then use a vegetable peeler to shave some over the salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 62085,&quot;Edible Vegetable Skewers 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 small zucchini 3 small yellow squash 2 tablespoons kosher salt 15 baby carrots Instructions: In a medium bowl, mix all the ingredients for the spice rub together until well blended; set aside. Cut the zucchini and squash in half lengthwise and gently scrape out the seeds with a spoon. Place the vegetables skin side down on a sheet pan. Sprinkle them evenly with salt and let them sit for 5 minutes to sweat. Rinse them in cold water to remove the excess salt and pat them dry with paper towels. Slice them widthwise into 1-inch pieces. Using the sharper end of a chopstick, gently screw a hole through the center of each piece. Put them into the spice rub and let them marinate while you prep the carrots. Using a peeler, peel down the baby carrots to the width of a chopstick, leaving the top inch of the carrot to use as a handle. Gently push a piece of zucchini onto the carrot with the skin side facing the \handle\ of the carrot. Next skewer a piece of squash at a 90 degree angle to the zucchini. Repeat 2 more times so that there are 2 pieces each of zucchini and squash on the carrot \skewer.\ Repeat until all the carrots have been used. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Place the skewers on the grill and cook for 3 minutes on each side or just until the vegetables are tender.

Transfer them to a heatproof measuring cup. Pour boiling water over the mushrooms to cover. Set aside for 20 minutes to plump them up. Then, using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the mushrooms from the liquid, leaving behind any grit that may have fallen to the bottom. If any of the morels are extremely large, halve them lengthwise. Liberally season the chicken pieces on all sides with sea salt and white pepper. In a deep 12-inch skillet, combine the oil and 4 tablespoons of the butter. Place over moderate heat. When the fats are hot but not smoking, add the chicken, skin side down, and brown until it turns an even golden color, about 5 minutes more. Carefully regulate the heat to avoid scorching the skin. (This may have to be done in batches.) When all the pieces are browned, use tongs (to avoid piercing the meat) to transfer them to a platter. Season again with sea salt and white pepper. Pour off and discard the fat in the skillet. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, the shallots, and the garlic. Cook, covered, over low heat, until soft but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add the wine and boil, uncovered, over high heat for 5 minutes to burn off the alcohol, which could make the sauce bitter. Add the cream and the morels, and stir to blend. Return the chicken and any juices that have accumulated to the skillet. Cover, and cook over low heat, turning the pieces in the sauce once or twice, until the chicken is cooked through and has thoroughly absorbed the sauce, about 20 minutes.

Bake potatoes until very soft on a bed of coarse salt in a baking dish, about 45 minutes. (The salt keeps the potatoes from touching the dish and developing a hard spot.) Cool potatoes until warm, then halve lengthwise and scoop out the flesh. Pass the flesh through a food mill or ricer, or push it through a coarse sieve. You should have about 4 cups. In a bowl, combine potato, egg yolks, Parmesan, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Work the mixture with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add 1 cup of the flour and knead very gently, patting and pressing the dough with your hands until all the flour is incorporated. Add some or all of the additional 1/4 cup flour if the dough feels too moist, it should be soft but shouldn&#39;t stick to your hands. Transfer dough to a work surface and roll into a log about 3 inches in diameter. Cut the log into 8 equal pieces. Give each piece a quarter-turn so that you are rolling the dough in a different direction, then roll into ropes, a generous 1/2-inch in diameter, as if making breadsticks. Flour the ropes generously, and then cut crosswise at 1/2-inch intervals. You can shape the gnocchi on a ridged butter paddle or on the back of a fork, or you can cook them as is. Let them dry at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before cooking. For the sugo: Heat a large saute pan over high heat. When hot, add oil, and then sprinkle in the mushrooms. Don&#39;t stir! Let the mushrooms sizzle and caramelize for 7 to 8 minutes. Stir and season with salt and pepper. Add garlic and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute to release its fragrance. Add the rosemary and shallot and cook for about a minute. Cook briefly to release their fragrance, then add tomato and red wine and simmer until almost evaporated. Add the broth or water. Simmer until slightly reduced, 4 to 5 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and stir in the butter. Sprinkle with the parsley and keep warm. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi. They are usually done about 2 minutes after they float to the surface, but test 1 to be sure. Lift them out with a skimmer and transfer to a large platter. Pour the warm sauce over the gnocchi. Grate Parmesan over the top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 62092,&quot;Poached Pears in Wine 4 firm pears, Bosc preferred, or Comice 1 bottle of Zinfandel 1 cup of sugar 1 1/2 cups of water 6 peppercorns 1 vanilla bean 1/3 pound Gorgonzola dolce 1/4 cup toasted pecans, coarsely chopped Instructions: Peel the pears, core them from the bottom, leaving the stems on.

In a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter with the thyme and sugar. Crowd the onions into the pan, center cuts down and skins on. Allow the onions to caramelize in the pan over medium heat, approximately 5 to10 minutes. Place the pan in the oven and cook until the onions are fork tender, approximately 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly, approximately 15 minutes. Remove the tough, outside onion skins without disturbing the onions. Roll out the puff pastry on a well-floured surface. Use a fork to dock the dough. Whisk together the egg and water with a fork to create an egg wash. Using a pastry brush, brush the puff pastry with the egg wash. Carefully lift and place the puff pastry, egg wash side down, over the onions. Brush the exposed side of the puff pastry with the egg wash and begin to tuck the puff pastry into the circumference of the saute pan making sure to envelope all the onions, while lifting the corners of the puff pastry. Fold the corners into the center of the pan, doubling the crust. Egg wash the top of the puff pastry and place the pan into the oven. Bake approximately 25 to 30 minutes or until the puff pastry is a golden brown and fully cooked. Remove the tart from the oven and flip the tart out onto a large plate and allow it to cool.

Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper and set aside. Pulse the cornmeal with the pecans and some salt and pepper in a food processor until uniform and the size of breadcrumbs. Create a breading station with the flour on a plate, the milk and egg beaten together and the pecan-cornmeal mixture on another plate. Be sure to sprinkle salt and pepper on each part of the breading station. Dip the fish in the flour, then the egg, then the cornmeal mixture. Heat the oil in a large oven-safe saute pan over medium heat. Brown the coated catfish until golden on one side, about 3 minutes. Then turn the fillets over and place in the oven to finish cooking, about 10 minutes longer (a few minutes more if the fillets are thick). For the spicy cream sauce: Place the onions and garlic with the stock, wine and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Boil and reduce for 5 minutes, gently pressing on the onions and garlic to release the flavors. Remove the onion and garlic and discard. Turn down the heat to low and whisk in the steak sauce and lemon juice, then the sour cream. Allow to cook and reduce 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly. (Place back on the heat for 10 seconds if needed to keep the temperature high enough.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62104,&quot;Triple Creme Tart 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 1/2 cups flour 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons almond flour 1/4 cup coarsely chopped toasted hazelnuts Pinch salt Triple creme filling, recipe follows 1 cup milk 1 cup plus 5 tablespoons sugar 4 eggs, separated 1/2-ounce or 2 tablespoons cornstarch 10 ounces triple creme cheese, rind removed and cut into pieces (recommended: St. Andre or Explorator) 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 tablespoon light corn syrup Splash water Instructions: In the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar until soft, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, almond flour, hazelnuts, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in two batches, scraping down the sides of the bowl in between additions. Mix until the dough is well combined. Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and form it into a disk. Chill for at least 1 hour, until firm. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round and fit into a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Trim excess dough. Use a fork to prick the crust all over to prevent air bubbles from forming. Bake the tart crust until it&#39;s pale golden all over, about 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer tart to a wire rack to cool. (Tart shell can be made 8 hours ahead.) Triple Creme Filling: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan combine 3/4 cup of the milk and 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Meanwhile, in a large bowl whisk together the remaining 1/4-cup milk, egg yolks, cornstarch and another 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Remove the milk mixture from the heat and add a little bit of it to the egg yolk mixture to warm it, whisking constantly to keep the yolks from cooking. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the hot milk mixture, whisking the milk constantly as you pour. Return the custard to the stove and cook it over medium heat, whisking constantly until the consistency of pudding (pastry cream). Add the cheese and freshly grated nutmeg, and whisk until smooth. Strain the custard through a sieve into a clean bowl. In a small heavy saucepan, stir and combine the remaining cup of sugar, light corn syrup and water. Cook over medium heat until it reaches (soft ball) 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip whites until they are opaque and hold very soft peaks. When the sugar syrup is ready, drizzle it into the whites in a slow and steady stream on low speed. Once fully incorporated, increase the speed and whip until stiff, but still warm. Whisk 1/3 of meringue into pastry cream to lighten. Fold in remaining 2/3 in 2 separate additions. Mound into prepared tart shell. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 30 minutes or until tart is golden brown and springy to the touch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62105,&quot;Blue Cheese Souffle with Fresh Figs and Honey 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing the ramekins 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup milk, warmed 2 tablespoons sugar, plus more for the ramekins 5 eggs, separated Pinch salt Ground white pepper Pinch ground nutmeg 1 cup crumbled blue cheese Pinch cream of tartar 8 fresh black mission figs, split in 1/2 lengthwise 1/2 cup honey Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare 4 (8-ounce) ramekins by greasing them with softened butter and then coating them with sugar, tapping out any excess. Make a thick bechamel sauce base by melting the 3 tablespoons of butter over low-medium heat in a thick-bottomed pot. Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a whisk to prevent lumps. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to coat the flour with fat and remove the starchy taste; do not allow the roux to brown. Add the warm milk to the mixture and continue to whisk until smooth and thick. Remove from the heat. Beat in the sugar and then the egg yolks 1 at a time. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir in the cheese until incorporated evenly. Chill the mixture while whipping the egg whites. In a separate clean bowl beat the egg whites and cream of tartar just until soft peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the bechamel mixture to lighten it. Then gently fold in the rest. Pour the batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a cookie sheet. Bake on the middle rack for about 25 minutes. The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden, and the center jiggles slightly. Serve with fresh figs and a drizzle of honey.

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly but gently with the whisk. Cook until it thickens and the whisk leaves light lines; it will still be quite liquid. Do not let it boil. Strain it into a bowl and press plastic wrap onto the hot surface. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Invert a 10-inch cake pan over the dough (towards the edge of the tray so you waste a minimum amount of dough) and press. Lift off and use a pizza cutter to cut around the imprint of the circle. Lift the circle of dough out and place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Dock it. Center the round metal bottom of 9-inch tart mold over the dough and press. Cut around at 1-inch intervals to form a decorative \fringe. Weigh the metal bottom down with heavy objects. (I place an 8-inch cake pan on top and fill it with stacked tartlet molds - about 3 1/2 pounds worth.) Bake about 18 minutes, until the edges are golden, then remove the weights and metal tart bottom. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the center is golden. Remove from oven and spread the lemon curd evenly in the center. Put back in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes to set the filling.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly chop the cumin seeds and add to a medium bowl. Trim the ends off the celery root, then peel and discard the exterior. Cut the root into 3/4-inch-thick planks and then into 3/4-inch cubes. Add the cubes to the bowl with the cumin seeds, then add the olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper and toss. Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and spread the celery root cubes on it in an even layer. Add the onion slices to the bowl the celery root was in and coat with the residual oil and seasonings. Arrange the onions on top of the celery root (if the onions are in contact with the pan for the entire cooking time, they could get too dark or burn). Roast until the cubes begin to brown on the bottom, about 15 minutes, then toss the vegetables around, scattering the onions around the pan, and flatten again into 1 layer. Continue to roast until the vegetables are very soft when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes more. Allow to cool for a few minutes before tossing with the parsley leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 62116,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Easy Sausage and Mushroom Rigatoni Pie 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound spicy Italian sausage, casings removed<br> 1 pound button mushrooms, sliced<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> One 24- to 25-ounce jar vodka sauce (you can also use Alfredo or marinara sauce)<br> 1 pound rigatoni 1/2 cup grated (like sand) Parmesan cheese<br> 1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 6 slices provolone cheese 6 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese<br> Grated (like sand) Parmesan cheese, for topping 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley<br> 6 to 8 fresh basil leaves, torn<br> Instructions: For the sauce. In a pan with straight sides on medium heat, add the olive oil and sausage. Crumble the sausage into bits, not boulders, and cook until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan. Add the mushrooms to the pan and cook until wilted and darkened, 6 to 8 minutes. Season with pepper and remove from the heat. Add the sausage back to the pan along with the pasta sauce and stir. For the pasta: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rigatoni to the boiling water and cook until very al dente. Drain and spread out on a cooling rack to prevent sticking. Let cool slightly. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the rigatoni to a bowl and sprinkle with the Parmesan and parsley. Gently toss with your hands. Coat the inside bottom and sides of a springform pan with cooking spray. Begin lining the rigatoni on end (vertically) around the edge of the pan, creating a border. Pack the pasta pieces tightly, but not so tight that the holes in the rigatoni close. Toss the remaining rigatoni in the sauce, then pour into the center of the pan. Gently press the mixture to level it off. For the topping: Arrange the provolone slices in an overlapping spiral to cover the pasta mixture, then top with the mozzarella. Gently press everything down with your hands. Bake until the top is bubbly and golden around the edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before releasing the springform. Serve topped with Parmesan, parsley and basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 62117,&quot;Kir Royale 12 ounces Champagne 2 splashes creme de cassis Instructions: Divide the Champagne evenly between 2 Champagne flutes.

Stir in salt and sugar until completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the diced carrots, onion, celery, leeks, spices and fresh herbs. Place the stockpot in refrigerator until cold. Remove the giblets from the turkey. Add the turkey to the stockpot and place a plate on top to weigh the turkey down to insure full immersion. Refrigerate the whole turkey for 72 hours. Remove from brine and place the turkey in a large, disposable, aluminum-roasting pan. Allow the turkey to come to room temperature. Meanwhile, start the grill. When the coals are white hot, bank them up high along the perimeter of the grill so they form a circle. Place the roasting pan on the grill rack and cover with the lid. Control the temperature of the grill by opening and closing the vents. If the grill is too hot, close the vents slightly, but not all of the way. If the grill is too cold, open the vents. While the turkey is cooking, baste frequently with olive oil or butter and pan juices. It may be necessary to add more coals during the cooking process. If so, fire the coals in a cone separately and add them when they are hot. It&#39;s important to know that brined turkeys cook more rapidly than un-brined turkeys. So you should check the internal temperature of the turkey after 1 1/2 hours grilling time. Remove the turkey from the grill when the deepest part of the thigh reaches 160 F. Let the turkey rest for 20 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 62124,&quot;Limoncello and Ice Cream with Biscotti Vanilla ice cream Limoncello liquor, stored in the freezer Store-bought biscotti Instructions: Place 2 scoops of the ice cream in an individual serving dish and place it in the freezer until ready to serve.

Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 12 hours and as long as 2 days. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Oil a roasting or baking pan with canola oil. Make the stuffing: Put the breadcrumbs in a medium bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the liver and gizzard with salt and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet and when it melts, add the giblets and cook quickly until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer them to a cutting board, chop finely and add to the breadcrumbs. Off of the heat, add the wine and scrape the bottom of the skillet to dislodge the brown bits; pour the liquid onto the breadcrumbs and mix. Add the pork to the skillet and cook until browned, about 5 minutes; scrape the pork into the bowl with the bread mixture. Add 3 tablespoons of the butter, the onions and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the onions are soft and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the sage and garlic and cook 1 minute longer. Add the Swiss chard and cook until wilted. Scrape the mixture and all the buttery juices onto the breadcrumbs and mix to combine. Add the chives and lemon zest and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed. Loosen the skin over the chicken breasts. Insert the remaining 4 tablespoons cold butter under the skin of the chicken breasts, pushing down to disperse them. Rub the chicken all over with a thin film of canola oil. Sprinkle the chicken heavily on all sides with 3/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the bread mixture, and stuff the neck skin with any remaining stuffing. Set the bird in the oiled roasting pan. Roast the chicken until the skin dries and the butter melts, about 15 minutes. Turn the heat down to 375 degrees F and continue to roast, basting the chicken once or twice with the fat that accumulates in the corners of the pan, until the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a large platter to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Strain the pan juices into a bowl and skim off the fat. Pour 1/4 cup water into the roasting pan, set it on a burner on high heat and scrape up any stuck-on bits on the bottom with a rubber spatula. Return the defatted juices to the pan and simmer together for 3 to 5 minutes to make a thin, natural gravy. Season with salt and pepper. Carve the chicken on the platter. Slice the wings at the joint, twist to remove them and set them above the chicken. Cut the thighs at the joint, twist to remove them, slice them diagonally at the leg joint to separate them into thigh and drumstick and lay them on the platter. Carve thin slices from the breast meat and let them lay as they fall; pour a little gravy over the white meat, avoiding wetting the crispy skin of the thighs. Cut the stuffed neck in slices, and serve with the rest of the gravy in a small pitcher on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62127,&quot;Fruit Wands 1 cantaloupe, peeled 2 cups vanilla yogurt (recommended: Dannon) 2 tablespoons honey 1 (2-pound) container pre-cut mixed fruit cubes (such as pineapple, cantaloupe, melon, watermelon) 16 whole strawberries Instructions: Cut the cantaloupe in half and remove all seeds from 1/2 with a spoon.

Grill the steaks until cooked to desired doneness, turning once, about 5 minutes per side for rare, 7 minutes per side for medium-rare. The key to getting those great grill marks is to place the steak down and not move them. After you flip them, do not shift the steaks.<br> Allow the steaks to rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing, otherwise all the juices will be run all over your cutting board. Run your knife along the bone and carve the meat off the bone. Slice the meat into 1-inch slices. Transfer the slices to a platter. Squeeze the lemon over the steaks. Drizzle with the oil and serve immediately with Grilled Vegetables. Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush the vegetables with 1/4 cup of the oil to coat lightly. Sprinkle the vegetables with salt and pepper. Working in batches, grill the vegetables until tender and lightly charred all over, about 8 to 10 minutes for the bell peppers; 7 minutes for the yellow squash, zucchini, eggplant, and mushrooms; 4 minutes for the asparagus and green onions. Arrange the vegetables on a platter. The key to getting those great grill marks is to not shift the vegetables too frequently once they&#39;ve been placed on the hot grill.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, parsley, basil, and rosemary in a small bowl to blend. Add salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle the herb mixture over the vegetables. Serve the vegetables, warm or at room temperature.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 62139,&quot;Root-Centric Noodle Bowl 4 purple carrots 1 cup rice vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 4 large eggs<br> 1/4 cup sesame oil 2 burdock roots, peeled and sliced into 2-inch-long matchsticks 1/2 cup soy sauce<br> 1/4 cup mirin<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> Three 5-by-2-inch sheets kombu 5 dried shiitake mushrooms<br> 1 large beet, diced, greens reserved and wilted, if desired for garnish 1 1/2 cups soy sauce<br> 1/2 cup maple syrup<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon MSG 4 packages konnyaku noodles (spaghetti thickness), such House Foods Instructions: For the eggs: Add to a blender the carrots, vinegar, sugar, salt and 1 cup water and blend at high speed for 3 minutes.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a small glass and a pencil, draw 6 (3 1/2-inch) circles on each piece of paper. Turn the paper face-down on the baking sheets. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, and a large pinch of salt on medium speed until frothy. Add 1 cup of the sugar and raise the speed to high until the egg whites form very stiff peaks. Whisk in the vanilla. Carefully fold the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar into the meringue. With a large star - shaped pastry tip, pipe a disc of meringue inside each circle. Pipe another layer around the edge to form the sides of the shells. Bake for 2 hours, or until the meringues are dry and crisp but not browned. Turn off the heat and allow the meringues to sit in the oven for 4 hours or overnight. Spread some of the sauce from the stewed berries on each plate. Place a meringue on top and fill with whipped cream. Top with berries and serve. Whip the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When it starts to thicken, add the sugar, vanilla and orange liqueur and continue to whip until the cream forms stiff peaks. Don&#39;t overbeat, or you&#39;ll end up with butter! Combine the blueberries, one-half pint of raspberries, the sugar and zest in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and cook uncovered over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes. The juice will become a syrup and the berries will be slightly cooked. Off the heat, stir in the remaining raspberries and the framboise. Set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 62144,&quot;Callie&#39;s Charleston Biscuits 2 cups self-rising flour, preferably White Lily brand 1/4 cup cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 2 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature, plus 1 tablespoon melted butter for glazing<br> 3/4 to 1 cup buttermilk<br> All-purpose flour, for dusting Serving suggestions: Savory Thyme Butter (recipe follows), blackberry jam, cream cheese 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons minced green onion 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme, or more to taste<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper (more than you think you&#39;ll need)<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Have an ungreased baking sheet ready. Place the self-rising flour in a large mixing bowl. Use 2 forks or your fingers to cut in the cream cheese and butter, making sure not to overwork the dough; there should be small chunks and some loose flour. Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the buttermilk, gradually incorporating it into the flour. (The dough will be wet.) Pat a little all-purpose flour on the top of the dough, then flip it out onto a floured surface, floured-side down. Flour the top of the dough lightly; that will make it easy to roll out but keep it moist inside. Lightly pat or roll out the dough to a 1 1/2-inch thickness (do not overwork it or the biscuits will be tough). Use a 2-inch biscuit cutter or a similarly sized drinking glass to cut out biscuits, cutting them as close together as possible. (The key to good biscuits is to avoid having to knead or roll out the dough too many times.) Arrange the biscuits on the baking sheet so that they are just touching. Roll out the leftover dough into a rope and outline the exposed outer edge of the biscuits, binding them together to stop the biscuits from spreading and creating a wonderful rise while baking. Brush the tops with the melted butter. Put the biscuits in the oven, then immediately turn the oven down to 400 degrees F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan, then bake until golden brown, an additional 6 to 10 minutes. Serve warm with spreads such as Savory Thyme Butter, blackberry jam or cream cheese. Combine butter, green onion, thyme, garlic and some salt and pepper in a bowl with a rubber spatula, or whip with a handheld mixer. Transfer to a ramekin, cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator, or roll into a log in plastic wrap and freeze until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62145,&quot;Veal Chops Stuffed with Fontina, Pancetta, and Porcinis and served with Braised Peas and Carrots 4 (10-ounce) veal chops, bone in 8 thin slices Fontina 4 slices thinly sliced pancetta Sauteed mushrooms, recipe follows 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and pepper 1 shallot, thinly sliced 1 cup white wine 1 cup veal or chicken stock 2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut on the bias into 1/4 inch thick slices 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 3 sprigs fresh thyme Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 cups chicken stock 1 cup frozen peas, thawed or fresh peas 1 pound cremini mushrooms 2 ounces dried porcini mushrooms soaked in hot water for 30 minutes and chopped 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic, finely sliced Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme Instructions: For the veal: Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan until almost smoking.

Cover the rice with cool water and soak for 30 minutes to 1 hour, then drain. Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add the turmeric and heavily salt the water (it should taste like sea water). Add the rice and boil for 5 to 7 minutes, until the rice is al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.<br> Stir together the yogurt, 3 scallions and 1 cup of the parboiled rice in a medium bowl.<br> Wrap the lid of an 8-inch nonstick skillet with a kitchen towel, ying the loose ends around lid handle to secure. (This will trap the steam and absorb condensation as the rice cooks.)<br> Add the oil and butter to an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter melts, pack the rice-scallion mixture evenly into the bottom of the pan then mound the remaining rice on top. Use a skewer or the handle of a wooden spoon to make 4 holes to vent the steam around the perimeter about 2-inches in from the outer edge. Make a fifth hole in the center. Cook, uncovered, rotating the skillet halfway through, until the bottom is golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Cover the skillet with the towel-lined lid and continue to cook, rotating the pan about a quarter turn every 10 minutes, until the rice is steamed and fluffy, about 35 to 40 minutes.<br> Remove the lid, dig a hole about 1-inch deep in the center of the rice, just large enough to hold the egg yolks, and pour them in. Then cover with the displaced rice. Return the lid to the skillet and cook until the yolk is just starts to set but is still runny, about 1 minute more.<br> Remove the lid. Use a butter knife or a small offset spatula to loosen the rice from the edge of the skillet. Place a plate over the skillet and flip the crisped rice pancake onto the plate. Sprinkle with remaining 2 scallions and slice into wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 62161,&quot;Baked Apples With Raspberry Cream And Toffee 8 Fuji apples water white sugar 2 cups fresh raspberries 1 1/2 Tbs. confectioners sugar 1 tsp. grated lemon zest 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 cup superfine sugar Instructions: APPLES: Core apples and peel top half.

Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture until you have something that resembles coarse meal with a few larger pea-sized pieces of butter. Add 6 tablespoons ice water and stir with a fork. If you can squeeze the mixture together in your hands, you have added enough water; if not, add a little more. The dough will look shaggy. Knead the dough with your hands a couple times in the bowl to get it to start to come together. Tip the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Use the edges of the plastic wrap to help gather the dough and form it into a flat rectangle. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.<br> For the fillings: In a large saucepan, combine the blueberries, 1/2 cup of the sugar, 3 tablespoons of the cornstarch and the salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the blueberries have released some juice and the sauce is thick, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool completely.<br> In a medium bowl, beat together the cream cheese, lemon zest and the remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg yolk. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> For the egg wash: In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water.<br> On a lightly floured piece of parchment, roll the dough out into a rectangle about 12 by 14 inches. Trim the ragged edges. (Pop the dough in the fridge to chill if it has gotten too soft.) Spread the cream cheese filling on the right half of the dough rectangle, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around the edges. Top with the cooled blueberry filling. Brush the border with the egg wash. Use the parchment to lift the left half of the dough over the filling. Use a fork to seal the edges. Using the parchment, transfer the pie to a baking sheet. Brush the top with more egg wash and sprinkle with the sanding sugar if using. Use a small paring knife to cut a few small slits in the top to vent the pie. Bake until golden brown and set, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62167,&quot;Jalapeno-Cheddar Beer Bread 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 2 3/4 cups self-rising flour, sifted (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons sugar 3/4 cup shredded Cheddar One 12-ounce can or bottle lager, pilsner or IPA-style beer, at room temperature 1 cup sliced pickled jalapenos Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush an 8-by-4-by-2 1/2-inch loaf pan with some of the melted butter. Whisk together the flour, sugar and 1/2 cup Cheddar in a large bowl. Pour the beer into a medium bowl. Add half of the remaining butter and whisk together (it will get foamy!).<br> Pour the beer-butter mixture into the flour mixture and fold until just combined (it&#39;s ok if there are lumps). The batter will be relatively thick and shaggy. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan and pat out into an even layer. Pour the remaining butter over the batter and top with the remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar and the jalapeno slices.

Scoop out 1 heaping teaspoon of Chocloate Chip Blondie mixture and roll it into a ball. Place onto the parchment paper and repeat with the remaining batter. Cover with plastic wrap and place into the freezer for at least 2 hours and up to 1 week. (Keep the truffles in the freezer only until needed prior to dipping in the chocolate, otherwise they will melt into the chocolate when they are dipped.) Remove 1 baking sheet of truffles from the freezer and skewer your toothpick into the truffle ball and dip into the melted chocolate. Use a spatula to paint the chocolate onto the toothpick and place the truffle back onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. Remove the toothpick and cover up the hole. Sprinkle the truffle with some fleur de sel. Finish dipping all the truffles and garnish with desired toppings.

Grease a 9 by 13-inch jelly roll pan with softened butter or cooking spray. Beat your butter in the bowl of a stand mixer until it is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the brown and granulated sugars a little bit at a time, pouring them in on the side of the bowl. While you&#39;re adding your sugars, stop the mixer occasionally and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure that everything is fully mixed. Cream the butter and sugar mixture until it is light and fluffy, about 8 minutes. (Creaming creates air pockets in the dough, and therefore these blondies have a light and delicate texture.) Whisk your flour, baking soda and sea salt in a bowl. Add your eggs 1 at a time, adding the second only after the first is fully incorporated. Once the second egg is fully incorporated, add your vanilla. Turn your mixer down to low speed and slowly add the flour/baking soda/sea salt mixture.

Grease a glass 9-inch-by-13-inch baking dish with butter and line it with strips of parchment paper so the paper comes up over the edge of the dish. Grease the paper with more butter. Place a small pot of water on medium heat, and bring to a simmer. Place a heatproof bowl over the simmering water and add the butter and chocolate to gently melt together, stirring to combine. (This can also be done in the microwave, heating at 15 second intervals.) Transfer the chocolate and butter mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add the brown and granulated sugars, eggs, vanilla and salt and whisk together. Add the flour and gently whisk to combine, then pour into the baking dish. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out somewhat clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let the brownies cool completely. Carefully spread the Minty Buttercream over the brownies, then refrigerate until firm. Once the buttercream has firmed up, use the parchment sleeves to carefully remove the brownies from the baking dish. Slice into bars. Combine the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until smooth. Add the creme de menthe and beat until combined. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar a quarter at a time and beat until the mixture is smooth and fluffy.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62200,&quot;Hot Apple Cider with Rum 1 apple 2 teaspoons whole cloves 1 orange, thinly sliced 2 quarts apple cider 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1 teaspoon allspice Pinch grated nutmeg 1 cup dark rum Cinnamon sticks, garnish Instructions: Stud the apple with the cloves.

Add the chickpea flour and stir constantly until golden brown and toasted, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Add the shallots, gingerroot, garlic and green chiles to a food processor and mince or puree. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and add the yogurt, butter, lemon juice, vinegar, tandoori masala, paprika, turmeric, garam masala, salt and black pepper. Add the toasted chickpea flour mixture and mix well. Remove any giblets or turkey parts from the neck and breast cavities of the turkey and reserve for other uses if desired. Dry the turkey well with paper towels, inside and out. Baste the whole turkey with the yogurt marinade, rubbing the mixture under the skin and inside of the breast cavity. Loosely cover the turkey and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours.\u202f\u202f Remove the turkey from the refrigerator an hour before you are ready to cook. Position an oven rack in the lowest position of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Set the turkey breast-side up in a roasting pan fitted with a roasting rack. Tent the bird with foil and roast for 2 hours. Remove the turkey from the oven and remove the foil. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and continue to roast the turkey until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 1 hour more. Remove the turkey from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62203,&quot;Quinoa and Salmon Croquettes 1/3 cup quinoa 1 1/2 pounds center-cut skin-on salmon fillet 1 large egg, beaten 1/4 cup chopped scallions (green parts only) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour Grated zest of 1 lemon 1 teaspoon Urfa pepper flakes (or freshly ground black pepper) Kosher salt 2 tablespoons coconut oil Lemon wedges, for serving Plus: 1 cup applewood chips Instructions: Soak the applewood chips in water for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the quinoa as the label directs. Drain the applewood chips and scatter them in a foil-lined flameproof roasting pan. Place the pan over two burners and heat over medium-low heat until the wood chips smoke, about 10 minutes. Place the salmon skin-side down on a wire rack and carefully set the rack over the wood chips. Cover the roasting pan tightly with foil and cook over medium-low heat until the salmon is just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the salmon from the smoker and let it cool to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove and discard the salmon skin, then flake the salmon with a fork and transfer to a large bowl. Add the quinoa, egg, scallions, flour, lemon zest, Urfa pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix until well combined. Form the mixture into 6 patties, about 1 inch thick and 2 1/2 inches wide. Heat the coconut oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Sear the patties until crispy and deep golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the patties to a rack set on a baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Serve the croquettes with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 62204,&quot;Yogurt-Tahini Dressing 2 tablespoons yogurt 1 tablespoon tahini (sesame paste) 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 teaspoon honey Instructions: Combine ingredients in a bowl.

Mix the ingredients only enough to incorporate. Allow to cool to 90 degrees and stir in the rum. Pour into a shallow dish that has been lined with waxed or parchment paper. The filling should be 5/8 inches thick. Allow to cool overnight or until firm, covered in refrigerator. Cut into squares. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Brachetto]&quot; 62206,&quot;Fiddlehead Ferns 1 pound fiddlehead ferns 3 tablespoons butter 2 teaspoons garlic, minced 1 teaspoon parsley, chopped (optional) Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Before you&#39;re ready to cook cut about 1/8-inch off the thick ends if they look brown and rinse the fern shoots thoroughly to get rid of the brown fuzzy chaff that clings to their sides. Dry the shoots thoroughly before cooking by first spinning them in a lettuce spinner and then patting them with paper towels. Melt butter in a pan at medium heat. Add garlic, parsley and fiddleheads to the pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Saute for 5 minutes or until they are done. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62207,&quot;Orange Spiced Crumb Cake 1 1/2 cups pecans 2 sticks unsalted butter, melted 3/4 cup light brown muscovado sugar 1/2 cup pure cane granulated sugar 2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 stick unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 cups pure cane granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 cup whole milk 1/4 cup canola oil 2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons orange juice 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: For the crumb topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the pecans in an even layer onto a baking sheet and toast in the oven, stirring once, until lightly golden brown and just fragrant, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a baking rack and let cool slightly before coarsely chopping. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over high heat until it begins to turn light golden brown. Whisk in both of the sugars and cook until smooth. Take the pot off the heat and add the flour, cardamom, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg and mix until clumps begin to form. Refrigerate the crumb mixture for 15 minutes. For the cake: Heavily butter a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the melted butter, milk, canola oil, orange zest, vanilla and eggs. Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking pan, smoothing out the surface. Scatter the crumbs in large clumps over the cake; the crumb layer should be quite deep. Bake until the crumbs are golden and firm and a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 55 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. For the glaze: Whisk together the sugar, butter, juice, zest and vanilla. Once the cake is cool, drizzle the glaze over it and cut into 9 pieces. Serve on a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62208,&quot;Garlic-Roasted Asparagus 1/4 pound prosciutto, thinly sliced 2 pounds asparagus, tough ends trimmed, rinsed and patted dry Salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup pine nuts 3 hard-boiled eggs, sliced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place asparagus in a baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Heat a small saute pan over medium heat. Add olive oil and garlic and then lemon juice and pine nuts. Toast until nuts begin to brown slightly. Remove from heat and drizzle over asparagus. Roast in the oven until just cooked. Serve warm or at room temperature with eggs and prosciutto. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 62209,&quot;Roasted Poussin with Sixteen Spices with Caramelized Mango-Garlic Sauce with Fried Plantains 3 tablespoons cinnamon 3 tablespoons ancho cl powder 3 tablespoons pasilla cl powder 3 tablespoons ground cumin 3 tablespoons ground coriander 3 tablespoons ground ginger 1 tablespoon ground cloves 1 tablespoon ground fennel seed 2 tablespoons garlic powder 2 tablespoons onion powder 1 tablespoon all spice 1 teaspoon cl de arbol 3 tablespoon brown sugar 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper Olive oil 4 poussin, 1 1/2 pounds each 8 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 Spanish onion, coarsely chopped 4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 1 large ripe mango, peeled, pitted and coarsely chopped 1/4 cup light brown sugar 6 cloves roasted garlic, smashed to a paste 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro Salt and freshly ground pepper 4 green plantains, peeled and sliced on bias into 2-inch pieces 2 cups peanut oil Salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine the spices in a medium bowl. Brush each poussin with oil and rub the spice mixture over the entire bird. In a hot large saute pan sear all sides of poussin, until golden. Place the birds on a rack over a baking sheet and roast the birds for 25 to 30 minutes, until just cooked through. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. Place stock in a medium saucepan over high heat and reduce to 4 cups. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the onions and cook until soft. Add the roasted garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the mango, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the reduced stock and brown sugar and cook slowly over medium heat until the mango is very soft, and falling apart, 30 to 40 minutes. Place the mixture, in batches, in a blender and blend until smooth. Strain the mixture into a clean saucepan, whisk in the roasted garlic and cook for 10 to15 minutes until reduced and slightly thickened. Stir in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat oil in a cast iron skillet to 365 degrees F. Fry the plantains in batches until golden brown. Remove them with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels and season with salt to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 62210,&quot;Wild Mushroom Spring Rolls with Chinese Mustard Dipping Sauce 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1/2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger 2 scallions, sliced thin 1 pound mixed wild mushrooms (such as chanterelle, crimini, oyster, shiitake) 2 cups shredded Napa cabbage 1 carrot, grated 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce 1 tablespoon oyster sauce 2 ounces bean thread noodles, blanched and chopped 1/2 cup bean sprouts 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 package spring roll wrappers 1 egg, beaten Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup hot water 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 1 tablespoon sugar Instructions: Heat oil in a skillet or wok over high heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and scallions and cook for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and cook for another minute. Add the cabbage and carrot and cook until the cabbage starts to wilt, about 2 minutes. Stir in the hoisin and oyster sauces; toss to coat the mixture. Remove from the heat and mix in the noodles, sprouts, and cilantro; season to taste with salt and pepper. The filling should be moist but not wet. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Lay a spring roll wrapper on a flat surface on an angle so it looks like a diamond. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling near the bottom corner of the wrapper and fold up to enclose the filling. Fold in the 2 sides. Paint the top seam of the wrapper with beaten egg. Continue rolling up to form a tight cylinder. Pour about 1-inch of oil in a skillet or wok and heat to 350 degrees F. Fry the spring rolls, turning to cook all sides, until browned, about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Serve with Mustard Dipping Sauce. For the Mustard Sauce: Mix all ingredients together and stir until the sugar dissolves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 62211,&quot;Tailgator&#39;s Pulled Pork Sandwich 2 (7 to 9 pound) bone in pork butt 2 cups Tailgator&#39;s Pulled Pork Rub, recipe follows 1 hickory log 4 cups BBQ sauce<br> 1 1/4 cups kosher salt 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup ground cumin<br> 1 cup black pepper 1 cup cayenne pepper<br> 1/2 cup paprika 1/2 cup garlic powder 1/4 cup onion powder 1/4 cup dried thyme 1/4 cup dried oregano<br> Instructions: Using 1/2 a cup or more pork spice blend rub generously over the entire pork butt.

Keeps well in a slow cooker for several hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Merlot, Zinfandel]&quot; 62213,&quot;Boneless Colorado Lamb Porterhouse 1-ounce olive oil 1 pound chanterelle mushrooms, cleaned and sliced<br> 2 tablespoons minced shallot 1 pound lamb trim meat, finely ground 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves<br> Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper 2 lamb loins, fat and silverskin removed (approximately 20 ounces each)<br> 4 lamb tenderloins, fat and silverskin removed 8 ounces dark mushroom powder (available at gourmet stores) 8 ounces caul fat 1-ounce vegetable oil 1 quart lamb stock Creamed Spinach, recipe follows Sauteed Potatoes, recipe follows<br> 1 pound fresh spinach, washed 1 pint heavy cream 1 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg Kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper 1 pound large Yukon gold potatoes 4 ounces duck fat (vegetable oil can be substituted) Instructions: In a large saute pan over high heat place oil, add mushrooms and sear well. Add the shallots and continue to cook until mushrooms are tender and any liquid has evaporated. Place mixture in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Refrigerate until completely cool. In a stainless mixing bowl place ground lamb, mushrooms, and herbs. Mix until well combined and season with salt and pepper. Divide mixture in 1/2 and place between cellophane. Shape with fingers and spread to the same length and width of the lamb loin. Roll the tenderloin in the mushroom powder (this will provide a visual break between the loin and the tenderloin in the completed dish as well as enhance the flavor.) Position each loin halfway on top of each of the ground lamb mix and place the tenderloin on top of the loin. Lift the cellophane and contour the meat around the tenderloin and press against the loin. Wrap with a single layer of caul fat and tie with butcher&#39;s twine at 1-inch intervals. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large ovenproof saute pan over high heat add vegetable oil, season meat and sear in pan until all sides are nicely browned. Place pan in the oven and continue to cook approximately 15 minutes until the desired temperature is reached. Remove meat from pan and allow to rest 10 minutes before slicing (twine can be removed.) Deglaze the pan with lamb stock, reduce to a sauce consistency and adjust seasoning. Serve on warm serving plates with potatoes, spinach and thick slices of the lamb. Spoon sauce over the top and serve. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, quickly blanch the spinach and refresh in ice water. Allow spinach to completely cool, then, using a clean dish towel wring out all of the excess water and finely chop.<br> In a large sauce pot over medium heat place the cream. Bring the cream to a simmer and allow to reduce by 2/3, add nutmeg and season, to taste. Hold warm. Just before serving, add the spinach and mix well. Slice potatoes 1/4-inch thick and using a cookie cutter, punch out disks of the potato and place in cold water (reserve the trim for another use). In a large saute pan over high heat, place duck fat and then add the potatoes (which have been drained and patted dry.) Cook potatoes until they have a tender interior and a golden exterior. Season and hold warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 62214,&quot;BBQ Kale Chips 1 bunch kale, washed and dried (about 1 pound) Olive oil cooking spray, for spraying BBQ Seasoning, for sprinkling, recipe follows 1/4 cup paprika 2 tablespoons ancho cl powder 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon salt 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard Instructions: Preheat the oven 275 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the thick stem from the kale and discard. Tear the kale leaves into bite-size pieces. Lay the kale onto the prepared baking sheet and spray evenly with cooking spray. Bake until crispy and browned on the edges, tossing the kale halfway through, 18 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle the kale with BBQ Seasoning and serve. Mix the paprika, ancho cl, sugar, garlic powder, salt and dry mustard in a small bowl.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 62215,&quot;Amy&#39;s Crusty Italian Loaf 1/4 cup, (2 ounces) very warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast 1 cup, (8 ounces) cool water ( 75 degrees) 1 1/2 cups, (12 ounces) Sponge Starter, recipe follows 3 1/2 cups, (16 ounces) unbleached allpurpose flour 1 tablespoon, plus 1 teaspoon Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) very warm water (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F) 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast 3 1/2 cups (16 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour Instructions: Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Add the cool water and sponge starter to the yeast mixture and mix with your fingers for about 2 minutes, breaking up the sponge. The mixture should look milky and slightly foamy. Add the flour and salt and mix with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the ingredients together until the dough gathers into a mass. It will be wet and sticky, with long strands of dough hanging from your fingers. If the dough is not sticky, add 1 tablespoon of water. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until it becomes supple and fairly smooth. This is a sticky, wet dough; don&#39;t be tempted to add more flour to the work surface. Just dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to loosen the dough from the table during kneading. Allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes, until it is stretchy and smooth, yet still slightly sticky. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees) for about 1 hour, or until the dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, or preferably, overnight to let it relax, develop flavor, and become more manageable. Take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, until it begins to warm up and starts to rise. Flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it. Divide the dough into three equal pieces, about 13 ounces each. Gently flatten one piece, pressing out some of the air bubbles, and stretch it into a rectangle. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure. Do not elongate. These loaves are about 10 inches long. Cover an area on the work surface with a thick layer of flour and place the loaf, seam side down, on the flour. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. The loaves will be loose and slightly irregular in shape. Leave plenty of space between the loaves they will spread as they rise. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours, until bubbly and loose. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone. Sprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal. Line an upsidedown baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with cornmeal. Lift one loaf, flip it over so the floured side is on top, and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of the peel, or about 14 inches on a pan. Repeat with the remaining loaves, placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan. Dimple each loaf with your finger in about 6 places, but don&#39;t deflate them too much. Be sure the loaves are loosened from the peel, then carefully slide them onto the baking stone. Place the pan of bread on the rack below the stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaves with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist the loaves again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later. Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust is not brown enough, the loaves will soften as they cool.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes until a smooth, somewhat elastic batter has formed. The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using an electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this point you have two options: If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse. This may take 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of the room and the strength of the yeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small dents will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough. It&#39;s best if you have already weighted or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much. If you&#39;re not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85 degrees to 90 degrees F) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the bread recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours), but don&#39;t let it collapse too much before you use it.

For the steaks: Place the steaks in a large shallow baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the marinade over the steaks and turn to coat. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours or overnight. Cover the remaining marinade and place in the refrigerator. One hour before cooking the steaks, remove marinade from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature. Heat a grill pan over high heat until smoking or heat up an outdoor grill Remove steaks from the marinade, discard marinade, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Grill for 4 minutes on each side for medium rare doneness. Use the other 1/2 of the marinade to serve with the steaks. For the Roasted Tomatoes: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the lentils, garlic cloves and bay leaves with 4 cups water or just enough to cover. Bring the water to a simmer and lower the heat. Simmer the lentils, uncovered, until they are tender, about 25 to 30 minutes. (Chef&#39;s Note: If you need to add more water for the lentils to finish cooking, add a little at a time. There will be more flavor in the lentils if you cook them and end up with very little liquid at the end of the process. The flavor will be in the lentils instead of down the drain with the discarded cooking liquid!) Once they are cooked but still somewhat \al dente, set them aside to cool. Remove and discard the garlic cloves and the bay leaves. Season with just a touch of salt and pepper, to taste. Retaste, but hold off on reseasoning until serving. Add the duck fat to a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions, season with salt, to taste, and allow them to caramelize. When you are ready to serve add the lentils to the sauteed cipollini onions. Stir to coat the lentils with the duck fat. Taste and season with salt, if needed, and stir in the vinegar. Transfer the lentil mixture to a serving bowl and serve with duck and green peppercorn glaze, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 62226,&quot;English Chocolate Crisps 7 1/4 ounces milk chocolate, such as Perugina 5 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, such as Lindt or Perugina 3 cups cornflakes, such as Kellogg&#39;s 1/3 cup dried cranberries Instructions: Chop the two chocolates and place 3/4 of them in a heat-proof bowl. Place the bowl in a microwave on high heat for 30 seconds, remove the bowl, and stir the chocolates vigorously with a wooden spoon. Continue heating and stirring the chocolates in 30-second intervals, switching to 15-second intervals as the chocolates start to melt, continuing to stir vigorously with a wooden spoon in between each heating. Heat only until the chocolates are just melted. Add the remaining quarter of the chocolates and stir vigorously until melted and smooth. (If the chocolate isn&#39;t completely melted, microwave it for another 5 or 10 seconds.) Place the cornflakes in a medium bowl, pour the chocolate mixture over the cornflakes, and immediately fold them together with a rubber spatula, being careful not to break up the cornflakes. You&#39;ll want to work quickly so the chocolate doesn&#39;t harden. Fold in the cranberries. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Working with 2 soup spoons, spoon 8 mounds of chocolate crisps onto the paper. Set aside at room temperature to cool completely until hardened.

Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, salt and ginger.<br> In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, yogurt, oil, vanilla extract, banana, carrots, and egg. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and fold to blend well. Fill the cups of the muffin tin about halfway with the batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the tops of the cupcakes spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes.<br> Cool in the pan for 3 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely (cooling the cupcakes in the pan completely will make them tough). For the frosting: In the heatproof bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the sugar, salt and egg whites. Place the bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water to create a double boiler (make sure there is space between the water and the bottom of the bowl). Whisking by hand, heat the mixture until slightly thickened, a bit lighter in color and hot to the touch; a candy thermometer dipped into the mixture should reach 160 degrees F (very important so that the frosting will whip up firmly!). Return the bowl to the stand mixer. Whip the mixture on high speed until very thick, fluffy and pale latte in color, 5 to 10 minutes depending on your mixer. The frosting is done when it&#39;s very stiff and the bowl is completely cool to the touch all over.<br> Top the cooled cupcakes with 2 tablespoons frosting per cake. Dust lightly with ground cinnamon to garnish.

Select a wide 2 to 2 1/2-quart baking dish or casserole, large enough to hold 8 cups of fruit and 1 to 2 inches of crumble, and set aside. Prepare the topping: in a large bowl combine the sugars and stir with a fork to break up any lumps of demerara. Blend in the flour. With a pastry blender or by rubbing the mixture roughly between your fingers, cut in the butter until the crumble begins to lump together. (The crumble may also be prepared up to this point in a food processor fitted with a steel blade: whir the sugars together to break them up, then add the flour and whir just to mix. Add the diced butter and use quick pulses to reduce the mixture to a lumpy crumble. Transfer the crumble to a bowl and proceed with the rest of the recipe by hand.) Add the coconut and the macadamias and work these by hand, kneading the mixture until evenly moist and crumbly, then set aside. Prepare the fruit: cut the pineapple, papaya, and mango flesh into roughly 1-inch chunks and combine in large, non-reactive bowl. Peel and slice the banana, then add to bowl. Sprinkle the fruit with lime juice and toss gently to coat. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and tapioca, then toss with the fruit. Don&#39;t forget to taste! If not sweet enough for your liking, add another few tablespoons of sugar. If the sweetness is more that you care for, add another squeeze of lime. Spoon the fruit into the baking dish. Sprinkle the crumble mixture evenly over the top. Be generous! I like to have every bit of fruit covered with a good inch or so of sweet crunchy topping. Set the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 45 minutes, or until the topping is a rich golden brown in spots and the juices from the fruit are visibly bubbling up through the crumble. Remove from the oven and cool at least 20 minutes before serving. (The crumble may be baked up to 2 days ahead and reheated in a 350 degree F oven for 15 minutes before serving.)

Then transfer to a strainer and rinse well) 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper, black or white 1 pint (2 cups chicken stock) 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 shallot, minced 1 cup (about 3 ounces) white mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and sliced 1/2 cup Merlot 2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon water 2 teaspoons tomato paste 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup demi-glace 2 teaspoons fresh finely minced flat-leaf parsley (from about 3 to 4 large sprigs) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Oil 3 ounces bacon strips 1 medium onion, diced 6 baby potatoes, sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon minced scallions, white and tender green parts only 1 quart chicken stock 1/3 cup packed fresh basil leaves 1/8 cup packed fresh tarragon leaves 1/4 cup packed fresh parsley leaves 6 (3 or 4-ounce) boneless chicken breasts Oil 3 (6 to 8-ounce) New York strip steaks Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound steamed haricots verts, as garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To make the olive salsa for the chicken topping, slice the root end off the entire head of garlic and turn it upside down, wrap it in aluminum foil and mold the foil so it supports the garlic to allow the cut end to stand upright in the oven. Pour about 1 teaspoon olive oil on the garlic so it slips between the skin and the cloves and wrap with the foil so it is enclosed. Roast for about 1 hour and set aside until it is cool enough to handle. In a small bowl combine the tomato, basil, parsley, peppercorns, olives and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Gently squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from the skins into the mixture. Fold everything together and set aside to let flavors integrate. For the rice accompaniment to the chicken, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and stir in the basmati rice, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper, allowing rice to toast for a few minutes. Then add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer covered and undisturbed for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. While the rice is cooking begin the sauce for the steak. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan, over medium-high heat, and saute the shallot until it becomes translucent. Add the mushrooms and cook until they are tender and give up their juices. (While the mushrooms are cooling, begin sauteing the bacon in a separate skillet for the potatoes.) Add the merlot and cook for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate small bowl, make a slurry with 1 tablespoon water and the cornstarch, then add the tomato paste and Dijon mustard and mix thoroughly until smooth. Add this mixture to the pan of mushrooms along with demi-glace and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Turn heat down to medium low, and allow to reduce and thicken. While the mushrooms are cooking, heat the oil in the deep-fryer to 375 degrees F or according the manufacturer&#39;s instructions for potatoes. Saute the bacon strips in a skillet until crispy. Remove to paper towels to drain and cool to room temperature. Drain excess bacon fat from the skillet leaving a coating in which to saute the onion. Cook until the onion becomes translucent. Deep-fry the baby potato slices until golden and drain on paper towels. Transfer them to the pan of onions, and crumble in the bacon. Toss in the scallions and season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F for the steak, if you are finishing in the oven. In a large saute pan, heat the chicken stock over medium-high heat. Add the basil, tarragon and parsley, bring to a boil to integrate flavors, then reduce heat. This is your poaching liquid. Season the chicken breasts generously on both sides with salt and pepper, rubbing the seasoning in, and place the chicken in simmering poaching liquid. (Remember, you are poaching, not boiling. The liquid should be kept at a simmer.) Poach chicken until cooked through, about 10 minutes, turning breasts midway through cooking period. Remove to paper towels to drain. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet with oven-safe handles. Season the steaks with walt and pepper. Sear for about 2 minutes per side undisturbed (to let seasonings integrate into the surface of the meat) and then to your preferred level of doneness. Transfer the entire skillet to the oven to finish (about 10 minutes for medium-rare) They can also be cooked on a grill. Let steaks rest, then slice into 1/4- inch thick slices. On half of the serving plate, spoon some basmati rice, top with a piece of chicken, and spoon olive salsa over chicken. On the other half of the serving plate, spoon some potatoes, top with a \fan\ of steak slices (about 3 ounces of steak or an amount equal to half of a strip steak, per person) and drizzle sauce over sliced steak. Garnish the plate with haricots verts. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Malbec]&quot; 62267,&quot;Arroz Rojo 2 plum tomatoes, cored 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 cup minced white onion 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup long-grain rice 1 3/4 cups chicken broth 1/4 cup canned tomato sauce 1 serrano cl 1 sprig fresh cilantro Salt Instructions: Using a box grater, grate the tomato into a medium bowl, discarding the tomato skin. Heat the oil in a medium heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the rice and cook until slightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Add the broth, tomato sauce and grated tomato and bring to a boil. Add the serrano, cilantro sprig and salt, to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat under the skillet.

Place the cheese between the bread at an angle so that the edges hangover the sides of the bread. Butter the outside of one bread slice with half the butter. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Press the sandwich on, buttered-side down. Press until the bread is golden brown and the cheese has started to melt. Butter the other side (which is facing up) with the remaining butter and flip. Cook until golden brown and the cheese is gooey, this should all take 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the sandwich from the heat and hold. Meanwhile, in a pan over medium heat, cook the bacon until barely crisp, about 5 minutes. Flip the bacon, pushing the two pieces next to each other to form a square. Crack the egg on top, cooking into the bacon. Continue cooking until the egg is set, about 5 minutes. Open up the sandwich (use a spoon to help pull apart the bread) and slide in the eggs and bacon. Close up, slice and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 62269,&quot;Double Chocolate Chip Cookies with Pecans 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 11 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into cubes 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons instant espresso powder 3 large eggs 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1 cup granulated sugar 12 ounces (about 2 cups) chocolate chips 1 3/4 cups chopped pecans Instructions: Position 1 rack in the top 1/3 and another in the bottom 1/3 of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt into a medium bowl and set aside. Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over hot, simmering water. Remove from the heat but keep the chocolate mixture over a bowl of hot water to ensure that the mixture does not set. In a small bowl, combine the vanilla extract and the espresso powder and whisk until the espresso powder is dissolved. Stir the espresso mixture into the chocolate mixture. Combine the eggs and both sugars in the 4 1/2 quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer. Set the bowl over a pan of hot, hot simmering water. Stir with a hand-held wire whisk until warm to the touch. Attach the bowl to the mixer stand. Using the wire whip attachment, whip the mixture on high speed until pale, thickened and cool, about 5 minutes. Fold into the warm chocolate mixture. Fold in the flour. Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto the 2 prepared pans leaving about 1 to1/2 inches between the cookies. Bake for 12 to14 minutes or until the cookies are set: switch the positions of the baking sheets halfway through the baking time for even baking. Cool the cookies on the baking sheets on wire racks for about 3 minutes, then transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely.

Mix lightly with your fingertips until the dough forms grapesized pieces. You should still be able to see streaks of fat. Stir in the water. Lightly knead, handling the dough as little as possible, until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more water if needed. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, then remove and let it return to room temperature, about 1 hour, before rolling. The dough can be frozen for as long as a week. Pinch off about half the dough. Roll out, on a floured surface, to a thickness of 1/8inch. Cut out 3inch circles. Then, gather the scraps, add to the rest of the dough, and roll out another batch of circles. Repeat, with the rest of the scraps. This should be enough dough for about 24 empanadas. Filling: In a large heavy skillet, over a medium high heat, saute the ground beef until the meat is browned, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain off the excess fat. Add the onion and saute 2 minutes. Then add the garlic, almonds, and raisins, and saute 1 minute. Place the tomatoes, chilies, lime juice, salt, and pepper in a blender and puree until smooth. Add the puree, cumin, cloves, cinnamon and salt and pepper to the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes to get rid of any excess liquid. Cool. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle of pastry. Fold over the pastry and seal the edges. Let the empanadas rest in the refrigerator 1/2 hour or freeze immediately. (Bake the frozen empanadas without defrosting.) Empanadas may be glazed (1 egg and 2 tablespoons milk, well beaten) and baked until golden in a 400 degree oven, for about 15 minutes. Or they may be deep-fried in oil at 375 degrees until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes a side. (If you deepfry them, make sure the edges are well sealed so the filling won&#39;t leak.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 62272,&quot;Prosecco and Scotch Whiskey Julep Ice 1 cup Mint Simple Syrup, recipe follows 1 cup single malt Scotch whiskey, such as Glenfiddich 5 fresh mint sprigs, plus extra for garnish 2 cups prosecco, chilled 1 cup sugar 1 packed cup packed fresh mint leaves Instructions: In an ice-filled pitcher, mix together the Mint Simple Syrup, whiskey and 5 mint sprigs.

In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, and 3 cups of water. Put electric mixer on a slow speed and add sour cream and egg mixture to the flour mixture. Mix for about 2 1/2 minutes. At this point check the dough and make sure it is creamy and pliable, if it is too sticky, add a bit of flour, if it is not pliable add more water. When dough reaches desired texture, remove from the mixer and let rest on a floured table, covered with plastic wrap, for about 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, begin working the dough with a floured rolling pin. Roll dough out to a rectangular shape that is 1 to 1 1/2-inches thick. Cut this into quarters. Take 1 sheet and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness. If dough begins to stick, sprinkle it with a bit of flour. Using a 2 to 3-inch cookie cutter, cut dough into circles. Once circles are cut, roll the circles to 1/8-inch. Place 1 tablespoon of the desired filling in the center of each circle. Lightly wet 1/2 of the edge of the circle with water, fold over and crimp together. Gently place pierogi into hot salted water that is just under boiling point, about 190 degrees F, and cook for 3 minutes or until pierogi float. Drain. Melt butter in a large frying pan. Add pierogis and cook until golden brown. Serve with Sauteed onions, a dollop of sour cream and chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Tempranillo]&quot; 62284,&quot;Sausage with Apple and Sage 2 pork sausages, cooked 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled and cored 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed 2 tablespoons butter Pinch sugar 24 small sage leaves Instructions: Slice the pork sausage into 1/4-inch/1/2 cm-inch slices on the bias. Cut the apple into 24 cubes. Heat the oil in a saute pan and fry the sausage slices on both sides until golden brown, remove to a platter. Wash the pan before melting the butter in the pan for the apples. Add the sugar, and fry the apple cubes, tossing occasionally, until golden on all sides. Add a little more oil to the pan, if needed, and fry the sage leaves until slightly crisp, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Lay a fried sage leaf on each sausage slice. Top with a cube of sauteed apple. Pierce with a toothpick and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 62285,&quot;Strawberry Ice Cream 3 cups half-and-half 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 vanilla bean (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)<br> 9 large egg yolks<br> 3 cups heavy cream<br> 1 pound strawberries, hulled, plus extra for serving<br> Instructions: Stir together the half-and-half and 2 cups of the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Split the vanilla bean, scrape out the caviar and add it to the mixture (or add the vanilla extract). Heat the mixture until it&#39;s hot but not simmering or boiling. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks vigorously with a whisk until they start to lighten in color, about 2 minutes. Next, grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and very slowly drizzle it into the bowl with the egg yolks, whisking the whole time. (The purpose of this is to temper the egg yolks and bring them to a good temperature before adding them to the pan.) Repeat with a second ladle of hot half-and-half mixture, making sure to whisk the whole time. Pour the tempered yolks into the saucepan with the rest of the half-and-half mixture and stir gently with a wooden spoon, cooking it slowly, until it&#39;s thick enough to coat the spoon, 2 to 4 minutes. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean bowl. Pour the thick half-and-half liquid through the strainer into the bowl. Add the heavy cream and stir gently to combine. Refrigerate this mixture until chilled, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, combine the strawberries and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a blender. Puree until smooth (or you can stop just short of smooth if you want a little texture). Pour the pureed strawberries into the chilled custard mixture and stir. Now pour this mixture into your ice cream maker and freeze it according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Depending on the size of your machine, you may need to do this in 2 batches. Transfer to a freezer-safe container and place in the freezer until frozen firm, at least 4 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 62286,&quot;Chilled Tomato Soup and Crabcakes 8 vine-ripened tomatoes (about 8 ounces each for a total of 4 pounds) 3 teaspoons balsamic vinegar 1/4 teaspoon chopped garlic 1/4 cup olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 6 ounces peekytoe crab (or other top quality crabmeat such as jumbo lump from Maryland) 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chopped chives 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup bread crumbs (may also use panko, the dry Japanese bread crumbs) 8 basil leaves, plus 4 basil tops for garnish 1 ripe avocado Instructions: Roughly chop the tomatoes and pass through a food mill into a 4-quart stainless steel mixing bowl. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and the garlic, and then whisk in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and set aside. Add the crab, mayonnaise, chives and lemon juice to a large mixing bowl and mixing gently, combine well. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and blend in 1 tablespoon olive oil until just combined. Form the crab mixture into 4 round patties, approximately 1 1/2 inches high by 1 1/4 inches wide. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a 10 inch non-stick saute pan, and place over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, coat the top and bottom of each crabcake with bread crumbs, transfer to the hot pan, and saute until golden brown. Turn and repeat until crabcake is browned on both sides (note: crabcakes are very delicate, so please be gentle when handling them). To serve, stack the basil leaves and slice thinly. Halve the avocado, remove the pit, and using a spoon, invert the half and insert the spoon between the flesh and the skin gently. Jimmy the spoon gently, working deeper and deeper until the flesh is free from the skin. Dice avocado into medium cubes. Ladle the soup into 4 chilled serving bowls and add one quarter of the avocado to each. Place 1 crabcake in the center of the bowl and sprinkle with chiffonade of basil. Garnish each crabcake with a basil top, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 62287,&quot;Peachy Black Cherry Yogurt Pops 1/2 cup Smucker&#39;s?

Instructions: Form the ground beef into four 8-ounce patties. A quick and easy way to do this is to divide the meat into 4 piles. Place a pile on the top of a deli container lid. Take a second deli container lid and place the top of it against the meat. Press down evenly and firmly and watch as a perfect patty forms. Repeat with the remaining meat. Make an indentation in the middle of each patty with your thumb to keep the burger from shrinking as it cooks. Sprinkle each patty on both sides with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Lightly brush the grill grates with oil. Grill the patties, indentation-side up, until marked on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until marked and slightly firm, about 4 more minutes for medium-rare. For cheeseburgers, top with 1 slice cheese during the last minute of cooking if desired; cover the grill to melt. Remove to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. While the burgers cook, place the onion slices on the grill (try to keep them together in a disk). Cook until they are golden on one side, about 4 minutes, then flip with a metal spatula and sprinkle generously with salt. Cook on the other side until the onions are lightly charred and softened through, about 4 minutes, and transfer to a plate. Right before serving, toast the buns cut-side down on the grill. Top the bottom bun with a burger patty and layer with grilled onion, lettuce and a slice of tomato. Spread the inside of the top of each bun with some mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup. Arrange the pickle chips on top. Flip over to top the burgers and secure with a toothpick if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 62289,&quot;Kringle 1 scant tablespoon or 1 (1/4-ounce) package active dry yeast 1/4 cup warm water (about 110 degrees F) 3/4 cup heavy cream 3 large egg yolks 1 large egg white 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, very cold Apple Pecan Filling, recipe follows 1 large egg white Sliced almonds 2 tablespoons granulated sugar I&#39;m partial to Granny Smith apples because I like their tart flavor and they keep their shape during baking 1 cup light brown sugar, packed 2 cups finely chopped, peeled and cored Granny Smith apples 1 cup finely chopped pecans 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Instructions: For the Topping: For the Dough: In a large measuring cup or medium bowl, sprinkle the yeast in the water to soften. Heat the cream to 100 degrees F and add it to the yeast along with the egg yolks and egg white. Whisk to combine. In a large bowl, combine the sugar, salt, cardamom, and flour. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it is the size of tiny peas. This process also can be done easily in a food processor. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Do not mix too much because you do not want to soften the cold butter. You should see small flour-coated pieces of butter throughout the dough. Overnight rise: Put the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap and a tightly woven towel and refrigerate 12 hours or overnight. Shape: Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Roll each half into a 24-inch square. Fold the dough in half from top to bottom, then fold the dough in half from side to side to make a 12-inch square. Cover with a towel and let rest 10 minutes. Working with 1 square of dough at a time, roll the dough into a 12 by 24-inch rectangle. Spread half of filling evenly over two-thirds of the dough, filling an area of 8 by 24 inches. Fold the portion of dough that has no filling onto the center third of filled dough, then fold the other third of dough to the center, forming a 4 by 24-inch rectangle. Place the dough seam side down on a parchment-lined or well-greased baking sheet. Bring the ends of the dough almost together (about 4 inches apart) to form a horseshoe. Repeat with the second piece of dough. If you cannot get both Kringles on a baking sheet, cover the second one and put it in the refrigerator until the first Kringle finishes baking; then bake. Second Rise: Cover the with a tightly woven towel and let rise for 1 hour. Preheat Oven: About 10 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Final Preparation: For the topping, beat the egg white with a whisk or fork until frothy and brush over the loaves. Sprinkle with sliced almonds and then granulated sugar. Bake and Cool: Bake for 25 minutes until the internal temperature of the bread reached 190 degrees. Immediately remove the bread from the baking sheet and place on a rack to cool. In a medium bowl, stir the sugar, apples, pecans, butter, and cinnamon together until well mixed.

Prepare the chicken: Season the outside of the chicken with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity with the thyme sprigs and lemon wedges. Turn the chicken so the cavity is facing you. Put one end of a bacon slice squarely over the left thigh, run it over the breast meat and finish by covering the right thigh. Repeat with 9 more strips of bacon, slightly overlapping, so the thighs and all of the breast meat are covered. Then wrap one strip, slightly overlapping, around each drumstick. Cook the chicken: Transfer the chicken to a shallow baking pan or rimmed baking sheet fitted with a roasting rack and put it in the center of the oven. Roast for 20 minutes and then lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Cook until the juices run clear or the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for 15 minutes before carving. The bacon should form a hard shell over the breast meat. Take care to use a sharp knife when carving so the bacon stays on top of the white meat. Finish the dish: Make a sauce by pouring the juices from inside the cavity (along with the thyme and lemon wedges) into the baking pan. Put the pan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Whisk in the mustard, add 2 tablespoons water and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes to allow the sauce to come together. Strain, pressing down on the lemon wedges to extract all the juice, and season with salt and pepper. Discard the lemon wedges and thyme sprigs and taste for seasoning.

Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the pan. Add the 1 tablespoon butter, the onion, 3 of the garlic cloves, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to the pan. Saute the onion, stirring often, until it turns coppery brown and sweet, about 15 minutes. Add the tomato paste and ketchup and cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Stir in the paprika, and then add 1/2 cup water, the cherries, vermouth, cider, vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, juniper berries and bay leaves. Simmer until the sauce thickens and bubbles evenly, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly. Discard the bay leaves. Puree the mixture in a food processor, and then push it through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Season with the fish sauce and lime juice, and add more salt if necessary. (You can store the sauce in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 2 weeks, or in the freezer for 6 months.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat two large cast-iron pans over high heat. Pour a coating of oil into each pan, and then wipe it out with a paper towel so that just a thin film remains. Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper. Add the steaks to the hot pans. Cook steadily, reducing the heat to medium-high if they threaten to burn, until the steaks caramelize deeply on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the steaks and cook for 3 minutes. Transfer the pans to the oven and roast the steaks for 3 to 5 minutes more, or until their internal temperature reaches 120 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. (You want to have time to butter baste the steaks before they reach their final temperature.) Transfer the pans to the stovetop, off the heat. Divide the 3 tablespoons butter, the rosemary, and the remaining 4 garlic cloves between each pan. Using a large spoon, baste the steaks with the butter for a few minutes. The steaks are ready when they begin to feel firm when poked or reach 125 degrees F. Transfer the steaks to a platter and let them rest for at least 5 minutes. Serve with the steak sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 62305,&quot;Stuffed Chicken Breasts 4 boneless chicken breast halves 4 ounces soft cheese such as fresh goat&#39;s cheese, or ricotta 1/4 cup chopped herbs (one of a kind or a mix) such as chives, parsley, tarragon, dill, mint or basil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: With a slender knife cut a 3-inch pocket along length of thickest side of chicken (or have a butcher do this for you). In a mixing bowl combine the cheese with chopped herbs of your choice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stuff a quarter of this mixture into each pocket and secure pocket with toothpicks. Season the outside with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick pan and saute the chicken, skin side down for 5 to 6 minutes over moderate heat. Turn over and cook for 5 minutes longer or until chicken is cooked through. Remove toothpicks and serve over the salad. Variation: instead of the cheese and herbs, stuff each chicken breast with about 2 to 4 tablespoons of another mixture which might include one or several ingredients such as slivered roasted peppers, pitted good black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, capers, anchovies, hot chilis, or other cheeses such as Mozzarella or Fontina. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 62306,&quot;Coloradito (Red Oaxacan Mole) 3 slices French bread 1-ounce Mexican chocolate Sea salt to taste 3 cups cooked white rice, seasoned 12 corn tortillas, warm 1 large chicken (about 3 1/2 pounds) cut into serving pieces 1 medium white onion, roughly chopped 1 small head of garlic, scored around the middle 4 fresh marjoram or oregano sprigs 4 fresh thyme sprigs 4 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley Sea salt to taste 12 chiles guajillos or chilcostles 1/2 pound (about 2 small) tomatoes, stewed 4 tablespoons melted lard or safflower oil 1/4 cup sesame seeds 1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano 2 whole cloves 2 whole allspice 1 medium white onion, thickly sliced 9 small garlic cloves, peeled 1 3-inch cinnamon stick, broken into thin strips 1 small ripe plantain, peeled and cut into thick rounds Instructions: Put the chicken into a pan with the onion, garlic, and herbs; cover with water and add salt to taste. Bring to a simmer and continue simmering until the chicken is just tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the stems, if any, from the chiles, slit them open, and remove veins and seeds. Toast the chiles on a hot comale for a few seconds on each side, pressing them down until the inside flesh turns an opaque, tobacco color. Rinse the chiles in cold water, cover with hot water, and set aside to soak for about 15 minutes. Put the tomatoes into a blender jar and blend briefly. Heat 1 tablespoon of the lard and fry the sesame seeds for a few seconds until a deep golden brown. Transfer with a slotted spoon, draining them as much as possible, to the blender jar; add the oregano, cloves and allspice and blend until smooth, adding a little more of the water in which the chiles were soaking if necessary. Add more lard to the pan and heat; add the onion and garlic and fry until translucent. Add the cinnamon pieces and fry until the onions and garlic are lightly browned. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the blender jar. Add the plantain and bread to the pan and fry over low heat until a deep golden color; transfer to the blender jar. Adding more cl water if necessary, blend until you have a smooth puree. Gradually add the soaked chiles with more water as necessary and blend until smooth. When all the chiles have been blended, dip a spoon into the bottom of the blender jar and take out a sample of the sauce to see if the rather tough cl skins have been blended sufficiently. If not, add a little more water, stir well, and then blend for a few seconds more. Heat the remaining lard in a heavy pan or saute pan, add the blended sauce and chocolate, and cook over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking, for about 15 minutes. Add 2 cups of the chicken broth and the chicken pieces, taste for salt, and cook for 15 minutes more. The sauce should be fairly thick and lightly cover the back of a wooden spoon. Serve with white rice and tortillas. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 62307,&quot;Roasted and Pureed Cauliflower 2 heads cauliflower, core removed, cut into florets 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/2 bunch chives, minced for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the cake crumbs and frosting in a large bowl. Work the frosting into the crumbs with your hands until it forms a thick paste and can be easily rolled into balls. Roll into 12 balls and place on the prepared baking sheet using a 1-ounce ice-cream scoop. Freeze until almost solid, 20 to 30 minutes. For the decoration: Melt the black chocolate discs in the top of a double boiler or in the microwave. Put the sanding sugar into a bowl. Remove the cake pop balls from the freezer and insert a lollipop stick or straw into each. Dip a cake ball into the black chocolate and swirl to coat completely, allowing any excess to drip off. Sprinkle generously with sanding sugar. Stand the cake pop, stick up, on the prepared baking sheet. Dip the ends of 8 licorice lengths into the black chocolate and attach to the cake pop to form the spider&#39;s legs. Repeat with the remaining cake balls. Use a toothpick to dab a tiny bit of black chocolate to adhere the candy eyes. Let set completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator until ready to serve. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter, milk, vanilla if using, and salt, and whip on low speed until incorporated. Turn the speed up to high and whip until the buttercream is smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl once or twice. If it&#39;s too wet, add a bit more confectioners&#39; sugar. If it&#39;s too stiff, add a bit more butter. Use immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for 24 hours or in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

Cut off the tips of the plantains, then make a slit along the back of each, cutting through the skin from tip to tip. Remove the plantain skins using your thumb. Lay each plantain on its side and slice off a thin layer on the back (the outer curved area), about 3 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. This will flatten the curved area and help the plantains sit on the cutting board without tipping over. Using a paring knife, make a 1-inch-deep slit along the middle of the front side of each plantain, starting from an inch away from one tip and stopping at an inch away from the other tip. Use your index or pinky finger to carefully widen each slit until you see the little black seeds in the middle of the plantain. Brush the plantains all over with about 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle them with salt. Oil a baking sheet with another tablespoon of oil and add the plantains. Bake the plantains for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake until the plantains are yellowish and soft to the touch and the tips, sides and bottoms are caramelized, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet. Once the plantains cool, they can be easily lifted without breaking. To make the stuffing, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a small pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and tomato and cook until softened slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the corned beef and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is heated through, about 3 minutes. Mix in the curry, thyme, granulated garlic, bouillon powder and cayenne pepper, if using. Let simmer for 2 minutes. Allow to cool until warm. Use a teaspoon to scoop the stuffing into the opening of each plantain.

Stir in the cocoa powder and mix until smooth, forming a paste. Set aside to cool. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the remaining 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) butter, the granulated sugar, brown sugar and cooled chocolate paste and mix until combined, about 3 minutes. Add in the vanilla and eggs and mix well. Slowly incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix well. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface, divide into two disks, wrap in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for about an hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with one disk at a time, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out stocking shapes with the cookie cutter and place the cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Re-roll the scraps to get as many cookies as possible, returning the dough to the refrigerator to chill if necessary. Bake the cookies just until they&#39;re set, 10 to 12 minutes. (Bake one sheet at a time for even cooking and browning.) Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let cool. For the salted caramel: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan , combine the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water over medium-low heat and cook until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat and bring the mixture to a boil without stirring. If necessary, use a wet pastry brush to wash down any crystals on the sides of the pan. Boil until the syrup is a deep amber color, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the syrup from the heat and carefully whisk in the heavy cream (the mixture will bubble). Stir in the butter and salt. Transfer the caramel to a dish and cool completely. Decorate the cookies with the chilled caramel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62317,&quot;Chocolate Strawberry Tart All-purpose flour, for dusting One 14-ounce box refrigerated pie dough (2 sheets) 3/4 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup milk 1/4 cup granulated sugar 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 1 large egg, slightly beaten 1/2 cup strawberry jam Confectioners&#39; sugar, for serving Strawberries, hulled and halved, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Spread with the BBQ sauce and top with the mozzarella. Arrange the chicken strips over the sauce and cheese. Bake on the bottom oven rack until the crust is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board, pile on the slaw, sprinkle over the pickles and jalape?os and drizzle with the remaining dressing. Slice into pieces and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 62322,&quot;Austrian Apricot Dumplings: Marillenknodel 1/2 pound fresh curd cheese, such as topfen, quark, or pot cheese 1 large egg 1 tablespoon sugar Pinch salt 11/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon melted butter 12 whole fresh apricots 12 sugar cubes 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 cup fresh bread crumbs, dried out 1 tablespoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 cup sour cream 1/4 cup light brown sugar 1/2 lemon, juiced Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting, if desired Instructions: Place the cheese in some cheesecloth or several layers of paper towels and let it drain for 5 to 10 minutes, pressing gently, to remove excess moisture. With a mixer, beat the cheese until smooth. Add the egg and continue to beat until incorporated. Sprinkle in the sugar and salt, and then gradually add the flour; continue to mix until a dough begins to form. Add the melted butter and mix just until the dough holds together when patted with your hands, it will look pretty wet. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for several hours or up to overnight, the dough will stiffen as it chills. Using a knife, make a slit down the seam of the apricot and carefully pull out the pit, keeping the fruit in tact. Stick a sugar cube inside the apricot where the pit was and squeeze the apricot back together to close it up tightly. The sugar cube melts inside the apricot when you cook it. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Lightly flour a rolling pin and work surface. Roll the dough out into a thin circle and cut out 12 circles with a 4-inch ring cutter. Place an apricot in the center of the dough and carefully bring the edges together to completely enclose the fruit and form a dumpling; make sure there are not any tears or holes in the dough. Working in batches, gently lower the dumplings into the simmering water; they should not be touching or crowded. Cook for about 10 to 15 minutes; the dumplings will sink to the bottom of the pot and then rise to the surface. Carefully remove the dumplings from the water with a strainer. In a large nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs, sugar, and cinnamon, cook and stir for a couple of minutes until the bread crumbs are toasty and golden. Lay the bread crumbs out on a sheet pan or plate and roll the apricot dumplings in the browned crumbs to coat evenly. In a small bowl, mix the sour cream, brown sugar, and lemon juice together. Serve the apricot dumplings with the sweet-sour cream sauce on the side and a dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62323,&quot;Meatball Frittata with Leeks and Mushrooms 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 leeks (white and light green parts), halved lengthwise, thinly sliced and rinsed<br> Kosher salt<br> 8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme<br> 1 clove garlic, minced 8 large eggs 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons half-and-half 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives Freshly ground pepper 3 ounces goat cheese, at room temperature 8 beef meatballs, halved Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375?.

Divide the pizza dough into 4 balls. Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray and press each ball out into a thin 8-inch round. Put the baking sheet on the preheated stone and parbake until the dough just starts to brown on the bottom and edges, about 10 minutes for a softer crust or about 15 minutes for a crisper crust. Remove and let cool slightly. Meanwhile, roll the turkey sausage into very small balls, about 1 teaspoon per ball (using damp hands helps). Heat the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook until browned on most sides, turning as needed, about 5 minutes. Remove the meatballs and set aside. Add the garlic to the skillet and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, 1/2 cup of water, basil and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, then cook until the sauce begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Return the meatballs to the skillet and continue to simmer until the sauce is very thick, 3 to 5 minutes more. Remove from heat. (The meatball sauce can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days ahead.) Divide the sauce and meatballs among the 4 parbaked pizza crusts. Divide the mozzarella among the pizzas evenly. Bake, one baking sheet at a time, on the preheated stone until the crust is golden brown and the cheese melts, 8 to 10 minutes.

Here is my take on the classic, if only to be used as a helpful reminder to make-ahead a batch especially in the winter months.; Warm 2 cups milk in small pot over lowest heat. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium to medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and cook until lightly brown. Then add the chicken livers, and cook almost through. Add the onions, celery, carrots, garlic, rosemary, and bay leaves, and cook until tender, 10 minutes. Add the ground meat and cook through breaking into pieces, but do not brown. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, clove, and stir in the wine and allow it to cook into the meat, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the warm milk to the meat and allow it to absorb into the meat for 1 minute. Stir in the beef stock, vegetable stock, and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat and simmer over low heat for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Divide the sauce in 1/2, cool, and freeze one batch. Cool and store the remainder for a make-ahead meal within the week. Alternately, cook pasta to al dente, thin the sauce a bit with a bit of starchy pasta water and toss with pasta dressed with butter to combine. Top with grated cheese and chopped celery leaves.

Then, pour half the mixture over 1 side of the flank steak and massage into the meat. Turn the steak over and pour the other half over the meat and massage in. Set aside on the counter up to 2 hours to marinate. You could also marinate the meat overnight in the fridge. For the compote: Heat the olive oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering (not smoking), add the onions, a pinch of salt, and stir to coat with oil. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn a deep caramel color, about 45 minutes. Warm your grill or grill pan over medium heat. When the onions are caramelized, add the dates, vinegar, and water. Stir and cook, covered, for another 15 minutes. Fold a paper towel in 4, pour a little vegetable or canola oil onto it, and wipe down your grill pan. Once the grill pan is nice and hot (oil lightly smoking), throw your rubbed-down meat on. It should sizzle upon contact - if it doesn&#39;t, your pan wasn&#39;t hot enough. This is how you ensure a nice crust on the steak! After 5 minutes on 1 side, flip the steak over, and cook another 4 to 5. Check the temperature; I like my flank steak done medium-rare, so I pull it off as soon as the thermometer register 125 degrees F. Pull onto a chopping board, and tent with foil; allow your meat to rest for 5 minutes. Slice the steak thinly against the grain on the bias; if you don&#39;t, your precious steak won&#39;t be incredibly tender and deeply unsatisfying! Serve with a dollop of onion compote on top. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 62335,&quot;Sweet and Salty Bacon and Nuts 8 ounces (8 to 9 slices), applewood-smoked bacon, cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces 1 large egg white 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/3 cup sugar 1 cup raw almonds (about 5 ounces) 1 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped (about 4 ounces) 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Cook the bacon over medium heat in a large skillet until brown and crisp, 8 to 9 minutes. Remove the bacon using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Pour 1/4 cup of the bacon fat on a heavy rimmed baking sheet and spread evenly. Beat the egg white and salt until just foamy using a whisk in a medium bowl. Gradually add the sugar and beat until just blended. Add the almonds, walnuts and cayenne pepper. Toss until the nuts are coated. Spread the nut mixture in a single layer on the baking sheet.

In a large pan over medium heat, coat pan with oil. Add the pureed veggies and season generously with salt. Bring the pan to a medium-high heat and cook until all the water has evaporated and they become nice and brown, stirring frequently, about 15 to 20 minutes. Be patient, this is where the big flavors develop. Add the ground beef and season again generously with salt. BROWN THE BEEF! Brown food tastes good. Don&#39;t rush this step. Cook another 15 to 20 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook until brown about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the red wine. Cook until the wine has reduced by half, another 4 to 5 minutes. Add water to the pan until the water is about 1 inch above the meat. Toss in the bay leaves and the bundle of thyme and stir to combine everything. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer, stirring occasionally. As the water evaporates you will gradually need to add more, about 2 to 3 cups at a time. Don&#39;t be shy about adding water during the cooking process, you can always cook it out. This is a game of reduce and add more water. This is where big rich flavors develop. If you try to add all the water in the beginning you will have boiled meat sauce rather than a rich, thick meaty sauce. Stir and TASTE frequently. Season with salt, if needed (you probably will). Simmer for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. During the last 30 minutes of cooking, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat to cook the spaghetti. Pasta water should ALWAYS be well salted. Salty as the ocean! TASTE IT! If your pasta water is under seasoned it doesn&#39;t matter how good your sauce is, your complete dish will always taste under seasoned. When the water is at a rolling boil add the spaghetti and cook for 1 minute less than it calls for on the package. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. While the pasta is cooking remove 1/2 of the ragu from the pot and reserve. Drain the pasta and add to the pot with the remaining ragu. Stir or toss the pasta to coat with the sauce. Add some of the reserved sauce, if needed, to make it about an even ratio between pasta and sauce. Add the reserved pasta cooking water and cook the pasta and sauce together over a medium heat until the water has reduced. Turn off the heat and give a big sprinkle of Parmigiano and a generous drizzle of the high quality finishing olive oil. Toss or stir vigorously. Divide the pasta and sauce into serving bowls or 1 big pasta bowl. Top with remaining grated Parmigiano.

Pulse until a dough forms, about 10 seconds. Remove the dough from the food processor to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, 4 to 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball; wrap with plastic and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cut the dough in half and keep one half refrigerated. Cut the remaining half into two equal pieces. (Make sure to keep the unused dough pieces covered.) Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough with a rolling pin as thin as possible (but still thick enough to be lifted off the counter without breaking, about a 10-by-16- inch rectangle; the dough should be paper-thin, but you shouldn\u2019t be able to see through it.) Dust each dough sheet with flour. Fold the dough in half (using the short ends) and dust the top with flour. Repeat twice more, dusting with flour between each layer to create a stack. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into thin strips (1/4-inch wide). Separate the noodles into \u201cnests\u201d and let dry on a lightly floured surface, about 1 hour.

Place a roasting rack on a foil-lined baking sheet in the oven. Using your hands, break the meat into small pieces and combine evenly but loosely on a parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Spread the meat out and season it generously with salt and pepper. If desired, add the spice mix at this time. Divide the meat into 4 portions (about 6 ounces each). Using your hands, form each portion into a ball-shape by gently tossing it from 1 hand to the other. (Don&#39;t over work or press too firmly on the meat.) Gently form each portion into a patty about 3 1/2 inches wide and 1-inch-thick. Preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Raise the heat to high and add the oil. Add the patties and cook, turning once, until well-browned, about 2 minutes each side. Using a spatula, transfer the hamburgers to the roasting rack in the oven and continue cooking to desired doneness, 8 to 9 minutes for medium-rare, 10 to 11 minutes for medium, and 13 to 15 minutes for well-done. If you are using the cheese, top the hamburgers during their last couple of minutes of cooking to melt. Transfer the hamburgers to a plate, let rest for a couple minutes before serving. Meanwhile, toast the hamburger buns. Assemble the hamburgers with the condiments and toppings of your choice. Serve. When cooking on a countertop grill, turn on grill, then place burgers on the heated grill. Timing for a countertop grill: For Medium-Rare: Cook for 3 minutes covered and then unplug the machine and continue to cook covered for 2 to 3 more minutes. For Medium: Cook for 4 minutes covered and then unplug the machine and continue to cook covered for 4 more minutes. For Well: Cook for 5 minutes covered and then unplug the machine and continue to cook covered for 5 more minutes.

Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead until it is soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with the remaining melted butter. Place the dough in the buttered bowl, turning to coat lightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and use a permanent marker to trace a circle the size of the dough onto the plastic, noting the time. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and knead briefly on a floured surface to release excess air; reshape the dough into a ball and return it to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap and tightly cover the entire bowl. Let the dough proof in the refrigerator for 4 hours and up to overnight. For the filling: Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with some of the butter. Whisk the granulated sugar and pumpkin pie spice together in a small bowl. Turn the prepared dough onto a floured work surface and press flat. Then roll into a 10- by 18-inch rectangle, with a long edge facing you. Spread the remaining 1 1/2 sticks of butter evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving about an inch border on the side opposite you. Dollop the pumpkin puree over the butter and spread over to cover the same area as the butter. Evenly scatter the pumpkin spice-sugar mixture over the pumpkin puree. Starting from the long side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight 18-inch-long cylinder. Lightly brush the clean edge of the dough with water, then press it to the cylinder to seal. Slip a long taut piece of string or unflavored dental floss under the roll, about 1 1/2 inches from the end. Lift and cross the string ends over the roll, and then pull the ends tightly in opposite directions to cut a single roll. Repeat, cutting every 1 1/2 inches, to make 12 buns. Place the buns cut-sides-down in the prepared pan, leaving 1 inch of space between them. Cover the baking dish loosely with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place to rise until the buns double in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the buns until golden brown and the tops spring back when pressed lightly, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. For the glaze: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter, milk, vanilla and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Drizzle over the warm buns and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62383,&quot;Lava Flow 1 ounce coconut syrup 2 ounces pineapple juice 1 1/2 ounces rum Splash vanilla ice milk (or ice cream) 1/2 cup ice 1 1/2 ounces strawberry puree Instructions: Blend all ingredients except strawberry puree.

Pulse the biscotti to fine crumbs in a food processor. Drizzle in the butter, add the salt and pulse until the mixture has the texture of wet sand. Press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 8 minutes, until the crust smells toasted and is beginning to brown. Set aside to cool while you make the filling. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese, mascarpone and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula. Add the salt, vanilla and lemon zest; beat on medium speed until combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix again. Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the chocolate chips. Pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust and spread evenly. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the center of the cake still moves just slightly. Allow the cheesecake to cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Run a knife around the edge of the pan before releasing the collar. Top each slice of cheesecake with a spoonful of cherries, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Prosecco, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 62386,&quot;Fish Fajitas 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 onions (1/2 chopped, 1 1/2 thickly sliced) 1 15-ounce can pinto beans, drained and rinsed 1/2 cup spicy tomato salsa Kosher salt 2 bell peppers (1 red, 1 yellow), thickly sliced 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder 1 pound skinless halibut or snapper fillets, cut into 2-inch chunks 1 cup fresh cilantro 8 corn tortillas, warmed Guacamole and lime wedges, for serving Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Add the garlic, paprika and cayenne and cook, stirring, until dark red in color, 2 minutes. Add the flour and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir in the broth and sugar and cook until the sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken to the sauce and bring to a simmer. Cook over medium-low heat until the chicken is tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and vinegar. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve with crusty bread if desired! &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 62390,&quot;Boiled Garlic Chive Dumplings 2 bunches finely chopped garlic chives (regular chives can be substituted) 2 small packs (1 1/3 ounces each) mung bean noodles, soaked soft and cut into 1/2-inch strands 1 cup re-hydrated black mushrooms, de-stemmed and finely diced 2 tablespoons minced ginger 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic 2 tablespoons thin soy sauce 3 tablespoons sesame oil 1/2 tablespoon salt 1 egg 4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups cold water 1/3 cup thin soy sauce 1/3 cup rice wine vinegar 1/3 cup sliced scallions 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon sambal Instructions: In a large bowl thoroughly mix all ingredients - aside from those in the Cold Water Dough and the Spicy Soy Dipping Sauce - together by hand. Cook a tester to check for seasoning. MAKING THE DUMPLINGS: Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling, as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up. COOKING THE DUMPLINGS: Use a large stock pot with plenty of water. Add a small handful of salt, as if you were cooking pasta. Make sure the water is at a rolling boil before adding dumplings. Once the dumplings are dropped, gently stir so that they do not stick together or stick to the bottom. Do not try to boil too many at a time, as it will take too long to cook resulting in soggy dumplings. Overcooking also causes the dumplings to break apart. For the Cold Water Dough: In a stainless steel bowl, mix flour and salt. Slowly add cold water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow dough to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long &#39;noodle&#39;, 1 inch in diameter. Cut 1/2 inch pieces and turn them over so cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter. For the Spicy Soy Dipping Sauce: Combine all and serve in a small bowl. PLATING: Serve dumplings on a large platter lined with lettuce with a bowl of dipping sauce on the side. One family tradition is the serving of the dumpling &#39;broth&#39; at the end of the meal since inevitably some of the dumplings do break and flavor the water. Waste not, want not. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62391,&quot;Flank Steak and Grilled Veggie Pita 2 garlic cloves, smashed and finely chopped 2 teaspoons coriander, toasted and ground Pinch cayenne pepper 1 lime, zested and juiced Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 1 flank steak, trimmed of excess fat 2 red or yellow bell peppers (or one of each) 1 large zucchini or 2 small, 1/2-inch slices on the bias 1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch rounds 2 cups washed baby arugula 1/4 pound shaved Parmigiano Balsamic vinegar 4 whole-wheat pita pockets Instructions: Combine the garlic, coriander, cayenne, lime and pinch of salt with enough olive oil to make a loose paste. Coat the flank steak, cover with plastic wrap and let marinate up to 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat the grill. Grill the peppers on all sides until they are BLACK! Remove them from the grill and place them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap. Let them sit for 15 to 20 minutes, remove the plastic and let the peppers cool. Remove all of the black char, stems and seeds. Cut the peppers into 1/2-inch strips and reserve. Remove the steak from the marinade. Place on preheated grill and cook to desired doneness, about 6 to 7 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Remove from the grill to a cutting board and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. While the steak is grilling, toss the zucchini and onions with olive oil and salt. Grill the zucchini and onions on both sides until they are charred and soft, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove from the grill and reserve. To assemble the sandwich: Slice the flank steak very thin on the bias, make very wide, very thin slices. Cut on a severe angle. In a large bowl, toss the arugula with the Parmigiano and the peppers and dress generously with balsamic, olive oil and salt. Cut 1 edge off the pita and carefully open it. Lay the arugula, Parmigiano and pepper mixture in the pita, followed by the steak and a layer of zucchini and onions. Close the pita and give a little press to secure. Repeat with remaining pitas. Serve right away or wrap in aluminum foil to take with you for lunch. Oh baby...what a pita! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 62392,&quot;Squash and Chickpea Moroccan Stew 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, small dice 4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound butternut squash, large dice 3/4 pound red potatoes, large dice 2 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth 2 cups cooked chickpeas, drained 1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes, with juices Pinch saffron threads, optional 1/2 preserved lemon, finely chopped 1 cup brined green olives (recommend: Cerignola) Steamed couscous, for serving Fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped, for garnish Toasted slivered almonds, for garnish Plain yogurt, for garnish Instructions: Heat butter and olive oil in a 3- to 4-quart Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan with a tight fitting lid over medium heat. When oil shimmers, add onion, garlic, cumin, and cinnamon, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until spices are aromatic and onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add squash and potatoes, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, stir to coat, and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Add broth, chickpeas, tomatoes and their juices, and saffron, if using. Bring mixture to a boil then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until squash is fork tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in preserved lemon and olives. Serve over couscous garnished with cilantro, almonds, and yogurt. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 62393,&quot;Lazy Sunday Pot Roast with Caraway and Green Apples 2 tablespoons oil, or more if needed 1 (4 to 5-pound) boneless cross-rib pot roast or other chuck roast Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste 2 medium onions, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced 1/2 cup cider vinegar (or substitute white vinegar) 3 bay leaves 1 tablespoon caraway seeds 1/4 cup packed brown sugar 1/4 cup chopped fresh marjoram (or 2 tablespoons dried) 2 to 2 1/2 cups beef stock 4 Granny Smith or other tart green apples, quartered, cored and peeled Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. In a 5-inch-deep Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking. Dry the meat with paper towels, sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper, place in the pot, and brown well, about 8 to 10 minutes per side. When the meat is well browned, transfer it to a platter. Pour off fat or add oil to the pot as needed so you have about 2 tablespoons in the pot. Add the onions and saute, stirring, until translucent, 7 to 9 minutes. Add the vinegar and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown stuff from the bottom of the pan. Put the meat back in the pot and add the bay leaves, caraway seeds, brown sugar, marjoram, and enough stock so that the liquid comes halfway up the sides of the meat. Bring just to a simmer and skim any scum off the surface then cover, put in the oven, and cook until the beef is fork-tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. After 2 hours and 15 minutes, add the apples to the pot; after 2 1/2 hours, remove the apples with a slotted spoon, set aside, and begin checking the meat for doneness. To check for doneness, plunge a fork straight down into the meat and try to pull the fork out. If the fork slides out easily, the meat is done; if the meat hangs on to the fork, give it more time. When the meat is done, remove it from the pot, cover it loosely with foil, and let it rest for at least 10 minutes. Skim the fat from the braising liquid and taste the liquid. If it needs more flavor, place the pan on the stove over medium-high heat and simmer to reduce the liquid. For a thicker sauce, reduce it until it coats the back of a spoon. Season with salt and pepper. (You can also strain the liquid and pass it and the cooked onions separately.) Cut the meat into thin slices and serve accompanied by the apples, braising liquid, and onions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 62394,&quot;Pressure-Cooked Potatoes with Smoky Aioli 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more if needed 4 to 6 medium-size red potatoes, scrubbed and quartered<br> 6 cloves garlic Salt and pepper<br> 1/2 cup chicken stock<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 2 tablespoons ketchup<br> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt<br> 4 to 6 dashes hot sauce<br> 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped<br> Instructions: Heat a pressure cooker over high heat; add the olive oil.

Cook at a low simmer, stirring frequently, until the rice is tender, 35 to 40 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar, the egg yolks, vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and the nutmeg. Add this mixture to the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 4 minutes, or until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and let cool. Mix together 1/2 cup cream, the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, and the rum, in a mixing bowl. Using a handheld mixer, beat until soft peaks form. Fold into the cooled rice mixture. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the remaining cinnamon and the bananas. Cook for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and add the liqueur. Place the pan back over the heat and flame the liqueur. Shaking the pan constantly, cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup cream and remove from the heat. Spoon the banana sauce in each of 4 bowls. Spoon the pudding into the bowls and top with a little more banana sauce.

Melt 2 tablespoons shortening in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Meanwhile, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, milk and egg until combined. Slowly incorporate the wet ingredients into the dry, stirring until combined. Melt the remaining 1/4 cup shortening in the microwave and add to the batter, stirring constantly. Pour the batter into the hot skillet, smoothing the surface with a rubber spatula. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the cornbread cool in the skillet, then cut into 1-inch cubes. Spread the cornbread and French bread cubes on 2 baking sheets and let dry at room temperature, uncovered, until totally crisp, about 24 hours. Transfer to a large bowl and toss to mix them up a bit. Make the stuffing: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the celery, carrots and onion and cook until the onion is almost translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and add the rosemary, thyme, sage and turmeric. Gradually ladle the broth mixture into the bowl with the bread, tossing gently. Taste as you go and add salt carefully. If the mixture is not moist enough, add a bit more chicken broth. Stir in the parsley. Transfer the mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

Make a well in the flour and add eggs into it. Mix the eggs into the flour and knead the mixture with your hands until smooth. Add water only as needed to reach desired consistency. Avoid adding more than necessary. Flatten dough slightly and cover with plastic. Chill dough in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.<br> For the Lobster Filling: Drop the lobsters in boiling water for no more than 45 seconds to a minute. Separate the tail, body, and claws. Split the tail and remove the meat. Crack the claws and knuckles open and remove their meat \u2013 setting aside the meat from the larger claw and its knuckles.<br> Smash the shells (including the body) with a cleaver or meat mallet. Covering the shells with a kitchen towel first helps avoid making a mess. Heat the clarified butter in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium/high heat. Add the lobster shells, celery, carrots, and onions. Cook until the mixture caramelizes. This may take up to a half hour. Keep the heat on medium to high. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the brown residue from the bottom of the pot. Add the water (should be enough to cover the contents of the pot. If not add more) and simmer for about 45 minutes.<br> While this lobster stock is cooking, cut 8 ounces butter into small cubes. Place them in a small saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of water. Heat the butter slowly \u2013 whisking it with the water until fully melted. Add the lobster tail meat and the claw and knuckle meat from the smaller claw. Cook the meat in the butter over low heat for a total of about 5 minutes. Check the claw and knuckle meat after about 3 minutes. When cooked, remove the meat from the butter and set aside to cool slightly. Cut the tail and knuckle meat into small cubes. The claw meat will break up in your fingers.<br> Returning to the lobster stock, strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve \u2013 saving the stock and discarding the rest. Pour the stock into a clean saucepot, return to the stove and bring to a boil. Continue at a rolling boil until it has reduced down to about a quart of liquid. Remove half of the liquid and set it aside.<br> Add the white wine and reduce again \u2013 this time down as much as possible. When fully reduced, the bubbles from boiling will be much tighter. There may be as little as a tablespoon of liquid left. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the 1-ounce of butter. Set this wine reduction aside.<br> In a food processor puree the claw and knuckle meat from the larger claw (that you set aside earlier) until it is a smooth paste. Fold the poached lobster meat and about a tablespoon of the wine reduction into the pureed meat. Add a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate filling until ready to use. For the Vanilla Bourbon Sauce: Combine the lobster stock set aside from the filling, the bourbon, vanilla bean, and thyme in a saucepot and bring to a rolling boil. When the mixture has reduced by about half remove the thyme and discard. Remove the vanilla bean and set aside. Continue reducing the liquid until it thickens. Reduce heat to low. Split the vanilla bean and scrape its seeds. Add the seeds to the sauce and discard the pod. Cube up the butter and whisk it, bit by bit, into the sauce to finish it. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.<br> For the Celeriac Puree: Place the diced celeriac in a medium saucepot and pour the cream over it. Cut a disk out of parchment paper just big enough to cover the celeriac (the inner diameter of the pot). Using this to cover the mixture instead of a pot lid will help prevent boil-over. Cook the mixture on low heat for 45 minutes or until celeriac is very tender. Remove paper and strain the mixture \u2013 reserving both the celeriac and the cream. In a food processor puree the celeriac. Add just enough cream to make a smooth puree. Season with salt and pepper.<br> For the Chanterelle Mushroom Ragout: Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the onion. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, for about 15 minutes and then add the fennel. When this mixture has caramelized (may take about 15 minutes) add the chanterelles and the herbs. Add the wine and cook until it reduces by two thirds. Swirl in the butter and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.<br> For the Ravioli: Roll the pasta dough out into sheets using a pasta roller. Brush 1 sheet at a time lightly with egg wash. Spoon small mounds of filling (about 1 teaspoon each) onto 1 side of the dough - about 1-inch apart. Fold the dough over the filling and press it together just around the filling \u2013 working outward. Cut the ravioli with a pasta wheel or with a ring mold. If making a large batch, freeze the ravioli. This will make cooking them much easier. If not, cover and refrigerate until needed. Just before service, cook the ravioli in a large pot of salted boiling water for about 4 minutes.<br> To plate: Pipe 3 small mounds of the celeriac puree in a row in the center of the plate. Gently set 1 ravioli on each mound \u2013 slanted upward. Spoon some of the mushroom ragout around the side of the ravioli and drizzle sauce on the plate. If edible flowers or fresh herb sprigs are available they can be used as a garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Barolo, Pinot Noir, Sancerre]&quot; 62400,&quot;Bacon-Tomato Cheese Toasts 2 ripe tomatoes Kosher salt 8 strips bacon 4 slices Texas toast or other thick sandwich bread 3/4 cup grated cheddar cheese 3/4 cup grated part-skim mozzarella cheese 3/4 cup mayonnaise 5 scallions, finely chopped 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/2 small zucchini, very thinly sliced Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Core the tomatoes and thinly slice. Place in a colander in the sink and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt; let drain for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Pour off and reserve the drippings, leaving 1 tablespoon in the skillet; toast the bread on one side in the drippings until golden (do this in batches, adding more drippings as needed). Place the bread, toasted-side down, on a baking sheet. Combine the cheeses with the mayonnaise, scallions and parsley in a bowl. Spread the cheese mixture on the toasts, reserving about 1/3 cup. Crumble the bacon on top. Shake any excess liquid from the tomatoes; distribute the zucchini and tomatoes among the toasts. Dot with the reserved cheese mixture and season with pepper.

Cut in the butter. Pulse until butter is well distributed and the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add eggs and pulse again until dough clumps together. Gather the dough into a ball. Divide dough and wrap in waxed paper. Chill for 1 hour. Add water and vinegar to a medium pot. Add cherries and cook until cherries are soft. Drain. Heat up grill. Butter a 10-inch round cake pan. Roll dough into a circle and transfer to cake pan. Pinch edges to form a crust, like that of a pan pizza. Fill dough with pastry cream. Spread cherry preserves and cherries. Place pie on pizza on pizza stone on grill. Cook until dough is crispy and brown, about 1 hour. In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the milk and vanilla bean and bring to a boil. Turn off heat immediately and keep warm while you whisk the yolks. In a medium bowl, combine the yolks, sugar, and cornstarch and whisk until thoroughly combined. While whisking, slowly add the warm milk mixture into the yolks and then transfer this back into the saucepan over medium heat. Whisk constantly while you bring the custard to a boil; it should begin to thicken immediately. Whisk until thickened completely, about 3 minutes. Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl and use a rubber spatula to push everything through. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate until completely chilled.

Bring to a simmer and cook until tender all the way through when pierced with a knife, about 20 minutes. Drain. When the potatoes are still hot but you are able to handle them, peel off the skins with a paring knife and press the warm potatoes through a ricer in a flat layer on a working surface. Let cool completely. Once the potatoes are cool, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Drizzle the beaten egg over the potatoes. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the flour and use your hands (or preferably a bench scraper, if you have one) to mix and knead the dough together. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour as needed until the dough holds together and is only slightly sticky. (A good way to tell if the dough is the right texture is to cut the dough ball in half--the interior should look like cookie dough peppered with small holes throughout.) To form the gnocchi, break off a piece of dough and roll into a log about 3/4 inch thick, keeping your hands and counter well floured as you work. Cut crosswise into 3/4-inch segments. Give each piece a quick single roll between your palms to round them slightly. Roll each piece off the back of the floured tines of a fork, pressing with your thumb as you roll down to make a small indentation on one side and ridges from the fork on the other side. Place on a floured baking sheet. Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt generously. Boil the gnocchi until cooked, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and serve tossed in a sauce of your choosing. Garnish with Parmesan and basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 62411,&quot;Whole-Grain Pear Cranberry Walnut Bread 2 ounces unsalted butter at room temperature, plus extra for the pan 1 cup lightly packed dark brown sugar 1/4 cup unbleached sugar 3 large eggs 1/2 cup vegetable oil 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 cups white whole-wheat flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 8 ounces raw cranberries 1 firm ripe pear, cored and grated 3/4 cup chopped walnuts (about 3 ounces) 2 tablespoons sesame seeds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut a piece of aluminium foil about 12 inches long. Put the garlic on 1/2 of the foil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, drizzle in some olive oil, and add 2 sprigs of thyme. Fold the foil enclosing the garlic, making a pouch, and add a couple teaspoons of water. Fold the foil over the garlic to enclose and fold in the edges 2 or 3 times to seal. Put the package in the oven and roast for 30 minutes, or longer, until the garlic is soft. Open the package and let the garlic cool a bit, then squeeze out the cloves into a food processor or blender. Add 1/2 cup olive oil, the lemon juice, parsley, and thyme leaves and puree to make a thick vinaigrette. Preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal grill to medium heat. Rinse the chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Put the pieces in a bowl, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat with the seasonings and then refrigerate while you get everything else together. Put the radicchio in another bowl, drizzle with olive oil, balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss; set aside. When you&#39;re ready to cook, take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel and carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill to make a nonstick surface. Season with salt and pepper and place the radicchio quarters on the preheated grill. Cook the radicchio for about 2 minutes per side until it has a nice char; pull it off the grill, place into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to steam and finish cooking. Then put the chicken on the grill, skin side down, and grill. Grill the chicken for about 20 minutes, turning once, then baste with about half of the vinaigrette and keep cooking until an instant-read thermometer stuck into the thickest part of the thigh reads 160 degrees F and the chicken is nice and caramelised all over, 15 to 20 more minutes. During the last few minutes, throw the lemon halves on the grill, cut sides down, and cook until just marked and smoky. To serve, separate the radicchio into individual leaves in a big bowl. Add the chicken and the rest of the dressing and toss well. Serve with grilled lemon halves, squeeze the lemon over the chicken, and top with reserved dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 62419,&quot;Whipped Ricotta with Raisins and Pine Nuts 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar 1 1/2 teaspoons honey Kosher salt 3 tablespoons golden raisins 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground pepper 1 16-ounce container whole-milk ricotta cheese 1 tablespoon capers, drained 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts Chopped fresh parsley, for topping Toasted baguette slices, for serving Instructions: Whisk 3 tablespoons water, 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon honey and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan.

Oil a large baking sheet. Using a food processor or blender, pulverize the tortilla chips until finely ground, then place them in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the corn oil, chili powder, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper, paprika, and black pepper. Dip the wings into the oil mixture, let excess oil drip off, then dredge them in the tortilla coating. Place coated wings on a large oiled baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, following the method below, until the tortilla coating is browned and uniformly crispy. Method for Baking Wings: Using a paper towel, lightly oil a 9 by 13-inch baking sheet to prevent wings from sticking. Place your prepared wings in a single layer on a prepared baking sheet and bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven until crispy brown, 30 to 40. If you are using a marinade, you can periodically baste wings for the first 15 minutes. If you are applying a barbecue glaze, apply during the last 10 minutes of cooking. For extra-crispy wings, you may place the wings under the broiler to 2 to 3 minutes at the end of cooking. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 62424,&quot;Emeril&#39;s Duck Chow Mein 2 duck breasts 1 tablespoon Hawaiian salt Freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces fresh or dried Chinese egg noodles 3 tablespoons chopped green onions 1 tablespoon minced ginger 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1/2 cup julienned bok choy 1/2 cup julienned carrots 1/2 cup mung bean sprouts 1/2 cup brewed Hawaiian coffee 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon oyster sauce 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts Instructions: Season the duck breasts with Hawaiian salt and pepper.

Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, flipping as needed, until crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and set aside. Pour out all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat. Return the skillet with the bacon fat to medium heat and add the peppers, garlic and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are softened and slightly fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the almonds and continue to cook until the almonds begin to brown, an additional 2 minutes. Set aside on a plate. When the pot of salted water is at a soft boil, drop in the green beans and gently blanch until bright green but still slightly undercooked, 3 to 4 minutes. They will finish cooking in the skillet later. Return the skillet to medium heat and add the butter. With a slotted spoon, transfer the greens beans directly from the boiling water to the hot skillet. Toss and cook for an additional minute. Just before removing them from the skillet, add the remaining lemon juice. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Transfer the green beans to a platter. Drizzle with the sriracha mayo, mound the sauteed veggies in the center and crumble the crispy bacon all around. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 62433,&quot;Neely&#39;s Memphis-Style Catfish 1 cup yellow cornmeal 1 tablespoon paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 3/4 cup buttermilk 1 tablespoon hot sauce 4 catfish fillets (8-ounces each) skins and bones removed, rinsed and patted dry Salt and freshly ground black pepper Peanut oil, for frying Remoulade Sauce, for dipping, recipe follows 1 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup Creole mustard 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon paprika Instructions: Preheat a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F.

Serve with the catfish. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 62434,&quot;Voodoo Crawfish Enchiladas 2 habanero peppers 1 jalapeno pepper 1 poblano pepper 1 serrano pepper 2 red bell peppers 2 red onions 2 red tomatoes 1 pound crawfish tail meat 1 pound shredded jack cheese 2 tablespoons Cajun spice 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon paprika 1 teaspoon ground thyme or oregano Olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1 teaspoon chopped shallots 4 cups heavy cream 1 teaspoon Cajun spice 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, such as Lawry&#39;s 2 cups vegetable oil 10 to 15 white or yellow corn tortillas Instructions: For the filling: Roast the cl peppers, bell peppers, onions and tomatoes on a grill or open flame until charred on the outside. Place in a plastic bag or on a tray and cool in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Pull them out of the refrigerator and reserve 1 red bell pepper, 1 red onion and 1 red tomato for the sauce. Remove the skin and seeds (if desired) from the rest of the peppers while being very careful to not touch your face. Leaving the seeds in will mean your enchiladas are much spicier. For milder enchiladas, leave out the habaneros altogether. Scrape any black char off of your red onion and the outer skin (not good eats). After this is done, you want to mix your peppers, onions, tomatoes and hot peppers and chop them into bite-size pieces. When the vegetables are chopped, add your crawfish tail meat and half your jack cheese and mix well. In separate mixing bowl, add the Cajun spice, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and thyme. This spice mix you have created is a great blackening spice so save any extra you have. Some Cajun spices have more salt then others, so taste your mixture. It should have lots of flavor but have a nice balance of salt. If you find you need a little salt, add some seasoned salt or a season-all; if too salty, add a little more paprika, garlic and onion powder. Once you have your spices mixed together, add half of it to your crawfish mixture and taste. For the sauce: Add a splash of olive oil to a hot pan over medium-high heat, and then add the butter. Immediately add your garlic and shallots; this will cook quickly so have your cream ready to go. Cook for maybe a minute, stirring constantly (don&#39;t burn), and then add your heavy cream. Using a whisk, stir the sauce until it just starts to simmer. Reduce the heat to low and stir every couple of minutes. In a food processor, add the reserved red bell pepper, onion, tomato, Cajun spice, paprika and seasoned salt. Puree into a smooth consistency. Add this mixture to your hot cream and stir well. Turn the heat up to medium and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring often. Do not let the sauce boil over. (Allow the sauce to cool and then chill in the refrigerator if you want to make it ahead of time.) To assemble: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep frying pan to 350 degrees F. Using a pair of metal tongs, drop the tortillas 2 at a time into the hot oil for about 10 seconds. Remove from the oil and place on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the oil. Allow the tortillas to cool, but don&#39;t chill them. While they are still slightly warm, begin spooning in the filling about one-quarter of the way down the tortillas and then roll tight. Using a cake pan or a deep casserole dish, place about 1/2 cup of the cream sauce in the bottom of the pan and spread evenly. Add each enchilada side by side until the pan is filled. Pour enough sauce to completely cover the top. Add the rest of your jack cheese and place in the oven to bake for 30 to 40 minutes. The cheese should be bubbling hot and just starting to brown.
