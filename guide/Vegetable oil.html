water 1-ounce wasabi 6 ounces heavy cream Salt and pepper Seaweed Instructions: Preheat a fryer to 360 degrees F. Begin by mixing the cumin and pepper in a small bowl. Dip and coat each tuna steak in the cumin mixture. In a hot skillet coated with oil, sear each tuna steak for approximately 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and set aside. The tuna should still be pink. In a hot wok or skillet, saute the diced pineapple and red bell pepper for 2 minutes. Remove from wok and set aside. Prepare the tempura batter right before you are ready to fry. The avocados should be peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch thick slices. To make the batter, mix the flour, egg, and cold water together until all of the ingredients have combined. Dip each avocado piece into the batter and fry until golden, approximately 1 minute. Remove the fried avocado pieces and season. To make the wasabi sauce, combine the wasabi paste and heavy cream in a small saucepot. Bring the sauce to a boil and let reduce. Once the sauce has reduced you are ready to serve. To serve this dish, place the avocado tempura in the center of each plate. Top with tuna and surround with the seaweed. Add a spoonful of the pineapple and peppers, and drizzle some of the wasabi sauce around the plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 42467,&quot;Waffled Blueberry French Toast with a Carrot-Ginger Smoothie 2 cups lowfat plain yogurt 2 medium carrots, roughly chopped 5 tablespoons pure maple syrup 1 tablespoon chopped ginger 1 cup blueberries Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup 2-percent milk 1 large egg Large pinch ground cinnamon Kosher salt 4 slices whole wheat bread 2 tablespoons toasted almonds Instructions: Make the smoothies: Combine the yogurt, 1 1/2 cups ice, carrots, 2 tablespoons of the maple syrup and the ginger in a blender and blend until smooth. Divide among four glasses and refrigerate until ready to serve. Make the sauce: Combine the blueberries and the remaining 3 tablespoons of maple syrup in a small microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until the blueberries pop, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Preheat a waffle iron and lightly coat with the nonstick cooking spray. Whisk together the milk, egg, cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a baking dish. Soak a piece of bread, on each side, for a few seconds. Place on the waffle iron, close and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and keep warm on a plate covered in foil, repeat with the remaining bread. Divide the waffles and blueberry sauce evenly among four plates, sprinkle with almonds. Serve with the smoothies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42468,&quot;Caramel Topped Cream Puffs 1 cup water 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 eggs 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/3 cup water Ice cream of your choice, or lightly sweetened whipped cream, flavored with almond extract Instructions: Make the cream puffs: Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the water, butter, salt, and granulated sugar in a large saucepan and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, about 2 minutes to evaporate some of the moisture. Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer). Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, and adding 1 egg at a time, add 3 of the eggs, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add another egg, and mix until completely incorporated. Grease and line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Using the pastry bag, pipe the dough in bite-size \kisses\ (about 1 1/2 inches across) onto a cookie sheets. Dip your finger in flour and push down the points to smooth out any bumps. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 25 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. To make the caramel, pour the 1 1/4 cups sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the sugar, trying not to splash any sugar onto the sides of the pan. Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar to moisten it. Over high heat, bring to a full boil and cook without stirring, swirling the pot occasionally to even out the color, until amber-caramel in color, 10 to 20 minutes. When the mixture is done, remove the pot from the heat, and rest the bottom in the ice bath for 15 seconds to stop the cooking. Dip the top of each cream puff in the caramel and place it caramel-side down, with the base sticking straight up, on the other greased cookie sheet. The caramel will pool slightly around the puff and will harden and develop a foot. (When you turn the puffs over later, this will be a smooth, flat \lid\ for each profiterole.) Let cool until set, at least 10 minutes. When ready to serve, carefully turn the puffs over and cut each one horizontally in half using a long serrated knife. Fill each with a small scoop of ice cream or sweetened flavored whipped cream. Place the lid on top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42469,&quot;Black Beans 1 ounce smoked bacon, diced 1/2 tablespoon pure olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 jalapenos, stemmed, seeded, and minced 1/2 medium red onion, diced 1 large stalk celery, diced 1 carrot, peeled and diced 1/2 tablespoon toasted and freshly ground cumin 1/2 tablespoon toasted and freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste 1 bay leaf, broken in half 1/4 cup Spanish Sherry vinegar 1 cup dried black beans, rinsed, soaked overnight, and drained 2 ham hocks 5 cups chicken stock Kosher salt Instructions: In a medium saucepot over medium heat, cook the bacon in the olive oil until the meat is nearly done. Add the butter. When it foams, add the garlic and jalapenos. Stir and allow them to flavor the fats; but only for about 30 seconds. Quickly add in the onion, celery, and carrot, and turn the heat to medium-high. Stir to coat. Cook, stirring only occasionally, about 10 minutes. When the vegetables are nicely caramelized, add the cumin, black pepper, and bay leaf. Add the vinegar, then the drained beans, ham hocks, and chicken stock and bring to a boil. Skim off any impurities that float to the surface. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the beans, uncovered, until they are soft, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add more stock or water as necessary. Season with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinotage, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 42470,&quot;Barbecued Ribs 6 pounds pork ribs (baby back or spareribs) 1 tablespoon barbecue meat seasoning 1 (16-ounce) bottle barbecue sauce Instructions: If using charcoal, pile the charcoal in a pyramid. Ignite the charcoal with lighter fluid. Once the top portion of the charcoal has turned white, spread the charcoal out evenly using a fireproof tool such as a metal rake or shovel. Spread the coals over half of the bottom of the grill, leaving the other half empty. (If using a gas grill, only ignite one side of the burners.)<br> Evenly spread the meat seasoning over both sides of the ribs. Let stand in the refrigerator unless using right away. Place the ribs over the area where there is no charcoal or the side of the grill that is not hot. Cover and turn every 20 minutes for approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours. For the last 10 minutes of cooking, baste ribs with the barbecue sauce and cover again. Turn the ribs over and baste again. Do this every 2 minutes.<br> While on grill, cut the ribs up individually and baste 1 last time. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 42471,&quot;Pork and Clams 6 medium cloves garlic, peeled 2 teaspoons sea salt 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper 1 tablespoon Spanish paprika 1 cup Portuguese or good olive oil 1 1/2 pounds boned pork loin, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1 cup small diced onions 2 cups dry white wine 100 cockles or small littleneck clams in the shell, scrubbed and purged Sea salt, to taste 1 loaf crusty bread 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: In a small food processor, combine garlic, salt, pepper flakes and paprika. Process until smooth. Add 1/2 cup of the oil and process until smooth. In a glass mixing bowl, toss the meat with the pureed mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator, to marinate at least 8 hours, overnight if possible. In a cataplana (or a large saute pan with a lid), over medium heat, add the remaining 1/2 cup of oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions. Season with salt. Saute for 2 minutes. Add the pork and saute for 4 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a simmer. Add the clams, and season with salt. Cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.

Add the butter and shortening and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Drizzle in 3 tablespoons ice water and pulse until the dough begins to come together (add more water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, if necessary). Turn out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and pat into a disk; wrap tightly and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Roll out the dough into an 11-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edges with your fingers. Pierce the bottom all over with a fork. Refrigerate the crust until firm, about 30 minutes. Place a baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F. Make the filling: Whisk the heavy whipping cream, sugar, flour and vanilla in a bowl. Pour into the chilled crust, dot with the butter and sprinkle the nutmeg on top. Carefully transfer the pie plate to the hot baking sheet and bake 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly in spots, about 55 more minutes (the center will still jiggle slightly); cover the crust edges with foil if they&#39;re browning too quickly.

Line a half sheet pan (18-by-13-inch baking sheet) with parchment paper and spray only the bottom with nonstick cooking spray. Roll the almond paste between two sheets of parchment paper into a 9-by-14-inch rectangle; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the egg whites and salt and whisk just until foamy. Whisk in the cream of tartar. Slowly add 1/2 cup (100 grams) of the granulated sugar and whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form. (Be careful not to overwhip to the point of dryness or clumping.) Transfer the egg whites to a large clean bowl. In the same stand mixer bowl (you needn&#39;t clean it), add the egg yolks, vanilla and the remaining granulated sugar and whisk on high speed until the mixture is pale yellow and forms ribbons when you lift the whisk. Stir one-third of the egg whites into the yolk mixture. Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Sift the cocoa powder over the egg mixture and fold into the batter until just combined. Transfer the mixture to the prepared sheet pan. Using a large offset spatula, spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cake springs back lightly when touched. Sprinkle the confectioners&#39; sugar onto a clean kitchen towel in an even layer. Run a very sharp paring knife along the side of the pan and release the cake. Invert the cake onto the towel and remove the parchment. While the cake is still very warm, place the rectangle of almond paste onto the cake. Using the kitchen towel to help you, roll the cake into a jelly roll and wrap the towel tightly around the cake to keep it in place. Allow to cool completely. For the coffee simple syrup: Put the coffee and granulated sugar in a small saucepan and heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Let cool. To assemble the Charlotte Royale: Line a 10-inch metal mixing bowl with plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap hangs over the side. Cut the jellyroll into rounds 1/3 inch thick. Dip the bottom of each round quickly into the coffee simple syrup and use the rounds to line the bowl. Start at the middle and place them packed tightly together soaked-side down. Use 1/2 cup of the cookie crumbs to coat the inside of the rolls in the bowl, pressing gently with your hands to get in between any gaps in the rolls. Add 1/2 gallon of the softened chocolate ice cream into the center of the cake-lined bowl, packing it in gently and spreading to even and smooth the top. Add 1/2 cup crushed chocolate wafer cookies in an even layer, then top with the remaining 1/2 gallon ice cream, packing it in gently again and using an offset to spread evenly. Finish with an even layer of the remaining 1/2 cup cookie crumbs. Place in the freezer until firm (at least 4 hours or overnight). Trim any overhang from the cake base. Invert onto a serving platter and use the plastic wrap to coax the Charlotte out of the bowl. Remove the plastic wrap. Allow the cake to rest for about 30 minutes in the refrigerator to thaw to a temperature where it can be sliced. Slice and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 42485,&quot;Layered Potatoes from Bahia de Casares 2 1/2 lbs white or red rose potatoes, peeled 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus extra for drizzling 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 large onions, thinly sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram, crumbled 6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only, finely chopped 2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade 1 1/2 cups coarsely grated Swiss cheese (optional) Instructions: In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes with enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat and simmer actively for about 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are just tender. Remove from the heat, drain and, when cool enough to handle, slice the potatoes 1/8inch thick. While the potatoes are cooking, in a large heavy skillet, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and saute, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and remove from the heat. Preheat the oven to 425/. In a small bowl, combine the garlic and herbs and toss together to mix evenly.

Add the meat, greens, reserved liquid, thyme, oregano, basil, and parsley. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Remove the bay leaves. Adjust seasonings with salt, if desired. (If not using meat, the gumbo may need more salt.) Also, if no meat has been added, add 4 tablespoons butter to the pot just before removing from the heat. Serve in deep soup bowls over steamed white rice with file powder passed at the table for guests to thicken the gumbo to their personal taste. Serve with hot sauce, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Pinotage]</p><p>&quot; 42492,&quot;Bananas Foster 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 bananas, halved lengthwise 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 cup dark rum 1 pint vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Squeeze the lemon juice over the bananas.

I drank these as a kid and really found them to be the perfect blend of sweet and bubbly. I come from a house where my father would keep the champagne for New Years in the freezer until we were ready to drink it. There were always little ice chips in it and I have really grown to love ice cold drinks of any kind. This recipe is no different. For me, all of the ingredients have to be very cold for optimum results. Pour the syrup into the bottom of a glass. Add the skim milk and stir to blend slightly. Add the seltzer.; In a small bowl, combine and whisk the cocoa powder, sugar, and salt with the water and vanilla extract. Transfer to a small saucepan and simmer over low heat until the ingredients meld together, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside to cool. Refrigerate. Use as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 42494,&quot;Chicken Soup with Ground Chicken Meatballs 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Bones from 1 whole chicken 2 large carrots, peeled and roughly chopped 2 stalks celery, chopped 2 medium onions, chopped 1 leek, chopped 1 clove garlic, halved 1/2 cup fresh dill 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 sprig fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon peppercorns 24 cups water Salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 1/4 cup milk 1 pound ground chicken, or 4 chicken breasts, cut into small pieces 1 red onion, roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon cl flakes Freshly ground pepper 2 carrots, finely chopped 2 stalks celery, finely chopped 1 leek, finely chopped Vegetable oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 4 cups watercress 4 blackened chicken wings, for garnish (from Blackened Chicken Salad, recipe follows) 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, for garnish 2 tablespoons smoked paprika 1 tablespoon smoked sea salt 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, ground 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, ground 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 chicken drumsticks 4 chicken wings 4 chicken thighs, deboned Vegetable oil 1/2 cup canned tomato soup, undiluted 1/4 cup ketchup 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 1 shallot, minced 1 clove garlic, minced Juice of 1 lemon 1/2 cup vegetable oil Salt and pepper 1 head romaine lettuce 1 red onion, minced 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar Salt and pepper 1/2 cup radishes, julienned 1/4 cup fresh flat parsley, chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil Instructions: For the chicken stock: In a large stockpot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken bones, stir to coat and cook for 5 minutes to brown. Add the vegetables to the stockpot along with the herbs and peppercorns. Stir to mix, add the water and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 4 to 6 hours. The stock will have reduced by half. Strain and skim the fat. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Reserve. For the chicken meatballs: Soak the breadcrumbs in the milk. In a food processor, combine the ground chicken, or chicken breasts if using, the red onion and garlic. Blend for 2 minutes. Add the dill, olive oil, salt, cl flakes and breadcrumb mixture. Spinkle with freshly ground pepper. Using 1 teaspoon of the ground chicken mixture, form small meatballs. Reserve on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator until ready to cook in the soup. For the soup: In a medium stockpot, cook the vegetables in oil for about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add 8 cups stock and the chicken meatballs. Let simmer until the meatballs are cooked, about 15 minutes. When ready to serve, divide the watercress in the bowls and add a ladle of chicken soup. Garnish with the blackened chicken wings and fresh dill. For the blackened chicken: Combine all the spices with the garlic and oil in a bowl. Evenly rub the chicken pieces with the spice mixture. Place in a large re-sealable plastic bag or a bowl covered in plastic wrap. Keep in the refrigerator for 1 hour or up to overnight for a more intense flavor. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a cast-iron skillet heat over high heat, add enough vegetable oil to coat the whole bottom of the pan. The pan will be ready when it starts to gently smoke. First place the chicken drumsticks in the skillet (they take the longest to cook) and blacken all sides, about 5 minutes. Add the rest of the chicken pieces and continue in the same manner for another 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and place the skillet in the oven for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside and keep warm.<br> For the French vinaigrette: Add the tomato soup, ketchup, vinegar, honey, Worcestershire sauce, mustard seeds, shallot, garlic and lemon juice to a blender and puree all the ingredients together. Slowly add the oil until it emulsifies and becomes thick and creamy. Season with salt and pepper and blend again. (Add a little bit of water if the vinaigrette is too thick.) Store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator. The vinaigrette can be made ahead and will be good for up to 1 week. For the salad: In a bowl, mix together the romaine lettuce with the red onions, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the red wine vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the chicken thighs from the skillet, slice lengthwise and toss into the salad. Mix well and set aside. In another bowl, mix together the radishes, herbs and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. To serve: Dress the plates with the romaine and chicken thigh salad mix. Top each plate with a blackened chicken drumstick and garnish with the radish salad. Drizzle with the French vinaigrette and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Chianti]&quot; 42495,&quot;Turkey and Stuffing One 14- to 16-pound turkey, innards removed and reserved , neck reserved for gravy 1/2 stick unsalted butter, melted Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 stalks celery, washed and sliced into 1-inch pieces 2 large onions, peeled, halved, and sliced 1 head garlic 2 sprigs fresh sage, stemmed and coarsely chopped 4 bay leaves 2 teaspoons dried rosemary 7 cups low-sodium chicken stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 cup dry marsala, or sherry 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 stick unsalted butter, divided 1 pound loose pork sausage, broken into small pieces 6 cups 1-inch cubed sourdough bread, crusts and all Instructions: For the turkey: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Transfer the turkey to a roasting pan, fitted with a roasting rack if desired, and soak the cheesecloth in the butter. Season the bird with salt and pepper. Brush any remaining butter on top of the bird and cover the breasts with the cheesecloth to prevent the top skin from burning before it is cooked. Place the celery, onions, garlic, sage, bay, and rosemary in and around the turkey in the roasting pan - these will be used to make the stuffing when everything is roasted. Place the roasting pan in the center of the oven. Cook for about 12 minutes per pound. After about 2 hours of cooking, remove the cheesecloth from the top of the breasts and return the turkey to the oven to cook for 1 more hour. If the tips of the wings start to get too dark, cover with foil to prevent them from burning. For the gravy: Place the neck and the chicken stock in a pot and simmer gently on top of the stove as the turkey finishes cooking. The stock should reduce by about half. Season with salt and pepper. How do you know when the turkey is done? The temperature of the thigh meat (where the meat is thickest and takes the longest time to cook) should register 165 degrees F when tested with a thermometer. When done, remove the bird from the oven, transfer it to a flat surface (or serving platter), and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before removing the vegetables for stuffing and carving the meat. For the stuffing: Heat a large skillet and add half a stick of butter. Add the sausage and cook until brown and crispy. Reserve any grease and set the sausage in a large bowl with the roasted vegetables from the turkey tray. Add the remaining butter to the pan. Add the cubed sourdough bread and cook, stirring, until they toast golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Toss and season with salt and pepper before adding to the bowl with the vegetables. Stir everything together and taste for seasoning, adjusting if necessary. For the gravy: Unless the bottom of the roasting pan is burned, you can make delicious gravy. Place the roasting pan over the burners of the stove, add the mustard and marsala to the pan, and warm it over low heat. Scrape the bottom to get the drippings and tasty bits off of the pan as the marsala reduces. Strain the neck out from the stock and pour about 1/2 cup into a small bowl. Whisk the flour into the bowl, taking care there are no lumps. Reduce the marsala until there is almost no liquid. Add the remaining chicken stock and the flour mixture to the roasting pan. Whisk to blend. Taste for seasoning. Reduce until the mixture thickens. Transfer to a gravy boat. Allow the turkey to rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Serve sliced turkey with stuffing (dressing) on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42496,&quot;Flan Souffle al Miel 4 egg yolks 4 tablespoons cream plus 5/8ths cup cream beaten stiffly 1/2 cup honey 4 egg whites, stiffly beaten 1 crisp green eating apple, finely diced 1 teaspoon orange flower water 8 toasted almonds, roughly chopped Instructions: In the top of a double boiler over a gentle heat place the egg yolks and 4 tablespoons cream and drizzle honey over the top.

Using your fingers, two knives, or a pastry blender, cut in the shortening and butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Working quickly, add only enough water to form a firm dough. Do not overwork pastry. Form dough into a disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 1/2 hours or overnight. In a large skillet, heat the oil until hot but not smoking. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute. Add the ground beef, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cardamom, hot peppers, and thyme and cook until the beef is browned and spices are fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add the scallions, parsley, tomatoes, and stock and simmer for about 25 minutes, until the flavors have come together and almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, remove from the heat and stir in the rum. Set aside to cool before assembling the patties. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out pastry and cut into circles about 6 to 7 inches in diameter. Spoon a scant 1/4 cup of the cooled filling onto the center of one side of each circle, and lightly brush the edges of the circle with a little of the beaten egg yolk mixture. Fold the other half of the pastry over so that the edges meet, and use a fork to crimp the edges together. Lightly brush the top of each patty with a little of the beaten egg yolk mixture. Place the patties on parchment-lined baking sheets and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 42498,&quot;Green Goddess Potato Salad 2 pounds fingerling potatoes, halved Kosher salt 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup sour cream 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/3 cup chopped fresh chives 1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon 2 anchovy fillets 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon capers Juice of 1 lemon Freshly ground pepper 3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped 6 slices bacon, chopped and cooked 4 scallions, thinly sliced 2 stalks celery, sliced Instructions: Put the potatoes in a large pot and add water to cover; season with salt.

Alternatively, you can use eight individual straightsided porcelain ramekins. Coat evenly and generously all the way to the top, making sure to get the corners. Sprinkle in some sugar and toss around to coat the bottom and sides of the mold or molds. Place molds in the refrigerator to chill (if using individual molds, place them on a cookie sheet first.) Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Find a medium metal bowl that completely covers the top of a small saucepan. Place 3 inches of water in the saucepan and bring to the simmer. Turn off the heat. Place cut up butter and chocolate in the bowl and place bowl over pan of hot water. Let sit for 2 minutes then stir. It should be completely melted; if not, remove the bowl, bring the water back to a simmer, turn off the heat and replace the bowl. Stir until smooth. Stir in the Grand Marnier. Set aside to let cool to room temperature. Place egg yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip. Beat egg yolks at medium speed until opaque and lightened in color, about 3 minutes. Add to cooled chocolate mixture. Bring medium pot of water to a boil. Clean mixer bowl and whip well, and dry them. Place egg whites in bowl and whip at high speed 2 minutes, then reduce speed to medium and add the cream of tartar. Whip until soft peaks form then slowly add the granulated sugar down the side of the bowl while continuing to whip until firm peaks form. Take 1/3 of the whites and whisk into chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in remaining whites with a large rubber spatula, trying not to deflate the whites. Fold gently but thoroughly until no white streaks remain. Remove coated molds from the refrigerator. Fill mold or molds with souffle mixture, up to 1/2-inch from rim. Run your thumb around the inside of each mold to form a shallow groove all around. When all molds have been filled transfer to the oven and bake until risen and top is evenly dried, about 10 minutes for individual soufflJs and about 25 minutes for a large. Serve immediately. Classic souffle technique: egg yolks combined with flavoring base, lightened with whipped egg whites and baked until risen. Very important that all equipment used for beating whites be scrupulously clean. Running thumb around mold encourages an even rise. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 42512,&quot;Walnut Loaf 9 slices commercial whole wheat bread (about 8 ounces) 2 cups walnuts (about 8 ounces) 3 large eggs 3 medium onions, diced 1 small green bell pepper, diced 1 small celery rib, minced 1 small bunch parsley, stems discarded and leaves chopped 2/3 cup canned crushed tomatoes or 1 (16-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained very well 1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning 1 teaspoon salt Generous seasoning freshly ground black pepper Mushroom Gravy, recipe follows 1/4 cup unsalted butter 2 cups thinly sliced mushrooms (8 ounces) 1/4 cup unbleached flour 2 1/2 cups vegetable stock, store-bought or homemade 1/4 cup dry red wine 2 tablespoons tamari soy sauce Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Toast the bread slices either in the toaster or on a baking sheet placed under the broiler. Let cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Generously butter a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, then line the bottom with waxed paper and butter the paper. Tear up the toasted bread slices and make crumbs out of them in a food processor. Place in a large bowl. Process the walnuts until finely ground and mix into the bread crumbs. Combine the eggs and onions in the processor and process until fine but not liquefied. Stir into the bread crumbs. Place the green pepper, celery, parsley, tomatoes, and oil in the processor and grind until fine but still with some texture. Stir into the loaf mixture along with the poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix this all very well until evenly moistened. (The mixture may be prepared to this point and refrigerated up to 8 hours in advance.) Scrape it into the prepared loaf pan and smooth over the top. Cover the loaf with foil. Bake 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out dry. Let sit 5 minutes, then run a knife all along the sides of the loaf to help loosen it. Unmold the loaf onto a platter and remove the waxed paper. Let the loaf cool 20 minutes or so before slicing it. It&#39;s best to serve the loaf warm and the gravy hot. Melt the butter in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and saute until brown, about 7 minutes. Stir in the flour; it will become very pasty. Cook this roux for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. It will stick to the bottom of the pan a little bit; that&#39;s okay. Stir in the stock, wine, soy sauce, and pepper, and bring to a boil. Cook the sauce at a lively simmer for 5 minutes, stirring almost constantly and scraping any crusty bits that adhere to the bottom of the pan. Serve in a sauceboat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 42513,&quot;Marzipan Moose Mousse Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pans and cooling rack 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 cup cocoa powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 cup whole milk (almond milk will also work)<br> 1/2 cup vegetable oil<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> 3/4 cup hot coffee<br> 2 cups heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup cocoa powder<br> 1/4 cup powdered sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br> 16 ounces marzipan Powdered sugar, for dusting and decorating About 9 tablespoons raspberry jam<br> Gel food coloring, optional Crushed almonds, for decorating Pearl sugar, sprinkles, optional<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and line four 6-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. In a very very large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, oil and extract. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, then whisk in the coffee. The batter will be very thin. Pour into the cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean. Begin checking for doneness at 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pans, then turn out onto a greased wire rack and let cool completely. (These can be baked up to a week in advance, cooled completely, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, and then frozen. Cake layers can be assembled straight from the freezer; allow to come to room temperature before serving.) For the mousse frosting: Whip the heavy cream to soft peaks, then gradually add the cocoa and powdered sugar. Add the almond extract and continue beating to medium stiff peaks.<br> For the filling and decorating: Level the cake layers, and then place one layer on a plate or cake board. Spread with a thin layer of frosting. Roll out the marzipan, dusting with powered sugar if necessary, to 1/4-inch thick, then cut out a circle that will fit on top of the cake. Place it on top, then spread on about 3 tablespoons jam. Place the second layer of cake on top, then repeat the process twice more. Cover the cake with the frosting. Cut a moose out of the remaining marzipan, then, if desired, knead a bit of gel food coloring into some marzipan and cut out hearts. Stick them on the cake. Surround the bottom of the cake with crushed almonds, then dust the top with powdered sugar, pearl sugar or sprinkles. Store in the fridge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 42514,&quot;Smoked Beef Short Ribs 2 cups packed dark brown sugar 1 cup dark cl powder<br> 1 cup good-quality paprika<br> 1 cup kosher salt<br> 1 cup butcher-grind (coarse) black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons ground cumin<br> 2 tablespoons curry powder<br> 4 plates beef chuck short ribs<br> Barbecue sauce, for serving (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Heat a smoker to 250 degrees F preferably using Texas post oak wood.

In a heated skillet, cook the onions, adding a little water to prevent them from burning. Cook until lightly brown, adding more water, if needed. Add the squash, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook until the squash is tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the mayonnaise, 1 cup of the cheese and 1 cup of the crumbled crackers. Pour the mixture into a 1 1/2-quart baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with remaining 1/4 cup of butter crackers. Bake until the casserole is bubbly around edges, about 25 minutes. Remove the casserole from the oven and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42533,&quot;Brownie Puddle 1 cup coarsely chopped pecans 14 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, broken into squares 1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar 3 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces 1/2 all-purpose flour Pinch of salt 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: All ingredients should be at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Grease bottom of a 9 1/2 -inch tart pan with removable bottom and line with parchment, then lightly spray with non-stick vegetable spray. Place pan on cookie sheet to catch any possible leaks. Place the pecans on a cookie sheet and toast them, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely. In a double boiler over hot water melt the butter and chocolate, stirring 2 or 3 times. Beat the cocoa, then the sugar, beating until it is incorporated. (If you are doing this by hand, use a whisk.) Beat in the eggs and vanilla. When incorporated, beat in the cream cheese until only small bits remain. Add the flour and salt and mix only until the flour is fully moistened. Stir in the nuts; scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. It will fill the pan almost to the top. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the batter has set. A toothpick inserted 1-inch from the side will come out clean. The mixture will puff and rise a little above the sides but sinks on cooling. While the brownie is baking, prepare the puddles. Melt the chocolate in a microwave, using 15 second bursts on high power and stirring several times, or in a double boiler over hot but not simmering water, stirring occasionally. Add the cream and stir gently until the mixture is smooth and dark. If necessary (if the cream was too cold and the mixture not entirely smooth), return it to the heat until totally fluid and uniform in color. As soon as the brownie is removed from the oven, grease the end if a wooden spoon (no larger than 1/2-inch diameter) and insert it into the brownie, at 1-inch intervals, all the way to the bottom, twisting slightly, as you insert and withdraw it, to create 23 to 28 little holes. Using as small spoon to pour or a zipzeal bag with a small piece of the corner cut, fill the holes until slightly rounded (you will need at least 1/2 teaspoon for each). Place the pan on a wire rack and cool completely. The chocolate puddles will sink in as it cools and more ganache can be added, to fill any depressions, as long as the brownie is still warm enough to melt it. (If necessary, you can set the tart under a lamp to heat the ganache puddles and make them smooth.) Unmold by placing the pan on a canister smaller than the opening for the loose bottom and pressing sides firmly down. To remove the parchment, refrigerate the tart or allow it to sit at room temperature until the puddles are firm to the touch. Cover a flat plate with plastic wrap, spray it lightly with non-stick vegetable spray and set it in top of tart. Invert the tart; peel off the parchment, and reinvert it onto a serving plate. To serve, use a thin, sharp knife to cut wedges. Serve accompanied by a scoop of coffee or vanilla ice cream and any leftover ganache reheated as sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 42534,&quot;Low Country Boil Pie 1/2 recipe All-Butter Easy Pie Dough, recipe follows 3 cups organic low-salt chicken broth 1 teaspoon Cajun spice blend<br> Pinch cayenne<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 cup regular (not quick-cooking) grits<br> 1 medium Idaho potato<br> 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar 1 red bell pepper, chopped into fine dice<br> 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped<br> 1 cup fresh corn kernels (from 2 cobs)<br> 1 link cured andouille sausage, diced<br> Salt 4 eggs<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 pound fresh raw medium-sized shrimp, peeled 2 cups (240 grams) all-purpose flour, cold, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon (6 grams) salt<br> 1 tablespoon (11 grams) sugar<br> 1 cup (225 grams) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and chilled in the freezer for 10 minutes<br> 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) ice water<br> 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) lemon juice<br> Instructions: For the crust: Line a 9-inch pie pan with the All-Butter Easy Pie Dough. Dock the dough and refrigerate it for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the crust with parchment, fill it with pie weights or dried beans and bake it for 15 minutes. Remove the pie weights and the parchment and bake the crust for 5 to 10 minutes more, just until the raw-dough sheen goes away. Set the crust aside. For the filling: Bring the chicken broth, Cajun spice, cayenne and butter to a boil in a large saucepan. Stir in the grits and whisk until combined. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the grits thicken, 8 to 10 minutes. Peel the potato; place it in a small saucepan filled with water and boil until it is fork-tender. Cool the potato and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. And the Cheddar, bell pepper, jalapeno, corn, andouille and potato to the grits and stir until combined. Test the seasoning and add salt to taste. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs together with the heavy cream and stir the mixture into the grits. Add the shrimp, stirring gently to distribute them evenly. Pour the mixture into the crust. Bake the pie for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the custard is set. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the flour, salt, sugar and butter until the mixture resembles cornmeal with some pea-size pieces of butter remaining. In a small bowl, stir together the ice water and the lemon juice. Slowly add the liquid to the flour mixture, pulsing, until the dough just comes together. Squeeze a small piece of dough between your thumb and index finger to make sure it holds its shape. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it in half. Gently turn over each piece of dough a few times so that any dry bits are incorporated. Form each piece into a loose disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42535,&quot;Sticky Rice 2 cups sticky rice Instructions: Soak the rice in cold water to cover by 2 inches for 3 hours up to overnight. Drain the rice and transfer to a bamboo steaming basket, or a colander or steaming basket which can be suspended over boiling water. Set aside. Fill a wok or saucepan with water.

Remove the oyster mushrooms from the stem and pull them into bite-size pieces (the smaller ones can be left whole). Add them to a bowl along with some olive oil. Season with salt and crushed red pepper, to taste, and toss to coat. Spread the seasoned mushrooms out on 2 baking sheets in a single layer. Roast the mushrooms in the preheated oven until the mushrooms are sort of \cooked on\ to the bottom of the baking sheet, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let it cool for 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape the mushroom chips off the bottom of the baking sheet with a bench scraper and reserve in a small bowl. MMMMM...mushroom chips! Cut the prosciutto crosswise into 1/2-inch strips. Try to keep them separated. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and put over low heat. Lay the prosciutto strips in the pan, and when they start to shrivel and shrink add more strips to the pan. When the strips get crispy and crinkly give them a douse of red wine vinegar. Stir quickly and turn off the heat. Remove the strips to paper towels until ready to use. These are best when they are cooked the day of use. Separate the leaves of the lettuce, removing any thick ribs. Wash and spin dry, if needed; usually this lettuce is pretty clean and healthy looking. Add the lettuce to a large bowl and toss in the mushrooms chips, sliced pears and blue cheese. Dress with red wine vinegar, olive oil and salt, to taste.

Sprinkle the yeast on top and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. If the yeast does not foam, discard and try again with fresh yeast. Add 3 cups flour and 2 teaspoons salt to the yeast mixture. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed, then increase the speed to medium as the flour starts to incorporate. (Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed.) Mix in the remaining 3 cups flour on low speed, then increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough gathers around the hook and pulls away from the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface; knead until smooth, 5 minutes. Brush a large bowl with melted butter, add the dough and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down the dough, then divide it in half. Divide each half into 6 even pieces with a knife; cover with plastic wrap. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper and coat with cooking spray. Tape a 24-inch-long piece of string to the countertop to use as a guide. Roll out a piece of dough on the countertop with your hands, starting in the middle and working your way out to the ends until you have a 24-inch-long rope. As you roll, occasionally lift the dough by the ends and slap the middle against the counter to stretch it. Lift the ends of the rope to make a U shape, then cross one end over the other twice to make a double twist in the middle. Fold down the ends and attach them to the bottom of the U, forming a pretzel shape. Transfer to one of the prepared baking sheets; repeat with the remaining dough, arranging 4 pretzels on each baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until slightly puffed, about 30 minutes. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 425 degrees F. Fill a wide pot with 10 cups water; add the baking soda and bring to a low simmer, whisking to dissolve. Use scissors to cut the parchment around each pretzel, leaving a 1-inch border. Slide the pretzels (on the parchment) off the baking sheets, then coat the baking sheets with cooking spray. Working in batches, carefully invert each pretzel into the water and use tongs to peel off the parchment. Simmer until the pretzels plump, about 45 seconds per side. Remove with a slotted spoon, letting the excess water drip off; arrange on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt. Bake the pretzels until golden brown, rotating the baking sheets halfway through, 12 to 15 minutes. Brush with melted butter and serve with mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 42568,&quot;Preserved Lemon Potato Salad 4 russet potatoes (about 2 pounds), peeled Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup parsley, leaves and tender stems, chopped<br> 1/2 cup dill, chopped<br> 1/3 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped<br> 4 scallions, chopped<br> 1/2 red onion, chopped<br> 3/4 cup pitted kalamata olives, sliced<br> 1 preserved lemon (see Cook\u2019s Note)<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon honey<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons juice from preserved lemons<br> Instructions: Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water by about 1 inch.

Watch carefully as the butter can burn quickly. The butter should have a nutty aroma. In a blender, combine the passion fruit juice, orange juice, shallots, ginger, mustard, and sugar and blend until pureed. While the machine is running, slowly add the browned butter to make an emulsion. Be careful, as the mixture may foam up when the hot butter is added. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. The vinaigrette should be served slightly warm. Divide the rice into the 4 lightly greased metal ring molds. Press the rice firmly into the molds to form cakes. Sprinkle the bottom of the cakes with the ground nori and the toasted sesame seeds. Prepare a skillet coated with the canola oil over medium heat. With the rice still in the mold, place the mold in the skillet. Sear the rice cakes on the bottom until they are brown and very crispy. Set the cakes aside without removing the ring molds. In a non-reactive bowl, combine the salmon, tomatoes, scallions, lime juice, hot pepper sauce, and canola oil. Season to taste with the sea salt and pepper. The salmon should be well seasoned, and be prepared no longer than 15 minutes before serving. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mirin, sesame oil, and canola oil. Season with salt and pepper. Just before serving, drizzle some of the vinaigrette over the mache and toss gently. Fill a small heavy pot one-third full with the oil and heat to 300 degrees. Add the taro root to the oil and fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove the taro with a large-mesh spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with the salt, to taste, while hot. PLATING: Spoon equal amounts of the salmon mixture onto each rice cake. Place each mold in the center of a serving plate and gently remove the ring mold. Drizzle the warm vinaigrette around each rice cake and sprinkle with ground nori and toasted sesame seeds. Garnish the top of the salmon with the dressed mache and the crispy taro strings. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42574,&quot;Fresh Salmon Croquettes 2 pounds salmon fillets, skinned and cut into 2-inch pieces 1 cup fine dry bread crumbs 1/2 cup heavy (or whipping) cream 1/4 cup finely chopped shallots 1 clove garlic, minced 2 tablespoons mixed chopped fresh herbs, such as flat-leaf parsley, dill, and chervil leaves 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce Coarse (kosher) salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste All-purpose flour, for coating 1/2 cup canola or other vegetable oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: Put the salmon through the medium blade of a meat grinder into a large bowl. Lacking a meat grinder, chop the salmon by hand or place it in a food processor and pulse briefly until chopped medium fine, then transfer it to a bowl. Be careful not to chop the fish too fine or the croquettes will be dry. To the salmon add the bread crumbs, cream, shallots, garlic, herbs, mustard, eggs, lemon juice, Tabasco, salt, and pepper. Using your hands or a wooden spoon, mix thoroughly. Form the mixture into six burgerlike patties, each about 3/4 inch thick. Spread about 1/2 cup flour on a plate and dip the patties, one at a time, in it to coat on both sides, shaking off any excess. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat; it should be hot enough so a sprinkle of flour sizzles on contact. Add the butter to the hot oil and, as soon as it has melted, add the salmon croquettes and fry until cooked through and golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the croquettes to paper towels to drain, then serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42575,&quot;Crouton Crushed Chicken Tenders with Orange Barbeque Sauce 1 (6-ounce) bag garlic and butter croutons 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 egg 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/3 cup plain bread crumbs 1 1/2 pounds chicken tenders 1/3 cup barbeque sauce 2 tablespoons orange marmalade 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon hot sauce Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut the corner off of the bag croutons just enough to let the air escape. Place the bag onto a cutting board, cover with a kitchen towel and smash it with a rolling pin. Crush the croutons until coarse in texture. Set up a breading station with 3 pie plates or baking dishes. In 1 dish add the flour, and season it with poultry seasoning, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. In the second dish mix together the egg and buttermilk. In the third dish add the crushed croutons, and the bread crumbs. Dip chicken tenders into the flour and shake of any excess. Then dip them into the buttermilk, and then into the bread crumb mixture making sure to thoroughly coat the tenders. Put the tenders on a baking sheet and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve with the orange barbeque sauce.

Line an 8 by-8-inch square baking pan with foil so it hangs over the edges by about 1 inch. For the crust: Lightly butter the foil with some of the melted butter. Stir the rest of the butter together with the crumbs, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Press the crumb mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the brownie. Put the butter and chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt in the microwave on 75 percent power for 2 minutes. Stir, and microwave again until completely melted, about 2 minutes more. Alternatively, put the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 1 inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl on the pan without touching the water. Stir occasionally until melted. Stir the light brown and white sugars, vanilla and salt into the melted chocolate. Add the eggs and beat vigorously to make a thick and glossy batter. Add the flour and stir until just incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the top is crispy and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out mostly clean, with a few crumbs, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully position a rack about 6 inches from the broiler and preheat on low. Layer marshmallows across the top and toast under the broiler until golden, (keep an eye on it, it can go quick), about 2 minutes. Cool on a rack, gently removing the brownies from the pan using the aluminum flaps. Carefully separate any marshmallow from the foil and fold away. Cut into 12 (2-inch) squares. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42577,&quot;Slow Cooker Chocolate Candy 2 pounds salted dry-roasted peanuts 4 ounces German&#39;s sweet chocolate (about 4 squares) One 12-ounce package semisweet chocolate chips (about 2 cups) 2 1/2 pounds white almond bark Instructions: Put the peanuts in the bottom of a 4-quart slow cooker.

Peel the sweet potatoes and slice very thinly into rounds (or use a mandoline). Brush the cups of a 12-cup muffin tin with some of the melted butter. Stack 5 to 6 slices sweet potato in the bottom of each muffin cup. Combine the melted butter, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg in a small bowl. Spoon a teaspoon of the butter/brown sugar mixture over each of the small stacks of potatoes. Fill the muffin tin with the remaining sweet potatoes. Top each stack with the remaining brown sugar and butter mixture, then bake for 40 minutes. Remove the muffin tin from the oven and top each muffin cup with a tablespoon of the marshmallow creme and a sprinkle of the pecans. Return to the oven and bake until the marshmallow creme is heated through and starts to melt down the stacks, an additional 5 minutes. Leave the sweet potato stacks in the muffin tin for 10 minutes while they set and cool slightly. Carefully use a spoon to lift out each stack and transfer to a serving dish. Spoon any additional caramel sauce from the muffin tin over the stacks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42579,&quot;Saucy Moroccan Chicken and Lemon with Date Couscous 1 lemon, cut into 1/4-inch thick rounds (ends and seeds discarded) 2 teaspoons sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 cups couscous 1/4 cup chopped pitted dates or golden raisins 1/2 cup loosely packed chopped fresh cilantro 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 8 small boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 2 pounds total) 3 tablespoons tomato paste One 15-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained Instructions: Sprinkle both sides of the lemon slices with the sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper.

When butter is hot stir in onions and saute until caramelized. Pour browned onions into a sieve over a bowl and let drain. Pour the fat from the onions back into the casserole and when the fat is hot add beef, and remove as slices become brown. Drain in the sieve with the onions. In the same casserole, stir in the brown sugar and add the flour. When a roux has formed, stir in mustard and add beer slowly to deglaze the pan. Add beef stock and season with salt and pepper. Pour liquid into a bowl. Layer the casserole with the meat and onions, making 3 layers of meat, sandwiching 2 layers of onions. Add a bay leaf and a teaspoon of mixed herbs on each layer of onions. Pour beef sauce back into the casserole. Add more beer to cover the meat if necessary. Bring casserole to a boil, cover and bake in a 300 degree oven for 3 hours. Skim off fat, season with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 42591,&quot;Blueberry Crumble 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, softened 2 pints blueberries, or any other berry 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1/2 cup apple cider or orange juice 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes 1/2 cup toasted oats 1/2 cup chopped, toasted almonds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly butter an 8-inch square baking dish. For the filling: In a bowl, add the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, cider, and vanilla, Carefully mix the ingredients together with a spatula, leaving the blueberries whole. Set aside while you assemble the topping. For the topping: In the bowl of a mixer, add the flour, sugars, and butter. Using the paddle attachment, incorporate the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture looks mealy or crumbly. (This can be done by hand.) Stir in the oats and nuts. Pour the filling into an 8-inch square baking dish and evenly distribute the topping over the fruit. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling. Cool slightly and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 42592,&quot;Granny&#39;s Old Fashioned Pudding Cake Vigilante 1 box vanilla cake mix 1 small box vanilla pudding mix 1 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup vegetable oil 3 eggs Zest of 1 lemon Juice of 1/2 lemon Juice of 1/2 lime 2 cups powdered sugar 1 stick unsalted butter 1/4 cup buttermilk Zest of 1 lemon Zest of 1 lime Juice of 1/2 lemon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water; stir to dissolve and let stand for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt and baking soda. Add the yeast mixture and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to blend. If the dough is sticky, add sprinkles of flour until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough until it is soft and has an elastic consistency, about 5 minutes. Add sprinkles of flour to control the stickiness. If using a mixer or a food processor, the dough will form a soft ball around the revolving dough hook and clean the sides of the bowl. Add flour, if necessary, to firm up the dough. Drop the dough into a buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 1 hour and up to 18 hours (the longer the better.) Arrange the rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. With a heavy rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle about 18 by 6 inches and no thicker than 1/8-inch. Fold the dough from the short ends, brushing off the excess flour, to make 3 layers for extra flaky crackers. Roll again using the rolling pin. Prick the dough with the tines of a fork to help cook evenly. Evenly cut the dough along the edge of a ruler or yardstick with a pizza or cookie cutter into desired shapes. Place the crackers close together on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt from 12-inches above the crackers to distribute evenly. Bake until lightly browned and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the crackers. Check the crackers several times during the baking period to make certain those on the outer edge of the baking sheet are not getting too brown. If so, switch the ones on the outside with the ones in the middle. Remove from the oven and brush the crackers with melted butter. Let cool on a metal rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42594,&quot;Caribbean Stuffed Red Snapper 1 (3 to 4 pound) whole red snapper, scaled and gutted 1 lime, quartered Salt, for rubbing the fish 2 cups bread crumbs 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted 4 tablespoons chopped chives 4 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 small onion, chopped 5 cloves garlic, minced 1 small lime, zested and juiced 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon white pepper 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon dried sage 1 teaspoon dried sweet marjoram Instructions: Wash the fish and rub inside and out with the quartered lime and salt. Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Wipe off the lime juice and salt. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F or prepare the barbeque grill. Combine all the stuffing ingredients and fill the cavity of the snapper. Bake or grill the fish until the flesh is opaque, allowing about 10 minutes per pound. Do not overcook. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 42595,&quot;Death By Chocolate: Chocolate Ganache 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 22 ounces semisweet chocolate, broken into 1/2-ounce pieces Instructions: Prepare the ganache, heat 1 1/2 cups heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of butter in a 2 1/2 quart saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil. Place 22 ounces of semisweet chocolate in a stainless-steel bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Keep at room temperature until needed. &quot;,&quot;[Port, Tawny Port, Ruby Port, Moscato]&quot; 42596,&quot;Doughnuts 1/2 cup whole milk 1/3 cup plus 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar, divided 1 vanilla bean, split, seeds scraped out (seeds and pod reserved) 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast 2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (freshly grated if possible) 1 large egg, at room temperature 3 tablespoons water 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted Good-quality oil for frying Cinnamon sugar (made with 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon) Instructions: Heat the milk to 110 degrees F. Place in a cup and stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons of the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds and pod. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let sit for 10 minutes. The yeast will begin to bubble. Remove the bean pod, rinse, and set aside for another use.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, the remaining 1/3 cup sugar, the salt and the nutmeg. On low speed, stir just to mix. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients on low speed, then add the egg, water and the melted butter.<br> Change to a dough hook and mix on medium-high speed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, 15 to 18 minutes. Put the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (this is the first proof).<br> On a floured work surface, roll the dough out into a rectangle 1/4 inch thick. Transfer to a sheet pan and refrigerate for 30 minutes to rest the dough.<br> Cut out thirty 4-by-4-inch squares of parchment paper. Lightly oil each one or spray with pan spray. Have several baking sheets ready.<br> Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a work surface. Cut out doughnuts with a round cutter (or cut squares for a different look. If you&#39;re going for the traditional doughnut shape, use a smaller cutter to make a hole in the center of each round. (Do not cut out holes if you are going to fill the doughnuts. You may decide to cut the doughnuts really large; that&#39;s also fine.)<br> Once each doughnut is cut, set it on an oiled square of parchment. (Trust me, this will make your doughnut experience much better and more efficient.) Place the doughnuts on baking sheets. Cover the sheets lightly with an oiled piece of parchment. Allow to proof about 45 minutes in a warm, draft-free area. They are ready when they are almost doubled in size.<br> Heat 3 to 4 inches of oil in a straight-sided heavy saucepan. (I like rice bran oil or grapeseed oil, but vegetable oil or canola are also good.)<br> Clip a deep-fat thermometer to the side of the pan and heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Place the cinnamon sugar in a bowl to dredge the warm doughnuts.<br> Lift a doughnut on the square of paper and place it just over the oil; this will allow the doughnut to slip right into the oil without deforming. Use tongs to nudge it off the paper and into the oil if necessary; if you must, the paper and doughnut can even go into the oil together and you can immediately fish the paper out with the tongs. You can fry 2 or more doughnuts at a time, just don&#39;t over crowd the pan. I like flipping the doughnuts quickly and often to help them keep their shape. I use two chopsticks, placing them on the edge of the doughnut and using a quick motion to flip them. It will take about 1 minute on each side until they&#39;re golden brown. (Keep an eye on the heat, especially if frying several doughnuts at once.) When browned, carefully lift the doughnuts out of the oil, drain briefly, and toss in the cinnamon sugar. Place on a rack to cool. Repeat until all the doughnuts are cooked.<br> These are best eaten within a few hours of frying. They can be reheated in a low-temperature oven to give them that just-fried texture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42597,&quot;Sancocho 1 yellow onion, roughly chopped 1 green bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped 1 Italian frying pepper, seeded and roughly chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves and stems, plus cilantro leaves, for garnish 2 pounds oxtails, excess fat trimmed (substitute with chuck or short ribs) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon adobo all-purpose seasoning 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 2 bay leaves 8 ounces tomato sauce 1/2 cup red wine 1 gallon chicken stock, plus more if needed 1/2 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into large dice 1/2 pound yucca root, peeled and woody center removed, then cut into large dice 1 green plantain, peeled and sliced on the diagonal in 1-inch-thick slices 1/2 pound calabaza pumpkin (Caribbean pumpkin), peeled and cut into large dice (substitute with kabocha squash, butternut squash, sweet potatoes or carrots) 1 ear of corn, sliced in 1-inch rounds Cooked rice, for serving, optional Instructions: To make the recaito, process the onion, bell pepper, frying pepper, garlic and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a blender until it resembles a very chunky sauce. Add the cilantro and blend until the sauce is combined and has a slightly chunky consistency, about 30 seconds. Set aside 1/2 cup of the recaito you\u2019ve just made and freeze the rest for future preparations. Add the remaining olive oil to a very large, heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium-high heat. Dry the oxtails and add salt and pepper. Brown the oxtails in batches, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove and set aside on a plate or platter. Remove excess fat from the pot you browned the oxtails in, leaving about 2 tablespoons in the pot. Add the reserved 1/2 cup recaito and saute until fragrant. Add the adobo, oregano and bay leaves, then stir in the tomato sauce and saute for 1 minute. Add the red wine and chicken stock and bring to a boil. Taste the broth and add salt and pepper to taste, remembering that as the broth reduces it will become saltier; don\u2019t go overboard. Add the oxtails back to the pot. Lower the heat and cover the pot, leaving the lid slightly cracked. Simmer until the meat is beginning to become tender and fall apart, about 2 hours. Skim the fat off the top of the stew. Add the potatoes, yucca, plantains, pumpkin and corn. Top with more chicken stock, if necessary, to cover all the vegetables. Put the lid back on and simmer until the root vegetables are tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Taste the broth, season with salt and pepper and garnish with cilantro leaves. Serve with a side of rice if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 42598,&quot;Mashed Potatoes 5 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed Kosher salt 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 small yellow onion, minced 2 cups whole milk Freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Add the potatoes to a large pot of cold water.

Add the onions, garlic, jalapenos, and tomatoes; cook, stirring for 15 minutes until the vegetables are cooked down and pulpy. Pour in the stock, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1-inch of canola oil in a skillet over medium-high flame. When the oil begins to smoke, add the tortilla strips in batches and fry until they are crisp on all sides. Remove to a paper towel-lined platter and sprinkle with salt while they are still hot. Ladle the hot soup into 4 soup bowls and put a pile of shredded chicken on top of each. Top with the diced avocado and fried tortilla strips (and cheese if using). Garnish with cilantro and serve with lime wedges. Place the chicken and vegetables in a large stockpot over medium heat. Pour in only enough cold water to cover (about 3 quarts); too much will make the broth taste weak. Toss in the thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns, and allow it to slowly come to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, partially covered, until the chicken is done. As it cooks, skim any impurities that rise to the surface; add a little more water if necessary to keep the chicken covered while simmering. Carefully remove the chicken to a cutting board. When its cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones; hand-shred the meat into a storage container. Carefully strain the stock through a fine sieve into another pot to remove the vegetable solids. Use the stock immediately or if you plan on storing it, place the pot in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool down the stock. Cover and refrigerate for up to one week or freeze.

Butter a 12-cup Bundt pan and flour the buttered surface, shaking out the excess. Stir cake flour and baking powder together well to combine in a small bowl. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter until soft and light. Use a hand mixer set at medium speed or a heavy-duty mixer fitter with the paddle, if you have one. Gradually beat in the sugar and salt and continue beating about 5 minutes until very light. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, continuing to beat until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. Sift half the cake flour mixture over the butter mixture, then stir it in. Stir in the milk thoroughly, scraping the side of the bowl, then sift over and stir in remaining cake flour mixture. Beat the batter for a few seconds to ensure that everything is thoroughly incorporated. Divide the batter in half and stir the molasses and spices thoroughly into one half. Spoon alternating tablespoons of the two batters into the prepared pan. Use the point of a table knife to run a zig-zag through the batters to marble them. Bake the cake for about 45 to 50 minutes, or until it is well risen and a skewer inserted in the center of the cake emerges clean. Cool in pan on rack for 5 minutes, then invert to a rack to cool.

Always use an insulated or doubled cookie sheet in the bottom level of the oven to prevent cookies from burning. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 42608,&quot;Brisket 3 tablespoons smoked salt (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon celery salt 1 teaspoon garlic salt 1 teaspoon onion powder One 6-ounce can tomato paste 3 pounds beef brisket, trimmed 2 large onions, sliced 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the smoked salt, celery salt, garlic salt and onion powder. If using liquid smoke (see Cook&#39;s Note), mix it together with the tomato paste. Rub the tomato paste over the brisket so every side is covered. Then sprinkle the brisket with 1 tablespoon of the salt mixture. Reserve the remaining mixture for future use. Wrap the brisket in foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to overnight. Remove the brisket from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a large roasting pan or baking dish, toss the onions with the oil to coat. Unwrap the brisket and place it on top of the onions. Cover the entire pan with foil and roast until tender, 3 hours to 3 hours 30 minutes. Using tongs, carefully remove the brisket from the pan and place it on a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes. Thinly slice with a carving knife. Pour the juices and onions over the slices. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 42609,&quot;Christmas Cake Cookies 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) salted butter, softened 1/4 cup shortening, softened 2 large eggs<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Seeds from 1/2 vanilla bean<br> 3/4 cup sour cream<br> 8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, softened 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups powdered sugar<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> 2 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream<br> 18 drops green gel paste<br> 72 cinnamon imperials, for topping Instructions: For the cookie: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream together the granulated sugar, butter and shortening. Add the eggs 1 at a time, mixing well between additions. Add the vanilla extract and vanilla seeds and mix well. Add the sour cream and mix until just combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on low until just mixed through; the dough will be sticky. Shape into a rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking mats. Roll out the dough on a generously floured piece of parchment to about 1/4 inch thick and cut into 2 1/2-inch rounds. Place the rounds on the prepared baking sheets. If the dough becomes too sticky and hard to work with, move it to the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes to firm up, then continue rolling and cutting. Bake until the cookies are puffed and cooked through but have not taken on any color, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the cookies to a wire rack to cool. For the frosting: When ready to decorate, make the frosting. In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and vanilla extract until smooth. Slowly add the powdered sugar and salt and beat on medium until smooth and fluffy. Add the heavy cream 1 tablespoon at a time until the frosting is fairly thick. Add the gel paste and stir to evenly combine. Use a butter knife to spread the frosting on the cookies, then decorate with 3 cinnamon imperials in the center of each cookie. Leave overnight to set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 42610,&quot;Sweet-Tea Fried Chicken 8 chicken leg quarters, cut into thighs and drumsticks 1 quart brewed tea, double strength 1 lemon, quartered 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup kosher salt 1 quart ice water 3 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups corn flour (or fish fry) 2 tablespoons crab boil seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon pepper 8 eggs 1 cup buttermilk Peanut oil Instructions: Combine tea, lemon, sugar and kosher salt, and simmer for 5 minutes or salt and sugar are complete dissolved.

Spray a 9 1/2-by-3 1/2-inch bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray and dust with flour. In a large bowl, combine 2 of the cake mixes and mix according to the package instructions. Pour into the prepared bundt pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 55 minutes to 1 hour and 5 minutes. Let cool in the pan until warm, then remove and transfer to a cooling rack. Spray and flour the pan again and repeat the process with the remaining cake mix. The smaller cake should bake for 40 to 45 minutes. For the decorations: Mix the pudding according to the package instructions, adding the neon green food coloring. Hold in the refrigerator. Slice about a 1 1/2-inch-thick slice off the flat end of the large bundt cake and set aside; this will become the top lip of the cauldron. Place the large bundt cake cut-side up onto a large platter or cutting board. Slice a little off the flat end of the smaller bundt cake to make a level surface. Reserve the scrap pieces. Place the small bundt cake cut-side down on top of the large bundt cake. Slice a little off the rounded top of the smaller bundt to make a level surface and reserve the scraps. Fill the center hole of the stacked bundt cakes with the reserved scrap cake pieces. Fill a piping bag fitted with a medium round tip with some of the chocolate frosting. Pipe some of the frosting onto the top of the stacked bundt cakes. Carefully place the 1 1/2-inch-thick piece of cake cut-side up onto the frosting to form the lip of the cauldron. Starting about an inch from the edge, scoop out about a 1/2-inch-deep well from the top layer. This is where the pudding will go. Pipe frosting around the entire outside of the cake and on the lip. Smooth out the frosting with an offset spatula. Carefully press the wafer cookie crumbs into the frosting. Brush off the excess crumbs that fall onto the platter. Cut about half of the candy bars into varying lengths. Arrange the whole candy bars and pieces around the bottom of the cauldron cake to resemble logs. Arrange the red hard candy in between the logs to resemble hot coals. Insert 2 skewer pieces in the cut sides of 2 of the donut halves. Press the skewers and donut halves into the side of the cauldron, just below the lip, to form handles. Carefully spread the pudding inside the well on top of the cake. Arrange the gumballs and nonpareils in the pudding to resemble bubbles. Press the gummy eyeballs into the surface of the pudding so they are partially covered. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 42614,&quot;Bife de Chorizo 24 ounces beef Salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Season the steak with salt and pepper to your liking.

Alternatively, you can use a bamboo steamer or a large saucepan fitted with a steamer basket. Bring the brown slab sugar and 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons of cold water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally as the slab sugar tends to stick to the bottom of the pot, and cook until the sugar melts. Turn off the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set aside to cool until no longer steaming, about 6 minutes. Mix both kinds of rice flours together in a large bowl and set aside. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Line the bottom of the pan with a parchment circle and lightly grease the parchment with more vegetable oil. Set aside. Gradually add the sugar syrup to the rice flours in three additions, stirring with a rubber spatula until there are only a few small lumps of flour. The mixture will be stiff at the beginning but will loosen after stirring for about 1 minute. Strain the batter through a fine-mesh sieve set over another large bowl. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and cover with aluminum foil. Place the pan over the steamer and steam over medium heat until the cake is light brown and almost translucent, about 2 hours; refill the steamer after every 10 to 15 minutes as the water evaporates. The classic way to check for doneness is by taking a small piece from the center of the cake with a chopstick (or a butter knife) and then placing a dried red date on top of the hole to hide it and provide a kind of decoration. Remove the pan from the steamer and set aside until cool enough to handle. Flip the nian gao onto a large plate, peel off the parchment and invert onto a serving plate. To serve right away, cut the cake into 1/2-inch-thick wedges using a greased knife. Enjoy the bouncy texture. For pan-fried nian gao, allow the cake to cool completely and, without slicing, cover the cake with foil. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight. Slice into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Pan-fry in a lightly greased nonstick skillet over medium heat, flipping halfway through, until browned in spots, about 10 minutes. Enjoy while hot for the perfect chewy texture and serve with condensed milk if desired as a dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42626,&quot;Fried Shrimp Baskets 4 tablespoons paprika 3 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons dried basil<br> 2 tablespoons garlic powder<br> 2 tablespoons onion powder<br> 2 tablespoons dried oregano<br> 2 tablespoons ground white pepper<br> 2 tablespoons dried thyme<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 cup buttermilk 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined<br> 4 cups canola oil 2 russet potatoes, scrubbed 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons ketchup<br> 1 tablespoon dill pickle relish<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill 2 dashes hot sauce Instructions: For the Gullah seasoning: Combine the paprika, salt, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, white pepper, thyme, sugar and cayenne in a paper bag and shake to mix up well. For the shrimp: Line a baking sheet with butcher or parchment paper. Pour the buttermilk in a bowl. Mix together the flour and 1 1/2 tablespoons Gullah seasoning in a bowl (reserve the remaining seasoning for another use). Dip the shrimp in the buttermilk, then dredge in the flour mixture, shaking the bag to coat. Shake off the excess flour and place on the prepared baking sheet. Discard the buttermilk mixture but reserve the flour mixture. Place the oil in a Dutch oven or heavy pan and heat to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack on top. Fry half the shrimp until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to the prepared wire rack to drain. Repeat with the remaining shrimp. Reduce the heat of the oil to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack on top. For Mom&#39;s fries: Slice the potatoes into 1/2-inch-wide sticks. Add the potatoes to the flour mixture and shake until the potatoes are coated. Drop a few in the oil. Fry in batches until golden brown, flipping and stirring frequently, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove to the prepared wire rack to drain in a single layer. For the fry sauce (if using): Whisk together the mayonnaise, ketchup, pickle relish, dill and hot sauce in a medium bowl. Transfer to a serving dish and serve alongside the fries and shrimp. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 42627,&quot;Chick and Egg Cupcake 1 Vanilla Cupcake, recipe follows About 1/3 cup White Fluff Frosting, recipe follows Green Coconut Grass, recipe follows 6 small candied malt balls (2 yellow, 2 pink, 2 white) 1 yellow chick peep White Airhead candy 2 2/3 cups sugar 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces 2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 2/3 cup milk 2/3 cup water 2 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/3 cups cake flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 cup whole milk 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 5 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup marshmallow fluff Pinch fine salt 2 cups sweetened shredded coconut 1 to 2 teaspoons liquid green food coloring 1/2 to 1 teaspoon liquid yellow food coloring Instructions: Frost a cupcake with fluff frosting.

Process sugar and butter in a food processor until very creamy, scraping sides as needed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, pulsing after each addition. Add the milk, water, and vanilla and process to blend. Whisk both flours, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dry ingredients, in 3 batches to the wet, pulsing, and then scraping batter off the sides of the processor as needed after each addition. Process until the batter is very smooth and pourable like pancake batter, about 2 minutes. Evenly pour the batter into the prepared cups, filling them 3/4 of the way full. Bake until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and the tops are golden, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly in tin, and turn out of tin when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a rack before frosting. Whisk the milk and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Slowly beat the butter and sugar, in another medium bowl, with an electric mixer until incorporated. Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the sides of the bowl down with a rubber spatula.) Add the fluff and salt and reduce the speed to low. Add the milk and vanilla mixture, scrape the bowl down, and mix until fully incorporated. Raise the mixer to high and beat briefly until fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Frost cupcake immediately. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a mesh rack on top, if available. Put coconut in a shallow bowl. While tossing with a large spoon, add food coloring drop by drop until the desired color is reached. A little more green than yellow makes a pretty grass color. Add a few tablespoons water to moisten the mixture and help disperse the color evenly. If the color is too dark, add additional water, as needed, to dilute to the desired color. Drain the coconut in a sieve or strainer. Spread the coconut in an even layer on the rack, or directly on the lined baking sheet. Place in the oven until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. Use immediately, or store in covered container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 42628,&quot;Flavor Mister 1 cup chicken broth 1/2 cup apple juice<br> 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> Instructions: Combine the chicken broth, apple juice, vinegar, salt, red pepper, black pepper and garlic in a bowl or measuring cup.

Add the mayonnaise, chives, mustard, smoked paprika, salt and pepper; pulse until well combined. Taste for salt and pepper and adjust. (The remoulade will keep, refrigerated, for 4 days. It is best made a day ahead.) For the crab cakes: Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and peppers and saute until soft, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Let cool to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, chiles, crabmeat, 1 cup of the panko, mayonnaise, chives, parsley, salt, pepper and the cooled vegetables. Gently mix until well blended. Pack the crab mixture into a 1/4 cup measuring cup, then gently tap out into your hand and form into a patty. Place the patty on a baking sheet and repeat with the rest of the crab mixture. Spread the remaining 1 cup panko on a large plate. Dredge the crab cakes in panko on all sides. Melt another 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When hot, add the crab cakes in batches, flattening them a bit with the back of a spatula. Cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Between batches, add another tablespoon of butter and olive oil to the pan. Place the browned crab cakes on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until sizzling and heated through. Serve the crab cakes with remoulade sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 42630,&quot;Old Cuban 1 handful fresh mint leaves (about 1 large sprig) plus more for garnish 1 1/2 ounces aged rum 1/2 ounce freshly-squeezed lime juice (1 lime) 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons superfine sugar or 1/2 ounce Simple Syrup, recipe follows 2 dashes bitters, (recommended: Angostura) Ice cubes 1 1/2 to 2 ounces dry Champagne, Prosecco or other sparkling wine Instructions: Muddle the mint leaves with the rum, lime juice, Simple Syrup, and bitters in a cocktail shaker.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal with some pea-size lumps. Drizzle in the vinegar and 4 tablespoons of the water; pulse until a dough starts to come together. If the mixture is too dry, add more water, a teaspoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap, form into a disk and wrap well. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. For the filling: Beat the cream cheese, egg yolk, 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar, and the vanilla in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. In another bowl, toss the cherries with the cornstarch and the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar. Finish the galette: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll the dough out to a 12-inch round. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Spoon the cherries over the cream cheese, leaving any excess juice in the bowl. Fold the edges of the dough over so they just barely cover some of the filling. Beat the egg white with a splash of water and brush it over the crust. Sprinkle the Demerara sugar evenly over the filling and crust. Bake until the crust is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42633,&quot;Double Mustard and Herb Crusted Ham One 8- to 10-pound bone-in, smoked, fully-cooked ham, butt or shank portion 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1/2 cup whole grain mustard 1/4 cup honey 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Let the ham sit at room temperature 30 minutes.

Put the milk in a microwave-safe cup or dish. Microwave until hot, about 1 minute. Whisk in the Dijon mustard until combined, then microwave for another 30 seconds. Meanwhile, heat a 10-inch ovensafe skillet over medium heat and add the butter. When melted, add the shallot and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Add the flour all at once and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Slowly pour in the hot milk mixture in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Increase the heat to medium low and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Whisk in the Gruyere, nutmeg, kosher salt to taste, a few grinds of pepper, 3 ounces of the ham and 1/3 cup of the Parmesan. Remove from the heat. Top the dip with the remaining 1 ounce ham, sprinkle with the remaining 2/3 cup Parmesan and finish with a few grinds of pepper. Place the thyme sprigs on top. Broil, rotating the skillet every minute to ensure even browning, until the top is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread the sourdough slices on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil on both sides and sprinkle with sea salt. Broil, flipping halfway through, until golden on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes total. For the creamy scrambled eggs: Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Add the half-and-half and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Gently whisk until combined and uniformly yellow. Melt the butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture and let sit and cook for 10 seconds. Stir with a rubber spatula and continue to cook, stirring every 5 seconds and making sure to scrape up the cooked eggs from the bottom, until the mixture is set with medium-size creamy curds, about 5 minutes. If you prefer smaller curds, stir constantly until the eggs are just set. Transfer to a serving plate. For the brunch board: Put some Dijon mustard in a small bowl for serving. Put half of the sourdough toast on a corner of a large board or platter, along with the mustard and a spreading knife. Place a potholder in the center of a board and put the croque monsieur skillet on the potholder. Arrange the muffins, danishes, pain au chocolat, fruit and babka on separate boards placed around the croque monsieur dip. Place the plate of scrambled eggs on another empty board with the remaining toast slices. Top the eggs with the chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42636,&quot;Croissants 1 ounce fresh yeast 3 1/2 cups unbleached flour 1/4 cup white or packed brown sugar 2 teaspoons salt 1 cup milk, or more 1 pound unsalted butter 2 tablespoons flour, for dusting 1 egg 1 tablespoon milk Instructions: In a mixer with a dough hook, place the yeast, flour, sugar, salt and the milk and mix for 2 minutes until a soft moist dough forms on the hook. If most of the flour isn&#39;t moistened with this quantity of milk, add more, a tablespoon at a time until it is moistened and smooth, using up to 4 tablespoons. Turn mixer on high and mix for another 4 minutes until very smooth and elastic. Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a floured board, cover with a damp tea towel and allow it to rest for 15 minutes to relax the gluten. Remove the towel and, using a French rolling pin, roll the dough into a 10 by 9-inch rectangle 5/8-inch thick. Wrap in plastic then chill for 1 hour and up to overnight. Ten minutes before the dough is done resting in the refrigerator, prepare the butter. Beat it with your rolling pin on a floured surface to soften it and form a rectangle 6 by 8 1/2 inches. Place it between parchment paper or plastic wrap and set aside. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll it on a floured work surface into a 10 by 15-inch and 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Brush any excess flour off the dough. Place the shorter side of the dough parallel to the front of your body on the work surface. Place the butter in the middle, long-ways. Fold the bottom up over the butter and brush off any excess flour and then fold the top down over the butter to overlap and encase the butter. Press down lightly with the rolling pin to push all the layers together and make sure they have contact. Continue rolling the laminated (layered) dough to form a new 10 by15-inch rectangle, patching any holes with a dusting of flour where butter may have popped through. Fold into thirds, like a letter, brush off any excess flour and mark it with an indentation made by poking your finger once at the corner of the dough meaning you have completed the first \turn. Wrap well in plastic and chill 1 hour and up to overnight. Do this again three more times (some people only do 3 turns total, some do 6, some do 3 plus what&#39;s called a \wallet\ turn for the last one which is a 4 fold turn that&#39;s folded into itself like a book jacket) marking it accordingly each time and chilling in between each turn. After the fourth turn, you can let the dough chill overnight, or, for 1 hour, or, roll it out to a 13 by 24-inch square that is a little less than 1/4-inch thick and cut out your croissants and shape them. I roll out my dough and cut it with a sharp large knife into 6-inch strips then cut them into triangles, 4 inches wide at the base of the triangle (or for a more curved croissant cut the triangles 6 inches wide). Stretch these triangles again 9 inches long, then place on the work surface and put a piece of scrap dough in the center of the wide end to enclose, which will plump up the center. Roll the triangles up towards you starting at the wide end and place them 2 inches apart on a parchment lined sheet pan with the tip tucked under and the ends slightly curved in to make a crescent shape. You may freeze the croissants at this point, or, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk and brush the croissants with this egg wash. To proof the croissants, place them in an oven that is warm but not turned on, with a pan of hot water in the bottom to create a moist environment like a proof box. Set aside to proof for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours until puffed up and spongy to the touch. Remove from the oven. Spritz a preheated 425 degree F oven with water, close the door, and get the croissants. Place the croissants in the oven and spritz again, close the door and turn the oven down to 400 degrees F. After 10 minutes, rotate your pan if they are cooking unevenly and turn the oven down to 375 degrees F. Bake another 5 to 8 minutes until golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42637,&quot;Oven Fries 3 large baking potatoes, peeled 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon white sugar 1/2 teaspoon paprika Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the potatoes into \fries\ by slicing them lengthwise 4 times, and then slicing each slice another 4 or 5 times. Mix the oil, sugar and paprika in a bowl or large freezer bag. Toss the potatoes in the oil and sugar mixture and transfer to a baking sheet in 1 layer. Sprinkle with salt on both sides. Bake 30 to 40 minutes, turning the fries over with tongs about halfway through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42638,&quot;Marzipan Pumpkins 7 ounces almond paste 2 teaspoons fondant 2 teaspoons corn syrup 4 tablespoons powdered sugar 3 drops orange food coloring Instructions: Place almond paste and fondant in a mixing bowl with the dough hook attachment, set on first speed, beat until soft.

Drain on paper towels and cut in half; set aside. Soft-boil the eggs: Bring a saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the eggs into the water and cook exactly 6 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a bowl with ice water. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs from the boiling water and lower them into the ice water. Let sit at least 5 minutes, then peel. Preheat a grill or griddle to medium high. Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, the tomatoes, basil and garlic in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper; toss and set aside. Stand the iceberg head upright on the core. With a sharp knife, cut a 1-inch-thick slice out of the center (the thickest part) of the head, creating a thick round disk. Lay the lettuce disk on a work surface and cut away the core. Slicing horizontally, cut the disk in half to create two 1/2-inch-thick round lettuce \steaks.<br> Whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the paprika in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Brush on both sides of the lettuce steaks; grill just to give the lettuce a little color on one side, about 30 seconds. To assemble the salad, put a piece of grilled iceberg on each plate. Cut the soft-boiled eggs in half and arrange on top. Top with the avocado, bacon, radishes, onion and tomato mixture. Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar.

Cut 1 1/2 sticks of the butter into small pieces; add to the flour mixture and cut it in with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Pour in the cream and mix just until the dough comes together. Don&#39;t overwork; the dough should be slightly sticky but manageable. Melt the remaining 1/2 stick butter in a10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add the peach mixture and cook gently until heated through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a 2-quart baking dish (or leave in the skillet). Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls over the warm peaches. (There can be gaps because the dough will puff up and spread as it bakes.) Brush the top with some heavy cream and sprinkle with sugar and a little extra cinnamon. Bake in the oven on a baking sheet (to catch any drips) until the cobbler is browned and the fruit is bubbling, 40 to 45 minutes.

Stir 1 1/4 cups warm water with the olive oil and yeast and pour into the well in the flour bowl. Stir until a soft and shaggy dough forms and then turn out onto a lightly-floured board and knead until smooth and the dough springs back when pressed with your thumb. Transfer to a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, mist the dough ball, cover and let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Divide the dough into 2 pieces and roll each into a ball. Cover loosely and let rest an additional 30 minutes. For the sauce: Combine the oregano, tomatoes and garlic in a small skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring and lightly mashing the tomatoes with a spatula, until the tomatoes have released their liquid and the sauce has become thick and jammy, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper and stir in the basil. For assembling the pizza: Place 2 baking sheets in the oven and turn the oven to 500 degrees F. Stretch and/or roll each piece of dough until very thin and place each on a piece of lightly floured parchment paper that is the same size as the baking sheets heating in the oven (the dough will be a rustic oval shape). Rub each piece of dough with 1 teaspoon of the oil, sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and carefully transfer to the hot baking sheets. Bake until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and evenly spread each pizza crust with the sauce, spreading about 1/2 inch from the edge, and then top with the mozzarella, Parmesan and spinach. Return to the oven and continue to bake until the crust is crisp and the cheese has melted and is browned in spots, 6 to 8 minutes, rotating the pans if necessary. Remove from the oven and place small spoonfuls of the ricotta on the pizzas and sprinkle with fresh basil. Sprinkle the pizzas with salt and crushed red pepper flakes, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 42646,&quot;Beer Can Chicken with Cola Barbecue Sauce One 12-ounce can beer One 3 1/2 to 4 pound chicken 2 tablespoons Basic Barbecue Rub, recipe follows 2 cups Cola Barbecue Sauce, for serving, recipe follows 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar 1/4 cup sweet paprika 3 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons kosher or sea salt 1 tablespoon hickory salt 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons onion powder 2 teaspoons celery seeds 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 cup cola (recommended: Coca-Cola) 1 cup ketchup 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon liquid smoke 3 tablespoon steak sauce (recommended: A-1 Steak Sauce) 1 teaspoon onion flakes 1 teaspoon garlic flakes 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Pop the tab off the beer can. Using a church key style can opener, make a few more holes in the top of the can. Pour out half the beer into the soaking water of the wood chips. Set the can of beer aside. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium. If using a charcoal grill, place a large drip pan in the center. If using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and preheat the grill to high until you see smoke, then reduce the heat to medium. Remove the packet of giblets from the body cavity of the chicken and set aside for another use. Remove and discard the fat just inside the body and neck cavities. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water, drain, and blot dry inside and out with paper towels. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the rub inside the body and neck cavities of the chicken. Rub the bird all over on the outside with 2 teaspoons of the rub. If you have the patience, you can put some of the rub under the skin being careful not to tear it. Spoon the remaining 2 teaspoons of rub through the holes into the beer in the can. Don&#39;t worry if it foams up, this is normal. Insert the beer can into the body cavity of the chicken and spread out the legs to form a sort of tripod. Tuck the wing tips behind the chicken&#39;s back. When ready to cook, if using a charcoal grill, toss all the wood chips on the coals. Stand the chicken up in the center of the hot grate, over the drip pan and away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until the skin is a dark golden brown and very crisp and the meat is cooked to an internal temperature of 180 degrees, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. If using a charcoal grill, you&#39;ll need to add 12 fresh coals per side after 1 hour. Using tongs, carefully transfer the chicken in its upright position on the beer can to a platter and present it to your guests. Let rest 5 minutes, and then carefully remove the chicken from the beer can. Take care not to spill the hot beer or otherwise burn yourself. Quarter or carve the chicken and serve with the Cola Barbecue Sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir to blend together. Store the rub in an airtight jar away from heat or light. It will keep for at least 6 months. Combine all the ingredients in a heavy non-reactive saucepan and gradually bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat slightly to obtain a gentle simmer. Simmer the sauce until reduced by 1/4, about 6 to 8 minutes. Use right away or transfer to a large jar, cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for several months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42647,&quot;Rabbit, Hunter-Style: Coniglio alla Cacciatora 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 pounds rabbit meat, cut into serving pieces 1 medium onion, thinly sliced 3 large cloves garlic, smashed 1 pound button mushrooms, cleaned and halved 1 teaspoon salt 4 cranks freshly ground pepper Pinch red pepper flakes 1 (28-ounce) can peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley Instructions: In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.

Be sure the chocolate has set completely and the stand is sturdy before you set anything on top of it.<br> If you would like to use a potato masher or a slotted spatula, first place an acetate or parchment sheet on the work surface, then place the utensil on top of the paper. Using an offset spatula, spread a layer of white chocolate over the utensil (filling the holes) and onto the acetate sheet. Carefully, lift off the utensil. Allow the chocolate to set then use an offset spatula to carefully spread a layer of dark chocolate over the white chocolate texture. Allow the chocolate to set. Use a sharp knife or cutter to cut the chocolate into interesting shapes.<br> Use these same techniques for any other textured mat and create more interesting pieces for the centerpiece.<br> To assemble the centerpiece, use the chocolate to glue the various shapes into place. Use your eye as a guide to create an interesting design. A nice thing to do is to place a cake on the stand and distribute petit fours around the base of the centerpiece. You can also decorate with fresh fruit to add color. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 42663,&quot;Black Bean Cumin Dip 2 pounds cooked black beans 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped garlic 1 1/2 teaspoons toasted cumin seed, ground 1/4 cup cilantro leaves 1/4 cup sour cream 1/2 jalapeno, chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put all the ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth. Reserve some of the juice from cooking the beans, or if you are using a canned product extra water can be used if there is not enough in the can. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 42664,&quot;Chicken Corn Soup 1 (5 pound) stewing chicken, 1 large onion studded with 2 whole cloves 1 large carrot 2 outside green celery stalks 3 tablespoons chopped fresh lovage leaves 1/2 lemon in large pieces 1/2 teaspoon ground saffron 12 ears of fresh corn 3/4 cup fresh celery and leaves, chopped Salt and pepper, to taste 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced 2 large whole chicken breasts Rivels 3/4 cup unbleached flour Pinch salt, or to taste 1 large egg 1 tablespoon water (mineral or plain seltzer) Instructions: Cook the chicken slowly in 4 quarts of water (or to cover) for 1 hour. Add the vegetables and cook for another 1 hour, then add the lovage and lemon and continue to cook slowly until the chicken is very tender and falls away from the bones. The broth should never boil. Strain the stock. Discard the vegetables, herbs and lemon. At this point the stewing chicken has lost its nutrients and taste, discard it. Return the stock to the pot and add the saffron. Cut the kernels from the ears of corn. It is important to get the most \milk\ from the corn, so cut the corn with a sharp knife (not too close to the cob) and go back over the cob with the flat of the knife to release the \milk. Add the corn to the broth and saffron. Add the celery. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add parsley and simmer until the celery is tender. Break 6 of the cobs in half and cover with water. Add 2 whole chicken breasts and simmer with the cobs until the meat is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the breast and strain the \cob water\ into the soup. Remove the skin and bone from the chicken breasts. Cut into bite sized pieces and add to the soup. Correct the seasoning if necessary. Add the rivels to the simmering soup and cook until they are tender. Sift the flour into a bowl with the salt. Make a well in the center. Whisk the eggs until light colored and add the water. Pour this into the well and stir to form a stiff dough. Break off piece of dough and dip into flour. Shape in hand into tiny strings of dough. Spread the crumbs on a cookie sheet or clean cloth to dry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42665,&quot;Huevos Rancheros Corn oil 12 eggs Refried beans 8 ounces ground beef Corn oil 1 1/2 pints (3 cups) water 2 medium tomatoes, chopped 1 large roasted green cl, chopped 1/2 onion, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, crushed Dash Worcestershire sauce Salt Black pepper, freshly ground 2 tablespoons corn flour 6 corn tortillas Instructions: To make the chili sauce, brown the beef in a little oil over medium heat. Add water, tomatoes, green cl, onion, garlic, Worcestershire, and salt and pepper to taste; stir. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Add the cornflour (mixed with a little water), stir well and cook for 10 minutes more. ( The sauce keeps in the fridge and can be frozen. It may need more liquid if too thick after thawing). Keep the sauce hot. Heat about 2 inches of corn oil in a large frying pan and cook the tortillas, one at a time, for a few seconds on each side (do not let them become crisp). Drain on a paper towel. Pour off most of the oil, then return the pan to a low heat. Fry the eggs 2 or 3 at a time. Top each tortilla with 2 eggs and pour a ladle of green chili sauce over each portion.

Using a whisk, stir the mixture to incorporate all the ingredients. Cream the butter in a stand mixer until it lightens up. Slowly add in the sugars and continue to cream until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each egg. Stir in the vanilla. On low speed, add the flour mixture. Once incorporated, fold in the chocolate chips by hand. Take 2 teaspoons dough, or if using a spoon, take a good scoop and roll it into balls. I use my hands, it&#39;s faster and a whole lot easier. Put the cookie dough balls onto a baking sheet and pop them into the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes. Chilling the dough will help the batter stick to the cookie balls. For the batter: Combine the flour, sugar and baking powder in a large bowl. Take a whisk and give the mixture a few swirls to incorporate the ingredients and break up any lumps. Whisk in the egg and the seltzer, making sure to combine well. You want the batter to have the consistency of heavy cream, so add more seltzer, if needed, to achieve this. In a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Working in batches, add 3 chilled dough balls to the batter and turn to coat completely. Using a fork or slotted spoon, remove each cookie dough ball from the batter, letting the excess batter drip back into the bowl, then very carefully slip it into the hot oil and repeat. Fry no more than 3 at a time, since you do not want the temperature of the oil to drop. Using a slotted spoon, turn them over a few times until they are golden brown, about 3 minutes total. Remove the crispy cookie dough balls from the oil to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with a generous pinch of fleur de sel and serve warm. Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 42692,&quot;Inspired Trail Mix 1 cup raw cashews 1 tablespoon maple syrup 2 pinches ground cinnamon 1 pinch cayenne pepper 1 pinch sea salt 1/3 cup halved dried apricots 1/3 cup raisins Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl, toss together the cashews, maple syrup, cinnamon, cayenne, and salt until well mixed. Spread the mixture onto the baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, stirring half way through, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and scrape the nuts onto a plate to cool. When the nuts are cool, put them into a bowl and toss them together with the apricots and raisins. Serving suggestions: Divide the mix into small individual containers for snacking. Spoon a few tablespoons over a serving of yogurt or frozen yogurt.

Drain the noodles thoroughly in a colander and set aside while preparing the other ingredients. In a small bowl, mix the fish sauce, tamarind juice, and sugar; stir well to melt the sugar. Taste and adjust flavors to the desired combination of salty, sour, and sweet. Heat a wok over medium-high heat until it is smoking hot. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and quickly stir-fry the shrimp until they turn pink and are almost cooked through; 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the shrimp to a plate and cover to keep warm. Add the remaining oil to the wok and toss in the garlic, shallots, and cl; stir-fry for 30 seconds. Push the garlic and shallots to 1 side of the wok and pour the egg into the center. Scramble the egg lightly until set, breaking it up into pieces with a spatula. Add the drained noodles to the wok, stirring and tossing quickly with 2 spatulas to separate the strands. Pour in the fish sauce mixture, tossing well to coat the noodles and keep them from sticking (if the noodles are still too firm, drizzle with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help them cook.) When the noodles are in good shape, toss in 1/2 of the bean sprouts and peanuts; save the remaining for garnish. Continue to stir-fry, to combine. Return the shrimp to the wok and toss the pad thai together to warm everything through. Serve the pad thai on a platter, pile the remaining bean sprouts and peanuts on 1 side of the dish and garnish with the lime wedges and cilantro. Squeeze lime juice over each portion before eating. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 42694,&quot;Peach Jam 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cloves 4 large ripe peaches, peeled, pitted and coarsely chopped (about 2 pounds) Instructions: Put the sugar, 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice, vanilla and cloves in a heavy, nonreactive skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Add the peaches to the skillet and stir once to coat. Raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a visible simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thick and jam-like and the peach pieces are very soft, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on ripeness of the peaches. Check the pan midway, you may need to lower the temperature to medium if the mixture starts to brown. Crush the peaches with a potato masher, until most of the mixture is smooth and there are only a few chunky pieces left. (The longer the mixture cooks, the thicker the jam will be after it cools.) Remove from the heat, stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, and let cool before refrigerating. Cool completely in the refrigerator before using. Discard the cloves before serving. The jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42695,&quot;Tangy Chicken and Black Bean Collard Wraps 8 large collard green leaves (about 10 ounces) Kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes 8 chicken tenders (about 1 pound) 2 tablespoons jerk seasoning 1/3 cup nonfat Greek yogurt One 14.5-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed 2 cups shredded red cabbage (from 1/2 small head) 2 tablespoons lime juice<br> 1 small avocado, sliced 1 small red bell pepper, cut into thin strips Instructions: Remove the stems up to the leafy part of the collards. Lay each collard leaf underside up on a flat surface. Locate the thickest part of the stem and use a vegetable peeler to shave off the top for even thickness (this makes it easier to roll up the leaves). Fill a large wide skillet or pan with just enough water to coat the bottom. Arrange a few leaves at a time in a circle, overlapping, in the bottom of the skillet and sprinkle lightly with salt. Repeat with the remaining leaves. Put the skillet over medium-high heat and as soon as steam appears, lower the heat to medium, cover and steam until the collards are green, tender and pliable, 5 to 6 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the leaves to a baking sheet to cool completely. Meanwhile, arrange a rack in the top of the oven and preheat the broiler. Scatter the coconut on a baking sheet and broil until toasted, 15 to 30 seconds. Transfer to a medium bowl. Coat the chicken in 1 tablespoon of the jerk seasoning and 1 tablespoon of the yogurt. Arrange the chicken tenders on the baking sheet and broil until lightly browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Add the beans to the bowl with the coconut and use a fork to mash lightly. Combine the cabbage, lime juice and remaining 1/4 cup yogurt and 1 tablespoon jerk seasoning in a separate bowl.<br> Lay a collard leaf underside up on a work surface. Lay a piece of chicken across the middle. Top the chicken with a couple slices of avocado and strips of pepper. Pile an eighth of the coconut black beans next to the chicken.

Place them in a colander or kitchen towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Combine the potatoes in a bowl with the egg, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix well. Melt 2 tablespoons of clarified butter in a skillet. Drop a heaping tablespoon of the potato mixture into the sizzling butter. Flatten with a spatula and cook for 2 minutes. Turn, flatten again, and cook for another 2 minutes, until crisp on the outside and golden brown. Serve the pancakes hot from the skillet with a dollop of creme fraiche and a teaspoon of caviar. Note: To make 6 tablespoons of clarified butter, slowly melt 8 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan. Set it aside until the milk solids settle. Spoon off any solids that rise to the top and then carefully pour off the golden liquid, leaving the milky part in the bottom of the pan. Clarified butter has a higher burning temperature than melted butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42735,&quot;Stracciatella with Chicken and Barley 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 leeks (white and light green parts), thickly sliced 3 carrots, chopped 8 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into thirds 1/2 cup pearl barley 1 head escarole, trimmed and roughly chopped (about 6 cups) 3 large eggs 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Juice of 1/2 lemon 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.

Toast the chiles skin-side up until fragrant and beginning to darken, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and pour enough boiling water to cover and soak until softened, about 15 minutes. Strain, reserving the water. Transfer the chiles to a blender or food processor along with 1/2 cup of the reserved steeping water, the cider vinegar, cumin, oregano and garlic. Process until a smooth paste forms. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Place the lamb in a Dutch oven and slather the cl paste over the shanks. Add the chicken stock. Bring the liquid to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer, cover with the lid and braise until the lamb is tender, about 2 hours 30 minutes. For the pickled peppers: Meanwhile, bring the lime juice, sugar and vinegar to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Put the chiles in a separate bowl and pour the vinegar mixture over. Let cool for about 20 minutes. Discard the liquid before using. For the guacamole: Combine the cilantro, cumin, salt, tomatillos, garlic, avocado, onions, jalapenos and lime juice in a food processor or blender and pulse until combined and still somewhat chunky.

Chill in the fridge at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Right before serving, stir in the mint and pour over the mangos and berries. Garnish with whole mint leaves. BYOC: You will love this syrup so much you will be pouring it over fruit all year long. For something a little different, try using fresh basil instead of the mint. This also makes a fantastic base for a drink. Try a mojito by adding a bit of rum and club soda. Or try adding fresh ginger for a kick of warm spice. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 42740,&quot;Michael&#39;s Upside Down Apple Pie 2 cups all purpose flour 1 stick butter (1/2 cup) Small glass water with ice cubes 1 package pecan nut halves 1/3 cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 stick butter (1/4 cup) 1 cup sugar 1/2 vanilla bean 1 lemon 6 to 8 Granny Smith apples 1 rounded teaspoon cinnamon 1 pinch grated nutmeg 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour Instructions: To make pastry sift flour into a bowl. Cut cold butter into small pieces with a wire cheese cutter. Add butter to flour and work it into the flour with the back of a fork. Do not use your hands or anything that would add heat to the mixture. When the butter has been worked into the flour as much as possible, add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time and mix it in with a large spoon. It will probably only take 2 or 3 tablespoons of water to form the dough. As soon as the dough can be rolled into a ball in the bowl put it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator.<br> When the dough has been in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour, start to coat the bottom of the pie pan. I prefer to use the deepest pie pan I can find. Spread 1 tablespoon of butter over the bottom and sides of the pie pan. Depending on the size of the pan you might have to use more or less, but I like my coating to be generous. Then sprinkle 1/3 cup of brown sugar over the butter, with a light coating covering the bottom and sides. As with the butter you may have to use more or less depending on pan size. Then place the pecan nut halves, flat side up, on the bottom and sides of the pan. I start in the middle with 1 nut and then put the rest in circles around the center, closely spaced. Finish with a layer of nuts covering the side of the pan. The entire bottom and sides should be covered with nuts. Next take the dough out of the refrigerator, cut the ball in 1/2, wrap 1/2 in the plastic wrap and put it back in the refrigerator. Roll out the other 1/2 taking care not to handle the dough too much. Place the rolled out dough in the pie pan over the pecan nut coating, and trim the edges. Cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator.<br> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> To make the filling place 1/4 cup of butter and 1 cup of sugar in a small pan and cook over medium heat. When the butter and sugar have mixed into a liquid form add 1/2 vanilla bean. Stir the mixture constantly until it starts to turn brownish, or caramelized. Then remove it from the heat. Fill a large bowl with cold water and squeeze in 1/2 of the lemon. Peel the apples, cut into thin slices and put into the bowl with cold lemon water. I like to cut the slices rather thin, 1/8-inch or so. In a small bowl mix together 1 rounded teaspoon cinnamon, 1 pinch nutmeg, and 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. Drain the apples in a colander and wipe all water out of the large bowl. Put the apples back in the bowl and sprinkle with the cinnamon, nutmeg and flour mixture. Mix until they are all covered.<br> Take the pie pan out of the refrigerator and put 1/2 on the apples over the bottom pastry layer. Squeeze 1/2 of the lemon into the caramelized butter and sugar mixture, mix and pour half of the mixture through a sieve onto the apples. Layer the other 1/2 of the apples on top of that and pour on the rest of the caramelized mix. The pie should be just slightly over filled, and formed to a dome in the middle. Remove the second half of the pastry ball from the refrigerator and roll it out. Brush the bottom lip of the pie pastry with water to help form a seal. Place the rolled pastry on top of the pie and trim with kitchen scissors. Crimp the edges together with your fingers to make a good seal between the top and bottom pastry layers. Cut 3 small slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Place pie on a cookie sheet and wrap aluminum foil around the pie edges. Place the cookie sheet and pie in the center of the oven and allow to cook for 15 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and cook for an additional 25 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil and check the crust to see if it is golden brown. You will probably have to continue to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes for the crust to turn golden brown. Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to set for 5 minutes. Then place a large plate over the top of the pie and flip it over. Gently lift the pie pan off of the pie. It should come off clean, but if any pecans stick to the pie pan remove them and put them back on the pie. Allow to cool at least 1 1/2 hours before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42741,&quot;Parmesan, Basil and Lemon Wafers (Frico) 1 cup shredded Parmesan 2 tablespoons shredded basil leaves 1/2 tablespoon grated lemon zest Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Transfer a heaping tablespoon of Parmesan mixture onto a silicone or parchment-lined baking sheet and lightly pat down. A silicone baking sheet is highly recommended for this recipe. Repeat with the remaining cheese mixture, spacing the spoonfuls about 1/2-inch apart. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes or until golden and crisp.

In a medium bowl, mix the butter, parsley, garlic, scallions, red pepper flakes and a few grinds of black pepper. Prepare and bake the bread. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Keeping the integrity of the shape of the loaf in mind, evenly apply the butter mixture to one side of each slice of bread. Reassemble the loaf upright to form the boule shape on top of a sheet of nonstick aluminum foil. Pull the long sides of the aluminum foil over the top of the boule, using the foil to keep the slices together. Set the bread perpendicularly on top of another piece of foil; again pull the long sides over the exposed sides of the boule. Leave the top open to expose the top crust of the loaf. Place on a sheet pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Unwrap and cut the slices in half.

Line an 18-by-13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Have another 18-by-13-inch baking sheet and piece of parchment on hand. Roll out the puff pastry to a 12-by-15-inch rectangle. Cut in three equal rectangles, about 12 by 5 inches each. Dock all over with a fork to suppress the puff pastry&#39;s rise in the oven. Transfer the pieces to the prepared baking sheet, cover with the other sheet of parchment and top with the second baking sheet. Bake until the flour structure has set and the pastry looks light golden and flaky, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the top baking sheet and piece of parchment and return to the oven until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes more. Cool completely on a baking rack. Meanwhile, combine the granulated sugar, salt, vanilla and 2 1/2 cups of the milk in a large saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edges. While the milk is warming, whisk together the cornstarch, flour, eggs and remaining 1/2 cup milk in a large bowl. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk mixture, adding a ladleful to the egg mixture at a time, whisking the whole time. Once you&#39;ve added two-thirds of the milk mixture to the egg mixture, pour it back into the pan and cook on medium heat, whisking constantly. Once the mixture thickens and comes to boil, stir vigorously and count to 60. Remove from the heat. Pass the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then stir in the butter and Scotch. Cool over an ice bath, stirring occasionally, until the pastry cream reaches room temperature. Transfer the pastry cream to a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. (Or, if not using immediately, cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic wrap onto the surface of the pastry cream to keep a skin from forming.) Whip the cream in a medium bowl with a hand mixer or balloon whisk until medium-stiff peaks form. Put the whipped cream in a separate pastry bag with a medium round tip. Trim the cooled puff pastry carefully with a serrated bread knife to produce three identical pieces. Then, slice the long rectangle pieces crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Line up a third of the pieces to form the first layer of the mille-feuille, like a puzzle. Pipe dots of pastry cream on the first layer. Top with the next layer of pastry. Pipe dots of whipped cream on the second layer of pastry. Line up the pieces of pastry for the final layer on a baking sheet. Dust the top with the confectioners&#39; sugar, covering the pastry completely. Torch the top, being careful not to burn the sugar.

Divide the melon balls and half the raspberries evenly among 4 tall narrow glasses or dessert cups, about 8 ounces each. Sprinkle the gelatin over 1 cup of the Prosecco and stir to combine (fresh sparkling wine will bubble up, so do this in a medium bowl with room for froth). Let stand until the gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Toss the remaining raspberries with the sugar and water in a medium saucepan and heat over low heat until raspberries break down and sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Pour off about 3 tablespoons of the raspberry juice, and reserve for flavoring the whipped cream. Add the remaining Prosecco to the berries in the saucepan and heat over medium-low until the berries break up and flavor the wine, about 2 minutes. It&#39;s best not to let the wine boil. Stir in gelatin mixture until dissolved, about 1 more minute. Strain and press through a fine mesh strainer to remove any fruit pips. Pour Prosecco gelatin into glasses over the fruit and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours. For the Cream: Just before serving whip the cream and sugar until soft peaks form.

You should be left with the pork loin opened into about an 8-by-10-inch piece. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the sausage, olives, dates and shallots. Mix in the cream, breadcrumbs and egg yolk, and finish with the parsley. Season with the za&#39;atar and some salt and pepper. Stuff the pork loin by spreading the mixture down one side of the opened loin and folding over the other half. You should leave about 1/2 inch of extra space for the ends of the pork to seal again, keeping the filling centered. Cut 8 long pieces of butcher&#39;s twine and tie the loin together to form it back to its original shape. Put the loin on a roasting rack in a pan and season with salt and pepper. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F, 50 to 60 minutes. Rest the meat for 10 minutes before slicing. You should have 8 even slices from the roast. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]</p><p>&quot; 42778,&quot;Sonoma Coolers 8 Sonoma-variety grapes, plus more for garnishing 4 fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnishing 3 ounces vodka 2 ounces grapefruit juice 2 ounces Meyer lemon juice 2 ounces Orange Blossom Honey Syrup, recipe follows Ice California sparkling wine, as needed 1 ounce orange blossom honey 1 ounce water Instructions: Make two cocktails at once using this method: In a cockatil shaker, muddle the grapes and fresh basil .

Mix in the barley malt syrup, yeast packet and sugar until dissolved, then allow the yeast to foam, 10 minutes. To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the bread flour and salt and mix to combine. When the yeast mixture is ready, pour into the flour along with an additional 1 3/4 cups warm water. Mix until a soft dough forms. Your dough should clean the bowl and begin to climb the hook. Mix for about 5 minutes more on medium speed. After 5 minutes of mixing, pour the dough onto a clean surface and continue kneading by hand for an additional 15 minutes, until the dough is stiff, slightly tacky and very smooth. Put the dough in a clean bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours (see Cook&#39;s Note). Pre-shape the dough: Fold the dough down, deflating it, then turn out onto a clean work surface. Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces, about 4 ounces each. Form each piece of dough into a tight ball, rounding it in a circular motion until smooth. Place on a parchment-lined sheet tray lightly sprayed with cooking spray and repeat with the remaining dough, 6 to a tray. Cover with a damp towel and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Shape and proof: Roll out each ball into a rope roughly 9 to 10 inches. Pick up the rope and wrap it around your fingers where they meet your palm, overlapping the ends and forming a ring of even thickness. Seal the seam by rolling on your palm, then reshape if necessary into an even ring. Place back on the parchment and repeat with the remaining dough. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, then place the damp towel over the sheet tray. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Set up your grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Your grill should be at 450 degrees F. Finishing and baking: Allow the chill to come off of the bagels for at least 1 hour before baking. The bagels are ready to finish when the dough floats in room temperature water. Fill a bowl with room temperature water, pick up a bagel and drop it into the bowl. If it floats, the bagels are ready to proceed with the rest of the finishing and baking process. If the dough sinks, allow the dough to set out at room temperature for another 30 minutes and test again. For the bagels: Fill a pot halfway with water and bring to a boil on the direct heat side of the grill. Whisk in the barley malt syrup and baking soda. The water should look like brewed black tea. Drop as many bagels as will comfortably fit, about 4, into the pot and boil for 1 minute, flipping halfway through. Remove to a draining rack and continue with the remaining bagels. Pour your desired toppings onto plates and dip the tops of each bagel into the topping, pressing gently. Put the bagels on a cast-iron pan, place on the offset heat part of the grill, close the grill and bake until the bagels are deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool before serving. Oven method: Bake on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet at 450 degrees F for 40 to 45 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42796,&quot;Lamb Tacos (Barbacoa Style) 2 dried ancho chiles 2 dried chipotle chiles 1 tablespoon paprika 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 5 cloves garlic, crushed 1/2 cup vegetable oil 3 pounds tied boneless lamb shoulder Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 6 banana leaves 2 limes, cut into wedges 10 to 12 flour tortillas, warmed 1 cup picked fresh cilantro leaves 1 cup crumbled queso fresco 1 cup shaved radishes 1 red onion, shaved paper thin Malbec, for serving Instructions: Rehydrate the anchos and chipotles in a bowl and cover with hot, boiling water.

Remove the neck and gizzard from the turkey and discard. Rinse the bird thoroughly with cold water and pat dry. Using your fingers, gently loosen the skin from the breasts and drumsticks and slip the sage leaves underneath. Rub the entire surface with 1/4 cup of the melted butter. Lightly sprinkle the skin and cavity with salt and pepper. Truss the turkey and place on a rack in a large roasting pan. Roast for about 45 minutes, until brown, basting with the remaining butter every 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 F and continue roasting for another 1 1/4 hours or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 180 degrees F. If the legs or breast brown too quickly, cover them with foil. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and allow it to rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving. To serve, cut down along each breast and remove it whole. Cut the breast into slices, the way you would a loaf of bread. Place on a large serving platter and arrange the thigh meat in chunks and the legs on top. Spoon some pomegranate sauce over the top and sprinkle everything with the pomegranate seeds and chives. Serve the remaining Pomegranate Sauce and the Wild Rice and Goat Cheese Stuffing alongside. You can reheat sliced turkey over medium heat in stock just to cover. Top with sauce, pomegranate seeds, and chives just before serving. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and sweat the onion and garlic until the onion is tender, about 3 minutes. Add the peppercorns and cook another 3 minutes. Add the port and cook, stirring, until most of it has evaporated. Add the stock, pomegranate juice, molasses and brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and reduce slowly to a sauce consistency. As the sugars caramelize, the sauce will turn brownish red. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and add chives and pomegranate seeds. Place the rice, water, and salt to taste in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer until the grains open all the way. Drain the rice. Meanwhile, cook the chorizo in a small saucepan over medium heat until the fat is rendered and the chorizo gets a little crisp. Drain. Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery and sweat until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, chorizo, bread, cheese, parsley, thyme, and stock and stir to combine. The mixture should be quite wet: add a little more stock or water, if needed. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Transfer to a 6-cup buttered baking dish and bake, uncovered, until golden brown and heated through, 25 to 30 minutes. May be refrigerated up to 1 day; reheat with a little chicken stock for 20 minutes at 350 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 42801,&quot;Three-Cheese Potato Gratin Butter, for greasing the baking dish 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 2 large cloves garlic, chopped 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary 1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 5 small Yukon gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/8-inch-thick rounds (about 1 1/4 pounds) 1 large yam (red skinned sweet potatoes), cut into 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch-thick rounds 1 1/2 cups coarsely grated Gruyere cheese (about 5 ounces) 1/2 cup coarsely grated Asiago cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces) 1/2 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces) 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, optional Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart glass or ceramic baking dish.<br> Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and stir 1 minute. Add the cream, broth, rosemary, salt and pepper. Remove the pan from the heat.<br> Mix all the grated cheeses together in a medium bowl.<br> Mix the yams and potatoes together in a medium bowl.<br> Arrange one-third of the potato mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with one-third of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers twice more ending with a layer of the cheese mixture. Pour the cream mixture over the layers and cover the pan with foil.<br> Bake the gratin until the potatoes are almost tender, about 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the potatoes are tender and golden on top, 20 to 25 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and let the gratin rest, 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley, if using, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 42802,&quot;Countdown #9 No Lump Gravy 7 cups low-sodium chicken stock Turkey neck, from turkey 1/2 cup dry marsala, or sherry 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour Instructions: Heat the stock in a large pot over medium heat. Add the turkey neck and bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes.<br> Unless the bottom of the roasting pan is burned, you can make delicious gravy. Place the roasting pan that you used to roast your turkey in over the burners of the stove, add the marsala and mustard to the pan, and warm it over low heat. Scrape the bottom of the pan to get the drippings and tasty bits off as the marsala reduces. Reduce the marsala until there is almost no liquid left in the roasting pan.<br> Remove the neck from the stock. Use a small strainer to sift the flour into a medium bowl. Slowly add 1 cup of stock into the flour, whisking constantly to blend smooth and lump free.<br> Whisk in the flour mixture and remaining chicken stock to the roasting pan. Reduce until the mixture thickens. Generally, a gravy is a thick sauce that is made fairly quickly. Cooking it for a while longer can help the starch in the flour break down and yield a slightly smoother texture. If any lumps, strain before serving. Transfer to a gravy boat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42803,&quot;Beef and Barley Cabbage Rolls 2 cups boiling water 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup uncooked barley 12 large, whole, outside cabbage leaves 1 pound ground beef 1 can evaporated milk 1/2 cup shredded carrot 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 egg, slightly beaten 1/4 teaspoon celery seed 3 tablespoons finely chopped onion 1/4 teaspoon oregano 1 1/2 tablespoons ketchup 1/4 teaspoon pepper 3 tablespoons butter, melted 1 teaspoon lemon juice Paprika Instructions: In a medium stockpot, bring water and salt to a boil.

Continue boiling until sugar has completely melted. Reduce heat to low, add the lemon wedges and cook slowly until almost soft. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking rack. Let dry at room temperature overnight. Place lemon juice in a small nonreactive saucepan and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup, let cool. Place cooled lemon syrup, sherry vinegar, shallots and garlic in a blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Pour into a bowl and fold in the parsley. Fry capers in oil until crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes. Drain on paper towel. For the potatoes: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the potatoes with the oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange the potatoes in an even layer in the bottom of 4 small cazuelas. Place in the oven and bake 3/4 of the way through. For the salmon: Remove the potatoes from the oven and reduce the heat to 250 degrees F. Lightly brush the salmon on both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.

With the mixer on low speed, drizzle in the orange juice and the lemon juice and mix until smooth. Drizzle in the cooled melted butter slowly and add the zests. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the batter is completely smooth. Refrigerate at least 4 hours (overnight is best). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For each tuile, drop a heaping teaspoon of batter onto a non-stick baking sheet with a non-stick liner, leaving three inches in between. Using a small, offset spatula or the back of a spoon dipped in cold milk to prevent sticking, gently pat each mound of batter into a very thin, even 4-inch round. Bake tuiles until they are golden brown all over, 9 to 11 minutes. Using a cannoli mold and working very quickly, roll each tuile around the mold. When the tuiles have cooled, carefully slide off the mold. Tuiles may be made smaller to form around mini tuile molds. Using a piping bag fitted with a star tip, fill each tuile shell with buttercream. Garnish with fresh seasonal fruit. Place egg whites and sugar in a stainless steel mixing bowl. Set bowl in a pot of simmering water, whisking constantly, until hot to the touch. Place whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.

Put the Buffalo sauce, sweet chili sauce, honey and butter in a saucepan and bring to a simmer; simmer for 10 minutes. Toss the chicken in the sauce, season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.<br> Whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl for the egg wash and set aside.<br> Take a wonton wrapper (cover the rest with a damp towel) and put a small amount of the chicken mixture--about 2 level tablespoons--in the middle of it. Add a few pieces of blue cheese crumbles, being careful not to go too far outside of the middle of the wonton--we don&#39;t want the cheese to ooze out when frying. Next, brush all 4 corners with the egg wash, then seal the corners by pinching each opposite corner together to make that famous wonton shape; make sure there are no holes for the filling to leak out. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Now in the fryer they go! Fry the wontons in batches until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes total. Drain briefly on a rack or paper towel-lined plate.

Whisk in 3 tablespoons olive oil. Combine the yeast mixture and 3 cups of the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix with a wooden spoon just until the dough comes together, then switch to the dough hook and knead on medium-high speed until smooth and stretchy, about 5 minutes. The dough should form a loose, somewhat sticky ball on the dough hook, but won&#39;t entirely clean the sides of the bowl. (If the dough doesn&#39;t form a ball at all, add tablespoons of flour, up to 1/4 cups.) Brush a quarter-sheet pan with 2 tablespoons oil. Add the dough, then turn to coat and press to almost fill the pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, depending on the temperature of your room. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Uncover the dough and gently press all of the way to the edges of the pan. Brush the top of the dough with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. If you&#39;d like to make a vertical landscape, turn the pan with the short side facing you. For decoration: Start with a layer of seeds on the bottom. Using asparagus, long chives and scallion greens, add your tall stems first, then cover those at the bottom with shorter sprigs of herbs to make some ground cover. Add some butterflies, made with horizontal slices of baby bell peppers and chive antennae. Once you&#39;re happy with the arrangement, press down on the decorations to make sure they stick to the dough. Use your finger to gently dimple the dough in the space where you haven&#39;t decorated. Brush lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the focaccia is risen and the top and bottom are golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before removing from the pan.

Add the onions and garlic and cook until very soft, but not brown, about 10 minutes. Add the beans and 1/4 cup reserved liquid from the can and season well with salt and pepper. Raise heat to medium-high and continue cooking until beans begin to break down, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly and transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree, drizzling in more reserved liquid, if needed, until it is the consistency of thick hummus. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer to a wide, tall glass and drizzle with additional basil oil before serving. To serve, stand the celery stalks upright in the dip.

In a large saute pan, heat the oil and sear the pork loin on all sides. Remove pork to a utility platter and coat liberally with mustard, then roll in Smokey Rotisserie Seasoning. Leave refrigerated for a couple of hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large saucepan, bring the 5 cups vegetable stock (for the rice) to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Transfer the pork loin to a covered roasting pan and slowly roast in the oven until fork tender, about 45 minutes. Allow pork loin to rest for 8 to 10 minutes before slicing. While the pork is in the oven, in another large saucepan or rondelle, heat the grapeseed oil and saute the chopped onion gently until translucent. Add the Arborio rice and using a wooden spoon stir to coat the rice with oil and to toast the rice in the pan. Add the white wine, bay leaves, and saffron and continue to stir to avoid sticking. Begin slowly adding the now hot vegetable broth, 1 ladle at a time, to the rice pan, stirring occasionally. This will bring out the starch in the rice. As the mixture absorbs the broth, ladle more into the pot. When all of the broth has been ladled into the rice pot, slowly simmer until rice begins to soften. Reduce the heat and gently stir in the chives, Parmesan, and crabmeat, trying not to break up the lumps of crab. Remove from heat when it is slightly undercooked and set aside. Rice will continue to cook in covered pot. Heat the grapeseed oil in a saute pan and cook the red, yellow and green bell peppers and onion until al dente. Add the red wine and let it reduce by half. Pour in 1/2 cup vegetable stock and let reduce again. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Remove pan from heat and whisk in butter to finish sauce.

Pulse quickly until the butter is the size of peas. Add very cold, ice water in a small stream until the dough just comes together. Empty the work bowl out onto waxed paper and halve the dough. Using the ends of the paper, shape into 2 balls. Wrap in plastic wrap and place in refrigerator until ready for use. Make caramelized onion: In a skillet heat the olive oil until hot and cook the onions, stirring constantly, until golden. Remove from heat and let cool, set aside. To assemble tartlettes: Take 8 small pie tins, brush with butter and liberally sprinkle with corn meal. Cut dough into 8 equal pieces and put 7 back in the refrigerator (must be kept cold) roll out the dough into a 4-inch circle, it should be quite thick, you don&#39;t want it too thin or the tomatoes will bleed through bottom. Place disk in pie tin and repeat until all 8 are done. Place dough in tins on baking sheets. Preheat oven on to 375 degrees F. Brush bottoms of dough shell with 1 teaspoon of mustard. In the following order place into each shell: 2 tablespoons of shredded cheddar cheese, 1 tablespoon caramelized onion, 4 slices of tomato, salt and pepper, and 1 teaspoon of olive oil.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Combine the thyme, scallions, garlic, scotch bonnet cl and bell pepper in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped (take care not to make a smooth puree). Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the beef, and cook, stirring, until slightly brown, about 2 minutes. Add the pepper mixture, curry powder and allspice, and cook, stirring, until the beef is deeply browned and the filling is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the oil. Season the filling with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and let the filling cool completely. Taste the filling and adjust the seasoning with more salt as needed. Roll each sheet of puff pastry to about 1/8 inch thick. Using a 4-inch football or oval-shaped cutter, stamp out 8 ovals of dough from each sheet; reserve the dough scraps. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the beef mixture onto the center of half the dough ovals and brush the edges with egg mixture. Top each oval with a second dough oval and crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Transfer the patties to the prepared baking sheets. From the dough scraps, cut sixteen 2-by-1/8-inch strips and forty-eight 1-by-1/8-inch strips, using a paring knife or pizza cutter. Arrange the long strips lengthwise across the center of each oval then arrange 3 short strips crosswise over the long strips to form the laces of a football. So as not to disturb the placement of the laces, carefully brush the tops of the ovals with egg mixture. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve with barbecue sauce, chutney or ranch dressing for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 42863,&quot;Pork Tenderloin Nachos with Mornay Sauce, Avocado-Corn Relish, Charred Jalapeno and Goat Cheese Canola oil, for deep frying 6 blue corn tortillas, cut into strips 6 flour tortillas, cut into quarters 1 tablespoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons ancho chili powder 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon pasilla chili powder 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 teaspoons allspice 2 teaspoons cl de arbol 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin, split in half 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 to 2 1/2 cups whole milk, heated 12 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch cl de arbol 2 ripe Hass avocados, diced 2 ears corn, roasted in husks and grilled, kernels removed 1 Charred Jalapeno, seeded and finely diced, recipe follows Juice of 1 lime 1/2 small red onion, finely diced Splash olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish 6 jalapenos 2 teaspoons canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Pickled red onions, for garnish 4 ounces soft goat cheese, cut into small pieces Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: For the tortilla chips: Heat oil in a deep fryer to 340 to 350 degrees F. Fry the tortillas, in batches, until firm. Drain on paper towels and season immediately with salt. For the new mexican rubbed pork tenderloin: Combine the ancho chili powder, sugar, pasilla chili powder, salt, allspice, cl de arbol, cinnamon and some black pepper in a small bowl. Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat. Sprinkle the pork with salt on both sides, and then dredge in the spice rub, tapping off any excess. Sear the pork on all sides until golden brown, and then continue cooking to medium doneness or when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135 to 140 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before thinly slicing. For the mornay sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook 1 minute. Slowly whisk in 2 cups of the warm milk, bring to a boil and continue whisking until the sauce thickens and the flour taste has been cooked out, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the Monterey Jack a handful at a time. Continue whisking until smooth, adding more milk if too thick. Whisk in the Parmigiano-Reggiano and season with salt, black pepper and cl de arbol. Set aside. For the avocado-corn relish: Combine the avocado, corn, jalapeno, lime juice, onions and olive oil in a bowl. Season with salt and black pepper, and fold in the cilantro.

For assembly: Arrange the tortilla chips on a large platter in a single layer. Top each chip with a heaping teaspoon of the avocado-corn relish, a slice of pork and some of the Mornay sauce. Garnish with the sliced charred jalapenos, pickled red onions, a dollop of the goat cheese and cilantro leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Rioja]&quot; 42864,&quot;Fondue Vudu 1 clove garlic, halved 1 (12-ounce) bottle hard apple cider 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon brandy Pinch kosher salt 5 ounces (2 cups) Gruyere, grated 5 ounces (2 cups) Smoked Gouda, rind removed, grated 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon curry powder Several grinds fresh ground black pepper Instructions: Rub inside of fondue pot or heavy small saucepan with garlic. Pour cider into pot. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, the brandy and salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, grate the cheese and toss well with the cornstarch in a large bowl. When the cider just begins to simmer, gradually add the cheese a handful at a time, allowing each addition to melt completely before adding the next. Continue adding cheese and stirring until all cheese is incorporated, about 3 minutes. If mixture starts to bubble, reduce heat to low. The mixture is ready when creamy and easily coats the back of a spoon. Stir in curry powder and pepper. If cheese seems stringy, add some or all of the remaining lemon juice. Move fondue pot to alcohol warmer, and keep stirring during service. A variety of breads, from pumpernickel to rye to bagel chunks can be skewered and dipped as can cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms and potatoes. (Soften all vegetables by blanching briefly in boiling water then chilling.) Crisp fruits such as apples make great fondue fodder, as do cooked meats and sausages. Even soft pretzels make for good dipping. If any fondue is left over, cover with ice water and refrigerate, pour off water and reheat over low heat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 42865,&quot;Aloha L.A.

Generously butter a 12-cup bundt pan (use all the butter; it may seem like a lot, but the potatoes need it to stick to the sides of the pan and to crisp up). Thinly slice the potatoes on a mandoline (they need to be thin enough to easily bend when folded). Starting on the bottom of the pan lay the potatoes in a slightly overlapping formation, sticking to the butter, until the entire pan is covered in one layer of potatoes. Stir together the heavy cream, Parmesan, garlic, rosemary, scallions, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a large bowl. Toss the remaining potatoes in the cream mixture until well coated.<br> Using a quarter of the potatoes, layer them in a circular formation, slightly overlapping in the bottom of the pan. Top with 8 pieces of the Cheddar in a slightly overlapping circle. Repeat two more times. Top with the remaining quarter of the potatoes so that all of the cheese is covered.

Set aside to let the flavors marry for about 10 minutes. For the rolls: Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss the rice noodles with the sesame oil. Fill a pie pan with warm tap water. Working with one wrapper at a time, soak the rice paper in the warm water for about 30 seconds or until pliable. Lay a few pieces of cilantro and basil across the center of the wrapper. Top the herbs with some crab, followed by some of the red pepper and cucumber. Top with approximately 1/3 cup of the dressed rice noodles. Roll the edge closest to you over the filling, pulling tightly. Fold in the ends and continue to roll to seal. Store on a tray with a damp paper towel. Continue with the remaining wrappers and filling. Serve with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 42899,&quot;Bugia, or Liar&#39;s Cookies 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting work surface 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons sugar 2 large eggs 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled briefly 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1 1/2 tablespoons brandy 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 teaspoon ground anise seeds 4 to 6 cups peanut or vegetable oil, for deep-frying About 2 cups powdered sugar Instructions: Sift the flour with the baking powder, salt, and sugar and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix together the eggs, butter, orange juice, brandy, vanilla, and anise seeds until well blended. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and adheres to the paddle. Remove the dough from the bowl onto a floured board. Knead by hand until smooth. Form the dough into a ball, flatten slightly, and place in a bowl. Cover with a tea towel and chill at least 2 hours or up to overnight to allow the dough to relax. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, cut the dough into 4 or 6 equal pieces. Keeping the dough and work surface well floured, pass the dough through the widest setting of a pasta machine 3 or 4 times. Then pass through successively narrower settings until the dough is almost thin enough to see through; depending on your pasta machine, this will probably be the next to thinnest setting. Cut the dough into long strips 3 inches wide, then cut the strips on the diagonal into pieces about 3 inches long. If the dough tears, cut it off and work it back into the dough. The cookies curl when they fry, so fancier shapes are not important. As the cookies are cut, transfer them to baking sheets lined with flour-dusted tea towels, and cover with tea towels so they won&#39;t dry out before frying. Fry in batches, turning once, until puffed and golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. While the cookies are still hot, dust them well with powdered sugar. Wait for a few minutes while the oil and heat absorb and melt most of this first coating. Dust well a second time until the cookies are quite white. The cookies will keep for a week or so in an airtight container. You may need to re-dust them with sugar before serving. Only a few cookies at a time will fit, even in a big pot, so frying takes time. It is best to have company in the kitchen, ready with lots of good talk to keep you amused. And there are always the warm cookies to eat along the way as a reward. You can also dredge the cookies in granulated sugar, crystal sugar, or even a mix of powdered sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 42900,&quot;Preserved Lemons 12 lemons 1 cup kosher salt Fresh squeezed lemon juice 1 Tbsp pickling salt Instructions: Sterilize a 1-quart glass preserving jar with boiling water right before filling with lemons.

Place a rack over a large baking sheet. Cut the 2 ends off the eggplant. Cut the eggplants lengthwise, into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange eggplant slices onto rack. Sprinkle with sea salt to help remove excess moisture and any bitterness from the eggplants. Set aside for about 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse off the salt from the eggplants and pat dry with a towel. Spray hot grill pan liberally with vegetable spray and then place eggplant slices on the grill until lightly browned on each side and tender, about 4 minutes per side. Remove slices from the grill pan and allow to cool. In a large bowl, beat eggs until lightly scrambled. Mix the ricotta in with the egg. Add mozzarella, 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and toasted pine nuts and gently combine. Fold in basil just to combine. Do not overmix. Place a tablespoon of the cheese mixture on 1 end of the eggplant and roll up tightly. Place the eggplant rollatini into a greased (with olive oil) 13 by 9-inch baking dish, seam side down. Continue with remaining eggplant. Evenly distribute the tomato sauce on top of the eggplant rollatini. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with remaining 5 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and bake for 15 minutes. When cooked, drizzle the top with extra-virgin olive oil. In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium high heat.

Blend, scraping down the sides occasionally, until smooth. Transfer the batter to a bowl; cover and let sit 1 hour. Make the filling: Whisk the sugar, eggs, cornstarch, pie spice, vanilla and salt in a medium bowl. Combine the milk and pumpkin in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking, until steaming. Gradually whisk in the egg mixture and bring to a boil, whisking constantly, until very thick. Strain the filling through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, pushing it through with a rubber spatula. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface and refrigerate 2 hours. Beat the heavy cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Working in three batches, fold the whipped cream into the filling until combined. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Make the crepes: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot; lightly brush with melted butter. Add about 3 tablespoons batter and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook until the crepe is dry on the bottom and set on top, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip and cook 30 more seconds. Invert onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter to make about 20 crepes, brushing the pan with more butter and stacking the crepes as you go. (Don&#39;t worry if a few tear; they can be layered in the center of the cake.) Assemble the cake: Lay a crepe on a plate or cake stand and spread with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pumpkin filling, spreading it to the edges. Top with another crepe and repeat with another layer of the pumpkin filling. Layer the remaining crepes and filling, ending with a crepe. Refrigerate the cake at least 6 hours or overnight. Make the ganache: Put the chocolate in a small bowl. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming, then pour over the chocolate. Let sit 5 minutes, then whisk until melted and smooth. (If the chocolate is not fully melted, microwave in 15-second intervals.) Let sit until thickened but still pourable, about 5 minutes. Pour the ganache over the crepe cake, letting the excess drip down the side, then gently smooth the top with a small offset spatula. Let the chocolate set, about 15 minutes.

For clean slices, run a sharp knife under hot water and wipe dry before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Brachetto]&quot; 42912,&quot;Stuffed Peppers 2 cups canned whole San Marzano tomatoes (with liquid from the can) 1/4 cup diced yellow onion<br> 4 cloves garlic<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br> 1 cup canned diced San Marzano tomatoes<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 1/2 pound orzo pasta<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br> 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed 1 cup canned diced San Marzano tomatoes<br> 1 cup shredded Parmesan<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil<br> Fresh ground black pepper<br> 6 red or yellow bell peppers<br> Shredded mozzarella, for sprinkling<br> 4 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 pounds broccoli rabe<br> 1/4 cup grapeseed oil<br> 1 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper<br> Instructions: For the tomato sauce: Combine the whole tomatoes and liquid from the can, onion, 2 cloves of the garlic, basil, oregano, olive oil, salt and black pepper in a 2-gallon container and puree with an immersion blender until smooth. Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke. Reduce the heat to medium and add the grapeseed oil and remaining 2 cloves of garlic and quickly saute. Add the diced tomatoes and saute until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the pureed tomato sauce and bring to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes and remove from the heat. For the stuffed peppers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring 1 gallon water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil in a 2-gallon pot. Add the pasta and stir continually for the first 2 minutes of cooking to make sure it doesn&#39;t stick, then stir occasionally until the pasta is cooked to al dente, about 9 minutes. Strain the pasta, spread it on a cookie sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Mix to coat and refrigerate until cold. Heat a saute pan over medium heat and add the grapeseed oil and sausage. Cook the sausage, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up the chunks, until browned and fully cooked, about 15 minutes. Remove from the pan, spread on a cookie sheet and refrigerate until cold. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the orzo and sausage in a mixing bowl with the diced tomatoes, Parmesan and basil. Season with salt and black pepper. Cut the top off each bell pepper and remove the seeds and ribs from the inside. Trim the bottom of each pepper so it will sit upright on the plate. Stuff the peppers with the sausage mixture and top with the mozzarella. Arrange in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil, return the peppers to the oven and bake until tender, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow the peppers to sit for 5 minutes. For the broccoli rabe: Combine 2 gallons of water and 4 tablespoons salt in a large pot and bring to a boil. Prepare an ice bath for shocking the broccoli rabe. Add half of the broccoli rabe to the water and cook until al dente, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the broccoli rabe from the water and shock in the ice bath. Bring the water to back up to a boil and repeat with the rest of the broccoli rabe. Remove the broccoli rabe from the ice bath and pat dry with a towel. For plating: Reheat the tomato sauce to a simmer over medium heat. Heat a saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke. Add the grapeseed oil and then add the blanched broccoli rabe. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes and then season with the black pepper and 2 teaspoons of the salt. Pool about 4 ounces of the tomato sauce on 6 plates. Divide the broccoli rabe among the plates, putting it in the center of the plate and making the pile flat so you can place the stuffed pepper on top. Place the stuffed pepper on top of the broccoli rabe and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 42913,&quot;Sugar Crust Poundcake with Sherry Sauce 3 sticks butter, softened 3 cups sugar 8 eggs 3 cups cake flour 2 eggs 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup dry sherry Pinch of salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.

Boneless Duckling Breast 14- to 16-ounce boneless duck breast Sea salt Pepper, made of equal parts red, white, black, pink and green peppercorns Instructions: Take the boneless duckling breast and place on a cutting board skin side down. Trim back with a sharp knife the skin and fat about 1/4-inch past the meat all around. Turn the breast over so the skin side is now facing up. Score the breast on the skin side, cutting diagonally approximately six times each way so as to form squares. DO NOT cut all the way through the fat, you don&#39;t want to pierce the meat. This actually helps the breast render the fat off very quickly and keeps the duckling meat from cooking too fast. Season both sides of the duckling breast to your taste with sea salt and the ground pepper mixture-1 part pepper to 5 parts salt and rub in lightly. Place the duckling skin side down in a hot skillet-over medium heat for about 10 minutes. This will let the fat render off and brown the skin-make sure the fat has rendered off. Take the breast out of the skillet and place on the grill meat side down on medium heat for about 5 more minutes. Take the duckling off the grill and let rest about 15 minutes, this allows the meat to tenderize. Place the duckling breast skin side down, slicing on the bias. The grilled duckling breast may simply be served this way, fanned out on a plate, or put atop of greens with a vinaigrette style dressing, or drizzled with your favorite fruit based sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 42943,&quot;Mediterranean Chicken Orzo 16 ounces orzo pasta 2 packages Tyson Grilled and Ready Breast Fillets 1/2 cup diced oil-packed sundried tomatoes 1/2 cup halved, pitted Kalamata olives 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese Pinch salt and ground black pepper Instructions:</p><ol><li>Cook orzo pasta according to package directions.

Put the bowl in a warm, not hot or cool, place until the yeast is bubbling and aromatic, at least 15 minutes. In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, 1/2 cup olive oil and the yeast mixture on low speed. Once the dough has come together, continue to knead for 5 to 6 minutes on a medium speed until it becomes smooth and soft. Give it a sprinkle of flour if the dough is really sticky and tacky. Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly floured surface, then knead it by hand 1 or 2 times. Again, give it another sprinkle of flour if the dough is really sticky and tacky. Coat the inside of the mixer bowl lightly with olive oil and return the dough to the bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour. Coat a jelly roll pan with the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil. (Chef&#39;s Note: This may seem excessive, but focaccia is an oily crusted bread. This is why it is soooooooooo delicious!). Put the dough onto the jelly roll pan and begin pressing it out to fit the size of the pan. Turn the dough over to coat the other side with the olive oil. Continue to stretch the dough to fit the pan. As you are doing so, spread your fingers out and make finger holes all the way through the dough. (Chef&#39;s Note: Yes, this is strange. But when the dough rises again it will create the characteristic craggy looking focaccia. If you do not make the actual holes in the dough, the finished product will be very smooth.) Put the dough in the warm place until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour. While the dough is rising a second time, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Liberally sprinkle the top of the focaccia with some coarse sea salt and lightly drizzle a little oil on top. Bake the dough until the top of the loaf is golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the focaccia from the oven and let it cool before cutting and serving.

Stir in remaining 1/3 cup water, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 3/4 cups flour, cornmeal, and salt and blend until the mixture forms a dough. Knead dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour, as necessary, to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth about 5 to 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball. Lightly oil the sides and bottom of a large bowl with oil, add the dough, turn to coat in the oil, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Gently punch the dough down and divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 10-inch circle that is 1/8-inch thick. Brush off excess flour and transfer the dough to a baking sheet, cover each circle of dough with plastic wrap and continue stacking rolled out pieces on top of each other.

Light a charcoal fire in a covered grill and set it up for indirect grilling: When the temperature reaches 225 degrees, carefully push the hot coals to one side and place a drip pan filled with 1 cup of water on the opposite side. Alternatively, bring a smoker to 225 degrees. Put the ribs on the grill over the drip pan, overlapping them slightly, and cover the grill; you&#39;ll need to cook the ribs for about 4 hours total, or until the meat pulls away from the bones and is very tender. Maintain the temperature at 225 degrees by replenishing the charcoal with a fresh batch of burning coals every hour. Every hour, drain 1/2 cup of the wood chips and scatter them over the hot coals. Add water to the drip pan when half of it is evaporated. After 1 1/2 hours, spray the baby back ribs with the Cider Mop spray and rotate them on the grill; repeat spraying every 45 minutes.<br> Remove the drip pan and spread the coals in an even layer. Replenish with fresh coals to make a medium-hot fire. Dilute the Sweet and Sticky Barbecue Sauce with 1/2 cup water. Brush sauce over ribs and cook for 30 minutes, turning often. Repeat brushing 4 or 5 times to build a sticky glaze. Transfer the ribs to a carving board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut between each rib and serve. (If you would like to prepare them ahead, the glazed ribs can be refrigerated overnight. Serve cold or reheat in a 325 degrees oven.) In a blender, puree the chopped garlic, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, onion and water. The marinade can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. In a small bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients.

Toss the garlic and habaneros with the cubed meat and fat in a large bowl. Combine salt, pepper, cilantro, coriander, paprika, onion powder and red pepper together in a bowl, then distribute over the meat mixture and mix by hand to make sure all the meat is well coated. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or up to 2 days. Grind meat mixture with medium die on a meat grinder to create sausage blend. Add peach puree and ice water and incorporate by hand until evenly distributed. Combine fontina cheese with sausage blend and mix thoroughly by hand to ensure even distribution. Refrigerate until sausage is below 40 degrees, at least 2 hours. Prepare hog casings by rinsing and soaking for 30 minutes in tepid water prior to stuffing. Stuff the sausage mixture into prepared hog casings and coil or link to desired size. You may choose to separate the links at this point or leave them linked. Hang or lay on a drying rack in the refrigerator for a minimum of 6 hours, or up to overnight. This lets the casings dry out to form pellicle, which aids in smoke absorption. Heat a smoker to 225 degrees F. Smoke sausage using wood of your choice until an internal temperature of 150 degrees F is reached, about 45 minutes. Rest 15 minutes.

Finish with vinaigrette and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 42961,&quot;Roasted Winter Squash About 3 pounds butternut squash (preferably 1 large squash) Gray salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage leaves 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup dark unsulfured molasses 2 teaspoons Toasted Spice Rub, recipe follows 1/4 cup fennel seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon peppercorns 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1/4 cup (1-ounce) pure California chili powder 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown, pull the pan off the heat and immediately add the sage, sugar, vinegar (stand back so as not to get splattered), molasses and toasted spice rub. Mix well and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors. Pour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well, then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny. Working in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Use immediately, refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. Serving suggestions: Serve the puree on its own as a side dish for roast chicken, turkey, or pork; stir into polenta just before the end of cooking; use as a stuffing for ravioli; make into a soup; or use to flavor pastina. Or omit the sage, season with ground cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg to taste, and use as a substitute for canned pumpkin in your favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Variation for Smoky Butternut Squash: Cook the prepared squash on a baking sheet in a covered grill with soaked chips to give a slightly smoky taste. Substitute in any of the recipes that call for roasted squash. If cooking kabocha, acorn, or other difficult-to-peel squash, cut in half, scoop out the seeds, and rub the insides and cut edges with the vinegar/molasses mixture. Place on a baking sheet, cut sides up, and roast at 400 degrees F until tender. Scoop out and puree. Toasted Spice Rub: Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put mixture into a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. Chef&#39;s notes: Toasting freshens spices, releases their oils, and makes them more fragrant, as well as adding a new dimension of flavor. Taste your chili powder before adding and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chilies are almost sweet, not hot. Yield: about 1 cup &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>Note: The wine pairing suggestions are based on the general flavor profiles of the wines and the dish.

Gently scrape out seeds and membrane and discard. Using a melon baller, scoop out rounds from flesh and place in large bowl. Discard skin. Keep the prosciutto loosely covered with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out as you start to assemble 1 purse at a time. Place 1 melon ball in the center of a prosciutto slice, gather all sides to the top and secure with a blanched chive. It may be necessary to overlap a few pieces of prosciutto in order to completely wrap the melon ball. Place finished purse, seam side down onto a baking sheet and keep covered. Repeat with remaining prosciutto and melons. Can make it only up to 2 hours ahead of time because the salt in the prosciutto will break down the melon. Scatter the chives onto a decorative platter. Place prosciutto purses on top and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 42964,&quot;Warm Chickpea Salad with Shallots and Red Wine Vinaigrette 1 large or 2 medium shallots, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt or kosher salt, plus more for serving 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained 1 large carrot, peeled and coarsely grated 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the shallots, vinegar, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.

Top with some mu shu chicken, sesame seeds and scallions. Add cilantro leaves if desired. Roll up like a crepe and serve with Sriracha if desired. In a medium glass mixing bowl, whisk the flours, salt, 1 cup water, the sesame oil and eggs; the batter should be smooth and free of lumps.<br> Heat a crepe pan or 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Very lightly coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Ladle in 1/4 cup of the batter. Gently rotate the skillet for a few seconds, swirling the batter to create a thin, even layer over the bottom. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons scallions to each pancake at this point. Cook the pancake until the underside is pale and just firmed up, about 1 minute.<br> Flip the pancake over and cook for another 30 seconds. Remove from the skillet and transfer to a plate and cover with a kitchen towel. Continue with the rest of the batter until all the pancakes have been made.

Rub all over the turkey, inside and out, and under the skin of the breast and legs where accessible, being careful to not tear the skin. Place on a sheet tray fitted with a rack or in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Place in the refrigerator, uncovered, for 2 days. Bring the turkey out of the fridge 1 to 2 hours before cooking to temper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the butter, minced thyme and lemon zest in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Place the turkey on a work surface. Spread the butter under the skin of the turkey around the legs and breasts, as evenly as possible. Stuff the cavity with the quartered lemons, apple, shallots and sprigs of thyme. Tie the legs closed with kitchen twine. Place the onions, carrots, celery and garlic at the bottom of a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Place the turkey on the rack. Roast, basting every 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the leg (do not touch bone) reads 155 to 160 degrees F, 12 to 14 minutes per pound, or 2 to 3 hours. Allow the turkey to rest for 90 minutes. For the gravy: Meanwhile, strain the drippings and juices from the roasting pan into a bowl. Discard the vegetables. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until the raw flavor is cooked off, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cider vinegar and soy sauce for depth. Slowly whisk the strained drippings into the flour to avoid clumps. Simmer until the gravy just coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. (The gravy will not be a heavy thick gravy, but rather a light gravy.) Season to taste. Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43034,&quot;Mango Mojito Pudding 2 cups milk 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 2 eggs, whisked<br> Splash rum<br> 1 cup crushed cookies 1 tablespoon melted butter<br> 2 teaspoons sugar<br> Pinch salt<br> 1 tablespoon butter 1 ripe mango, diced<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br> 1/4 cup rum<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint, plus leaves for garnish 4 egg whites 1 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> 2 teaspoons sugar Instructions: For the pudding: Whisk together the milk, sugar and flour in a small saucepot; bring to a simmer.

Put a lid on top, bring to a boil for a couple of minutes, then remove the lid and simmer for a few more minutes until you get a thick compote consistency. While the compote is stewing, we&#39;ll make some lovely crisp wafers. Sieve the icing sugar and cinnamon onto a clean work surface. Cut 4 slices about 1/2-inch thick off your pastry and place them flat on your dusted work surface. Pop the rest of your pastry in the fridge or freezer for another day. Roll each slice out to 1/4-inch thick, turning it over as you go so it gets covered in the icing sugar mixture. Cut the strips in half diagonally - you&#39;ll end up with long, triangular shapes. Preheat a large, nonstick frying pan and fry the pastry triangles, in 2 batches, on each side until golden brown. Leave to cool on a rack. Mix the yogurt, orange zest and honey together. To serve, dollop a spoonful of yogurt into each serving glass, followed by a spoonful of rhubarb compote. Continue layering the yogurt and compote until the glass is full, then stick a puff pastry triangle in the top. Alternatively, layer up the yogurt, rhubarb and pastry triangles on individual plates.

Add the garlic and red chili flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, bring to boil, season with salt and pepper and cook until the sauce is reduced and thickened, about 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in the parsley and basil. For the Bolognese Sauce: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season the shanks on both sides with salt and pepper, place in the pan and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the shanks to a plate. Remove fat from the pan. Add the pancetta to the pan and cook until golden brown. Remove pancetta with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic to the pan and cook until soft and lightly golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the red wine, scrape the bottom of the pan and cook until completely reduced. Add the beef stock, diced tomatoes, thyme, rosemary and parsley and bring to a simmer. Add the shanks and 1/3 of the pancetta back to the pan, cover and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is tender and falling off the bone, about 2 hours. Remove the shanks to a cutting board and when cool enough to handle, shred the meat into bite-size pieces and place in a bowl. Strain the cooking liquid into a bowl. Place 3 cups of the cooking liquid into a large high-sided saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced to about 3/4 cup. Add the shredded meat and the remaining cooked pancetta to the pan along with 1 cup of the tomato sauce, parsley and basil and stir to combine and just heat through. For the Ricotta Mixture: Stir together the ricotta, eggs, parsley, basil, cheese and salt and pepper in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to meld. For the Bechamel (Mornay) Sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and let cook for about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in 2 cups of the hot milk and continue whisking until the sauce is thickened and loses its raw flavor, about 5 to 7 minutes. Season the sauce with nutmeg, salt and pepper and whisk in the cheeses. If the sauce is too thick, whisk in some of the remaining milk. For Assembly: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with the butter. Ladle a thin layer of bechamel evenly over the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of pasta dough, cut to fit the inside of the pan on top of the bechamel and top the pasta with the ricotta mixture and spread evenly. Spread a thin layer of bechamel over the ricotta, sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan and some basil leaves. Top with another layer of pasta and spread the Bolognese sauce evenly over the top. Ladle an even layer of bechamel over the Bolognese sauce, sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan and some basil leaves. Place the final layer of pasta dough over the meat mixture and ladle the bechamel over the top to completely cover the pasta and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of Parmesan. Place the pan on a baking sheet and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F, remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 25 to 35 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and let rest 10 minutes before cutting. Cut into slices and top with some of the remaining tomato sauce, more grated cheese and chopped parsley and basil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 43058,&quot;Roasted Tomatillo Salsa 2 pounds fresh tomatillos, husked and well rinsed 2 fresh jalapeno peppers<br> 1 medium white onion, quartered<br> 4 tablespoons olive oil 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled<br> 1/2 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves<br> Juice of 1/2 lime<br> Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Add the onion, celery, carrot, and cinnamon stick and saute until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken stock and the coriander, if using, and bring to a boil. Simmer for several minutes. Stir in the squash until smooth, then simmer gently to let the flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick. Puree the soup in a blender until smooth. (The soup can be made ahead to this point, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for several days or frozen for about 1 month. It will thicken as it cools and may need thinning with stock or water when reheating.) Return the soup to the pan and reheat gently. Add the half-and-half, if using. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm until service. To serve: Ladle the soup into serving bowls. Garnish evenly, with the cheese and pumpkin seeds, if desired. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown, pull the pan off the heat and immediately add the sage, sugar, vinegar (stand back so as not to get splattered), molasses and toasted spice rub. Mix well and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors. Pour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well, then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny. Working in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Use immediately, refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. Serving suggestions: Serve the puree on its own as a side dish for roast chicken, turkey, or pork; stir into polenta just before the end of cooking; use as a stuffing for ravioli; make into a soup; or use to flavor pastina. Or omit the sage, season with ground cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg to taste, and use as a substitute for canned pumpkin in your favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put mixture into a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43075,&quot;Panko Crusted Chicken Sandwich with Four cl Aioli 4 boneless chicken breasts 6 cups panko crumbs 2 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes 1 bunch parsley, leaves only, chopped 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 whole eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water Salt and pepper Canola oil, for frying 4 leaves red leaf lettuce 4 slices tomato 4 small pain de campagne 1 jalapeno, chopped 1 serrano cl, chopped 1 dried Thai bird cl, ground 1 teaspoon Korean red pepper flakes 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 1 egg yolk* 1 1/2 cups canola oil Sugar, to taste Salt and pepper, to taste 3 baking potatoes, like russets, washed, and thinly sliced Canola oil, for deep frying Salt Instructions: In a large mixing bowl, combine the panko, red pepper flakes, parsley, salt and pepper.
