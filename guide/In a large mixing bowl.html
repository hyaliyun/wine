Reserve the fudge package for another use. Using an electric mixer with whisk attachment, whisk until well combined, about 3 minutes. Into another mixing bowl, add ricotta cheese, 4 eggs, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and 3/4 cup of granulated sugar. Add chocolate chips. Whisk until well combined, about 2 minutes. Pour 2/3 cup of the cake batter into the pan. Add cocoa powder to the remaining batter and pour over the batter in the pan. Gently swirl in the cocoa batter creating a marble look. Pour the ricotta mixture over the batter and place the pan on middle rack in the oven. Bake for 1 hour. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is cooked. Remove cake from oven and set aside to completely cool. To make the frosting, in a large bowl, add package of chocolate pudding and cold milk. Using an electric mixer, whisk until thick and glossy, about 1 minute. Gently fold in prepared whipped cream until well combined. When cake is completely cool, carefully transfer it to a decorative serving platter. Spread frosting evenly over the top of the cake and serve. Store leftovers in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 5563,&quot;Ricotta Gnocchi with Delta Asparagus and Meyer Lemon 16 ounces ricotta Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 bunch medium asparagus, woody stems removed<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 Meyer lemon, zested<br> 1/4 cup chicken stock (vegetable stock or water may be substituted)<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter (olive oil may be substituted)<br> Instructions: Line a colander with 4 layers of cheesecloth, then add the ricotta. Tie the corners shut. Let sit over a bowl so that the liquid can run out, refrigerated, 8 hours or overnight. Place a large pot of water on the stove; salt as you would for pasta and bring to a boil. Place the drained ricotta and 1/4 cup Parmesan in a large bowl. Add the eggs and whisk vigorously for a minute or two. Add a pinch of salt, a little pepper, and fold in the flour, a couple tablespoons at a time, just until incorporated. Turn the water down to a gentle boil, and with two spoons, form the batter into football shapes, then drop directly into the boiling water. (You will have to process the batter in two to three batches as you can cook about 12 gnocchi at a time.) Cook, stirring to flip them over, until the gnocchi float to the top and are firm to the touch, about 2 minutes. The gnocchi are delicate, so gently remove from the water and place on a sheet tray or baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and set aside. Peel the ends of the asparagus, then thinly slice. Place 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat and add the asparagus. Sweat until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the zest, chicken stock and butter, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Reheat the gnocchi by carefully adding to the asparagus mixture and let heat for a minute or 2. Place in a large serving bowl and top with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 5564,&quot;Pittsburgh Cheese Steak 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1/4 cup superfine sugar 1 tablespoon grated Spanish onion 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1/2 teaspoon celery seeds 1/2 teaspoon celery salt Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup canola oil 1/2 medium head cabbage, finely shredded 1 large carrot, shredded 1 pint cherry tomatoes Canola oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 Yukon gold potatoes, parcooked and sliced crosswise (1/4-inch thick) Canola oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 boneless rib-eye, 1 1/2-inches thick (at least 1 pound each) 8 slices thinly sliced aged provolone 1 large loaf Italian bread, split in 1/2 Instructions: Whisk together the vinegar and sugar, in a large bowl, until the sugar dissolves. Add the onion, mustard, celery seed, celery salt and salt and pepper, to taste. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Add the cabbage and carrot and toss to combine. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving. Heat a grill to high. In a medium bowl toss the tomatoes in canola oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Grill until charred and softened. Remove them to a bowl, and add the garlic, onion, olive oil and thyme and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving. Heat a grill to high. Brush the potato slices with oil on both sides and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Grill on both sides until lightly golden brown and just cooked through. Brush the steak on both sides with oil and season with salt and pepper, to tastes. Grill until golden brown and charred on both sides and cooked to medium-rare doneness, about 6 minutes per side. Remove the steaks from grill to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before cutting into thin slices. Put the sliced meat on aluminum foil and top with slices of the cheese. Put back on the grill, close the cover and cook until the cheese just begins to melt, about 45 seconds. Mound meat on the bottom of the bread and top with potatoes, tomato relish and coleslaw. Cover with the top of the bread and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 5565,&quot;Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger (from about 1/2-inch piece) 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 medium carrot, grated or julienned 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced Juice of 1 lime 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 pound ground pork 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 4 cloves garlic, minced One 1 1/2-inch piece ginger, peeled and finely grated (about 1 tablespoon) 1 shallot, minced 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 head Bibb, butter or iceberg lettuce, separated into leaves Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving Fresh mint leaves, for serving 1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts, chopped Sriracha, for serving Instructions: For the scallion and carrot relish: Toss the soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, carrots, scallions and lime juice in a medium bowl. Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to serve. For the pork: Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil, and once hot, the pork. Cook the pork, breaking it up with the back of your spoon until it browns and is no longer pink, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the red pepper flakes, salt, garlic, ginger and shallots. Cook until they are aromatic and incorporated, another minute. Add the hoisin and stir to combine, then add the soy sauce. Cook until the pork is sticky and glazed, about 3 minutes. Transfer the pork to a serving bowl. Serve the pork with the lettuce leaves, some scallion and carrot relish, cilantro leaves, mint leaves, peanuts and sriracha, letting everyone build their own wraps with all the fixings. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Tempranillo]&quot; 5566,&quot;Sweet Garlic and Goat Cheese Penne 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided 1 whole head garlic 1 pound penne pasta 1 cup milk 1 shallot, minced 1/2 cup white wine 3 ounces goat cheese, crumbled 1/3 cup grated Parmesan Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 small parsley sprigs Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice the root end off the entire head of garlic and turn it upside down, wrapping it in aluminum foil and molding the foil so it supports the garlic to allow the cut end to stand upright in the oven. Pour 1 tablespoon of the olive oil on the garlic (reserving the other tablespoon) so it slips between the skin and the cloves and wrap with the foil so it is enclosed. Roast for about 1 hour and set aside until it is cool enough to handle. Bring a large pot of water to boiling for the pasta. Salt the water and boil until al dente. Drain and set aside. Heat the milk in a small saucepot and keep warm. Squeeze the garlic cloves into a small bowl and mash them. Add a small amount of the warm milk to this bowl and whisk until smooth. In a separate large saute pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over medium high heat and saute the shallot until translucent. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and allow most of the wine to evaporate, then reduce heat to low, and add the garlic mixture. Whisk the goat cheese and Parmesan into the remaining hot milk, and add this to the pan with the garlic and wine sauce and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Fold the drained pasta into the pan of sauce, transfer to serving dish and garnish with parsley sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 5567,&quot;Crayfish in a Jar 1 tablespoon sugar 2 sprigs dill 4 white peppercorn 1 cup beer 2 cups water 1 pound crayfish 1/2 cup salt Instructions: In a small saucepan bring the sugar, dill, white peppercorn, beer to a boil in 2 cups of water, add the crayfish let cook for 2 minutes, season with salt and pour into the jar and close lid.

Toss together the bell pepper, onion, scallions, oil, cl powder, cumin and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a very large bowl. Tear two 18-inch pieces of 18-inch-wide heavy duty foil. Spread the vegetable mixture on one piece of foil, leaving a few inches of exposed foil as a border. Arrange the shrimp on top of the vegetables in a single layer. Squeeze the limes over the mixture. Top with the remaining piece of foil, lining up the edges. Fold the edges and crimp tightly to make a leak-proof packet. Tear two 18-inch pieces of 18-inch-wide heavy duty foil. Arrange the tortillas, overlapping slightly, on one piece of foil. Top with the remaining piece of foil, lining up the edges. Fold the edges and crimp tightly to make another packet. Put the shrimp packet on the grill, close the grill lid and cook 12 minutes (do not turn the packet over). The packet should puff up and look like a pillow. Slide from the grill onto a baking sheet using tongs. Set aside and let rest while you heat up the tortillas. Put the tortilla pack on the grill and cook until warm, about 2 minutes per side. Carefully open the shrimp packet (hot steam will escape). The shrimp should be pink and cooked through and the onions and peppers just tender. Scatter the cilantro over the shrimp. Serve with the warm tortillas and salsa and avocado, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 5571,&quot;Margarita 2 ounces 100 percent agave silver/blanco tequila, divided 1 tablespoon kosher salt 4 limes, divided 1/2 small Hamlin or Valencia orange 2 tablespoons light agave nectar 3/4 cup ice cubes, about 3 to 4 Instructions: Pour 1/2-ounce of the tequila into a small saucer.

Melt the butter in small pot over low heat, then add the 2 cloves of chopped garlic. Let the garlic bubble for 2 minutes. In a medium bowl add the bread, 1 teaspoon dried herbes or thyme, about 1/3 palmful and the cheese. Drizzle the garlic butter over the bread mixture and arrange the croutons on parchment lined baking sheet. Bake until golden and evenly brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. Croutons may be stored in an airtight container for a couple of days in a cool place. Salt the eggplant and drain it in a colander for30 minutes to remove the bitterness from the eggplant. Meanwhile, blacken the skins of the red peppers over open flame on the stove or under a hot boiler. If broiling, leave the oven ajar to allow the steam to escape. Put the blackened peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let cool. Peel, seed and dice the peppers. While peppers cool, heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat with extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan. Add the eggplant, zucchini, remaining sliced garlic, onions, rosemary and remaining 1 teaspoon of herbes or dried thyme. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover the pot and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Crush the tomatoes by hand and add them to the pot. Stir in the red peppers and 1/2 tomato-can of water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes to concentrate the flavors. Cool and store for a make-ahead meal. To serve, bring the ratatouille back to a simmer over medium heat, covered, then uncover and stir in the balsamic vinegar. Make 4 nests or wells in the ratatouille and crack an egg into each nest.

Line a standard cupcake or muffin pan with 12 cupcake liners. Pour 1/2 cup water into a microwave-safe glass bowl and bring to a boil. In a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt and whisk until combined. Add the milk, vegetable oil, vanilla, egg and boiling water and whisk to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and continue to whisk until all the ingredients are fully incorporated. Fill the liners three-quarters full with the batter and bake until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely before frosting. For the vanilla bean cream filling: Combine the granulated sugar, salt and egg whites in the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer and set the bowl over a medium saucepan of gently simmering water. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is frothy and smooth and registers 160 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 5 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and beat on high speed with a whisk attachment until the mixture has cooled completely and formed stiff and glossy peaks, about 7 minutes. With the mixer running, add the butter one piece at a time. Continue beating until all of the butter is incorporated and the mixture looks smooth. Separate out 1 cup of the buttercream and add the vanilla bean paste. Set aside for filling the cupcakes. For the espresso buttercream: Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and espresso to the remaining buttercream and beat on low speed with a paddle attachment until smooth. For the chocolate shell: In small microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate and oil. Microwave on medium heat for 1 1/2 minutes, stirring halfway through. Cool completely before using. To assemble: Cut out a hole in each cupcake and fill with some vanilla bean cream filling. Frost each cupcake with some espresso buttercream. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes, and then dip half of each cupcake in the chocolate shell. Refrigerate again for about 10 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5577,&quot;Deep-Dish Vegan Apple Pie 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 2 tablespoons vegan granulated sugar 2 tablespoons white vinegar Fine salt 1 cup unrefined virgin or extra-virgin coconut oil 8 to 10 tablespoons ice water 4 pounds mixed apples (8 or 9), such as Golden Delicious, Granny Smith and McIntosh 2/3 cup vegan granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 4 tablespoons unrefined virgin or extra-virgin coconut oil 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon or apple-pie spice 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 tablespoons unsweetened almond or soy milk Instructions: Special equipment: a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie pan For the dough: Put the flour, sugar, vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor, and pulse to combine. Add the coconut oil in small spoonfuls, and pulse until the largest pieces are pea-size. Add 8 tablespoons ice water, and pulse until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together; it should just hold its shape. If the mixture is very powdery, pulse in an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water. Divide the dough between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap, pat each into a 1/2-inch thick discs and chill for at least 1 hour up to overnight. For the filling: Meanwhile, peel and core the apples; cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Toss with the sugar and lemon juice in a large bowl. Melt the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until the firmer apples soften but hold their shape, about 12 minutes. Add the flour, cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and stir to combine. Remove from the heat, and let cool completely. (The filling can be made up to 2 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) To assemble: To make rolling easier, let the dough soften a bitit should be slightly soft when pressedat room temperature (this may take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen). Roll 1 disc of dough out into a 13-inch round on a lightly floured surface or between two pieces of floured parchment or wax paper. If the dough gets too warm, refrigerate it to firm it up. Ease the crust into a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie pan. Add the cooled filling, mounding it slightly in the center. Roll out the remaining dough disc into a 12-inch round; place it over the filling, and press the 2 crusts together around the edges. Fold the overhanging dough under itself, and crimp as desired. Brush the top and edges with the almond milk, and sprinkle generously with sugar. Pierce the top with a knife (or make decorative cutouts) a few times to let steam escape. Chill for at least 1 hour. Position an oven rack in the lowest position in the oven, place a baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 425 degrees F; preheat for at least 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet, and lower the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake until the pie is golden and the filling is bubbly, 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes, rotating as needed. (Cover the edges with foil if they brown too quickly.) Transfer to a rack, and cool until set, about 3 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5578,&quot;Red Velvet Cupcakes 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, such as Pernigotti 2 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon baking powder Red Velvet Frosting, recipe follows 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup buttermilk, shaken 1 tablespoon liquid red food coloring 1 teaspoon white vinegar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 1/2 cups sifted confectioners&#39; sugar (3/4 pound) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Slowly pour in the boiling water, while stirring, until you have a coarse meal mixture. Stir in the cold water to form a dough. (The addition of some hot water breaks down and inhibits the formation of gluten so you can roll thin wrappers.) Lightly flour a clean work surface and knead the dough for 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky. Lightly cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes. To make the pork filling: In a large bowl, combine the cabbage and salt. Massage the salt into the cabbage for a minute or so until it begins to wilt. Squeeze excess water from the cabbage into the sink and return the cabbage to the bowl. Add the pork, chives, ginger, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar and soy sauce. Mix well to distribute the seasoning. To assemble the dumplings: Divide the dough into 24 balls. Roll them out into 4-inch circles, flouring the surface as needed. Place about 1 tablespoon filling in the center of each. Fold the two sides up to meet in the middle. Pinch the wrapper together at the center and pleat from the center outward to the bottom corners. (The dumplings can be made ahead at this point and frozen on a baking sheet. Once frozen, transfer to a plastic bag for storage in the freezer. Frozen dumplings will keep for up to a month in the freezer. Add 1 to 2 minutes to total cooking time if cooking from frozen.) When you are ready to cook the dumplings, heat a 12-inch nonstick, lidded skillet over medium heat. Add enough neutral oil to just coat the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Add half of the dumplings, flat side down, leaving a little room around each. Let cook until golden brown on the underside, about 2 minutes. Add 1/3 cup water, cover and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Uncover and cook for a few more minutes until the water evaporates (a meat thermometer carefully inserted into the potstickers should read 160 degrees F). Remove onto a plate or baking sheet and set aside while you make the salad. For the salad, whisk together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, ginger and lime juice. Add the sesame oil and neutral oil and whisk until emulsified. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the chives. Add a small amount of sambal. Whisk together. Taste and add more sambal, if desired. Set aside. Combine the romaine, cabbage, carrots, snow peas and peppers in a large shallow serving bowl. Drizzle with about a third of the dressing and toss well. Top with the potstickers. Coarsely crumble the sesame sticks over top. Drizzle sambal over the top, to taste. Garnish with the remaining 2 tablespoons chives. Serve the remaining dressing on the side for dipping extra potstickers. This salad is best eaten as soon as it is made, but leftover cooked dumplings will keep in a covered container in the fridge for a day or two. Or uncooked dumplings can be frozen, as described above. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5580,&quot;Gina&#39;s Turnip Greens 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 shallot, chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 1/2 pounds turnip greens, washed, stemmed, and chopped Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted Instructions: Heat olive oil in Dutch oven over medium heat.

Combine the panko, thyme and salt on a plate. Dip the Brie in the eggs to coat then press firmly into the panko. Dip into the eggs then the panko once more. Place on a baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. Remove the Brie from the freezer and use a sharp knife to cut parallel lines 1/4 inch deep and 1/2 inch apart across the top. Give the cheese a quarter turn and repeat cutting the lines to create a diamond pattern. Return to the freezer until solid, about 8 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the Brie from the freezer and rescore the lines to make sure they didn\u2019t seal back together from the eggs. Heat the butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until the butter is foamy and just starting to brown. Add the Brie cut-side down and cook until dark golden and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip the Brie with tongs and transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake until the crust is golden all over and the Brie is hot throughout, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, arrange the bread on a baking sheet and brush generously with olive oil.

Pulse several times to combine. Add the butter and egg yolk, process just until the dough comes together. Distribute the dough into the 13-by-4-inch tart pan (or 10-inch round). Lay plastic wrap over the dough and press it into the pan so that it is an even thickness. Remove the plastic and freeze the dough until it is firm, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cover the dough with foil and fill with pie weights or beans. This will keep the dough from slouching in the pan. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and beans, bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until the crust is a light golden color. Allow to cool to room temperature. Prepare the pastry cream: Whisk together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sugar. Add the egg yolks to the cornstarch and mix into a smooth paste. Set aside. Bring the milk, remaining 1/4 cup of the sugar, vanilla bean, and salt to a gentle simmer in a medium saucepan. Slowly, and in small amounts, whisk the hot milk into the egg mixture. Once the egg mixture is warm to the touch, pour it back into the milk in the pan. Bring the custard to a gentle boil, whisking continuously for 2 to 3 minutes. The pastry cream will thicken almost immediately, but it is important to cook the starch until it isn&#39;t grainy. When the pastry cream is done it will be smooth and glossy. Remove from the heat and add the butter and white chocolate to the pastry cream. Allow to sit for 3 minutes, then gently whisk them together. Pour the pastry cream into a shallow container. Cover with plastic wrap, pressed directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Set the container in the freezer for 15 minutes (this cools down the eggs quickly) and then refrigerate for up to a few days. Fill the cooled tart shell with the pastry cream.

Combine the salt and 1 teaspoon of sugar and place them at 1 edge of the bowl. Put the yeast on the other side. (Do not mix the yeast and the salt yet; the salt will soak up the moisture in the yeast, killing it.) Stir first the eggs, and then the beer into the flour. Mix in 3 1/2 tablespoons water, incorporating the sugar, salt and yeast as you go and working until the batter is smooth. Cover the batter with plastic and set it aside in the refrigerator to relax for at least 1 hour. Whip the egg whites until they hold soft peaks. Fold the whipped whites into the batter (this makes for lighter beignet). Heat about 2-inches of oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Slice the apple into 8 (1/2-inch) thick slices. Mix the remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar with the cinnamon. Dust the apple slices with cinnamon-sugar. Working in batches of 2 or 3, dip slices of apple into the batter then carefully drop the beignet into the hot oil. Fry the beignet until crisp and uniformly golden brown, about 4 minutes per side then drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Allow the beignet to cool for a few minutes then sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 5589,&quot;Town House® Crackers with Avocado and Mango Salsa 1 1/2 cups finely chopped mango or fresh pineapple 1 large avocado, halved, seeded, peeled and finely chopped 1 small onion, finely chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 1 tablespoon lemon juice or lime juice 1 tablespoon finely chopped jalapeno pepper (optional) 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon pepper 40 Keebler?

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[IPA, Witbier]&quot; 5618,&quot;Caramel Peanut Butter Dip and Fuji Apples 24 wrapped caramel candies (recommended: Kraft brand) 1/2 of a 14-ounce bag 2 Fuji apples 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 cup water plus 1 tablespoon 2 tablespoonfuls creamy peanut butter Pinch ground cinnamon (this is your SECRET ingredient) Instructions: Unwrap candies and place into a bowl. Have your GH cut the Fuji apples into quarters and cut into each quarter to remove the core. The GH should then slice apples into 8 pieces per apple. Count for them and make sure they make even slices. You need 16 slices, total. Squirt some lemon juice into a bowl with 1 cup of water in it. Add the sliced apples and turn them around in the lemon water then drain them in a strainer or colander. Lemon juice is sour, but it&#39;s only a tiny bit on lots of apple slices. The apples will still taste sweet and really good. The skin of an apple keeps them from turning brown before you cut them, but apples will turn brown once they are cut up and the air can touch their insides. Lemon juice is acidic. That means that it has special properties in it that can keep apples from turning brown. Add 1 tablespoon water and peanut butter to your caramel candies. Place candies in microwave oven on high for 2 minutes. Stir the dip with a rubber spatula. If the candy is not melted all the way, put it back in the microwave on high for another 20 seconds. Add a pinch of cinnamon to the sauce and stir. DO NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT THE CINNAMON! Tell your GH not to tell, too. This is your secret ingredient.

Add the onions and salt and sweat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Add the rice and cook, letting the rice slightly stick to the bottom of the pan and scraping it off, until it sounds crackly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the wine to the pan until it covers the surface of the rice. Season with salt and cook over medium-high heat, stirring continuously, until the wine has absorbed into the rice. Add the chicken stock to the pan until it covers the rice, about 4 minutes. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring continuously, until the stock has absorbed into the rice, about 6 minutes. Repeat this process two more times with the hot chicken stock. When the third addition of the stock has absorbed and the rice is very creamy, bite a couple grains of rice to test how it is cooked. Add the squid ink and mix to incorporate. If the rice is still a little crunchy, add a little more stock and cook the rice for another couple of minutes. Add the calamari and allow to cook until tender and the rice is creamy but still flows and holds its own shape, 5 to 7 minutes. When the rice is cooked perfectly, remove it from the heat. Toss in the butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano and fold to combine. Garnish with chives or micro bull&#39;s blood if using, and a big glug of good extra-virgin olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5633,&quot;BeeSting Dark beer Freshly-squeezed orange juice Orange slices Instructions: In a glass, add 1/2 beer and 1/2 orange juice.

Cut a 3/4-inch wide strip off each side of the pastry and reserve. Roll out the pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface to a 10-inch square. Brush the edges of the square with the egg. Working with 1 strip at a time, stand the strips along the edges of the pastry square and crimp where they meet. You want to create a shallow box, where the pastry square is the base and the 4 strips are the walls. Overlap the strips at the corners, stretching them if necessary to complete the walls of the box. Brush the border with the egg. Pierce the center of the pastry all over with fork. Bake until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely. Using an electric mixer, beat the cream until soft peaks. With the mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add the liqueur and beat until just well blended; be careful not to overmix or the whipped cream will turn into a buttery consistency and start to separate. Using a large spatula, fold in the nuts.

In a small saucepan, heat 1 1/2 cups half-and-half and the cream over medium-low heat until a candy thermometer registers150 degrees F. (You may see steam rising from the pan, but the milk and cream should not start to boil.) With a sharp knife, slice the vanilla bean lengthwise, scrape the tiny black seeds into the half-and-half, and add the vanilla bean to the pan. Add the grits and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and maintaining the temperature around 150 degrees F, until the grits swell and the mixture thickens to the consistency of a thin porridge, about 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the freshness of the grits and the coarseness of the grind. Remove the vanilla bean and discard. Whisk 1 cup of the half-and-half and grits mixture slowly into the cocoa mixture, stirring constantly until the liquids are thoroughly incorporated. Add the chopped chocolate to the grits mixture remaining in the saucepan and stir until it dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the cocoa mixture into the grits and chocolate mixture and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until the custard thickens to the texture of a thick, liquid pudding, 8 to 12 minutes. Let cool to room temperature and transfer to a container. Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the custard and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight, until the custard is very cold. Pour the custard into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions until the ice cream becomes very thick and holds its shape. Quickly transfer the ice cream to a container with a tight-fitting lid. If there is any space between the surface of the ice cream and the lid, pat a sheet of plastic wrap on the surface. Cover the container. Freeze the ice cream until it has hardened, at least 2 hours. Remove from the freezer 10 minutes before serving and remove the plastic wrap. Serve small scoops of ice cream in bowls, and garnish with shaved chocolate or for fun, a pinch of dry, raw grits. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 5658,&quot;Crispy Oysters with cl Dipping Sauce 1 cup rice flour 1/2 cup fine cornmeal 1 tablespoon crab boil seasoning 1 quart iced soda water 1 dozen shucked Chesapeake Bay oysters Salt 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1/4 cup naturally brewed soy sauce 3 Thai bird chiles, minced 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon sesame oil Mixed greens, for plating Instructions: Preheat a fryer or wok filled 1/2 way with oil to 400 degrees.

Turn the stand mixer to a low speed and add 3 1/2 cups water followed by the melted butter. Once it starts to come together, turn the mixer to medium speed and mix for 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap touching the dough and allow to rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Once the dough has rested, make 24 equal-size balls, approximately the size of an ice cream scoop. Place all on a tray and cover with a damp towel to prevent drying out. For the filling: While the dough is resting, preheat a large rondeau pan to high heat. Add the vegetable oil and immediately add the ground meats. Saute until half-cooked, breaking up the meat as small as possible using a potato masher. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and then add the onions and saute for a couple of minutes until they start to soften. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another minute. Add the dried herbs and chiles and saute for 1 minute. Add the olives, raisins, chicken stock, tomato paste, capers and Worcestershire, and simmer over medium heat until the liquid is almost fully reduced and the meat comes to a paste-like consistency. Season with salt and then allow to cool fully. For assembly: Cover your prep surface with several layers of newspaper (this can be a messy job). Using an 8-inch pastelle/tortilla press, place a piece of a 16-inch long aluminum foil strip on the bottom of the press and top with a banana leaf. Lightly coat the banana leaf with oil and place a dough ball on top, rolling the ball over the leaf to coat it in oil. Brush a square of aluminum foil liberally with some vegetable oil and place on top of the corn dough ball. Press the dough using the pastelle/tortilla press until it becomes a flat, round piece of dough. Set aside the top square of foil to reuse. Remove the bottom piece of aluminum foil, banana leaf and flattened dough to a flat surface and place approximately 2 heaping tablespoons of the cooled meat filling on half of the dough, starting from the center out towards the edge, making sure to leave about a 1/2-inch rim of dough around the edge. Fold the half-moon of uncovered dough over the meat using the banana leaf and aluminum foil and press the edges together. Fold into a rectangular package, by first rolling it then sealing the ends by folding with the banana leaf and foil. Repeat until all the packages are complete. Bring a large pot of water to the boil and place as many packages as you want in the water until fully cooked and heated through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the water with tongs and place on a tray to cool enough so you can handle it, approximately 2 minutes. For the avocado cilantro root puree: Put the avocado, lemon juice and cilantro root in a food processor and process until very smooth. Season with salt and pepper, and then transfer to a non-reactive bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve the pastelles hot with the avocado cilantro root puree. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 5669,&quot;Strawberry Chocolate Milk 8 ounces milk 2 tablespoons strawberry syrup, or to taste 2 tablespoons chocolate syrup, or to taste Fresh strawberry, for garnish Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a tall glass and stir.

Add about one third of the chilled butter and process until thoroughly combined (the mixture will be slightly yellow). Add the remaining chilled butter and pulse until the mixture resembles very coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add the vinegar in a single pulse. Gradually add the ice water through the feed tube pulsing just until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together, it should just hold its shape and be a little crumbly. If still very powdery, pulse again, adding up to 2 tablespoons ice water. Turn the dough out on a work surface. Pat about two thirds of the dough into a square about 1/2-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining dough. Wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Adjust an oven rack to the bottom position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch-square baking dish. For the filling: Toss the tomatoes with 2 teaspoons salt in a large colander set over a large bowl. Let stand, gently tossing about every 10 minutes, until the tomatoes release some of their juices, about 30 minutes. Drain the juices from the bowl, add the drained tomatoes and toss with the brown sugar and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion to a medium bowl, stir in the thyme and let cool. Add the pepper Jack, mozzarella, parsley, scallions, mayonnaise, 1/4 cup of the breadcrumbs and the garlic to the onions and stir to combine. To assemble the pie: Let the dough stand at room temperature for a few minutes until slightly softened to make rolling easier. Place the larger piece of dough between two large pieces of floured parchment; roll into a rough 14-inch square (if the dough gets too soft, pop it in the fridge to firm up and then continue rolling). Roll the remaining dough into a rough 12-inch square. Transfer the larger piece of dough to the prepared baking dish. Gently press the dough along the bottom and up the sides of the dish. There will be overhang on all sides. Sprinkle the bottom with the remaining 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs; top with the cheese mixture spreading it in an even layer. Then add the tomatoes. Dot with the butter. Put the remaining dough over the filling, lining up the edges with the bottom piece of dough as best you can. Pinch the edges together, trim any excess, then fold and crimp to create a tight seal. Brush the top and edges of the crust with the egg and cut decorative slits in the top of the pie. Bake until the crust is dark golden brown and the filling bubbles out a little through the slits, 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes. (If the crust browns too quickly, cover the pie loosely with foil.) Let cool at least 2 hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 5673,&quot;Soft-Shell Crab Salad with Green Goddess Dressing 1/2 cup sour cream 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 lemon, juiced 2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped 3 anchovy fillets 1 cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups buttermilk 1 tablespoon crab boil seasoning Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 medium soft-shell crabs, cleaned and rinsed Vegetable oil, for frying 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 bunches watercress, trimmed 1 head bibb lettuce, trimmed and hand torn 1/2 red onion, sliced 1 hard boiled egg Lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: To make the green goddess dressing: Simply puree the ingredients together in a blender, until light green and creamy. Cover and stick the dressing in the fridge to allow the flavors to come together. To prepare the soft-shell crabs: Pour the buttermilk in a shallow bowl large enough to hold all the crabs. Season the buttermilk with crab boil seasoning, salt, and pepper. Lay the crabs in the buttermilk mixture and marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 hour; soaking the crabs in buttermilk helps plump them up when cooked. Remove the crabs from the milk bath and let the excess drip off. Pour 2 inches of oil in a heavy frying pan or large pot and heat to 350 degrees F. Put the flour in a pie dish or plate and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper. Dredge the crabs in the seasoned flour to coat, shaking off the excess. Lay the crabs in the hot oil in a single layer without crowding; you may have to fry them in batches. Be careful, the crabs have a tendency to pop and spatter. Cook the crabs for about 3 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. To assemble the salad: combine the watercress, lettuce, and onion slices in a mixing bowl. Pour in 1/2 cup of the green goddess dressing, tossing to coat. Arrange the salad on a serving platter, put the fried crabs on top, and grate the hard boiled egg over the whole thing.

Drizzle the beef with the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Weigh the meat and roast it for 12 minutes for the first pound and 10 minutes for each additional pound. (For 2 pounds/1 kg, about 25 minutes.) Remove from the oven and let sit at least 10 minutes before slicing. For the remoulade sauce: Whisk together the mustard, anchovy paste, vinegar and egg yolk in a bowl. Add the olive oil, drop by drop, whisking constantly. Whisk in the peanut oil. The mixture should be very thick. Stir in the gherkins, capers, tarragon, chervil and parsley. Adjust the quantities of any of these to suit your taste. Grind in some pepper. Taste, and adjust the seasonings with salt and squirts of lemon juice. Serve the remoulade sauce spooned over the beef. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 5682,&quot;Angel Hair Pasta with Caviar and Lemon 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup sour cream Kosher salt and black pepper Grated zest and juice of 1/2 to 1 lemon 4 ounces angel hair pasta 1 1/2 to 2 ounces American caviar or trout roe 1 small bunch chives, minced Instructions: Make the sauce: Whisk the heavy cream and sour cream in a large skillet and season with salt and pepper. Simmer over medium heat, whisking, until the mixture thickens and all the sour cream melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Add a few grates of lemon zest and some of the lemon juice. Taste for seasoning. At this point the sauce should be thick enough to coat the pasta. Meanwhile, cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons salt and bring the water back up to a boil. Add the pasta to the pot and cook until al dente, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn&#39;t clump or stick to the bottom, about 2 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the skillet and toss to coat with the cream sauce. Shut off the heat and allow the pasta to rest in the sauce for 2 minutes, tossing to coat from time to time. If the sauce is too thin, simmer over low heat for 2 additional minutes. If it is too thick, simply thin it out with some of the reserved pasta water. Taste for seasoning. Add more salt or lemon juice, if needed. Spoon a small amount of caviar onto 4 serving plates. Use a fork to twirl the pasta and make a large forkful. Use your index finger to gently coax the pasta off the fork and on top of the caviar on the plate. Repeat with the remaining plates. Spoon any leftover sauce over the pasta. Note: The sauce thickens quickly, so keep it loose with a little pasta water, if needed, as you plate. Sprinkle with the chives and a touch more grated lemon zest. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Prosecco]</p><p>&quot; 5683,&quot;Frozen Strawberries 1 quart strawberries, de-stemmed 1 (3 pound) block dry ice Instructions: Wash strawberries and place in a paper towel-lined colander.

Whisk the butter, milk and egg yolk together in a separate bowl until uniform in color and texture. Add the butter mixture to the flour mixture and stir until it forms a dough. Divide the dough in half and place each half onto a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Form into two logs about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove one dough log at a time from the refrigerator. Slice into 1/4-inch-thick slices and place onto the baking sheets. Bake until firm and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside on a rack to cool. Repeat with the second log. For the banana filling: Add the butter and shortening to a small bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined, about 1 1/2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the confectioners&#39; sugar in two batches. Add the extracts and mix until combined; set aside. Slice the banana into 3 dozen 1/8-inch-thick slices. To assemble the cookies: Place a heaping 1/2 teaspoon filling on each cookie. Place a banana slice on the filling, making sure it does not overlap the edge, and then cover with another cookie and press down gently. For the bittersweet ganache: Pour a couple inches of water into the saucepan and heat over medium-low heat to just below a simmer. Put the chocolate and shortening in a metal bowl and place over the hot water to melt, stirring often. If the water starts to steam too much, remove the bowl from the pan to avoid scorching the chocolate. When fully melted, remove from the heat, leaving the bowl of chocolate over the water. Using two forks, dip the sandwich cookies into the melted chocolate, turning gently to coat, and remove to wax paper. Allow to sit at room temperature until the chocolate is completely set, at least 2 hours.

Turn the parchment paper over so the pencil mark doesn&#39;t get onto the chocolate and place it on a sheet pan. Place three-quarters of the bittersweet chocolate in a heatproof glass bowl and put it in the microwave on high for 30 seconds. (Time it carefully.) Stir the chocolate with a rubber spatula, return it to the microwave for another 30 seconds, then stir again. Continue to heat and stir in 30-second intervals until the chocolate is just melted. Immediately stir in the remaining bittersweet chocolate and allow it to sit at room temperature, stirring often, until it&#39;s completely smooth. (If you need to heat it a little more, place it in the microwave for another 15 seconds.) Pour the melted chocolate onto the parchment paper and spread it lightly to fill the drawn rectangle. Sprinkle the top evenly with the peanuts, chocolate chips and marshmallows. Press them lightly so they will set in the chocolate. Place the white chocolate in a small, heatproof glass bowl and microwave it for 30 seconds. Stir with a rubber spatula and return to the microwave for 15 seconds, then stir again. Continue to heat and stir in 15-second intervals until the chocolate is just melted. Using a spoon, drizzle the white chocolate onto the bark in straight lines. Set aside for at least 3 hours until very firm.

Butter a 9 by 12 1/2-inch baking sheet pan, line with parchment paper, and butter the paper. Finely grate the skin (zest) off all 3 clementines, making sure you peel only the orange skin and not the bitter white pith. Puree the zest with 1/4 cup of the sugar in a food processor until minced, about 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, and salt in a bowl. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar on medium, until light and fluffy, about 8 minutes. Add the clementine-sugar mixture and beat for another minute. While mixing on low speed, add the dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Do not overwork the dough. Transfer dough to prepared pan, spreading it out as evenly as possible. Cover with plastic wrap, then press and flatten using your hands over the top to smooth and even out the dough. Cut the dough into bars about 1 by 3 inches with a sharp knife, while still in the pan. Prick a decorative pattern in the shortbreads with a fork or a wooden skewer. Bake until golden, about 1 hour and 10 to 20 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes and then re-cut the bars along the previous cuts. Let cool completely on racks.

Wrap each square with plastic wrap. Dip each square into the tempered chocolate. Make sure the chocolate covers at least 1/2-inch up the side of the sponge mold. Set the chocolate square on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Repeat to make as many chocolate cups as you would like. Wait until the chocolate sets. If necessary, place the chocolate squares in the refrigerator for about 5 minutes. When the chocolate has set, gently squeeze the sponge and lift up to remove it from the chocolate. Do not press or pull too hard or you will break the chocolate. Prepare the filling: Place a 1-quart saucepan half filled with water over high heat and bring to a simmer. Make a double boiler by setting a medium-size mixing bowl over the simmering water. Place the chopped chocolate in the mixing bowl and heat until completely melted. Stir occasionally and keep an eye on the chocolate as it melts so that it doesn\u2019t burn. Once melted, remove the mixing bowl from the heat. Stir the chocolate until smooth and set aside until cool to the touch but not so cold that it begins to harden and set. Place the peanut butter in a medium-size mixing bowl. Add the cooled chocolate and whisk together. This mixture will be stiff and begin to set quickly, so whisk vigorously and thoroughly to combine. Place the chocolate peanut butter in a pastry bag with a medium-sized opening (no tip). Fill each chocolate cup to about 1/8 inch from the top. Let the peanut butter cups set at room temperature for about 1 hour, then serve. If you are in a hurry, you can place the peanut butter cups in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. They can also be frozen for 2 weeks if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Thaw at room temperature before serving. Jacques\u2019 tip: To make a lighter dessert, add about 1 cup of crispy rice cereal (recommended: Rice Krispies). Sometimes I garnish this tiny treat with a dollop of whipped cream and fresh peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]</li></ol><p>&quot; 5721,&quot;Pork and Sweet Potato Empanadas 1/4 cup granulated garlic 1/4 cup coarse kosher salt 1/4 cup smoked sweet paprika 1/4 cup cumin powder 1/4 cup onion powder 1/4 cup black pepper 1 pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into large cubes 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder Pinch salt Pinch sugar 1/3 cup shortening 1/3 cup cold water 1 cup cooked and mashed sweet potato, about 1 large 1/2 cup cooked black beans 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Salt and freshly ground black pepper Flour, for binding 1 cup diced pineapple 1/4 cup diced red onion 1 jalapeno, seeded and diced 2 limes, zested and juiced 2 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 1/2 cup chipotle pepper puree 1/2 cup honey Oil, for frying Fresh cilantro sprigs, for garnish Instructions: For the pork: Combine the spices in a medium bowl. Mix 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the spice mixture with the pork, until completely coated, and let marinate for 2 hours. (Reserve the remainder of the spices for another time.) In a large pot add the pork and enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the meat pulls apart easily. Set aside to cool. Shred with a fork. For the dough: In a large bowl combine the dry ingredients and shortening and mix. Add small amounts of the water at a time until the dough forms. Knead for a few minutes, and then wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 1 hour. After the dough rests, on a floured table roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thick. Cut 4-inch disks and set aside in the refrigerator. Excess scraps can be rolled again for more disks, just allow the scrap ball to rest before rolling. For the filling: In a large bowl, combine the shredded pork with the sweet potato, black beans, cilantro, cinnamon and some salt and pepper. Mix well. In another bowl, mix equal parts cold water and flour to use as a binder for the empanadas. Fill the dough disks with a generous spoon of the filling, brush the outer edges with the flour and water mix and then fold over so it looks similar to ravioli. Crimp the edges with a fork and set aside for frying. For the salsa and glaze: In a medium bowl, mix all the ingredients for the salsa. In a separate bowl combine the ingredients for the glaze.

Add the squash and a pinch of salt and black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender and browned in spots, about 8 minutes. Remove the squash from the pan and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft, about 8 minutes. Add the chili powder (use less if you like milder chili) and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the vegetable stock, tomatoes, beans, sugar and cooked squash and bring to a simmer. Cook until all of the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes. (If the liquid reduces to less than three-quarters of the way up the sides of the squash, stir in a little water.) Stir in the baby spinach by the handful until all is incorporated and wilted. For the cornbread topping: Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Whisk the cornmeal, flour, baking soda, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl. Whisk the milk, sour cream and egg together in another bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until well combined. Stir in the melted butter and Cheddar. Drop spoonfuls of the batter on top of the chili, leaving space in between. (The batter will not completely cover the chili.)<br> Bake until the cornbread is golden brown and springs back when touched and the chili is hot and bubbly, about 18 minutes.

If you are using a convection oven, set it to 325?. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and whisk until they are really mixed together. Set aside. In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer on medium speed to blend the butter and sugar together until they become fluffy. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula so it\u2019s all mixed in from the sides. Add the eggs, one at a time, to the butter-sugar mixture, with the mixer on medium speed. Again, make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl. Add the vanilla to the milk and set it aside. Mix about one-third of your dry ingredients into the butter mixture, then blend in half of the milk mixture, always mixing on medium speed. Mix in the second third of the dry ingredients, then the remaining milk. Scrape down the bowl, then mix in the last of the flour mixture. You don\u2019t want any lumps, but don\u2019t overmix it\u2014stop the mixer as soon as the batter is smooth. Divide the batter evenly among six small bowls. They don\u2019t have to be exactly identical, but you want them to be close. (It\u2019s about 1 cup of batter per bowl.) Color the batter individually in rainbow colors: We use purple, blue, green, yellow, orange and pink for our six-layer cakes. Start with a tiny drop of food coloring, stir it in completely, then add more until it is your desired color. (The baked cake will come out pretty close to what you see.)<br> Spray six 6-inch round baking pans with cooking spray, then pour in the colored batter. (If you don\u2019t have 6 pans, cool, wash, dry and respray your pans before you refill them with batter.) Bake the cakes two at a time for 8 minutes without opening the oven door, then rotate each pan and bake for another 8 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when you insert it into the middle of the cake. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 5 to 10 minutes, then flip them over onto a baking sheet or cooling rack and let them cool completely before you frost them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 5732,&quot;Antipasti 1 (5-ounce) bag salad mix 1 pound mixed sliced deli meats (suggested: salami, mortadella ham, capicola) 1 (8-ounce) container fresh mozzarella bocconcini 1/4 pound provolone, sliced 2 tomatoes, quartered 1 (16-ounce) jar olive antipasta (recommended: Giuliano) 1 cup pepperoncini 1 can garbanzo beans, drained 1/2 bottle balsamic vinaigrette Breadsticks Instructions: Pour salad mix onto a large platter.

Cut the meat into large cubes and place them in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Reserve the shells and all the juices that collect. Cut the corn kernels from the cobs and set aside, reserving the cobs separately. For the stock, melt the butter in a stockpot or Dutch oven large enough to hold all the lobster shells and corncobs. Add the onion and cook over medium-low heat for 7 minutes, until translucent but not browned, stirring occasionally. Add the sherry and paprika and cook for 1 minute. Add the milk, cream, wine, lobster shells and their juices, and corn cobs and bring to a simmer. Partially cover the pot and simmer the stock over the lowest heat for 30 minutes. (I move the pot halfway off the heat.) Meanwhile, in another stockpot or Dutch oven, heat the oil and cook the bacon for 4 to 5 minutes over medium-low heat, until browned and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve. Add the potatoes, onions, celery, corn kernels, salt, and pepper to the same pot and saute for 5 minutes. When the stock is ready, remove the largest pieces of lobster shell and the corn cobs with tongs and discard. Place a strainer over the soup pot and carefully pour the stock into the pot with the potatoes and corn. Simmer over low heat for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. Add the cooked lobster, the chives and the sherry and season to taste.

Sprinkle with the paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Heat the olive oil in a small Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the short rib pieces and brown all over, 4 to 5 minutes total. Remove to a plate. Add the garlic, carrot, onion and thyme to the Dutch oven and cook until the vegetables just begin to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the meat back in and add the wine, then increase the heat to boil the wine down to a glaze, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the broth, honey and vinegar and reduce the heat to low so that the liquid is simmering. Cover and cook until the meat is tender but not falling apart, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Remove the meat to a plate. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pick out and discard the vegetables and thyme from the Dutch oven. Increase the heat to high and boil the liquid down to a thin glaze, about 5 minutes. Add the meat back and toss to coat. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. For the crostini: Arrange the baguette slices on a sheet tray in a single layer. Drizzle with the olive oil. Toast in the oven until just crisp but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. In a small bowl, mash together the blue cheese, cream cheese and chives with some pepper. Spread the mixture onto the toasted bread and broil until the cheese just begins to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Top each cheese toast with 1 to 2 pieces of glazed short rib.

Toss with 1 tablespoon salt, then let drain in the sink, 30 to 40 minutes. Squeeze the squash to remove as much liquid as possible. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Set aside 3 tablespoons scallion greens. Add the remaining scallions (white and green parts), the jalapeno, and salt to taste and cook until the scallions are soft, about 3 minutes. Add the shredded squash and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 7 minutes. Stir in the parsley, nutmeg, and pepper to taste. Cook until the mixture is slightly dry, about 1 more minute. Remove from the heat and let cool, 5 minutes. Spread the squash evenly in the skillet. Make six 2 1/2-inch-wide indentations in the mixture with the back of a spoon; put 1/2 teaspoon butter in each one. One at a time, crack each egg into a small bowl and pour into an indentation. Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the cheese. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the egg whites are set and the yolks are cooked to desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Filling: In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken broth and cumin to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the couscous. Cover the pan until the couscous is tender and all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 5 to 6 minutes. Put the couscous in a large bowl and add the beans, currants, spinach, feta and 1/4 cup olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir until all the ingredients are combined. Slice the tops off the peppers and remove all the ribs and seeds. If necessary, cut a very thin slice from the base to help the peppers stand up. Stuff the peppers with the filling and drizzle the tops with olive oil. Put the peppers in an 8 by 8-inch square baking dish. Fill the baking dish with 3/4-inch hot water and bake until the filling is golden and the peppers are cooked through, about 55 to 60 minutes. Cooks<br> Sauce: In a blender, combine the basil, creme fraiche, olive oil, water, garlic, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove the peppers from the oven and arrange on serving plates.

Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and sea salt. Beat the butter and sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until just combined. Mix in the yolk. Add the dry ingredients to the butter and beat lightly together until just combined but still crumbly. Fold in grated chocolate with a spatula. Bring the dough together by lightly squeezing in your hands; but don&#39;t knead or overwork, as the secret to these cookies is their delicate, sandy texture. Divide the dough in half. Lay half the dough on a long sheet of waxed paper and shape into a log along the width of the waxed paper, leaving some space at each end. Pull the paper over the top of the log. Grip the edge of the top piece of paper, and use a straight, firm edge, like a ruler or the edge of a pan, to press gently against the edge of the dough where the papers come together to create a solid, firm round log. Repeat with remaining dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (To keep logs round store inside an empty paper towel roll.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice logs into 1/2-inch thick rounds with a sharp, thin knife. Divide rounds onto the prepared sheets, leaving about 1 inch between them, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Bake until cookies smell fragrant with a full cocoa aroma and set on the outside, about 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on the pans, about 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool completely. Serve. Busy baker&#39;s tips: Dough can be made and frozen for up to 2 weeks. Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Baked cookies can be wrapped in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil and frozen for up to 2 weeks. Cook&#39;s note: For super uniform cookies, place each sliced disk of dough in a muffin tin and bake. The cookies will be chewier, less sandy this way. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5739,&quot;Chocolate Dessert Salami 1/2 cup slivered almonds (2 1/2 ounces) 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (2 1/2 ounces) Two 5 inch long plain biscotti, coarsely crushed 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, at room temperature One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips, such as Ghirardelli 1/4 cup brewed coffee 1 teaspoon grated orange zest (about 1/2 medium orange) 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the almonds, walnuts and crushed biscotti in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until the nuts are lightly toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool completely. Put the butter and chocolate in a heatproof medium bowl and place the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth, about 6 minutes. Stir in the coffee until smooth. Add the almonds, walnuts, biscotti pieces and orange zest, and stir until combined. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until firm but moldable, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Divide the chocolate mixture in half. Place half of the mixture in the center of an 18-inch-long piece of plastic wrap. Using a spatula, form the mixture into a log, about 7 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Roll up the log in the plastic and twist the ends to seal. Roll back and forth on a work surface a few times to make the log evenly round. Repeat with the remaining chocolate mixture. Refrigerate the logs until firm, about 1 hour. Spread the confectioners&#39; sugar on a dinner plate. Remove the plastic wrap from the logs, then roll them in the sugar until coated. Using a pastry brush, brush away the excess sugar. Let the logs sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut the logs into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve. Cook&#39;s Note: The dessert can be frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw at room temperature for 25 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 5740,&quot;Cornell Chicken with Grilled Steak Fries 2 cups apple cider vinegar 1/3 cup kosher salt 2 tablespoons sugar 8 whole cloves 8 black peppercorns 8 sprigs fresh rosemary 8 fresh sage leaves 8 sprigs fresh thyme Two 3 1/2-pound chickens, halved, keel bones and wing tips removed Canola oil, for brushing 3 tablespoons dried sage 1 tablespoon dried marjoram 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon ground celery seeds 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1 cup apple cider vinegar 5 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons clover honey 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh sage Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Finely chopped fresh parsley, for garnish Grilled Steak Fries, for serving, recipe follows 5 large Yukon gold or russet potatoes, par cooked in salted water Canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil Finely chopped fresh chives Instructions: For the brine: Whisk 8 cups cold water, the vinegar, salt, sugar, cloves, peppercorns, rosemary, sage and thyme until the salt and sugar are dissolved. Add the chicken, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours. Do not brine any longer than 2 hours or the chicken will start to break down. For the spice mixture: Stir the sage, marjoram, pepper, rosemary, thyme, celery seeds and ground cloves in a small bowl. For the sauce: Whisk the vinegar, mustard, honey, rosemary, thyme and sage in a bowl until smooth. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Rinse under cold water and pat dry. Brush the chicken with canola oil. Sprinkle the skin side of the chicken with half the spice mixture and some salt and pepper. Prepare a charcoal grill for direct and indirect cooking. On the direct side, have the coals at medium-high heat. Arrange the chicken skin side down on the grill, over direct heat. Rub the bottom of the chicken with the remaining half the spice mixture. Grill the chicken until well browned, about 10 minutes. Flip the chicken skin side up and baste 1/3 cup of the sauce. Move the chicken to indirect heat, cover, and cook until the thigh meat registers 165 degrees F, about 40 minutes longer. Baste with 1/3 cup of the sauce every few minutes. Transfer the chicken to a platter. Brush with the remaining 1/3 cup of the sauce and sprinkle with parsley. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before cutting. Arrange on a platter with the Grilled Steak Fries. Heat the grill to medium heat. Cut each potato into eighths. Brush the potatoes with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Add cold water to cover by 2 inches (about 5 quarts). Bring to a simmer, then simmer until the chicken is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Let cool, then strain the broth (you should have about 3 1/2 quarts). Shred the chicken into a medium bowl, discarding the skin and bones. (You&#39;ll have 2 to 2 1/2 cups chicken meat.) For the kreplach: Combine the flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Mix the eggs, vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons cold water in a spouted measuring cup. With the processor running, pour in the egg mixture and process until the dough forms a ball on the blade, about 30 seconds. (If the dough doesn&#39;t form a ball after 30 seconds or is too crumbly, adjust with a tablespoon or so of flour if too loose or a tablespoon or so of water if too crumbly.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature while you prepare the filling. For the filling, heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Add to the shredded chicken along with the chopped dill, lemon zest and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper and mix well. Cut the rested dough into quarters, then cut each quarter into 3 pieces (12 pieces in all). On a floured surface, press, pat or roll a chunk of dough to about a thin 3-inch round. Hold the round in the palm of your hand and add 2 tablespoons filling. Press the dough closed to encase the filling and form a ball, twisting and tearing off any excess dough. Set twisted-side down on a floured baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough and filling. (Any remaining filling can be added to the soup!) Heat the stock over medium heat and add the diced carrot, celery and parsnip. Simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Add the kreplach (dusting off any excess flour) and simmer until the dough is tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Serve the soup in bowls with slices of lemon and garnished with fresh dill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5779,&quot;Roasted Shrimp with Toasted Garlic Chips and cl Oil 1/2 cup pure olive oil 8 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced paper thin Kosher salt 1 cup pure olive oil 6 cl de arbol Kosher salt<br> 6 cloves chopped fresh garlic 48 medium shrimp (21 to 25 count), shelled and deveined (you can use any size shrimp you like) 1/2 cup Red cl Oil 1 1/2 tablespoons ancho chili powder Salt<br> 2 tablespoons freshly chopped thyme leaves Crusty French bread, for serving Instructions: For the Toasted Garlic Chips: Heat oil over medium heat in a medium skillet.

Remove from the heat and seal in a container to cool. When cool, peel the peppers under cold running water and slice into thin strips. Cut the lardo into small sticks and saute in a large skillet over medium heat. Slowly increase the heat in order to get the lard crispy. Once the lard is crispy, remove from the skillet and reserve. Discard half the melted fat in the skillet. Using the remaining fat, saute the garlic and chili pepper until lightly browned. Add the bell peppers and saute for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water (about 5 quarts) to a boil. Add the fresh squid ink spaghetti and cook according to the package directions.

Melt the clarified butter in a small saucepan over low heat. To a small saute pan, add the white wine vinegar, black peppercorns, thyme, bay leaf, 1/3 of the shallots and 2 tablespoons water. Turn on the heat to medium and cook until the liquid has mostly reduced, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, then add 3 to 4 ice cubes and swirl the pan to fully melt the ice and cool down the mixture. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Strain the shallot mixture into a large, heatproof bowl. Add the egg yolks and lemon juice and whisk until the yolks are pale yellow and foamy. Set the bowl over the pot of boiling water to create a double boiler, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Reduce the heat to low. Whisk the eggs vigorously until frothy, fluffy and starting to thicken slightly. Very slowly, a drop at a time, add the clarified butter while continuing to whisk, until the sauce is thickened but still flows; it should coat the back of a spoon. If the bowl gets too hot or the eggs look like they\u2019re in danger of scrambling, immediately pull off the bowl from the heat and add an ice cube to cool it down, then return to the heat. Season to taste with salt. If the sauce gets too thick, you can add a little water to thin it out. Remove the bowl from the water but reserve the pot of water to blanch the asparagus later. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil until the oil shimmers. Add the steaks and sear, without touching the steak, until deep golden brown and crusty, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip, and then sear until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F for medium rare, another 5 minutes. Remove the steak and allow it to rest. Discard most of the excess olive oil from the pan, then return to medium heat. Add another 1/3 of the shallots, salt to taste and a splash of water to deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the crabmeat and toss in the pan until just warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Season the reserved boiling water generously with salt. It should be as salty as the sea. Prepare an ice bath and season generously with salt. Add the asparagus to the boiling water and cook until bright green and tender but still slightly crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately plunge the asparagus into the ice bath and set aside. Heat a medium saute pan and add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and remaining shallots. Saute until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and toss until warmed through. Season with salt to taste. To serve, plate the steak and top with the crabmeat. Smother with the hollandaise sauce and garnish with chives. Serve alongside the asparagus. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5783,&quot;GZ&#39;s Iron Chef Burger 1 1/2 pounds ground beef (equal mix of ground brisket, chuck and rib-eye) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 small sweet onion, sliced into thin rings<br> 8 slices Cheddar 4 tablespoons butter, at room temperature 4 English muffins, split 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> 2 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 2 tablespoons ketchup<br> 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish<br> 2 tablespoons finely diced gherkins<br> 1 tablespoon sliced chives<br> 12 dill pickle slices, if desired<br> 8 Gem lettuce leaves, cut to the size of the English muffins<br> Instructions: Prepare a gas grill with a grill pan for medium heat. Gently form the ground beef into 4 loosely packed patties, making sure not to over work the meat. Season the burgers with salt and pepper. Place 4 onion rings on the grill and press a burger patty onto each one. Let this cook together until the burgers caramelize on that side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the burgers and top with 2 slices cheese (on top of the onions), then continue to cook to your desired temperature. Spread 1 tablespoon butter onto each English muffin. Season with salt and pepper, then toast on the grill. In a mixing bowl, combine the Dijon, mayonnaise, ketchup, horseradish, gherkins and chives. Fold together until evenly incorporated. To assemble, spread the special sauce on both slices of each English muffin. Stack the burgers on the bottom slices, then the pickles (if using), lettuce and top slices of English muffin. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 5784,&quot;Stuffed Baked Pork Chops 1/4 cup golden raisins, roughly chopped 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/2 cup finely diced peeled apple or pear Salt and pepper 4 very thick loin pork chops Flour for dusting chops Vegetable oil for skillet Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Rinse pork loin to remove any unwanted smells and pat dry with paper toweling. Remove pork to a nonreactive container. Place the limes and lemons in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since these will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set them aside briefly, until they cool just enough to handle. Blend the garlic cloves and the garlic pepper seasoning in a blender, then while the blender is still running, squeeze the juice of the limes and lemons through the feed tube to make a paste. With the blender still running, add the oil in a thin stream. Rub the paste into the pork, cover and leave refrigerated for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large saute pan with an oven safe handle, heat the oil and sear the pork loin on all sides. Roast covered in oven until fork tender, at least 45 minutes. Transfer pork to a utility platter and let rest in a warm place before slicing. The pork can also be cooked on the grill. Heat grill to medium-high heat. Wrap pork in a foil pouch in which you have shaken 1 tablespoon flour, and cook over indirect heat (on the side of the grill opposite the direct heat source) for about 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours. Let pork rest before slicing. While the pork is cooking, prepare the aioli. Add peaches, mayonnaise, and cilantro to a food processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt and white pepper, to taste. Lay slices of pork loin on rolls and spoon peach aioli over. Garnish with cilantro sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 5786,&quot;Roasted Beet Salad 4 medium red beets, tops removed and scrubbed Extra-virgin olive oil 2 navel oranges 1/4 cup toasted, peeled hazelnuts, chopped Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 small wedge Pecorino Romano, for shaving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put a large piece of aluminum foil on a baking sheet and put the beets on it. Drizzle olive oil over them and wrap them tightly in the foil, making a packet. Roast until a knife inserted into the largest beet meets no resistance, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool and remove the skins by rubbing the beets with a paper towel. (Gloves are a good idea to prevent staining your hands.) Cut the peel away from the oranges with a sharp knife, exposing the flesh. Hold the peeled orange in your hand and carefully slice the segments away from the membrane, dropping them into a bowl. Do not discard membrane. Thinly slice the beets and arrange on serving plates. Scatter the orange segments and hazelnuts over the sliced beets, drizzle the plates with olive oil and squeeze a little juice from the orange membrane over each plate.

Whisk in the soda water, a little at a time, until the right consistency is achieved. The batter should coat the back of a spoon, but some excess batter should run off the spoon. Allow to rest in the refrigerator at least 1 hour before use. Goat Cheese Filling: Combine all of the ingredients and mix well. Shape the mixture into 1 tablespoon balls. Make sure the squash blossoms are well cleaned. Open the flowers and insert 1 goat cheese ball in each flower. Gently press the filling into the base of the flower. Cover with the petals and pinch the top to seal. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat a fryer or a deep pot halfway filled with peanut oil to 375 degrees F. Hold the squash blossoms by the stem. Dip each into the tempura batter, making sure to coat completely. Let any excess batter drip off. Place the blossom in the oil and fry until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes, turning often to brown evenly. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Place some of the Tomato Sauce on the bottom of a plate. Top with 2 squash blossoms and garnish with Fried Basil leaves. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and heat. Add the onion, garlic, and chili flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Add the sugar and stir to combine. Lower the heat and cook until the tomatoes start to disintegrate and mixture is of sauce consistency, about 15 minutes. Add the thyme, basil, and remaining olive oil and mix well. Heat about 1/2-inch of the oil in a steep-sided saute pan to 350 degrees F. Or heat a deep fryer to 350 degrees F. Pat the basil leaves dry to remove any surface water. Carefully drop the basil leaves in the hot oil. The oil will spit and splatter as the moisture in the leaves fries.

Combine the tamarind with the sugar and rice wine and toss with the vegetables to marinate while the beef is cooking. Cook the beef in two batches so that each batch is well seared and served medium rare. Heat half the peanut oil in a wok or large skillet until hot. Add half the beef, season with salt and pepper and cook quickly over high heat. As the beef sears well but before it overcooks, remove from the pan and briefly set aside while you repeat the procedure with the remaining beef. When the second batch is similarly cooked, return the first batch of beef to the pan and quickly heat all together. Add the ginger, cumin, basil and fish sauce. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes more before serving by pouring over and wilting the marinated vegetable salad. Serve with glutinous rice that has soaked raw overnight and then steamed for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 5791,&quot;Asparagus and Chicken Salad with Buttermilk Dressing 1/4 cup fresh parsley 1/4 cup fresh tarragon Juice of 1 lemon 2 teaspoons dijon mustard 1/4 cup buttermilk 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt 1/4 cup sliced almonds 2 bunches thick asparagus, bottom half peeled and ends trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces 2 heads Bibb lettuce, roughly chopped 1 large bunch watercress, tough stems trimmed 6 radishes, thinly sliced 8 ounces skinless, boneless smoked chicken, diced 4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup fresh parsley<br> Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Make the dressing: Pulse the parsley, tarragon, lemon juice and mustard in a mini food processor to make a coarse paste.

Put the broccoli florets in a steamer basket in an even layer. Set the steamer basket over the boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, about 8 minutes (depending on the size of the florets). Transfer the broccoli to a large plate to cool slightly. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Making sure to reserve the liquid, drain the chickpeas and rinse thoroughly under cold water. Spread the chickpeas evenly on one half of the prepared baking sheet and the broccoli florets on the other half. Pat the chickpeas and broccoli with additional paper towels to remove excess liquid.<br> Put the parsley, cilantro, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, baking powder, garlic, onion, 1 teaspoon salt, several grinds of pepper and 3 tablespoons of the reserved chickpea liquid into a food processor. Pulse the ingredients until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Add the chickpeas and broccoli and pulse again, stopping and scraping down the sides as needed, until the chickpeas and broccoli are finely minced, about 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and stir in the panko. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, combine the yogurt, olive oil, harissa (to preferred spice level), 2 teaspoons water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a small bowl.

Coat in flour and shake off any excess. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the roast to the skillet and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes, turning as needed. Transfer the roast to the insert of a 6-quart slow cooker, along with the carrots, celery, onions and garlic. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet over medium heat. Add the tomato paste and stir until the oil begins to turn brick-red, about 1 minute. Add the flour and wine and whisk until thick (it&#39;s OK if there are some lumps). Add the beef broth, bay leaves, thyme, allspice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and bring to a simmer, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thickens slightly, about 4 minutes. Pour the gravy into the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours. The roast and vegetables should be tender. Remove the roast and let rest for a few minutes. Discard the thyme stems and strain the vegetables, reserving the gravy. Toss the vegetables with half the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Stir the remaining parsley into the gravy and season with salt and pepper. Slice the roast against the grain. Serve the meat and vegetables on a platter, moistening them with some of the gravy; serve the remaining gravy on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barbera]</li></ol><p>&quot; 5816,&quot;The Noteworthy Ice 1 1/2 shots Sambuca 1 1/2 shots coffee liqueur (recommended: Starbucks) 1 1/2 shots heavy cream Whole coffee beans, for garnish Instructions: In a cocktail shaker filled with ice cubes, add Sambuca, coffee liqueur, and heavy cream.

Add the chicken stock, light soy sauce, sugar, ginger and dried tangerine peel to the pot. Bring to a simmer and stir to dissolve the sugar. Remove the pot from the heat and allow it to steep for 1 hour. Remove the ginger and dried tangerine peel. Set aside the sauce until ready to use. For the steamed fish: Pat the fish dry and put on a heatproof plate. Scatter the ginger over the fish. Put a steamer rack in a pot wide enough to fit the fish. Add enough water to come almost up to the rack, place over high heat and bring to a full boil. Put the plate with the fish on the rack, cover the pot, lower the heat slightly and steam until the flesh flakes off the bones, 18 to 20 minutes. Pour off any liquid that has accumulated on the plate. Scatter the scallions over the fish. Heat the canola oil in a small pot until smoking. Slowly and carefully pour the hot oil over the scallions on the fish; the hot oil will release the aromas and flavors from the scallions. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Pour enough sauce around the fish to cover the bottom of the plate by 1/4 inch. Garnish with the cilantro sprigs on top of the fish. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5820,&quot;Grilled Pimento Mac n Cheese 1 clove garlic, smashed and chopped 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s Red Hot 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup mayonnaise 4 ounces shredded Cheddar 4 ounces shredded smoked Cheddar 1 cup macaroni pasta, cooked and cooled 1 roasted bell pepper, cut into small diced Butter, for spreading 8 pieces country white bread 8 thick slices tomato 4 piece bacon, diced and cooke 4 slices mild Cheddar Instructions: In a food processor, blend together the garlic, paprika, hot sauce, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and some black pepper.

Butter a large (11 x 8 1/2 x 3 inches) casserole dish and set aside. (Once in the oven, the casserole will sit inside a larger pan. A roasting pan would be good.) Mix the eggs, cream, and vanilla in a large bowl, and combine the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a separate bowl. This helps to evenly distribute the spices. Add the sugar mixture to the egg mixture, and combine thoroughly. Place the raisins in the bottom of the buttered casserole, and add the bread slices in a single layer. Gently pour the custard over the bread, making certain that all the bread thoroughly soaks up the custard. Cover the casserole with foil, place in a larger dish (the roasting pan, if that&#39;s what you&#39;ve decided to use) partly filled with hot water, and bake for 2 1/2 hours. Remove the foil, add increase the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Bake for 1 hour more, or until the pudding is golden brown and slightly firm. Use a spoon to make sure the custard is fully cooked; it should be moist but no longer runny. If you&#39;re unsure whether it&#39;s done, remove it from the oven and let it cool while it remains sitting in the water bath; the carryover effect will keep it cooking but it will not overcook. Serve slightly warm with whiskey sauce. Bring the cream to a boil, combine the cornstarch and water, and add the mixture to the boiling cream, stirring constantly. Return to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, being careful not to burn the mixture. Add the sugar and bourbon, and stir. Let cool to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Merlot]&quot; 5827,&quot;Charcuterie and Cheese Fondue 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 medium shallot, grated<br> 1 clove garlic, grated<br> One 15-ounce can fire-roasted tomatoes, very well drained<br> 1 chipotle in adobo, minced<br> 16 ounces processed cheese, preferably Velveeta, chopped<br> 1 cup shredded pepper jack cheese<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> Charcuterie board for dipping: sliced baguette, assorted cheeses, crackers, assorted veggies, sliced prosciutto, sliced black pepper salami, sliced cured chorizo, nuts, mustard, jam, etc.<br> Instructions: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.

Pulse until it looks like finely grated Parmigiano. Add the egg yolk and 1 to 2 tablespoons of the water. Pulse, pulse, pulse until the mixture comes together. If it seems a bit dry add a little more water and pulse, pulse, pulse. The mixture should come together into a ball. Dump the whole thing out onto a clean lightly floured work surface. Knead the mixture 1 or 2 times only to make it a smooth ball. Using a rolling pin or your fingers roll or press the dough out to an even circle about 11 to 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a cookie sheet lined with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight, covered with plastic wrap. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. To make the filling: While dough is chilling, place the sugar, apple cider, lemon juice, and vanilla bean seeds in a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof pan. Stir to combine. Over high heat bring the mixture to a boil brushing down the sides of the pan occasionally with a pastry brush dipped in water, if necessary. After 6 to 7 minutes the mixture will eventually begin to turn light brown. Swish the pan around gently to promote even cooking. Cook the mixture for another minute or so until the mixture becomes a much deeper amber color. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, 2 pats at a time. The mixture will bubble up. That is okay, just be VERY CAREFUL not to get any of this on you. When all of the butter has been incorporated, begin to arrange the apples rounded side down in circles. Try to do this neatly and in a pretty way. Remember, the bottom will be the top! Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Retrieve the chilled pastry from the refrigerator and place it on top of the apples. Tuck the pastry in around the edges of the pan. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the dough is golden brown and crispy. Let the tart cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Place a serving platter upside down on top of the pastry and CAREFULLY flip the platter and the pan over. Let the tart fall gently out of the pan. Slice tart into individual pieces and garnish with a dollop of sweetened mascarpone. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 5830,&quot;Mater&#39;s Mississippi Tuna Melt 1 fresh lemon 1 fresh lime 2 large egg yolks 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard 1/4 teaspoon salt Pinch (1/16 teaspoon) white pepper 3/4 cup canola oil (must be room temperature) 4 (6-to-8 ounce) tuna steaks Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 3 tablespoons (or enough as needed) extra virgin olive oil (approximately 1 tablespoon to brush on the fish and 2 for the bread) 1 loaf Italian bread, sliced in 1/2 lengthwise 6 scallions, white and tender green parts only 4 stalks fennel, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1/4 pound American artisanal Cheddar (such as Grafton Village Classic Reserve), sliced 1/8-inch thick with a cheese plane 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill Tomato soup, as an accompaniment Instructions: Make the aioli and begin marinating the tuna early in the day. Microwave the lemon and lime in a small bowl to release the essential oils and set aside just long enough to be able to handle. Meanwhile, through the feed tube of a running blender, add 1 at a time, the egg yolks, dry mustard, salt, and white pepper. By this time, the micro-waved lemon and lime should be cool enough to handle. Leaving the blender running, squeeze the juice from half of 1 lemon through the feed opening, then add the oil in a slow stream. Remove to a bowl and refrigerate. Season the tuna steaks with salt and pepper, place them in a nonreactive container and squeeze the rest of the lemon and the lime over them. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Heat the grill or preheat the broiler in the oven. Brush the marinated tuna with 1 tablespoon or so of olive oil. Cook until browned, until fish flakes with a fork, 3 to 6 minutes per side, and then let rest. Leave grill hot or oven on to toast bread. Brush olive oil (about 1 tablespoon per half) on Italian bread and toast lightly, either on the grill or under broiler. Flake the tuna, place in a bowl with scallions and fennel and fold in the aioli. Spoon tuna mixture onto the toasted Italian bread, drizzle a small amount of balsamic vinegar over, and top with Cheddar. Heat briefly in the oven to melt cheese. Garnish with fresh dill.

Set aside until the yeast activates and becomes foamy on top, about 10 minutes. Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan until the butter melts. Allow to cool to less than 115 degrees F.<br> Whisk the flour, salt and remaining sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the foamy yeast mixture and cooled milk mixture. Turn on the mixer to knead the dough for about 5 minutes. The dough should be a smooth uniform ball that no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm area until the dough doubles in size, about 1 1/2 hours.<br> For the filling: In the meantime, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the beef and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Brown the beef, stirring and breaking it up into small pieces, about 5 minutes. Once browned, transfer to a bowl and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium, add the cabbage, onions and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 15 minutes. Add the browned beef back to the skillet, stir it together with the cabbage and onions for 5 minutes. Add the white pepper and additional salt if needed. Take off the heat and set aside to cool completely.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.<br> When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and divide it into 10 equal-size balls, about 3 1/2 ounces each. Roll a ball into a rectangle, roughly 6- by 8- inches. Spread 1/2 cup of the cooled filling in the center of the rectangle. Bring the two long sides of dough together so the seam is facing up and pinch them together. Pinch the short ends shut as well. You should have a rectangular shape. Put the filled dough seam-side down on one of the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining 9 balls and the filling. There should be 5 pies per baking sheet. Cover the meat pies with a dish towel and allow them to rest for about 20 minutes. Bake in the oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.<br> While the pies bake, melt the butter.

Drain off most of the excess fat, leaving a little behind for moisture and flavor. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and cayenne. Stir together well, cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally; if the liquid level seems low, add up to 1 cup water to keep it from burning. After an hour, stir in the kidney and pinto beans. In a small bowl, combine the masa harina with 1/2 cup water and stir together with a fork until it&#39;s smooth. Pour the masa mixture into the chili. Stir together well, then taste the chili and adjust the seasonings. Simmer the chili for another 10 minutes to thicken, then turn off the heat and let it cool. Fill freezer bags with 2-cup portions and freeze them flat for easy stacking (or freeze in other freezer-safe containers). Thaw and use the chili packets in your favorite chili dog, chili cheeseburger or chili nacho recipes. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 5857,&quot;Peanut Butter and Jam Pinwheels 1/2 cup Crisco?

Turn the mixer speed to low and pour in 3 1/2 cups water, then the melted butter. Once the mixture starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and mix 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap, touching the surface of the dough, and set aside, 1 hour. Turn out the dough onto a work surface and divide into 24 equal-size balls, around the size of an ice cream scoop. Place the dough balls on a baking sheet; cover with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out. Make the filling: While the dough rests, heat a large rondeau pan or large pot over high heat. Add the vegetable oil, then the beef and pork. Cook until half-cooked, finely breaking up the meat with a potato masher, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium high, then add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the thyme, oregano and Thai chiles and cook 1 minute. Add the olives, raisins, chicken stock, tomato paste, capers and Worcestershire sauce; simmer over medium heat until almost fully reduced and the meat is a paste-like consistency. Season with salt and let cool completely. Assemble the pastelles: Cover your prep surface with several layers of newspaper (this can be a messy job). Using an 8-inch pastelle/tortilla press, place a 16-inch-long piece of foil on the bottom of the press. Place a banana leaf on the foil and lightly coat with vegetable oil. Place a dough ball on top, rolling the ball over the leaf to coat it in oil. Brush another square of foil with vegetable oil and place on top of the dough ball. Press the dough using the pastelle/tortilla press until flat. Remove the top square of foil and save it to reuse.<br> Transfer the bottom piece of foil, banana leaf and flattened dough to a work surface. Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling on half of the dough, making sure to leave a 1/2-inch border of dough. Fold the uncovered dough over the meat into a half-moon using the banana leaf and foil. Press the edges to seal. Wrap in the banana leaf, then the foil, to seal into a rectangular package. Repeat with the rest of the dough and filling. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add as many pastelles as you want to the water. Boil until fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Remove from the water with tongs and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 2 minutes. Make the avocado\u2013cilantro root puree: Put the avocado, lemon juice and cilantro root in a food processor and pulse until very smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a nonreactive bowl.

Heat the heavy cream, milk, vanilla and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat until just starting to bubble. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Make the caramel: Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in another small saucepan over medium heat, stirring just until the sugar dissolves. Cook, swirling the pan occasionally but not stirring, until amber, about 10 minutes. Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Remove from the heat and carefully whisk in the warm cream mixture (the mixture will bubble). Add the chocolate and stir until smooth. Whisk the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk about half of the caramel into the yolks, then add the remaining caramel and whisk until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large liquid measuring cup. Divide the mixture among six 6-ounce ramekins. Set the ramekins in a large baking dish, then add enough hot water to come about halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake until the pots de creme are set around the edges but still jiggle in the center, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the water and let cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours or overnight.

When buying oysters, look for a tag with the harvest date and use them within a week of that date. Also, make sure the oysters are fresh and alive; the shells should be tightly closed or should close when tapped. Chill and clean. Put the oysters in a colander of ice when you get home, then place the colander in a bowl and refrigerate. When you&#39;re ready to cook, scrub the oysters with a stiff brush under cold running water to remove any grit (a clean nail brush works well). Shuck the oysters. Hold the oyster, curved-side down, in a towel on a cutting board. Insert an oyster knife between the shells at the narrow pointed end. (Use a real oyster knife-there is no substitute!) Press down firmly on the oyster to prevent slipping and twist the knife to pry the shells apart. Use the knife for leverage; do not use force. Cut the muscle that connects the oyster to the top shell with the knife, being careful not to pierce the meat. Remove the top shell. Slide your knife under the oyster to loosen it, keeping the meat and liquid in the shell. Use your knife to carefully scrape away any shards of shell. Make the aioli. Blend the garlic, egg yolks, lemon juice and a pinch of salt in a food processor. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil with the motor running and process until thick. Use a rubber spatula to transfer the aioli to a bowl, then cover and refrigerate. Prepare the ragout. Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat, stirring, until crisp. Add the shallots and mushrooms and cook 5 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic, cook 3 minutes, then add the butter and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Assemble the oysters. Preheat the broiler. Place the oysters, in their shells, in individual flameproof baking dishes or one large flameproof dish. (Put a crumpled sheet of foil underneath them to keep them steady, if necessary.) Top each with a spoonful of mushroom ragout. Finish the dish. Top each oyster with a dollop of aeoli. Broil until the aeoli is golden, about 2 minutes, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 5874,&quot;Chicken Breast with Garlic and Parsley 7 medium, ripe tomatoes 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 heads garlic, peeled and thinly sliced 3 boneless, whole double chicken breasts, with skin Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 bunches Italian parsley, stems trimmed and roughly chopped 3 tablespoons chicken fat or vegetable oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Core tomatoes, cut in half horizontally, and remove seeds. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place tomato halves cut side up on a rack in the oven and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until shriveled and partially dried. Puree half the tomatoes in a blender until liquefied, then add remaining tomatoes, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Puree until smooth. (Thin with a few tablespoons water if sauce seems thick.) Strain to remove any seeds and skins, and set aside until serving time. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Blanch garlic in a small pot of rapidly boiling, salted water for 1 minute. Drain and set aside to cool. Create a pocket for stuffing by running your fingers between the skin and meat of each breast, leaving one side attached. Season all over with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine chopped parsley and garlic. Divide into 6 equal parts and stuff each breast between skin and meat, spreading evenly. If necessary, tie skin to breasts to keep in place. Heat chicken fat or oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium high heat. Saute chicken, skin side down first, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to oven and bake about 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside for 5 minutes, to redistribute juices before serving. Whisk tomato puree and coat 6 serving plates with it. Cut each breast into 1/2inch slices, across width.

On a floured surface, pound the dough gently to soften it and roll it into a rectangle about 7 inches wide and 12 to 15 inches long. Trim edges and arrange on baking pan. Cut two 1-inch strips from the length of the dough, leaving a 5-inch wide rectangle. Pierce the large rectangle well with a fork and wet the long ends with water, using a pastry brush. Apply the strips of dough to the moistened edges and press down well with fingertips to make the strips adhere to the base. Indent the sides of the strips with the back of a paring knife and pierce the narrow strips at 1/2-inch intervals with the point of a paring knife. Chill the tart crust for an hour. For the pastry cream, bring milk to a boil with half the sugar in a small saucepan. Whisk yolks in a bowl and whisk in remaining sugar and flour. Whisk the milk into the yolk mixture, then return mixture to the pan over the heat and whisk constantly until the custard boils and thickens. Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla and butter. Scrape the filling into a non-reactive bowl and press plastic wrap against the surface. Refrigerate until cold.

Cut your bacon into thick 1/2-inch/1 cm lardons, and add to the pan. Fry, stirring occasionally, for around 3 minutes, or until you&#39;ve got a good bit of colour on the bacon and a lot of the fat has rendered out. Turn the heat down a little and add your bread to the pan, making sure you spread the croutons out so they take on some colour. Fry for another 3 minutes, or until they&#39;ve sucked up all the wonderful flavour and are lovely, crisp, and golden. For the dressing: Put the extra-virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, and a good pinch of salt and pepper into a clean jam jar. Put the lid on and give it a shake, then have a taste and make sure you&#39;ve got the balance right. Cook&#39;s Note: You want it to be slightly too acidic at this stage, as you&#39;ll get quite a bit of saltiness from the bacon and French dressings tend to be quite sharp. For the salad: Once your dressing is made, get everyone around the table so they&#39;re ready to tuck in as soon as the salad is ready. Put your lamb&#39;s lettuce (mache) on a big platter, tear in the radicchio, then pour over that wonderful, thick dressing. Scatter over most of your walnuts and chives and all the croutons and lardons. Quickly mix it all up with your clean hands so that every single leaf is coated. Use the tip of a knife to crumble off little nuggets of Roquefort and let them fall straight on to your salad. Finish by scattering over the rest of the walnuts and chives from a height, and tuck in! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 5909,&quot;Bacon, Egg and Maple Grilled Cheese 6 slices thick-sliced bacon 2 tablespoons maple syrup 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 4 large eggs 9 slices Cheddar (about 7 ounces), one of them quartered Eight 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick slices brioche bread Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lay the bacon slices on a rack set over a baking sheet. Bake until the fat starts to render, about 10 minutes. Baste the bacon on both sides with the maple syrup and continue to bake until caramelized and the edges just start to brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool on the rack, about 5 minutes. When cool, cut them in half. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the skillet and fry until thoroughly set, 3 to 4 minutes.

Toss the carrots, turnips, beets, thyme sprigs and garlic in a roasting pan with the olive oil. Season generously with salt and pepper. Roast, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 30 minutes. Peel the beets. Keep the vegetables in the turned-off oven until the risotto is ready. For the Risotto: Bring the chicken broth to a simmer in a medium saucepan, over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat so the broth simmers gently. Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and cook until slightly crispy, about 3 minutes. Add shallots and cook stirring, until tender, about 1 minute. Add the rice and stir until it is glossy, about 1 minute. Add the salt. Add 1 cup of the Barolo and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it is absorbed by the rice, about 2 minutes, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the simmering broth and stir constantly, until the rice again absorbs the liquid, adjusting the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Continue ladling in about 1/2 cup of broth at a time, stirring between additions and letting the rice absorb the liquid before adding more. When rice is al dente, after 20 or so minutes of cooking time, stop adding broth. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup wine until just absorbed, then stir in the grated Parmesan and the butter. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Let the risotto rest off the heat for a minute or so before serving. Divide among warm shallow bowls and top with the roasted vegetables.

Warm the oil in a large, ovenproof Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season the brisket with salt and pepper on both sides, and then add the meat to the pot. Brown on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Remove from the pot and set aside on a plate. Turn the heat down to medium and add the cinnamon stick, cloves, and cardamom pods; they should sizzle upon contact with the oil in the pot. Once they start releasing their aroma (less than 1 minute), add the onions and Ginger-Garlic paste. Sprinkle with a touch of salt to help them release some moisture. Saute until they soften and turn golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar and beer to the pot, scraping up any bits that may have stuck to the bottom. Carefully, using a pair of tongs, return the brisket to the pot. Then add enough broth to bring the liquid halfway up the brisket, about 1 cup. Bring the liquid to a boil, shut off the heat, cover, and transfer to the oven where it will cook away for 3 hours until it&#39;s very tender. Remove the lid in the last half hour of cooking to reduce the liquid. When you&#39;re ready to serve, check the gravy. Stir in the cider vinegar. If it&#39;s too thick, don&#39;t be afraid to add a little water to thin it out. If it&#39;s too thin, reduce it on the stovetop. Taste for seasoning; depending on the brand of broth you used, you may want to add a little more salt. When slicing the brisket, remember to slice across the grain, that way you&#39;ll get the most tender pieces of meat. Spoon a little gravy over the top and enjoy a slice of brisket heaven! Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. Save what you don&#39;t use in a small glass jar; it should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It&#39;s a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir-fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 5925,&quot;Sugar and Spice Chipotle Whipped Sweet Potatoes 5 pounds sweet potatoes (about 8 large),scrubbed 1 1/2 to 2 canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce*, minced and mashed to a paste (about 1 tablespoon) 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces and softened 1 teaspoon maple sugar Salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. and line a baking sheet with foil.

Cover with the lid and continue to cook, rotating the pot every so often for even browning, until the crust is deeply golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and remove the lid. Let stand 5 minutes, then check that the bottom is detached from the pot with an offset spatula, loosening it gently if necessary. Place a platter over the top of the pot, using kitchen towels to hold the sides, and in one quick motion, invert the pot and the rice onto the platter.

In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until it renders much of its fat and the pancetta begins to get crisp, about 20 minutes. Drain the pancetta in a sieve placed over a heat-proof measuring pitcher. Add olive oil to the pancetta fat, as needed, to total 1 cup. Return the fat to the skillet and place over high heat. Add the garlic and cook until it begins to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let cool to room temperature. When cool, add red wine vinegar and salt and pepper, to taste. (Taste before adding salt as the pancetta is already heavily salted.) Mix in 1/2 of the chopped basil. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Place the slices of bread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden brown and just beginning to crisp, about 6 minutes. (You can also toast the bread on a stove-top gas grill.) Remove from the oven and lightly brush the bread slices on both sides with olive oil, then season lightly with salt. To serve, arrange a row of lettuce down the center of each plate. Slice the tomatoes 1/2-inch thick and arrange on 1 side of the lettuce. Cut each bruschetta on the diagonal into 2 or 3 pieces, and arrange the pieces on the side of the lettuce. Place some pancetta in the center of each plate. Spoon an equal amount of the dressing over each plate. Sprinkle with remaining basil and serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 5945,&quot;Yin Yang Soup 1 tablespoon peanut oil 1 tablespoon onion, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon minced green onions (scallions) 1 Kaffir lime leaf, torn 1 lemongrass, trimmed, 3-inches from the base, crushed 2 cup whole peeled plum tomatoes 1 tablespoon tomato paste Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon butter 1 teaspoon cl oil 1 tablespoon peanut oil 1 tablespoon onion, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon minced green onions (scallions) 1 small bunch Thai basil 1 (13 1/2-ounce) can coconut milk 2 cups shelled peas Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon butter 6 ounces cooked lobster meat, diced 1/2 cup ripe mango, diced 2 leaves Thai basil, chiffonaded 1/4 cup Asian vinaigrette, recipe follows Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 cup assorted herb leaves, mixed 1 cup assorted micro-greens 1/4 cup Asian Vinaigrette Salt and pepper Lotus root, thinly sliced, deep-fried 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon sesame oil 2 tablespoons peanut oil 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1/2 lemon, juiced Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Tomato Soup: In a saucepan, heat oil.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment and set aside. Spray a large ovensafe bowl or pot with cooking spray and add the popcorn and rice crackers. Place in the oven to keep warm. In a saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, combine the sugar, corn syrup, soy sauce, vinegar and 1/3 cup water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches 260 degrees F. Stir in the butter. Drizzle the sugar mixture into the popcorn mixture while stirring with a rubber spatula. Continue stirring until the popcorn mixture is fully coated and cool enough to handle, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> Scoop 6 large piles of the popcorn mixture onto the baking sheet and mold them into loose balls using oiled hands. Pack them just firmly enough so that they hold their shape but don&#39;t pack them too firmly or you might lose a tooth eating them. While they&#39;re still sticky, sprinkle with furikake and then let them set at room temp for about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5949,&quot;Beach Toy Centerpiece 5 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered 2 pounds milk chocolate, tempered 4 pounds white chocolate, tempered Cocoa butter Powdered food coloring as desired Block white chocolate Instructions: Make a base: Use flexible aluminum strips or very large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 19-inches in diameter. Place it on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. Make a support pole: Roll a 35-inch long piece of parchment paper into a cone that has a bottom diameter of 2 1/2 inches and tapers to a point. Tape it closed. This piece will support the mold so make sure it is long enough and thick enough to support the centerpiece you are making. Set the cone on end and fill with dark chocolate. When it is full, invert the cone over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Spin the cone so the chocolate inside is evenly coated. Let set. When the chocolate has set, repeat this step a few more times. You want the cone to be sturdy because the rest of the centerpiece will rest on this cone. Allow the chocolate cone to set until hard. Remove the parchment paper. Use a hot knife to trim the base of the cone so it is flat. Then use the knife to scar the bottom of the cone and the base. You want to make it somewhat textured so it will form a better seal to the base. Use tempered chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it. Make the pails, fish, starfish, lobster, and claim shells: Tip: Alternate the molds using white, dark and milk chocolates to make a more interesting centerpiece. Use a ladle to fill a mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many shell or fish molds as you would like. To make the flowers and the leaves: Use a paintbrush to apply color to the inside of each flower and leaf mold where you are inspired to do so. Place white chocolate in a cornet and use it to fill each of the painted molds. Tap the molds on the surface to help the air bubbles escape. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many flowers and leaves as you would like to make. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate the molded objects as you are inspired. If you want to paint the molded chocolate pieces, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint each piece, applying color where you are inspired to do so. You can also apply color directly to the mold before filling it with chocolate. This works especially well for the chocolate flowers. Make seaweed and sea grass: Make 2 cornets and fill 1 with tempered dark chocolate and the other with tempered white chocolate. Use the dark chocolate to draw some seaweed onto a sheet of parchment paper. Repeat the same technique using the white chocolate to paint randomly over the dark chocolate. Use this same technique to draw sea grass. When the chocolate sets, remove the parchment paper. Make the sun: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to cut the chocolate into a star or sun shape. The one I made was about 11 inches in diameter. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Paint the decoration as inspired. Make the chocolate curls: Use a block of white chocolate. Pull a vegetable peeler over the edge to create chocolate curls. Use the curls to decorate the base of the centerpiece and the cakes. Assemble: Use a hot sharp chef&#39;s knife or small round cutter to cut a hole in each beach pail so it can be placed in the support pole. To do this, heat the knife or cutter under very hot water and wipe it dry. If you have a blowtorch, you can also use that to heat the metal. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife/cutter or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the metal to \cut\ through the chocolate by melting it. Use more chocolate to glue the sun/star to the top of the support pole. Arrange the rest of the decorations as inspired to do so. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5950,&quot;Family-Size Italian Panini 1/2 cup pickled banana peppers, plus 1 tablespoon brine 1/4 cup pimento-stuffed olives 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 16-inch loaf soft Italian bread 1 small plum tomato, thinly sliced 4 ounces deli-sliced Genoa salami 4 ounces deli-sliced ham 2 ounces deli-sliced coppa 4 ounces deli-sliced provolone cheese Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 romaine lettuce hearts, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Place a baking rack on a sheet pan and arrange the bacon in 1 layer on the baking rack. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the bacon begins to brown. Remove the pan carefully from the oven; there will be hot grease in the pan! Brush the bacon slices with maple syrup and bake for another 3 to 5 minutes, until the bacon is a warm golden brown. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Merlot, Pinot Gris]&quot; 5965,&quot;White Chocolate Cranberry Cookies 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 large egg 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 cup dried cranberries, chopped 3/4 cup white chocolate chips 3/4 cup macadamia nuts, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> With an electric mixer, cream the butter and both sugars together until smooth. Add the vanilla and egg, mixing well. Sift together the flour and baking soda. Spoon the flour mixture gradually into the creamed sugar mixture. Stir in the cranberries, white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. Drop by heaping spoonfuls, about 2 tablespoons, onto the prepared baking sheets, 2 inches apart. Bake one sheet at a time until lightly golden on top and the edges are set, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the sheet about 5 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 5966,&quot;Chocolate Handbags 5 pounds white chocolate, tempered Modeling chocolate, dark chocolate Modeling chocolate, white chocolate 5 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered Instructions: To make the woven chocolate bag: I used a tall round glass container that was about 4-inches in diameter to give the front and back pieces their curve. Cover the container with parchment paper and tape it shut. Make the front and back: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Use a paring knife to cut a piece that is about 9 inches wide by 10 inches tall. You will need 2 of these pieces. Let the chocolate set slightly. While the chocolate is still pliable, curve each piece around the glass container and gently pinch the sides together. It will take a moment for the chocolate to set but this will give the bag its unique shape. When the chocolate is set, pull the glass container from the middle and peel off the acetate. Make the handbag base: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Use a paring knife to cut a base that is the shape of the space between the front and back. This is easy to do if you allow the chocolate to set slightly. Set the molded front and back on top of the chocolate and use a sharp paring knife to trace around the outside. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Use tempered chocolate to glue the piece into place at the bottom. Make the weaving strips: Roll out the dark molding chocolate to a 20-inch long rectangle. Use cornstarch to keep the modeling plastic from sticking to the rolling pin or the work surface. Use a sharp paring knife to cut 1-inch wide strips that are about 18 inches long. Repeat using the white molding chocolate. You will need 9 dark strips and 8 white strips for the weave. You will need 2 to 4 more strips for the handle strap, depending on the length of the strap, and a few inches for the logo. Weave the dark and white chocolate strips so the woven piece is slightly larger than the solid handbag. Place the handbag on its side so you can access the front. Use a pastry brush to paint a thin layer of tempered chocolate onto the front of the handbag. Carefully lift the woven piece and position it on top of the tempered chocolate, adhering it to the front of the bag. Use a sharp paring knife to trim as necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 5967,&quot;Oatmeal Peanut Butter Energy Bars Cooking spray 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup natural creamy peanut butter 2 tablespoons maple syrup 1 tablespoon canola oil 1/4 cup light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups rolled oats 2 cups crisp brown rice cereal 1/4 cup toasted wheat germ 1/2 cup chopped roasted peanuts 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots 1/2 cup chopped dried figs 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Spray a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine honey, peanut butter, maple syrup, canola oil, brown sugar, cinnamon. Stir and cook until mixture just begins to bubble, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. In a large bowl, combine oats, rice cereal, wheat germ, peanuts, apricots, figs and salt. Pour peanut butter mixture over oatmeal mixture and stir gently with a spatula until well combined. Transfer to baking dish, cover with parchment paper and press firmly into dish.

Cut into squares or bars. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5968,&quot;Spicy Cod with Grilled Lime 1/4 cup mirin 1/4 cup sake 3 tablespoons sugar 1/4 cup brown miso 2 tablespoons sriracha 1 tablespoon rice vinegar Four 8-ounce black cod fillets, skin on<br> Vegetable or canola oil, for the grill 3 limes, halved<br> Instructions: Set up your grill for medium heat. In a small saucepan, combine the mirin, sake and sugar and bring to a simmer on the grill. Whisk until smooth and the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the grill and whisk in the miso, sriracha and rice vinegar. Cool. Place the cod fillets into a zip-top bag. When the miso mixture has cooled, pour over the cod, seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 days. The longer fish marinates, the better. Set up your grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Allow the temperature to reach 400 to 450F. Liberally grease the grates of your grill with the oil. Remove the fish from the marinade and allow the excess to drain off. Meanwhile, place the limes, cut-side down, onto the direct heat side of the grill and grill until charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the grill and set aside. Place the fish, skin-side down, on the indirect heat side of the grill. Cover the grill and cook until the fish is flaky and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the fish to a serving platter and squeeze 1 of the grilled limes all over the fish. Serve with the remaining grilled limes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 5969,&quot;Slow-Cooker Beef Stroganoff 1 1/2 pounds beef chuck roast 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 1 teaspoon dried thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 8 ounces sliced mushrooms 1 1/4 cups mushroom or vegetable broth 12 ounces whole-wheat egg noodles 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3/4 cup sour cream Chopped fresh parsley, for serving Instructions: Trim the excess fat from the chuck roast, then cut the meat into quarters.

Remove the husks from the grilled corn and discard. Brush the ears of corn with 2 tablespoons of the canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the ears until the kernels are lightly golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the kernels from the ears. Place the avocado in a medium bowl and mash slightly with a fork. Add the corn, serrano, onion, lime juice, remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, cilantro and salt and pepper and gently stir to combine. Serve with fried corn chips or warm flour tortillas. Heat the grill to medium. Pull the outer husks down the ear to the base. Strip away the silk from each ear of corn by hand. Fold husks back into place and tie the ends together with kitchen string. Place the ears of corn in a large bowl of cold water with 1 tablespoon of salt for 10 minutes. Remove corn from water and shake off excess. Place the corn on the grill, close the cover and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, or until kernels are tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove the husks and eat on the cob or remove the kernels. How to remove corn kernels from cob: To remove kernels from cobs of either raw or cooked corn, stand cob upright on its stem end in a large pan, holding tip with fingers. Cut down the sides of cob with sharp paring knife, releasing kernels without cutting into cob. Run dull edge of knife down the cob to release any remaining corn and liquid. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 5972,&quot;Beef Gaucho 1 1/2 pounds ground beef (81 percent lean) 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br> Salt and black pepper Pinch crushed red pepper<br> 1 1/4 pounds jumbo yellow onions, thinly sliced<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons Spanish paprika One 14-ounce package empanada dough, such as Goya Discos (see Cook&#39;s Note) Vegetable oil, for deep-frying Instructions: Brown the ground beef in a saute pan over medium-high heat for 8 to 10 minutes.

Then slice the breast in half lengthwise and remove the skin. Next, sprinkle the breasts with the salt and pepper blend. In a bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs until evenly blended. Next, blend the breadcrumbs and parsley and keep separate for breading. Preheat some oil in a large heavy pot to 350 degrees F for frying. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. To bread the chicken, dip a breast in the seasoned flour, then the egg wash and finally evenly coat with the breadcrumbs. Repeat the process with the remaining chicken. After breading all the chicken, place in the preheated oil and allow to cook for 2 minutes. Then flip and repeat cooking for a final 2 minutes, until golden brown. After cooking, remove and allow draining of any excess oil over paper towels. After frying, spoon 1 tablespoon of the red sauce on the cooked chicken and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the cheese. Then bake for 6 to 7 minutes to melt the cheese. Do not over sauce, over saucing will cause the chicken to get soggy. In a deep saucepan over medium heat, warm the remaining sauce until hot, and then toss in the cooked pasta and stir to evenly coat with the sauce. Once sauced and heated, portion to bowls and top with the baked chicken and finish with the remaining cheese.

Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in 1 egg and the vanilla until incorporated. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Remove 3/4 cup dough and set it aside (this will be for the cone). Put 1/2 cup of dough into a medium bowl, add the cocoa powder and mix until combined (this will be for the chocolate ice cream). Put 1 cup dough into a medium bowl, add 1 drop red food coloring and mix until combined (this will be the strawberry ice cream). Place the remaining 2 teaspoons dough into a small bowl, add 2 drops red food coloring and mix until combined (this will be the cherry).<br> For the cone: Lightly dust a work surface. Roll the reserved 3/4 cup uncolored dough into a 10-inch log. Press the entire length of the log into an isosceles trapezoid shape. Use a ruler to help flatten the sides and top. The top of the trapezoid should be about 1 inch wide and the bottom should be about 1/4 inch wide. The sides should be about 1 inch tall. Put the log on a piece of plastic wrap. Prop the dough up against a loaf pan with the bottom resting against the counter. Alternatively, if you have 2 loaf pans, place them upside down, next to each other lengthwise. Add a piece of plastic wrap long enough to cover both pans with a slight overhang. Press the cone dough into the plastic wrap between the pans to your trapezoid. Flatten the top. Make the strawberry ice cream: Roll the pink dough into an 11-inch log. Use a ruler to flatten one side of the log so the log is a half-circle shape. The dough will spread as you shape it; the flat side of the log should be about 1 1/4 inches wide. Brush the flat side with the egg wash and press it on top of the cone.<br> Make the chocolate ice cream: Roll the chocolate dough into an 11-inch log. Use a ruler to flatten one side of the log so the log is a half-circle shape. The dough will spread as you shape it; the flat side of the log should be about 3/4 inch wide. Brush the flat side with the egg wash and press it on top of the strawberry ice cream.<br> Make the cherry on top: Roll the red dough into a 12-inch rope. Brush one side with egg wash and press on top of the chocolate ice cream. Wrap the entire ice cream cone in plastic wrap and freeze until hard, about 30 minutes.<br> Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.<br> Cut 1/4 inch off each end of the ice cream log with a very sharp knife to reveal the ice cream cone shape. Cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange the slices about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake, rotating about halfway through, until crisp and just starting to turn brown on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely.<br> Make the royal icing: Meanwhile, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue power in a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes (adding up to 1 tablespoon more water, if needed). Remove half of the icing to a small resealable plastic bag. Add the beige food coloring to the mixing bowl and beat on low speed until the color is incorporated. Transfer to a small resealable plastic bag. Put the chocolate chips in a small microwave-safe bowl and melt in 30 second intervals, stirring in between each, until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the chocolate to a third small resealable plastic bag.<br> Cut a very small hole in the corner of each of the plastic bags.

Lightly dust work surface with cornmeal. With a bench scraper divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Lightly round the halves and let rest on surface for 15 minutes. Shape the rested dough halves into French loaves and let rest for 5 minutes. Roll each loaf into a long rope. Twist each rope into a braid. Spray the tops with water and dip the tops in sesame seeds. Transfer the shaped loaves onto the back of 2 cookie sheets lined with parchment paper, cover lightly plastic wrap. Place the loaves in a warm place and let rise for 45 to 60 minutes. Working with 1 loaf a time, slide the scali, still on the parchment paper, onto the baking stone and and bake until crispy and brown, about 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer the scali to a rack to cool. Repeat with the remaining loaf. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pate fermentee and water and, using your hands, break up the dough into the water. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the pate fermentee mixture and mix by hand until firm and cohesive, about 3 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough until very elastic and smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 78 degrees F. Transfer the dough to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap (the plastic should not touch the dough). Place the bowl in a warm place (about 75 to 78 degrees F.) and let rise for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes, fold the dough and turn it over in the bowl. (It will somewhat deflate the dough, but it is gentler than what&#39;s commonly referred to as \punching down.) Let the dough rise, undisturbed, for 1 hour more. (The dough will rise considerably at this point.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough gently into a rectangle, to de-gas it. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and, using your hands, mix until incorporated, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, mix in a mixer on the lowest setting possible.) Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm place (about 75 degrees F.). Let the dough ferment for 1 hour. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 75 degrees F. Refrigerate the dough at least 10 hours and up to 36 hours. When ready, it will be roughly doubled in size and have a fine network of filaments and holes. Make this recipe the night before you mix the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 5992,&quot;Frozen Strawberries 1 quart strawberries, de-stemmed 1 (3 pound) block dry ice Instructions: Wash strawberries and place in a paper towel-lined colander.

Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and egg and beat again for 1 minute to combine, scraping down the bowl to ensure all of the butter mixture is incorporated. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients in 3 parts and mix until combined. Scrape the dough onto a work surface and slightly wet your hands. Knead the dough into a smooth disc and place between 2 pieces of parchment paper. Roll the dough out until it is 1/4 inch thick. Remove the parchment paper and use a heart puzzle cookie cutter to cut out heart shapes. If you do not have a heart puzzle cookie cutter, use a normal heart cookie cutter, then cut the heart down the middle with a knife to create a left and right side. Lift the cookies onto the prepared baking sheet and bake until they are just slightly golden around the edges, about 7 minutes. Allow to cool completely. For the icing: Add 1 cup of the royal icing mix to one bowl and the remaining 1/2 cup to a second bowl. In the first bowl with 1 cup of icing mix, create the flooding consistency royal icing. Add a drop of red food gel to the bowl and then, starting with 1 teaspoon of water, stir the mixture together with a spoon. Keep adding water to the bowl 1/2 teaspoon at a time until the mixture reaches the flooding consistency--when you drag a line through the icing mixture with a spoon, the line should disappear within 5 to 10 seconds. If the line disappears earlier, your mixture is too runny and you need to add a few tablespoons of royal icing mix to thicken the icing to the right consistency. If the line takes longer than 10 seconds to disappear, then your mixture is still too thick and you need to keep adding water 1/2 teaspoon at a time until you have the correct consistency. Once you have your red flooding icing, place a damp kitchen towel over the top of the bowl to stop it from drying out. In the remaining bowl, create the soft peak-consistency royal icing. Again, adding just 1/2 teaspoon of water at a time, stir the mixture together until it reaches a soft peak stage--when you lift the spoon out of the bowl and hold it in the air, the icing forms a soft peak on the end of the spoon. If the mixture is too runny and the icing falls off the end of the spoon, add more royal icing mix. If the mixture is too stiff, just add water 1/4 teaspoon at a time and mix together until it reaches soft peak consistency. Once you have the correct consistency, transfer about 2 tablespoons of the white soft peak icing to another bowl. Add red food gel coloring to the remaining mixture and stir to combine. If you would like to flavor any of the royal icing, add 1/4 teaspoon of your favorite extract, such as vanilla. Transfer the royal icing mixtures into separate piping bags fitted with number 2 round tip nozzles. Cover the ends of the piping nozzles with a damp tea towel at all times to stop them from drying out. With a cooled cookie in front of you, pipe a border of red soft peak royal icing around the edge of the cookie. Apply even pressure with your hand, and squeeze a thin line of icing along the outside of the cookie, joining the icing up at the end. Repeat on all of the cookies. Next, you need to flood the cookies. Pipe the red flooding royal icing inside the border you just created on each cookie, filling up the center of the cookies with icing. Use the piping nozzle to squeeze the icing into the edges to ensure each cookie is covered entirely. Allow to set for 10 minutes. Using the white soft peak royal icing, apply even pressure with your hand and decorate the center of each cookies with names, initials or messages. The cookies should be eaten the same day for the best taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5996,&quot;Baby Tomato and Fresh Herb Tabbouleh 1 cup bulgur wheat 2 pinches kosher salt, plus 1 teaspoon 1 1/4 cups boiling water 1/2 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh mint leaves 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives 1 pint baby tomatoes, washed and quartered 1 lemon, juiced 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper, about 15 grinds Instructions: Combine bulgur, a couple pinches of salt, and boiling water in a heat-proof bowl.

Lay each steak flat on the counter and tie each one horizontally so that the meat forms a tight, round package. You will need 6 pieces of kitchen twine, each measuring about 18 inches long. Spread half the marinade over the bottom of a nonreactive casserole or deep baking pan just large enough to hold all 6 steaks snugly but without crowding. Arrange the steaks in the pan and coat with the remaining marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 5 hours. Remove the steaks from the marinade and place them on a double thickness of paper towels to dry. Light a fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to medium. Set the peppers over the hottest part of the grill and cook until they begin to char. Turn with tongs and continue grilling until the peppers are charred on all sides. Stand by the grill during this time, the peppers cook quickly. Using tongs to turn them prevents them from splitting open. Transfer immediately to a container just large enough to hold them. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the peppers cool to the touch. Rub the charred skin off the peppers. Remove the seeds and ribs from the peppers. Cut the peppers into strips. About 15 minutes before grilling, remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature. Season the steaks with salt and pepper and brush with half the oil. Grill for 7 minutes on 1 side. Turn and grill for 7 minutes longer on the other side. Turn 1 more time and grill for about 2 minutes longer for rare steak. Grill for 1 to 2 minutes longer for medium-rare. Take care when turning the steaks to that the grill marks on the meat are perpendicular to the grate. Transfer the steaks to a warmer platter and remove the twine. Place a medium saute pan or skillet on the hottest part of the grill. Put the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and the sliced onions in the pan and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are lightly browned. Add the pepper strips and cook for about 2 minutes, or until heated through. Serve the steaks on warmed large plates with the grill marks showing. Carefully spoon the pepper and onions over half of each steak so that the grill marks are clearly visible. Put the cloves in a dry cast iron skillet and cook over low heat for 20 to 30 minutes, or until softened. Turn frequently so that the cloves soften but do not brown. Slide the cloves from the skillet onto a plate to cool to the touch. Squeeze the softened garlic pulp from the individual cloves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 6005,&quot;Carne Frita Moe&#39;Fongo One 4- to 6-pound pork butt 1/2 cup canola oil 1/2 cup white wine vinegar 5 tablespoons garlic puree 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon pepper 1 teaspoon dried parsley 1 cup melted butter or margarine 3 tablespoons pureed garlic 1 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 large Spanish onion, sliced 10 green plantains 4 cups canola oil Store-bought pork rinds, for mashing Chicken broth, for dipping Instructions: For the pork marinade: Wash pork. In a medium bowl, combine oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, pepper and parsley. Put aside. Using a sharp knive and cutting board, cube pork into 1-inch cubes, removing some of the fat to your liking. Pour marinade over pork in a bowl. Marinade, refrigerated, for at least 24 hours or up to 48. For the moe&#39;foe sauce: Combine butter, garlic and granulated garlic in a bowl. Reserve for later. Saute onion in a small skillet in approximately 1 tablespoon moe&#39;foe sauce until translucent and fork-tender. Peel and cut plantains 1/2-inch thick. In a small fryer or deep pot, heat canola oil to 375 degrees F. Fry plantains until fork-tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to sit and rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Fry pork until golden brown and crispy on the outside and 155 degrees F inside. Meanwhile, using a mortar and pestle, make moe&#39;fongo: Add 12 pieces plantain and 2 tablespoons moe&#39;foe sauce and mash until smooth, leaving some small chunks of plaintain. Add 2 to 3 pieces of pork rinds, and mash until pork rinds are incorporated well. Repeat for each additional moe&#39;fongo. Scoop mashed moe&#39;fongo into a shallow and wide cup to mold, then flip and place on a plate. Add pork and cover with sauteed onion. Serve with your favorite chicken broth for dipping! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 6006,&quot;Sweet Polenta Crostini with Mascarpone, Raspberries, Pistachios, and Lavendar Honey 3 1/2 cups water, preferably still spring or filtered water 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup medium grain yellow cornmeal, preferably stone-ground 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon mild-flavored vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing the pan 2 to 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 3/4 cup mascarpone 1/2 pint red raspberries 1/3 cup shelled, skinned, pistachio nuts, lightly toasted and coarsely chopped 1/4 cup dark, flavorful honey, such as lavender or wild forest, although preferably not buckwheat Instructions: Prepare the polenta: Line an 8 by 4-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside. Bring the water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add the salt, then gradually sprinkle in the cornmeal, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Keep stirring after the last of the cornmeal has been added: the mixture will begin to thicken quite quickly. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the polenta for about 30 to 40 minutes, stirring frequently. Spoon a little of the polenta onto a plate and taste it: when it is no longer crunchy and granular, it&#39;s done. Scrape the polenta into the loaf pan, flattening the top and pressing the mass into a rough rectangle, ending halfway to two-thirds down the length of the pan. This sounds a little confusing, but you should now have a 2-inch-thick rectangle of polenta pressed into the loaf pan. It will be very stiff and have no trouble staying put. Cool the polenta to room temperature, then press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours, or up to 3 days. No more that 2 or 3 hours before you plan to serve the dessert, remove the loaf pan from the refrigerator and unmold the polenta. With a long, thin-bladed knife, slice the loaf into 1/4-inch thick slices and cut each of these in half. You should end up with about 24 (2-inch) squares, 1/4-inch thick. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large frying pan (non-stick is fine) over medium heat. When the foam subsides, add half of the polenta slices and fry about 4 minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp on both sides. Carefully transfer the slices to a platter lined with paper towels and sprinkle the slices with half of the sugar. Repeat with the remaining butter, oil, polenta, and sugar. Cool the sugared polenta slices to room temperature. To assemble the crostini, spoon the mascarpone into a piping bag fitted with a medium star tip (about 1/2-inch or so). Pipe a generous amount of mascarpone on each polenta square and arrange two or three raspberries on the cheese. Press some pistachio pieces around the berries into the cheese and drizzle the crostini with a little of the honey (a honey dripper or even a teaspoon dipped into the jar then waved over the squares works really well, don&#39;t even bother measuring the honey!). The finished crostini should be eaten as soon as possible, but can be kept covered at room temperature for a few hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 6007,&quot;Tartar Sauce *3 egg yolks 1/4 cup malt vinegar 1 1/2 cups peanut or vegetable oil 2 shallots, finely diced 3/4 cup finely chopped cornichons 1/2 cup whole-grain mustard 1 teaspoon celery salt Pinch cayenne pepper Kosher salt Instructions: In the food processor combine the egg yolks and malt vinegar. With the machine running, add the oil, drop by drop, until the mixture starts to look homogeneous and thick and silky. When the mixture looks like it has come together and is starting to thicken, the oil can be added a little bit faster until all the oil is added. Add the remaining ingredients and taste for seasoning. Season with salt, if needed. Transfer to a container with a lid and refrigerate until ready to use.

Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Set up a breading station with three wide shallow bowls or baking dishes, one with the flour, one with the eggs whisked with a splash of water and one with the panko. Whisk the paprika, garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper into the flour. Working in small batches, toss the fish in the flour, then dip into the egg and, finally, coat with the panko. Arrange in a single layer in the basket of a 6-quart air fryer as they\u2019re done. Cook in the air fryer at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes, flipping the fish halfway through, until the fish is golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a dish and sprinkle with salt. Add the fries to the air fryer and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes. During the last minute of cooking, add the fish on top of the fries to reheat. For the tartar sauce: While the fish is cooking, mix the mayonnaise, dill, cornichons, vinegar, capers, mustard and some salt and pepper in a small bowl. Serve the fish and fries immediately with the tartar sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 6010,&quot;Arugula-Prosciutto Flatbread Pizzas 2 pieces lavash or other flatbread, halved 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 1/2 cup grated fontina cheese (about 2 ounces) 4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, torn 4 cups baby arugula 1 bulb fennel, halved, cored and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola or other blue cheese (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium.

Combine the vinegar, sugar, celery seeds, mustard seeds, salt and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepot over medium-high heat and simmer until the sugar dissolves. Pour the hot liquid over the jalapenos and onions. Set aside to pickle for 2 hours minimum or refrigerate overnight. For the balsamic onions: Combine the bacon and duck legs in a large saute pan over medium heat. Saute until the bacon and duck skin have rendered their fat and become crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool, leaving the rendered fat in the pan; you want about 3 tablespoons of fat. When cool enough to handle, separate and chop up the skin from the duck legs. Combine the duck skin with the bacon and set aside. Shred the duck meat into bite-size pieces and reserve separately. Add the sweet onions to the pan with the rendered fat and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another 2 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and sugar, raise the heat and cook until the onions become jam-like, another 5 to 7 minutes. Add the bacon and duck skin to the onions, mix and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lay the puff pastry out on a floured surface. Using a 1 3/4-inch cutter, punch out 16 rounds of puff pastry. Lay the rounds on a baking sheet, then place another clean baking sheet on top of the rounds to keep them flat while baking.

Lay the bread out on two rimmed baking sheets. Bake until slightly dried out, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Meanwhile, soak the dried cranberries in a bowl with the brown sugar, orange juice and all the citrus zests. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sage and thyme and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the onions, celery, garlic, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 12 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the bread, pour in the stock, and add the cranberry mixture; toss to coat. Let cool completely. Add the parsley, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper and mix thoroughly. For the roulade: Raise the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Lay the butterflied turkey breast skin-side-down on a plastic-wrap-lined work surface. Pound with a meat mallet to an even 1/2- to 3/4-inch thickness. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Spread about 5 cups of the stuffing in a 1/2-inch layer over the breast, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Starting on a long side, tightly roll up the breast to enclose the stuffing. Tie and secure the roulade every 1 1/2 inches with kitchen twine. Butter a 3-quart baking dish and fill it with the remaining stuffing. Gently rub the softened butter all over the roulade; sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 150 degrees F, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Thirty minutes before the roulade is done, add the stuffing to the oven. When the roulade is at temperature and the stuffing is hot, increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F and cook for another 5 minutes, until both are golden brown. Transfer the roulade to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil and let stand 10 minutes. For the gravy: Melt the butter in the roasting pan over medium heat.

For the pistachio creme brulee: Put the egg yolks in a medium heatproof bowl. In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream and sugar and bring to a boil over high heat. At the boil, remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly whisk the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks. Mix the pistachio paste into the hot cream/yolk mixture, blending thoroughly. Strain the mixture. Pour the creme brulee mixture into a 9-inch cake pan. Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan or baking dish and carefully pour hot water into the pan around it, halfway up the sides of the cake pan, to make a water bath. Bake until set and no longer liquid in the center, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check by jiggling the pan very gently; the creme brulee should tremble just slightly. Remove the roasting pan from the oven (but leave the oven on for the cheesecake), remove the cake pan from the water bath, cool the brulee to room temperature and then refrigerate for several hours until cold. For the mascarpone cheesecake: In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and sugar on medium speed until smooth. Add the mascarpone and beat until smooth. Beat in the whole eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl and beater between additions. Beat in the egg yolks, followed by the vanilla. Pour the mixture into a 9-inch cake pan. Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan or baking dish and carefully pour hot water into the pan around it, halfway up the sides of the cake pan, to make a water bath. Bake until the cheesecake is set and no longer liquid in the center, 30 to 45 minutes. Check by jiggling the pan very gently; the cheesecake should tremble just slightly. Turn off the oven and leave the door open. Cool the cheesecake in the oven for about 30 minutes, then refrigerate until firm--preferably overnight. For the chocolate tree trunks: Cut the 3-foot wooden dowel into twelve 3-inch lengths. Cut twelve 3-inch squares of aluminum foil. Lay a piece of dowel parallel to one of the edges of a foil square and roll the foil around the dowel. Repeat with the remaining dowels and foil. Cut twelve 8-inch squares of plastic wrap. Hold a foil-wrapped dowel by one end. Place the opposite end of the dowel in the center of a square of plastic wrap. Hold the dowel and plastic wrap up so that the plastic drapes over the dowel. Gather the corners of the plastic wrap to enclose the dowel in the plastic. There will be a lot of wrinkles in the plastic. This will give texture to the tree trunks. Twist the ends of the plastic wrap together, or secure the ends of the plastic wrap with tape. Repeat with the remaining dowels and plastic. To temper the chocolate, melt 24 ounces of the chocolate in a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water fitted with a digital or chocolate tempering thermometer. Heat to 115 to 120 degrees F. Remove the bowl of chocolate from the heat and add the remaining 8 ounces of chocolate. Stir until all the added chocolate has melted. The temperature of the chocolate should be below 86 degrees F. If not, allow the chocolate to continue to cool, stirring frequently, until it reaches 85 to 86 degrees F. Place the bowl of chocolate over the simmering water again and reheat for a few seconds at a time, stirring well, until the temperature has risen to 87 to 91 degrees F. (Do not allow the temperature of the chocolate to exceed 91 degrees F, or you will have to repeat the procedure from the beginning.) Wipe any moisture from the underside of the bowl before proceeding. Use a pastry brush to brush a coating of tempered chocolate onto the bottoms and up the sides of each dowel. Stand the dowels upright on a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil and allow to stand until the chocolate is just set. Apply a second coating of tempered chocolate for added strength. Set aside for 1 to 2 hours, or overnight. When ready to unmold, place the chocolate-coated dowels in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes. Undo the plastic wrap and remove the dowel from each. Hold each tree trunk securely in one hand (wear gloves to avoid fingerprints) and carefully remove the plastic wrap from the insides of the tree trunks. To assemble: Place the pistachio creme brulee mixture into a disposable pastry bag and snip a small opening. Pipe about a tablespoon of the mixture into the bottom of each hollow tree trunk. Use a spoon to scrape off the top skin of the cheesecake and carefully scoop the soft cheesecake center into a disposable pastry bag and snip a medium-sized opening. Pipe the cheesecake mixture on top of the pistachio creme brulee in the hollow tree trunks, filling as full as desired. Garnish each with a maraschino cherry and chopped toasted nuts if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 6038,&quot;Glazed Smoked Ham 1 large onion, quartered, root end intact 1 (5 to 7-pound) smoked ham (shank end) 3/4 cup apricot jelly 1/4 cup water 8 sprigs fresh thyme, stripped 3 tablespoons yellow mustard 4 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 teaspoons molasses 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice Pinch ground cloves 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Beat the granulated sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the molasses until combined, then the egg (the mixture might look curdled). Add the flour mixture and mix on low until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half, flatten each half into a disk and wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Keeping one dough disk refrigerated, roll the other on a well-floured work surface to 1/4 inch thick, sprinkling flour on and under the dough as needed and sliding a spatula underneath every so often to prevent sticking (if the dough looks crackly or breaks apart, press it back together from the outside edge in). Use a 3 1/2-inch-wide by 3 3/4-inch-tall Christmas tree cookie cutter to cut out trees as close together as possible. Pull away the extra dough around each shape, then use a small offset spatula to transfer the trees to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them at least 1/2 inch apart (they will not spread much during baking). Reroll the scraps and cut out more cookies. Repeat this process with the remaining dough disk to make about 22 total. Freeze the cookies until firm, about 15 minutes. Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake, rotating the baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through cooking, until the cookies are slightly firm to the touch but not browned at the edges, about 12 minutes. Cool the cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes. The cookies will continue to firm as they cool. For the filling: Beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt and mix until smooth and creamy. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip (size 6).<br> For the add-ins: Pipe frosting in the style of a garland on half of the cookies. Lightly press the candy-coated chocolates into the frosting garlands. Cut the pretzel sticks to the same length as the cookie tree trunks. Pipe a small amount of frosting onto the trunks, then press pretzel stick pieces into the frosting. Turn the remaining cookies over (bottom-side up) and pipe frosting onto each. Top each with a decorated cookie and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 6057,&quot;French Country Tart Variations 1 prepared tart shell, Pate Brisee recipe follows 7 eggs 1 cup heavy cream 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon white pepper Pinch ground nutmeg Variation #1 - Lorraine: 1 small onion, sliced 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 5 slices bacon, cooked crisp 1/2 cup shredded Gruyere Variation #2 \u2013 olives, roasted red pepper and goat cheese 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped 2 store bought roasted red peppers, roughly chopped 4 ounces crumbled goat cheese Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Then add eggs and milk and stir together using a metal or wooden spoon. The consistency should be a thick batter, a little thicker than pancake batter. When the water comes to a boil put a colander over the pot and pour in the batter. Using a rubber spatula, force the batter through the holes of the colander so it falls in little drops into the water. Cook for just a minute. When the spaetzle float to the surface, they are cooked. Strain and immediately rinse with cold water to cool and stop the cooking process. Lay the spaetzle out on a cookie sheet to dry a little bit.<br> Pork:<br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Heat a large, oven-proof saute pan over high heat. Add canola oil and when it starts to smoke add the pork. Liberally season the pork with salt and pepper, to taste. Sear the pork on all sides to get a real good deep brown color all over the pork. Transfer the pan to the oven to finish cooking. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the pork registers 138 degrees F, about 10 to 15 minutes for medium-well. Remove the pork from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.<br> Salsa: While the pork is cooking, make the salsa. In a large bowl, add the apples, the vinegar and lemon juice and toss to coat and to prevent them from turning brown. Add the jalapeno, oil, spices and salt and mix thoroughly. Stir in the cilantro, cover and refrigerate. It will keep up to 1 day.<br> In a large saute pan heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke add the spaetzle and turn the heat to medium-high. Let the spaetzle sit for a minute to get brown, then stir and brown for another minute. You are looking for nice crisp, golden brown pieces of pasta. (They shouldn&#39;t stick if you made them right. If they do stick, it means the batter was too loose from the start. If the batter was too loose just add a little more flour the next time.)<br> With a slotted spoon, remove the spaetzle from the oil and to a platter. Top with slices of pork loin and a generous helping of the salsa right over the top. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 6059,&quot;Bittersweet Chocolate Cloud Cake 1 1/3 cups sugar, divided 3/4 cup freshly brewed coffee 7 ounces bittersweet chocolate (62 percent) finely chopped 2/3 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon brandy 3 large eggs, separated plus 3 egg whites 1/3 cup cake flour 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Chocolate Glaze, recipe follows 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and position rack in the center.

Gradually add the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and beat on high until peaks are almost stiff. Stir about 1/4 of the egg whites into chocolate mixture (no need to fold at this point). Then gently fold in the remaining whites, 1/3 at a time, until no streaks of white remain. Pour into pan and smooth top. Bake in water bath for 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Place cake on wire rack and let cool to room temperature. Remove sides of pan and carefully invert cake onto cardboard cake round or flat plate. Chill for at least 2 hours before glazing. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and place it on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Pour the chocolate glaze over the cake, covering it completely; spread evenly with a metal spatula. Serve the cake immediately or refrigerate. Bring the cake to room temperature before serving. Put chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a gentle boil. Whisk in the honey. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate and let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Whisk the mixture until smooth. Cover the surface of the glaze with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes, or until slightly thickened. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 6060,&quot;Chocolate Covered Almonds 2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup water 3 1/2 cups whole unblanched almonds Bittersweet chocolate, tempered Milk Chocolate, tempered Cocoa Powder Instructions: Place the granulated sugar and water in a large copper pot or 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the almonds and stir to coat them evenly in the sugar syrup. Your goal is to cook the almonds until the sugar crystallizes and caramelizes. When water is added to the sugar, the sugar crystals are dissolved. As it boils, the syrup becomes thicker as the water evaporates and big soap-like bubbles begin to form. Soon, all the moisture evaporates and the mixture becomes sandy. The sandiness is the sugar recrystallizing. It only takes the reformation of one sugar crystal to recrystallize the others. Keep stirring! Next, you see the sugar closest to the heat change from sandy to a clear liquid. The melted sugar clings to the almonds. When the sugar changes from clear to golden brown, the nuts are caramelized. Once this happens, pay close attention; the time it takes to pass from caramelized to burned is only a matter of seconds, especially when making smaller batches. You know the nuts are finished when most of the sandy sugar is gone. The first few times you make these, I suggest you try the following: When the sugar closest to the heat changes from sandy to liquid, remove the pan from the burner and continue to stir. The residual heat in the sugar and nuts will continue to cook the mixture while you stir it. Lower the heat to medium-low and continue to stir the nuts while moving the saucepan on and off the heat at 10-second intervals. This will give you more control as it cooks. When the nuts begin to caramelize, remove them from the heat and finish stirring. Use a wooden spoon to spread the caramelized nuts onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Do not touch the nuts as they are extremely hot. Let the nuts cool completely. If your freezer will accommodate the baking sheet, you can place the nuts in the freezer for about 30 minutes to speed up the cooling process. When completely cooled, break apart any nut clusters that may have formed. At this stage, you can choose to serve the nuts as they are. Place the caramelized nuts in the coating pan attached to the stand mixer. Spin at low speed. Use a ladle to add the chocolate to the spinning nuts. Add 1 ladle at a time until the nuts are coated to the desired thickness. If a thicker coat is desired, use more chocolate. If a thinner coat is desired, decrease the amount of chocolate. Finish by adding cocoa powder to the coating pan. Remove and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 6061,&quot;Chicken in Peanut Sauce 2 large tomatoes, cored 2 cups roasted, unsalted peanuts 1 tablespoon peanut butter 2 tablespoons adobo sauce from canned chipotles (reserve chipotles for another use) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups shredded chicken breast meat, from 2 cooked chicken breasts Sesame seeds, for garnish Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish Warm corn tortillas or white rice, for serving Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.

Weigh down the chiles with a plate to ensure that they stay submerged. Soak for at least 4 hours to overnight. After the chiles have soaked for a while, dump all the dirty water. Fill a blender halfway with the soaked chiles (you may need to do this is batches depending on the size of your blender) and cover with enough fresh water to puree the chiles (this should equal to about 8 cups of water). Pour the puree into a stock pot, add the chicken base and 7 more cups of water. Bring the sauce to a boil. Make a slurry with 1 cup of cold water and the cornstarch. Add the slurry to the sauce, stir and simmer the sauce for about 20 minutes. Strain the sauce with a chinois or mesh strainer to remove the seeds. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a pan warm the shortening or oil to about 350 degrees F. Slide 1 tortilla at a time into the oil and coat with oil to make the tortillas pliable so that they do not tear or break when rolling the enchiladas. Make sure that the tortilla is only in the oil for a few seconds and doesn&#39;t fry. Coat the bottom of a baking dish with about 1 cup of enchilada sauce to prevent the enchiladas from sticking to the pan. Lay a tortilla down, fill with 1/4 cup of cheddar and jack cheeses and 1- ounce of sauce. Roll the tortilla and place in the baking dish. Continue with the remaining tortillas. Cover the enchiladas with sauce so that the tortillas are coated well. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top and place in the oven and bake for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the cheese has melted.

Add the olive oil, enough to coat the bottom of the dish. Add the loin and shin meat and brown. Layer by layer add all the vegetables. Turn and mix ingredients slowly with meat. Add the chorizo, black pudding and pancetta to the ingredients. Add the glass of white wine, saffron, black peppercorns. Add about 2 cups of stock or water and bring to the boil. Once the juices are bubbling turn the heat down to low and allow to simmer. Place the whole bulb of garlic in the center of the dish with all the ingredients surrounding it. The idea is to remove the garlic just before serving. Some chefs choose to keep the garlic in so they can nibble on it with bread as part of the main course. Keep adding the stock or water, keeping the ingredients covered all the time. Simmer on a low heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Serve with a salad and a crusty farmhouse loaf. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 6083,&quot;no recipes available no recipes available Instructions: no recipes available &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 6084,&quot;Chicharron de Pollo Recipe | Dominican Chicken Lollipops 2 shallots, peeled and trimmed 1 onion, cut into large dice 4 garlic cloves 1 bunch cilantro 1 bunch parsley 2 bay leaves 12 peppercorns 1/4 cup dried oregano leaves 3/4 cup white vinegar 1 1/4 cups salad oil Salt 24 chicken wings trimmed and sectioned, tip and 2-bone section reserved for stock, meat pushed down to expose the single bone making a drummette or lollipop Flour, for dredging Canola oil, for frying Jalapeno Dipping Sauce, recipe follows 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons mustard 1 tablespoon honey 1 jalapeno, halved Instructions: In a food processor, puree the shallots, onion, garlic, cilantro, parsley, bay leaves, peppercorns, and oregano with the white vinegar.

Heat a large deep skillet with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add shiitakes and cook a few minutes then add garlic and cook a couple minutes longer. Add wine and reduce a minute. Halve and slice portobellos then add to shiitakes. Scatter the rosemary into the pan and turn to distribute the herb. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes. Remove the porcini from steeping broth with a slotted spoon and chop. Stir mushrooms into sauce then add a few ladles of the steeping broth.

Place the duck on a plate, sprinkle both sides with a total of 4 teaspoons salt, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. When ready to cook the duck, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Score the skin of the duck breasts with a sharp knife, making a crosshatch pattern but not cutting down to the meat. In a large (12-inch) heavy-bottomed, ovenproof skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Place the duck breasts in the pan, skin side down. Cook uncovered over medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes, discarding the fat from the pan occasionally, until the skin is very browned. Turn the duck with tongs, place the skillet in the oven, and roast for 12 to 18 minutes, until the internal temperature of the duck is 120 degrees F for rare. Remove from the oven, cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, and allow the duck to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a medium saucepan. Add the shallots and saute for 2 minutes, until tender. Add the vinegar and cook for one minute.

Boil the sauce for 10 minutes to reduce. As it cooks, the color will deepen. Allow the sauce to cool before injecting it into the turkey. It is best to inject the turkey with the sauce at least 12 hours before frying. Set up a 40-quart deep fryer with burner base and propane tank according to manufacturer&#39;s directions. As a safety precaution, measure the amount of oil needed to fry by filling the pot first with water and covering the turkey by 1-inch. You may want to put the turkey in a plastic bag for ease. Remove the turkey and mark the water level on the side of the pot, this insures no spill over when working with hot oil. Pour out the water, dry the pot, and turkey thoroughly. Fill the pot with oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Have a deep fry thermometer attached to the pot. Put the turkey on the fry stand and attach to the metal hanger that comes with the fry kit. Slowly ease the turkey into the hot oil, long oven mitts and an apron are essential. Keep a close eye as the oil bubbles up. Turkey cooks 4 minutes per pound so check it at 45 minutes. The internal temperature of the bird should read on a thermometer between 170 and 180 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the oil as carefully as it went in. Set the turkey stand on a roasting pan to drain the excess oil. Let the turkey rest for 15 minutes so the juices settle before removing and carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 6135,&quot;Baltimore Crab Boil Omelet with Crispy Smashed Potatoes 8 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over for shells (about 6 ounces), 1 cup fresh corn kernels (from about 2 cobs) 1 bunch scallions, chopped, whites and greens kept separate Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound boiled small potatoes 1 1/4 teaspoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 6 large eggs 1/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat until hot.

Grease and lightly flour four 8-inch cake pans and one 9-inch tempered glass mixing bowl. Prepare the vanilla cupcake or cake mix batter. Mix the crushed sandwich cookies into the batter. Fill a 9-inch tempered glass mixing bowl halfway with batter. Divide the remaining batter among the cake pans, filling them about halfway up the sides. Bake the cake layers for 35 to 40 minutes and the cake \dome\ in the mixing bowl for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove and let cool completely. Use a serrated knife to level the tops of the cake layers and the flat side of the cake dome (the dome will be inverted so that the rounded side forms the top of the cake). Measure an 8-inch cardboard cake round against the bottom of the dome and trim the round as needed so the cake sits just inside the cardboard. Stack the cake layers, spreading about 1/2 cup of the milk chocolate buttercream between each layer. Set the stacked cake on an untrimmed 8-inch cardboard cake round. Spread a small amount of milk chocolate buttercream on the top cake layer and top with the trimmed cardboard cake round, pressing down gently to adhere. Add a dab of milk chocolate buttercream on top of the cake round and invert the domed cake, trimmed-side down, onto it. Using the serrated knife, trim the stacked cake layers below the dome at an angle to come to a slightly narrower bottom (this should look like the tapered sides of a cupcake). Spread milk chocolate buttercream evenly around the sides of the trimmed cake where the \cupcake wrapper\ would be. Frost the top of the cake with Champagne buttercream, making a swirled and wavy pattern. Cut the Pirouette cookies to the height of the \cupcake wrapper\ and place next to each other around the outside of the cake. Sprinkle with multicolored sprinkles, top with a maraschino and serve! Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until light and foamy, about 2 minutes. While beating, gradually pour in the melted butter and then the vanilla. While mixing slowly, add half of the flour mixture. Then add all the milk, followed by the remaining flour mixture; take care not to overmix the batter. Cream the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer). On low speed, beat in the powdered sugar and then the salt. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 tablespoons milk; adjust the consistency with extra milk as desired. Melt the chocolate, then fold it into the buttercream. Use immediately, or refrigerate in an airtight container up to 3 days. Allow to come to room temperature and beat on medium-high until smooth.

Season generously with salt. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put about a tablespoon of olive oil in a large saute pan over low heat and schmear it around to coat the bottom of the pan. Arrange the duck breasts, skin side down, in the pan. Be sure that the duck fits in the pan comfortably and is not crowded. Slowly render the fat from the duck breasts. This needs to be done s-l-o-w-l-y, otherwise the fat with be sealed into the skin and will not render out. The idea is to make crispy duck skin. This process will take about 30 minutes or so. As the fat builds up in the pan, remove it, but SAVE IT! It will be used to saute the kale later. When the fat has rendered from the duck breast, turn the heat to medium-high and brown both sides of the duck breast. When the duck is browned on both sides, move it to a sheet pan and put it in the preheated oven to cook it to medium rare, about 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the duck from the oven to a cutting board and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. Add the clementine juice and segments to the saute pan and scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. When the juice has reduced by a little more than half, add half of the chicken stock, the thyme and season the whole shootin&#39; match with salt. Continue to cook until the stock has reduced by half, then add a little more of the chicken stock. Continue to reduce the stock and turn the heat off when it gets to a sauce-like consistency. Taste for seasoning and add salt, if needed. While the sauce is reducing and the duck is resting, add some of the reserved duck fat to a large saute pan. Add the garlic cloves and bring to a medium-high heat. When the garlic is golden brown and aromatic, remove it from the saute pan and discard it. Toss in the prepared kale and season with salt, to taste. Add some of the reserved chicken stock to help steam the greens. Saute the greens until they are wilted but still vibrant looking. Taste for seasoning. Divide the greens among 4 serving plates. Slice each duck breast and fan the slices over the kale. Spoon some of the sauce on and around the duck. Garnish with the supremed clementines and the pomegranate seeds.

Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Allow to rest on the counter for up to 2 hours to come to room temperature. Heat a large oven-safe pan (such as a cast-iron skillet) over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Right as the oil begins to smoke, add the chicken, skin side down. Press gently while cooking and allow to sear until a peek beneath reveals golden brown skin, about 10 minutes. Using tongs, flip the bird over so that the skin is on top and place the pan in the oven. Be gentle with the tongs, they could rip the skin; try gripping the legs to flip. Place the pan in the oven and roast about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepot on medium heat, add the butter and melt. Add the onions, garlic and allspice, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper. Sweat the onions for a few minutes, but do not brown.

Can be made a day ahead. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 6198,&quot;Grilled Cheese with Spinach and Pancetta Vegetable oil cooking spray 6 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack cheese 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded mild Cheddar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon vegetable or canola oil, plus extra, as needed 2 packed cups coarsely chopped baby spinach 16 (1/3-inch-thick) slices country-style white bread Instructions: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Lay the pancetta in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets and bake until crispy and brown, about 12 to 14 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cool for 5 minutes and crumble. Set aside. In a food processor, combine the butter, cheeses, salt, and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Blend until smooth, adding extra oil, as needed, until the mixture is spreadable. Add the spinach and pulse until just combined. Preheat a panini maker. Spread the cheese mixture over 8 slices of bread. Top with the crumbled pancetta. Put the remaining bread slices on top. Grill the sandwiches, 2 at a time, until golden and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Cool for 2 minutes, then cut each sandwich in half and arrange on a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 6199,&quot;Coconut Tuna Tartare with Avocado Mousse 1 pound sushi grade tuna, cut into 1/4-inch dice 5 tablespoons grated coconut, toasted 1 teaspoon soy sauce 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar 4 tablespoons toasted almond slivers, chopped 4 tablespoons currants 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 2 ripe avocados 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/8 teaspoon paprika 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a medium stainless mixing bowl combine the diced tuna, coconut, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the lime juice, rice wine vinegar, almonds, currants, vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, and sesame oil. Toss well and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Peel and halve the avocados and remove the pits. Give them a rough chop and place them in a small stainless mixing bowl. Add the remaining lime juice, cayenne, cumin, paprika, and olive oil. Mash the seasoned avocado with a sturdy whisk until creamy in texture and season with salt and pepper. To serve: Divide the avocado mixture equally into the bottom of 8 martini glasses. Separate the tuna into eight equal portions and spoon on top of the avocado. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 6200,&quot;Chorizo Puffs (BunUelos de Chorizo) 1/4 pound chorizo sausage, skinned and finely chopped Bunuelo Dough Oil, for frying 1 cup water 3 tablespoons butter 3/8 teaspoon salt 1 cup flour 2 eggs Instructions: Saute the chorizo in a skillet for a couple of minutes until it starts to give off its oil. (Drain off some oil if there is a lot.) To make the dough, place in a saucepan over medium heat the water, butter and salt. When the water comes to a boil and the butter has melted, add the flour all at once. Lower the heat and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough leaves the sides of the pan and forms a ball. Continue cooking and stirring for 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and beat in the eggs 1 at a time. The dough will separate, then hold together again. (This step may be done effortlessly in a food processor; once the flour has been added and forms a ball, transfer the dough to the processor. Process for 15 seconds. Add both eggs and beat for 45 seconds.) Combine the Bunuelo dough with the chorizo. (This can also be done in the processor.) (May be prepared ahead.) In a skillet heat the oil at least 1/2-inch deep to about 380 degrees F. Drop the dough by teaspoonfuls into the oil and fry over medium hear, turning occasionally, until puffed and golden. Drain on paper towels. (May be kept warm in 200 degree F oven up to 30 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 6201,&quot;Artichokes with Sausage and Tomato 1 handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus some chopped for garnish 4 garlic cloves 2 bay leaves 1/4 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio 2 lemons, halved 2 quarts water Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 whole artichokes 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 pound chicken sausages 3 vine-ripened tomatoes 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: First thing to do is steam the artichokes in a flavorful broth. Put the parsley, garlic, bay leaves, wine, and 1 of the halved lemons in a wide pot, add 2 quarts of water, and bring to a simmer. Season the broth with salt and pepper. In the meantime prepare the artichokes. Wash the artichokes under cold water. Using a paring knife, trim the bottom end of the stem and shave the stem down to expose the tender, inner part of the artichoke. Snap or cut off the outer petals until you reach the pale green, soft leaves in the center. Cut 1-inch off the top of the artichoke. Repeat with the remaining artichokes. Place the artichokes in the steaming liquid. Cover and simmer on medium-low for about 20 minutes, or until there is no resistance when a knife is inserted into the base. Remove the artichokes from the poaching liquid with tongs. Using a spoon, carefully scoop out the hairy choke from the center and discard. Try and keep the artichoke intact as best you can, it looks great for presentation. Place a large deep skillet over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the oil. When the oil is hot, add the sausage and cook for 5 minutes to render out the fat and brown the sausage slightly; they should not be fully cooked through. Take the sausage out of the pan and slice it up. Cut the tomatoes in half and then squeeze them into a bowl to hand crush; drizzle with a couple of tablespoons of oil and a pinch of salt. Toss the sausage slices back into the pan and pour in the tomatoes, along with any juice that has accumulated in the bowl. Cook for 3 minutes until the tomatoes start to break down and soften. Now it&#39;s time for the artichokes to go in there. Nestle these little beauties into the sausage and tomato mixture; season with salt and pepper. Add the butter and let it melt, give a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 6202,&quot;Gravy Cheese Fries 8 medium baking potatoes Vegetable oil Kosher salt</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/In a large mixing bowl.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/In%20a%20blender%20or%20food%20processor.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>In a blender or food processor</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/In%20a%20medium.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>In a medium</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
