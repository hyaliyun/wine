pastry Vanilla ice cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a 9-inch shallow saucepan (about 9 by 3-inches), melt the butter. Stir in 1/2 cup of sugar and cook until golden brown. Peel, core and quarter the apples. In a non-reactive bowl, combine the apples and lemon juice. Start arranging the apple quarters in a flower-like fashion. Continue to do this until all the apples are used, forming a second layer. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, until golden brown. Turn the apples over and place in the oven and cook for 20 to 30 minutes. Before serving, return pan over medium heat to loosen caramel. Move the pan and when you see the apples loosen, remove from heat. Top with the pre-baked puff pastry and turn upside down onto a serving platter. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and caramelize with a propane torch or a creme brulee iron. Serve with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 28135,&quot;Stars-and-Stripes Cake 1 1/4 cups cake flour 1 tablespoon Dutch-process unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 8 large eggs, separated 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup water 1/3 cup canola oil 1 tablespoon red gel food coloring Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting 3 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 cups cold heavy cream Blue sanding sugar, for decorating Instructions: Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray; line with parchment, then spray the parchment. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour with the cocoa powder and baking powder. Set aside. Beat the egg whites with a mixer on high speed until foamy. Beat in the cream of tartar and salt, then slowly beat in 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Increase the speed to high; beat until stiff shiny peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the meringue to a separate bowl. In the same mixer bowl (leave it dirty!), combine the egg yolks, vanilla and the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Beat on high speed until light and doubled in volume, about 2 minutes. Beat in the water and canola oil. Sift the flour mixture into the egg yolk mixture, then stir with a rubber spatula until just combined. Add the food coloring to the batter and beat on high speed until smooth and bright red, about 1 minute. Stir a dollop of the meringue into the batter using a rubber spatula. Add the remaining meringue and gently fold into the batter until no white streaks remain. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking sheet; spread evenly with an offset spatula. Tap the bottom of the pan firmly against the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Immediately loosen the edges with a paring knife. Dust the cake with confectioners&#39; sugar, working quickly while the cake is still warm. Lay a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) over the cake. Place another baking sheet on top of the towel. Invert the cake onto the towel. Remove the pan and peel off the parchment. Starting at a short end, roll up the cake and towel together into a log. Keep the cake rolled up until it has cooled completely. Unroll the cake (it&#39;s OK if the end is still curled up). Cut the cake into 3 long strips, each about 4 inches wide. Use a ruler to make sure they&#39;re even. Spread an even layer of frosting on each strip of cake (use a little less than one-third of the frosting). Make sure to get frosting under the curled end. Make the frosting: In a clean mixer bowl, beat the cream cheese and confectioners&#39; sugar on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the vanilla and heavy cream. Slowly increase the speed to high and beat until smooth. Roll up one of the strips into a tight spiral. Move the spiral over to the next strip so that the ends meet and roll up into a fatter spiral. Continue with the third strip to make a large spiral. Turn the cake flat-side down and place on a cardboard round or platter. Gently squeeze the spiral together to make sure it&#39;s compact. Cover the cake completely with a thin layer of frosting, using the frosting to cover the seam of the spiral. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Return the cake (without the cardboard round) to your workspace and cover completely with the remaining frosting using an offset spatula. Place a star-shaped cookie cutter on top of the cake. Sprinkle some blue sanding sugar inside the cutter (use a small brush to help distribute the sugar), then carefully lift the cutter. Repeat to make more stars in different sizes. Refrigerate until ready to serve. When you slice into the spiral, you see vertical stripes! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28136,&quot;Cider-Braised Red Cabbage 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon caraway seeds 1 head red cabbage, thinly sliced 3/4 cup apple cider 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the butter until melted. Add the caraway seeds and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the cabbage in batches until slightly wilted, 5 minutes. Add the cider and vinegar and simmer for 15 minutes until the cabbage is soft and supple. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris, Sparkling wine]&quot; 28137,&quot;Beef Stew with Butter Beans, Peas, Carrots, and Red Wine 2 pounds beef stew cubes 1 cup flour Salt and pepper Olive oil, for sauteing 2 onions, diced 3 cloves garlic crushed 1/2 bottle red wine 2 cups chicken stock 3 cups chopped fresh tomatoes 1 bag baby carrots 1 bag butter beans 1 bag frozen peas 1 dash hot sauce 1/4 cup capers Instructions: Flour the beef cubes in salt and pepper seasoned flour. Dust off the excess flour. Sear beef cubes in hot oil and remove from pan. Saute 2 onions and garlic until translucent. Add beef back to pan and deglaze with wine. Add the chicken stock and tomatoes and let simmer for 1/2 hour. Add the carrots and simmer for another 1/2 hour. Add butter beans, peas, hot sauce, and capers. Season and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is fork tender. Check the seasoning. Serve on buttered bowtie noodles. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 28138,&quot;Coconut-Apricot Macaroons 1/2 cup dried apricots or cherries, finely chopped 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Pinch fine salt 2 large egg whites, lightly beaten Finely grated zest of 1/2 orange 3 cups finely shredded sweetened coconut (about 8 ounces) 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips, melted, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the apricots, vanilla, salt, egg whites and orange zest together in a large bowl. Toss the coconut with the egg mixture until completely coated. Moisten your fingertips with water. Form about 1 heaping tablespoon of the batter at a time into a tight ball and place on the prepared sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the entire macaroon is nicely toasted and dry, 16 to 20 minutes. Transfer the baking sheets to a rack to cool. If desired, dip the bottoms of the cookies in the melted chocolate. Store the macaroons in a tightly sealed container for up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Gewrztraminer, Vinho Verde]&quot; 28139,&quot;Chopped Iceberg Salad with Roquefort Dressing 1/2 cup crumbled Roquefort cheese (about 2 ounces) 3 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 small head iceberg lettuce, chopped<br> 1 Persian or kirby cucumber, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced<br> 2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and roughly chopped<br> 1 cup shredded carrots<br> 1/2 cup grape tomatoes, halved<br> Instructions: Mix and mash the mayonnaise and 1/3 cup of the Roquefort in a medium bowl until the cheese is very finely crumbed. Mix in the vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Toss the lettuce, cucumber, eggs, carrots and tomatoes together in a large bowl. Add the dressing and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Top with the remaining Roquefort and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28140,&quot;Green cl Cheeseburgers 3 serrano chiles 2 Anaheim chiles 2 poblano chiles 1 Vidalia onion, peeled and roughly chopped Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Juice of 1 lime Canola oil, for grilling 2 pounds ground brisket (80/20 blend) Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 4 large brioche hamburger buns 2 tablespoons butter, melted 8 white Cheddar slices 4 butter lettuce leaves 1 Vidalia onion, thickly sliced 1 large heirloom tomato, thickly sliced Mayonnaise, for serving, if desired Instructions: Preheat the broiler to high. Begin by making the green cl salsa: Place the chiles on a roasting tray with the garlic and onions. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt, pepper and cumin and then place under the broiler to cook, 5 to 7 minutes. Once the skins have blistered and the onions have slightly charred around the edges, remove from the oven. Let cool slightly, then remove and discard the skins of the large chiles, along with the seeds and stems. Place the cl flesh, onions and garlic in a food processor. Add the lime juice and pulse 5 to 6 times to roughly chop the vegetables up; do not over chop as you want the salsa to be chunky and still have lots of texture where you can see pieces of the cl. Taste and season once more, then set aside as you prepare the burgers. For the burgers: Preheat an outdoor grill and wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted paper towel. This not only cleans the grill but creates a nonstick surface. Form the ground brisket into four 8-ounce patties about 1/2-inch thick. Make them slightly bigger in diameter than your buns, as they shrink when they cook. Also, add a dimple in the center as the burger puffs up in the middle when cooked, and this will ensure a flat, even patty. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper, and then place on the hot part of the grill. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes on one side, then flip the patties and top with the cheese. Close the grill or place a metal bowl over the top to melt the cheese and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Cut open the hamburger buns and lightly toast on the grill. To assemble, place the lettuce, onion and tomato on the base of the burger bun. Top with a grilled patty and place a heaping spoonful of roasted green cl salsa on top. Smear the top burger bun with mayo, if desired, and place the top half of the burger bun on top. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 28141,&quot;Baked Lemon Ziti Butter, for greasing the baking dish Salt 1 pound ziti pasta 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 12 ounces pancetta, sliced into 1/4-inch thick slices, chopped 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3 1/2 cups whole milk, at room temperature Zest of 2 large lemons 3/4 cup grated Parmesan 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup chopped fresh basil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from 1 large lemon) 2 cups shredded mozzarella 2/3 cup plain breadcrumbs 1/3 cup grated Parmesan Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Instructions: For the pasta: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.

With the motor running, slowly add in water and continue to mix until a soft and pliable dough forms, 3 to 5 minutes. Flatten the dough into a 6-inch round, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator to let rest for 30 minutes to 4 hours. For the Filling: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon canola oil over medium high heat until it smokes lightly. Remove the pan from the heat and add the ground beef in a single layer. Season with salt. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain the beef, transfer the meat to a large bowl, and set aside. In a separate skillet, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, season with salt, and cook until soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Mix the onions and garlic into the beef and chill in the refrigerator. Once the meat mixture is cooled, add cumin and cayenne and mix to combine cumin. Add the cream cheese and mix well. Meanwhile, on an open flame or grill, roast the poblanos on all sides until charred, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Set aside to let cool enough to handle. Remove the skin, seeds and ribs. Cut the peppers into small strips. Set aside to let cool. For Empanadas: Line a sheet tray with parchment paper and dust with flour, set aside. Lightly dust a flat work surface with flour. Roll out dough into a 1/8-inch thick sheet. Make sure you flour only one side of the dough (if you flour both sides this will prevent the dough from sticking together when crimping the empanada.) Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Use a 3-inch cookie cutter to stamp out 24 to 26 rounds. Place a couple of strips of poblano in the center of one round and top it with 1 tablespoon of the beef mixture. Fold the dough in half to form a half moon and crimp the edges together by gently pressing them with the tines of a fork to seal. Place the cookie cutter over the empanada and use the edge to cut off any excess dough. Repeat with the remaining poblano strips, filling, and dough. Place the empanadas as done in a single layer on the parchment-lined baking sheet that has been dusted with flour. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Place a wire rack on a sheet tray, set aside. In a medium pot with a heavy bottom, heat the remaining canola oil until it reaches 350 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Slowly place 3 to 4 empanadas into the hot oil (don&#39;t crowd the pot) and fry, stirring occasionally with a slotted spoon, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes total. Transfer cooked empanadas to a wire rack set over a sheet pan. Sprinkle immediately with salt. Working in batches, fry the remaining empanadas and arrange in a single layer on the rack. Place the sheet pan in the center of the oven and heat for 5 to 8 minutes to ensure the centers of the empanadas are warm. Serve empanadas with tomato salsa on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 28152,&quot;Grilled Sausage and Mushroom Toasts 1 pound zucchini, thinly sliced Kosher salt 1 pound portobello mushrooms, stems removed 1 small onion, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rings 1 red bell pepper, quartered 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for grilling and drizzling Freshly ground pepper 6 1/2-inch-thick slices crusty Italian or sourdough bread 3 links hot or sweet Italian sausage (8 to 10 ounces) 1/4 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese 3/4 cup fresh basil, torn, plus more for topping 1/2 cup drained marinated artichoke hearts, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high.

Preheat a double burner grill pan to medium-high heat. To spatchcock a chicken, place the bird breast-side down on a cutting board with its wing tips facing up and away from you. Feel down the back of the bird to find the spine then, using poultry shears or kitchen scissors, cut up and along the spine on each side. Remove the backbone and discard or save it to flavor a chicken stock. Flip the bird over, breast-side up. Place your hands at the center of the breast and press down to crack breastbone and flatten the bird. Trim the wing tips and discard or save for stock as well. In a small skillet set over medium heat, toast the caraway, cumin, coriander and black pepper until fragrant. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind to a powder. Place the spices in a small mixing bowl and add the pimento, granulated garlic, granulated onion and 2 teaspoons salt. Shove half of the rub under the skin and sprinkle the remainder all over the outside. Be sure to wash your hands. Spray the bird well with cooking spray. Place the chicken skin-side down on the grill pan to mark it, and then flip it. Place the chicken on a rack set over a baking sheet and bake until the internal temperature registers 165 degrees F, 30 to 40 minutes. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, baste the chicken with half of the Whisky BBQ Sauce. (Place the other half of sauce in a bowl and pass at the table.) Remove from oven, let cool for 5 to 10 minutes and cut into pieces. Garnish with scallions. Serve with the Ranch Slaw. While the chicken is in the oven, make the Whisky BBQ Sauce. Place a small to medium pot over medium heat and add the oil. Add the garlic and onions, and cook until fragrant and translucent. Add the chicken stock, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, cider vinegar, hot sauce, bourbon and tomato sauce. Bring to a simmer and reduce to thicken, about 30 minutes. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together buttermilk, sour cream, chives, dill, parsley, sugar, white wine vinegar, celery salt, kosher salt, black pepper, garlic, lemon juice and adjust the flavor if needed. Add carrots, cabbage and red onions. Stir to combine and let hang out for flavors to come together. Set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Bourbon, Scotch, Rioja, Chianti]&quot; 28159,&quot;Baked Ziti 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 large onion, diced<br> 1 pound ground beef<br> 1 pound Italian sausage<br> Two 14.5-ounce cans tomato sauce or marinara sauce<br> One 28-ounce can whole tomatoes with juice<br> 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning<br> 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound ziti 1 1/2 pounds mozzarella, grated<br> One 15-ounce tub whole-milk ricotta 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for sprinkling 2 eggs<br> Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and saute until starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ground beef and sausage and cook until browned. Drain off almost all of the fat, leaving a bit behind for flavor and moisture. Add the tomato sauce, tomatoes, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and some salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove 3 to 4 cups of the cooked sauce to a bowl to cool down. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add some salt. Cook the ziti until not quite al dente. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a bowl, mix 2 cups of the grated mozzarella, the ricotta, Parmesan, parsley, eggs and some salt and pepper. Stir together just a couple of times (do not mix completely). Drain the pasta and rinse under cool water to stop the cooking and cool it down. Pour it into the bowl with the cheese mixture and toss to slightly combine (there should still be large lumps). Add the cooled reserved meat sauce and toss to combine. Add half the coated pasta to a large casserole dish or lasagna dish. Spoon half of the remaining sauce over the top, then top with half the remaining mozzarella. Repeat with another layer of the coated pasta and the remaining sauce and mozzarella. Bake until bubbling, about 20 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before sprinkling with chopped parsley to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 28160,&quot;Bean and Vegetable Soup, First Time Around 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 4 slices bacon, diced 2 medium onions, finely diced 1 stalk celery, finely diced 2 carrots, finely diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 large zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch dice (2 cups) 14-ounce can (or 2 cups) canned plum tomatoes, chopped 1/2 head small savoy cabbage, cut into 1-inch pieces or finely sliced 2 cups washed spinach leaves, chopped roughly 2 cans (16 ounces each) white beans; rinsed and drained; one can pureed, the can of beans left whole 1/2 cup stemmed washed basil leaves cut into strips 4 cups chicken broth, preferably homemade 4 cups water Salt and freshly ground black pepper About 1/2 cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese Instructions: Heat olive oil and bacon and cook until bacon bits are almost crisp.

Recipe from \New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch. Published by William and Morrow, 1993. about 2/3 cup &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28162,&quot;Creme Brulee 1 quart heavy cream 1 vanilla bean, split, or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 10 egg yolks 3/4 cup superfine sugar, plus extra for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Pour the cream into a saucepan over medium-low heat. Scrape the vanilla caviar from the vanilla bean and add it to the cream (or add the vanilla extract if using instead). Bring almost to the boil, and then turn off the heat. Place the egg yolks in a large bowl and add 3/4 cup sugar. With a whisk, mix the eggs and sugar together. Now, break out your elbow grease and take a deep breath. You&#39;re going to need to whisk the mixture like crazy for 3 or 4 minutes, until it&#39;s very light yellow in color. Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl. Pour the hot cream into the bowl through the strainer. To temper the egg mixture, very slowly drizzle 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg/sugar mixture, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from cooking. Continue adding the rest of the hot cream to the bowl very slowly, whisking constantly. You can add the cream a little more rapidly as the mixture warms. Place ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet and ladle in the custard until the ramekins are three-quarters full. Place the baking sheet inside the oven, and then pour water into the baking sheet until it reaches two-thirds of the way up the ramekins. Bake until the custard is set but not brown, 35 to 40 minutes, watching carefully to avoid browning. Remove the ramekins and allow to cool. Refrigerate the custards, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight. When you are ready to serve the dessert, sprinkle the top of each custard generously with superfine sugar. Use a kitchen torch to burn the sugar to a crisp, working quickly to avoid cooking the custard below. (You may also place the ramekins on a pan and put them right under the broiler, but you have to be careful not to affect the custard below.) Serve immediately with spoons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28163,&quot;Grilled Italian Burgers Vegetable oil, for oiling the grill grates 1 1/2 pounds ground beef sirloin 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano 1 garlic clove, grated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 slices provolone cheese 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 4 seeded hamburger buns, split Fresh basil leaves, for topping Giardiniera, for serving Instructions: Prepare an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.

Squeeze out the excess milk with your hands then put the bread in a clean mixing bowl. Add parsley, cheese, garlic, copacola, pine nuts, and raisins. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil to moisten and mix thoroughly. Set the veal on a piece of plastic wrap. Make a deep slice along the veal breast and fan open like a book. Lay another piece of plastic wrap on top. Using the smooth side of a mallet, gently flatten the veal until it&#39;s about 1/2-inch thick; take care not to tear. Discard the top sheet of plastic wrap; rub the surface with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread the stuffing evenly over the meat, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Place the eggs lengthwise down the center of the meat and roll up like a jellyroll log, using the plastic wrap as support. Tie the roll with kitchen string to secure. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven or roasting pan. Brown the stuffed veal roast well on all sides. Cover with foil and bake in a preheated 375 degree F oven for 1 hour. Alternatively, deglaze with red wine, then pour tomato sauce on top to cover the braciole. Cover the pan and gently simmer for about 1 hour until tender.

Add 1-inch of water and place over medium-high heat and bring to a bare simmer, about 190 degrees F. (Yes, there&#39;s a towel in the pan\u2026it&#39;s okay.) Combine 30 grams (about 1/4 cup) of the confectioners&#39; sugar with the egg white in the bowl of your stand mixer, then park the bowl on the towel in the water. Tilt the bowl as needed so the egg mixture is in contact in the water. (Some mixers have an added piece of metal at the bottom that necessitates this.) Reduce the heat to medium and stir often with a rubber spatula until the egg mixture is smooth, foamy, and hits 160 degrees F, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the water and transfer bowl to the mixer. Kill the heat under the saute pan but leave it on the stove; you&#39;ll use it later. Add the corn syrup and mint oil to the egg mixture. Using the paddle attachment, beat on medium-high until combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down the bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to low, add one-quarter of the confectioners&#39; sugar, and beat until combined, 30 to 45 seconds. Continue to add the sugar in this manner until it&#39;s all incorporated, then continue beating until the mixture forms a dough, about 1 minute. Remove the paddle attachment and knead a few times with your hands to smooth out the dough and form it into a ball. If the dough does not form a ball, add 1/2 teaspoon of water, return the bowl to the mixer, and beat with the paddle until smooth. Lightly dust the counter and a rolling pin with the cornstarch. Transfer the dough to the counter and roll into a rectangle about 1/4-inch-thick. Use a 2-inch ring cutter to stamp out 25 to 30 rounds of dough. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, then re-roll and stamp the scraps. You should have about 3 dozen rounds of dough. If there is a lot of excess cornstarch remaining on the rounds, brush off with a pastry brush. Place the pan with the peppermint rounds near the cooktop and position a second pan next to it lined with either a silicone baking mat or a second sheet of parchment. Place a folded kitchen towel right next to the stovetop. Turn the heat under the saute pan back on to medium-high and let the water return to a bare simmer. Reduce the heat as low as it will go. Place the chocolate in a metal bowl that will fit in the saute pan and set in the hot water. Stir constantly for 5 seconds. Remove from the heat, set on the towel, and stir vigorously for 30 seconds. Return to the hot water and stir for another 5 seconds, then back to the dry towel for 30 seconds. Repeat until the chocolate is half-melted, then reduce the time the bowl is on the heat from 5 to 3 seconds. Keep the off-heat stir time at 30 seconds. The goal is to melt all the chocolate while keeping the temperature below 91 degrees F. This process can take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the chocolate pieces. If the chocolate begins to creep up above 91 degrees F, leave the bowl on the counter and stir like crazy until the temperature drops back down. Continue with the melting process. Once the chocolate is a smooth liquid, stir vigorously for another minute before dipping. Place a candy round into the bowl of chocolate and, using a fork, flip it over to coat both sides. Pull the candy from the chocolate, then tap the fork on the side of the bowl to remove as much excess chocolate as possible. Transfer to the silicone mat and repeat with the remaining candies. (If the chocolate becomes too thick or hard to work with, return it to the hot water for a few seconds, stirring constantly. Again, do not let the temperature rise above 91 degrees F.) Rest the candies at room temperature until the chocolate hardens, about 5 minutes. Devour or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28178,&quot;New!

Allow it to stand for about 5 minutes, until the yeast dissolves and the mixture has started to foam, which tells you the yeast is active. Stir in the milk, butter, honey, vanilla and salt. Add the flour and whisk until the batter is smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to sit overnight at a cool room temperature. The next morning, heat a Belgian waffle iron according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions and brush the top and bottom with melted butter. Beat the eggs together with the baking soda and whisk them into the batter until combined. Pour just enough of the batter onto the hot waffle iron to cover the grids (? to 1/2 cup each, depending on your waffle maker), close and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on medium heat, until the waffles are golden brown. Cut them apart with a small knife, if necessary, and remove them with a fork. Repeat the process until all of the batter has been used. Serve the waffles hot with sliced bananas, toasted coconut, maple syrup and creme fraiche and let everyone help themselves. Make-Ahead Plan Prepare the batter the night before.

Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has reduced and thickened, about 15 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups of the coconut and a pinch of salt and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the coconut completely absorbs the liquid, and the mixture starts to pull away from the sides of the pot, about 10 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and continue cooking until the mixture resembles a stiff dough, about 7 minutes. Transfer the mixture to another bowl to cool. Refrigerate uncovered until completely cool and thickened, about 30 minutes. For quick cooling, place the bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice water, making sure that the ice water doesn\u2019t reach more than three-quarters of the way up the outside of the smaller bowl. Stir the mixture occasionally to expedite the cooling process.<br> Once the mixture is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the cardamom seeds, then roll the mixture into 3/4-ounce balls (about 1-inch wide; about 18 total). Roll each ball between the palms of your hands until smooth and even. Put the remaining 1/2 cup coconut in a small wide bowl. Roll the balls around in the coconut until evenly coated.

Add the olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic, thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and then simmer uncovered until just tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Lower the heat and continue to cook, keeping a watchful eye, so the water evaporates completely and the potatoes are left covered in salt, about 30 minutes. Once the water has evaporated, cook for 3 to 4 minutes, lightly tossing; the oil left in the pan will help prevent the potatoes from sticking.

Add diced onion and saute until just translucent. Add entire can of diced tomatoes (including juice). Add 2 tablespoons of your favorite hot sauce (more or less depending upon your desired level of spicy-heat and that of the hot-sauce) and reduce heat to medium-low. Add entire can of pureed pumpkin, 3 tablespoons powdered curry seasoning, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 cup vegetable broth. Cook uncovered 20 minutes or until a yogurt-like consistency is achieved. Add 1 teaspoon powdered cayenne pepper (more or less such that desired spice-heat level is obtained) and salt and pepper to taste. Finally add 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil and remove from heat. Allow to cool. Use an immersion blender to puree until tomato and onion pieces are thoroughly incorporated Use immediately or store in refrigerator in sealed air-tight container This sauce is great for grilled vegetables, fish, and white-meat (our favorite is to use it on grilled sliced eggplant). Apply liberally and right from the beginning on fast-grilling foods like fish or thinly sliced vegetables and meats, apply about 1/2 way through the cooking time for each side for longer grilling foods).

Place the bread cubes on a sheet pan and bake for 15 minutes, tossing once, until lightly browned. Place the pancetta in one layer on another sheet pan and bake in the same oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Place the pancetta on a plate lined with paper towels and set aside. Soak the leeks in water until they&#39;re clean, and spin them dry in a salad spinner. Heat the butter in an 11-inch pot over medium heat; add the leeks and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the wine, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook for 5 minutes, until the wine almost evaporates and the leeks are tender. Off the heat, mix in the artichokes, toasted bread cubes, chives and tarragon. Whisk the eggs, cream, chicken stock, nutmeg and 1 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Spoon half of the bread mixture into a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with half the Emmentaler and add the remaining bread mixture. Pour on the cream mixture, sprinkle with the remaining Emmentaler and press lightly to help the bread absorb the liquid. Dice or crumble the pancetta, scatter on top and sprinkle with pepper. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the bread to absorb the cream mixture. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until the custard is set and the bread pudding is puffed and golden. Serve hot.

Bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve, separately reserving the liquid and peelings. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the same saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, 1/4 cup of the chopped carrot, celery, and sachet. Saute for about 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add the reserved Madeira liquid and stir to de-glaze the pan. Continue to cook for about 3 minutes or until the pan is almost dry. Add the rich chicken stock and cook about 4 minutes or until the liquid is reduced by half. Immediately strain through a fine sieve into a medium size, heat-proof bowl. Discard the solids. Set the liquid aside to cool. When the liquid is cool, whisk in the vinegar, 1/2 cup of the remaining olive oil, and the truffle oil. Season the truffle vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside. Remove the green part from the leeks (you may want to reserve this for making stock). Split leeks in half, lengthwise, down to but not through the root ends. Holding the leeks together by the root, rinse thoroughly under cold running water to remove all the grit. Pat dry. Place the leeks in a medium saucepan along with the chicken stock, butter, minced parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until the leeks are soft. Add the 1/2 cup of remaining diced carrots and simmer for 3 minutes. Cover and turn off the heat, but leave the pan on the burner to keep the leeks warm until ready to serve. While the leeks are cooking, prepare the halibut. Lightly season each piece of halibut with salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste. Place 2 truffle slices and 1 tarragon leaf on each side of the halibut. Using a large pastry brush, very lightly coat one side of 6 10-inch by 10-inch squares of plastic wrap with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Securely wrap each piece of fish in an oiled plastic wrap square. Place the halibut in the top half of a steamer over lightly simmering water. Cover and steam for 8 minutes per inch, or until the fish is just firm but slightly underdone in the center. Remove the fish from the steamer. Whisk the fines herbs into the reserved truffle vinaigrette. Spoon equal portions of the melted leeks into the center of each 6 warm dinner plates. Unwrap the fish and place one piece on top of the leeks. Drizzle the vinaigrette over the fish and around the edge of the plate. Garnish top with crispy leeks and serve. Add oil to deep fryer, or a 3-inch deep saute pan. Heat over medium-high until very hot but not smoking, and add the leeks. Quickly fry until the leeks are crisp, about 30 seconds. Remove leeks from oil immediately. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 28227,&quot;Pot Roast Sandwich 12 pounds flat bottom round Salt and freshly ground black pepper Oil, for griddle 1 pound chopped carrots 1 pound chopped celery 2 pounds Spanish onion 5 bay leaves 1 sprig fresh thyme 2 gallon water 1 old-fashioned bun Butter 3 ounces coleslaw 1 slice kosher pickle 3 ounces French fries Depot spice 1 (5-ounce) portion pot roast 3 ounces brown gravy 1-ounce fried onions Instructions: For the pot-roast sandwich: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. On a cutting board, cut the flat bottom round into 3-inch pieces. Season cut meat on both sides with kosher salt and black pepper. Add the meat to a lightly oiled griddle and brown well on both sides. Transfer the browned meat in a deep roasting pan. Add the chopped carrots, celery and onions around meat along with the bay leaves and fresh thyme. Pour in the water, cover with foil, and put into the oven for 3 hours. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and discard the foil. Remove the meat to a clean sheet pan and allow to cool slightly. Strain the liquid into a clean container and store in the refrigerator for future use. When the pot roast is cool enough to handle use clean latex gloves to shred the pot roast. Put the shredded meat into portion-size bags each weighing 5 ounces. Plating the pot roast sandwich: Heat the pot roast liquid in a small pot over low heat. For each serving: Split and butter an old fashioned bun and warm it on the griddle for about 1 minute. On an oval platter put 3 ounces of coleslaw at the 3:00 position with a pickle slice. Now put the lightly browned old fashioned bun at the 12:00 and 6:00 position. Place 3 ounces of French fries into the deep-fat fryer and cook until they are a light brown. Remove the French fries from fryer to paper towels to drain, and then season with the depot spice. Put the seasoned French fries at the 9:00 position.

Arrange the pine nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted, 6-8 minutes. Cool completely before using. For the polenta: Preheat the broiler. Bring 3 cups water and the salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the polenta and continue to stir until the polenta is thick, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the polenta to a sheet of parchment paper. Roll the polenta into a 2 1/2-diameter log. Refrigerate until cool, 30 minutes. Spray a heavy baking sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray. Slice the polenta into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice of polenta in half to make half-moon shapes and arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with the olive oil and sprinkle with the Parmesan. Broil until the cheese is golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes. For the goat cheese: Beat the goat cheese, cream, basil, salt and pepper in a medium bowl using an electric hand mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 minute. Stir in the pine nuts. Using two spoons to measure, place 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon-size dollops of the goat cheese mixture on top of the polenta slices and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 28243,&quot;Amazing Glazed Ham One 7- to 9-pound fully cooked spiral-cut ham 1 cup dark brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup grainy brown mustard<br> 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon chili powder<br> 3 medium oranges, zested and juiced<br> 2 cloves garlic, grated<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Let the ham sit at room temperature for 1 hour before baking. This will allow it to cook evenly. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Make the glaze: In a medium pot over medium-high heat, combine the brown sugar, mustard, vinegar, cinnamon, paprika, chili powder, orange zest and juice, garlic and some salt and pepper. Bring to a gentle boil and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place a rack in a roasting pan. Put the ham on the rack large open-face down (so the spiral cuts are stacked on top of one another). Brush half of the glaze over the surface of the ham, getting it between the slices as much as you can. Pour about an inch of water in the base of the roasting pan; the water should not touch the ham. Tent the pan loosely with aluminum foil and bake for about 10 minutes per pound (1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 25 minutes). Take the ham out of the oven and remove the foil. Raise the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Brush half of the remaining glaze on the ham. When the oven is up to temperature, return the ham, uncovered, and bake for 15 minutes. Brush the remaining glaze over the ham and cook for another 15 minutes. Carefully transfer the ham to a platter. Serve right away, or cover with foil and take it to your gathering! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 28244,&quot;Hot Fudge Milkshakes 3 cups vanilla bean ice cream 1 cup whole milk<br> Homemade Chocolate Sauce (see recipe below) Whipped cream and maraschino cherries, for garnish<br> Sweet and Salty Peanuts (see recipe below) 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon agave syrup<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups raw red skinned peanuts<br> Instructions: Add the ice cream and milk to a high-powered blender and blend on high until the mixture is creamy and pourable. Drizzle the Homemade Chocolate Sauce on the inside of 2 tall glasses, pour in the milkshake, and top with another drizzle of chocolate sauce. Top with a big dollop of whipped cream, a maraschino cherry and a few Sweet and Salty peanuts. Serve with a straw and a spoon. Add all the ingredients to a bowl set over a double boiler. Heat over medium heat, stirring every so often, until chocolate is melted. Switch to a whisk if necessary to combine all the ingredients. As the chocolate sauce cools, it will slightly harden. It can be rewarmed to a pourable consistency in the microwave, heating in 10 second increments until desired consistency is reached. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Add the butter, agave and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a small saucepan. Melt over medium heat.

Beat in a small portion of the water, followed by a small portion of the flour. Continue adding water and flour, beating after each addition, to make a smooth batter. Season with salt. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper or plastic wrap. Set aside. Brush a 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick pan with olive oil. Warm the pan over medium high heat. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan. Swirl the batter around the pan to evenly coat the bottom, and pour any excess batter into the bowl. The batter should cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Cook the crepe until bubbles appear, about 1 minute. Flip the crepe over and cook the other side for an additional minute. Remove to the prepared baking sheet and continue cooking crepes, placing waxed paper or plastic wrap over each one on the baking sheet. (If the crepes begin to stick to the pan, brush it with more oil.) With this batter you will be able to make 24 crepes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Divide 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce between 2 large baking dishes, and spread to cover the bottom with a thin layer. In a large bowl, stir together the ricotta, mozzarella, egg, parsley, besiamella, and spinach. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the Romano cheese and season with salt. Spread a rounded tablespoon of the filling across the bottom third of one crepe. Roll the crepe closed and place, seam side down, in one of the prepared baking dishes. Continue filling crepes and arranging them in the baking dishes, making sure that their sides don&#39;t touch. Spread a generous teaspoon of tomato sauce across the top of each crepe. Sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons Romano cheese. Cover the baking dishes with aluminum foil and bake until the crepes puff, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

Generously butter a 9-inch glass pie dish and arrange the apples in the dish, cut side down. Combine 1 cup of the granulated sugar and 1/3 cup water in a small saucepan and cook over high heat until it turns a warm amber color, about 360 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Swirl the pan but don&#39;t stir. Pour evenly over the apple slices. Meanwhile, cream the 6 tablespoons of butter and the remaining 3/4 cup of granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until light and fluffy. Lower the speed and beat in the eggs 1 at a time. Add the sour cream, zest, and vanilla and mix until combined. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt and, with the mixer on low speed, add it to the butter mixture. Mix only until combined. Pour the cake batter evenly over the apple slices and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes, then invert the cake onto a flat plate.

Line the sides and bottom of an 8 by 3 1/2-inch deep, round loose-bottomed cake tin with a layer of reusable silicon baking parchment. When lining the tin with the parchment, cut the material into strips that are twice as high as the tin itself (it is easier to use two shorter strips of parchment, than one long strip); the height of the strips protects the cake from catching on the outside of the cake tin. Place the fruit, butter, sugar, honey, coffee liqueur, orange zest and juice, mixed spice and cocoa into a large wide saucepan. Heat the mixture until it reaches a gentle boil, stirring the mixture as the butter melts. Let the mixture simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and leave to stand for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, the mixture will have cooled a little. Add the eggs, flour, ground almonds, baking powder and baking soda, and mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula until the ingredients have combined. Carefully pour the fruitcake mixture into the lined cake tin. Transfer the cake tin to the oven and bake for 1 3/4 to 2 hours, or until the top of the cake is firm but will has a shiny and sticky look. At this point, if you insert a sharp knife into the middle of the cake, the cake should still be a little uncooked in the middle. Place the cake on a cooling rack. Once the cake has cooled, remove it from the tin. To decorate, place the chocolate-covered coffee beans in the centre of the cake and arrange the gold stars around the perimeter of the top of the cake. Then sprinkle some gold mini-balls over the whole cake and sprinkle the top with edible glitter. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 28261,&quot;Coriander and Cumin Chicken Pita with Cucumber Salad and White Sauce 3 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for drizzling 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon dried oregano Kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon ground ginger Zest of 1 lemon 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs 6 pitas 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh dill 2 tablespoons white vinegar 1 large cucumber, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick half-moons 1 Roma tomato, diced 1/2 large red onion, thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup plain yogurt 2 tablespoons white vinegar 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder 1/2 tablespoon onion powder Instructions: For the chicken pita: Combine the oil, cumin, oregano, coriander, cayenne, ginger, lemon zest and 1 tablespoon salt in a medium bowl.

While processing, drizzle in enough oil to create an emulsified sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve. For the tapenade: Combine the olives, anchovies and garlic in a food processor and process. While processing, drizzle in enough oil to create an emulsified sauce. For the mashed potatoes: Put the potatoes in a pot, cover with cold salted water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until fork-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. In a separate saucepan heat up the milk. Drain the potatoes well to remove any excess water. Using a ricer, mash the potatoes into a mixing bowl while they are hot. Add the butter, mascarpone and a splash of the hot milk and fold into the potatoes until incorporated. Add just enough milk to achieve a velvety consistency. Season with salt and pepper. To keep warm until serving, place the bowl over a pot of simmering water. For the bison: Preheat the broiler on high. Place a large saute pan on high heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle both sides of the bison tenderloins well with salt and pepper and place on the smoking-hot pan to sear. Once a crust has formed on the bottom, remove the meat from the pan and slice it. Return the slices to the pan. Spread the slabs of butter on top of the meat. Season with a little more salt and pepper and place under the broiler until the butter is melted. Put the arugula in a bowl, drizzle with extra-virgin oil and toss together. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble: Barely fold 2 tablespoons of the tapenade into the potatoes. Place several pieces of the bison on each plate and top with a dollop of the piquillo pepper pesto. Spoon some of the pan butter sauce over the bison and garnish with some arugula. Put a scoop of the tapenade-marbled potatoes next to the bison and garnish with minced chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 28263,&quot;Tuna Tartare on Fried Potato Gaufrettes 1/2 pound ahi tuna, small dice 1/2 cup minced green onions 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger 1 teaspoon wasabi paste 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 1/4 cup soy sauce Lime juice or yuzu 1 pound potato, waffle sliced on a mandolin Cooking oil, for deep frying Salt Instructions: Preheat a deep pot of oil or a deep fryer to 325 degrees F.

Pour the warm water into a large bowl, then add the flour mixture and stir until combined. Stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to make a very sticky dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, dusting with more flour as needed, until the dough comes together and no longer sticks to your fingers, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat. Tightly cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Coat an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add the dough and stretch it to fit the baking sheet. Brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until puffy, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Make the sauce: Combine the tomatoes and their juices and the salt in a medium bowl and crush well with your hands or a potato masher. Uncover the dough and sprinkle with salt. Gently place the baking sheet in the oven (the dough might deflate if it is knocked). Bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven, top with the sliced mozzarella and cover with 2 cups of the crushed tomatoes. Bake until the cheese is bubbling through the sauce and starts browning, 15 to 20 more minutes. Let the pizza stand 10 minutes, then remove from the pan using a spatula and transfer to a cutting board. Let cool 1 to 2 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 28265,&quot;Spicy Turkey Breast 2 teaspoons toasted fennel seed, ground 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 1 cup crumbled store-bought cornbread 1/2 cup milk, at room temperature<br> 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed<br> 1/2 cup grated Pecorino cheese<br> 2 teaspoons Calabrian chili paste<br> 2 (2-pound) boneless, skin-on turkey breast halves, butterflied Six 1-inch thick slices ciabatta bread<br> 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Mix together the fennel seed, salt, oregano, onion powder and smoked paprika in a small bowl. Set aside. Mix together the cornbread and milk in a medium bowl. Allow the mixture to soak for 10 minutes. Stir in the sausage, Pecorino and chili paste. Use your hands to mix well. Lay the turkey breasts skin-sides down on a cutting board so that they are open like a book. Pat half the stuffing onto each skinless side, leaving a 1/2-inch border, then close each half so the skin sides are up. Tie each turkey breast tightly with 4 pieces of butcher&#39;s twine about 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart. Rub the seasoning mix all over the turkey. Lay the bread on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Place the turkey breasts skin-sides up on the bread and drizzle the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil over the tops. Roast 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and continue to roast until the skin is brown and crisp and an instant-read thermometer reads 160 degrees F, about 40 minutes more. Allow the turkey to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 28266,&quot;Pecan Rum Raisin Ice Cream 1/3 cup dark raisins 1/3 cup golden raisins 1/2 cup dark rum, such as Mount Gay 1 3-inch strip of orange zest 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 3/4 cup whole milk 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 2/3 cup sugar, divided 4 extra-large egg yolks Pinch of kosher salt 1/2 cup pecans, toasted, cooled and roughly chopped (see note) Instructions: Place the dark and golden raisins, rum and orange zest in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, remove from the heat, cover and set aside. Meanwhile, pour the cream, milk, vanilla bean and 1/3 cup of the sugar into a large saucepan and heat it to a simmer over medium heat. Place the egg yolks, the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar and the salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until very thick. When the beater is lifted, the mixture will fall back on itself in a slow ribbon. With the mixer on low, pour 1/2 cup of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture. While stirring with a wooden spoon, pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring almost constantly, for 8 to 10 minutes, until thickened (175 degrees F to 180 degrees F on a candy thermometer). The mixture will be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon (your finger should leave a trail on the back of the spoon). Immediately pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the vanilla bean. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, until cold. When ready to freeze, drain the raisin mixture, reserving the rum and discarding the orange zest. Mix 3 tablespoons of the drained rum into the cream mixture (discard the rest). Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. At the end, stir in the raisins and pecans, transfer to a quart container and freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Port, Tawny Port, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 28267,&quot;Green Beans and Cherry Tomatoes 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cloves garlic, chopped 1 pint cherry tomatoes, sliced in half 1 pound green beans, ends trimmed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over a medium-high heat in a large skillet.

With a rubber spatula or large spoon, very gently fold the crab and panko into the mixture. Try to avoid breaking up lumps of crab as much as possible. Cover the crab mixture with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. This will allow the panko to absorb more liquid and help bind the crab cakes together better. For the chipotle sauce: While the crab mixture is resting, stir together the mayonnaise, sour cream, chipotles and adobo sauce, chives, parsley and lemon zest and juice in a small bowl until combined. Season with salt and black pepper and set aside. (The sauce can be refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap, up to 1 day.)<br> Just before cooking, divide the crab-cake mixture into 4 portions. Lightly compact each portion to form a patty (about 3 1/2 inches in diameter) with your hands to ensure they hold their shape while cooking and place onto a large plate.<br> Preheat the air fryer to 375 degrees F and spray the basket with cooking spray. Place the crab cakes into the basket and spray the tops with cooking spray. Cook until deep golden brown and crisp, flipping halfway through and spraying again with cooking spray, about 16 minutes.

Place the lobster in a pot and cover with the beer. Add the garlic and lemon and bring to a boil. Boil until the lobster shell turns a reddish color, 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately put the lobster into the ice bath to cool for approximately 5 minutes. Remove the lobster meat from the shell and chop into small chunks. For the crab and lobster mixture: Over medium-high heat in a saute pan, saute the olive oil, shallots and garlic until the shallots become slightly caramelized. Add the peppers. Add the crab and lobster to the pan and continue to saute, about 5 minutes. Add the Creole and seafood seasoning and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice. For the breadcrumb mixture: In a large mixing bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, peppers, basil, thyme, dill, black pepper, cayenne, nutmeg and salt. Add the crab and lobster mixture from saute pan and mix together. Add the half-and-half, Parmigiano-Reggiano and eggs and mix to combine. Form the mixture into 8 patties and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour. For the sauce: Mix together the Thai chili sauce, mayonnaise and red pepper flakes in a bowl until combined. Heat some oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry the crabby lobster patties on each side until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Place the crabby lobster patties on the buns and top with the sauce and some arugula or spinach. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 28270,&quot;Huckleberry Ketchup 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 medium yellow onions, minced 1 teaspoon minced garlic 12 Roma plum tomatoes, seeded and quartered 3 pounds huckleberries, or blueberries, strawberries, blackberries or any combination 2 cups dry red wine 1 cup red wine vinegar 2 oranges, zested and juiced 8 juniper berries 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 2 bay leaves 1 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup gin (optional) Instructions: In a large saucepan heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook until they begin to caramelize, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes and cook, stirring often, until they start to release some of their moisture, about 5 minutes. Add the huckleberries to the pot, reduce the heat to medium low, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients, except the gin, and stew over medium heat until the mixture is thick and has reduced in volume by nearly 3/4, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Soak in the fridge overnight or up to 24 hours.<br> When you&#39;re ready to fry the chicken, remove the bowl from the fridge and let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes, just to take the chill off. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 360 degrees F and mix up the breading. Place the flour, seasoned salt, paprika, black pepper, thyme and cayenne (plus extra cayenne if you like heat) in a very large bowl. Stir together well. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup buttermilk and the milk. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and gradually mix with a fork until there are little lumps throughout; these will adhere to the chicken and make for a crispier breading. If necessary, add a little more flour or milk to make the breading slightly lumpy. Heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer reaches 365 degrees F. Lower the heat slightly, if necessary, to keep the oil from getting hotter. Working in batches, thoroughly coat each chicken piece with breading, pressing extra breading onto the chicken if necessary. Place the breaded pieces on a plate. Add the breaded chicken to the oil, 3 or 4 pieces at a time; make sure they don&#39;t stick together. Cover the pan and fry for 5 to 7 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the chicken isn&#39;t getting too brown. Turn the pieces over, cover again, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes more. All the while, monitor the temperature of the oil to make sure the chicken doesn&#39;t burn. Transfer the fried chicken to a baking sheet and continue frying the rest of the chicken. When all the chicken has been fried, remove the wings and legs to a plate and keep covered. (These should be cooked all the way through by now, but always check if any pink juice or meat is visible. If so, return to the hot oil for another minute or so, until fully cooked.) Leave the thighs and breasts on the baking sheet. Bake the thighs and breasts for 15 minutes to finish cooking. (Sometimes I&#39;ll cut into the thicker part of one of the larger pieces just to make sure the chicken is cooked through. If any pink juice or meat is visible, the chicken needs to continue cooking in the oven.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, GSM]&quot; 28273,&quot;Oven-Dried Tomatoes 12 firm-ripe Roma tomatoes Olive oil Kosher salt Pepper 1 teaspoon dried thyme Instructions: Preheat an oven to 275 degrees. Slice each tomato in 1/2 lengthwise, without coring. Then slice each piece in 1/2 again, top to bottom, so that you have 4 equal-size slices from each tomato. Push or squeeze out seed pockets. Lightly brush a large baking sheet with olive oil. Spread tomato slices on baking sheet. Brush tops of tomatoes lightly with more oil, then sprinkle generously with salt, pepper, and thyme. Put tomatoes in oven and bake until dehydrated but still slightly flexible, about 2 hours (check after 1 1/2 hours and make sure tomatoes are not scorching). &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 28274,&quot;Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches 3 large egg whites 1/2 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 14-ounce package sweetened shredded coconut 3 pints vanilla ice cream, slightly softened Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk the egg whites, sugar, salt and vanilla in a large bowl until combined; fold in the coconut. Flatten heaping tablespoonfuls of the coconut mixture into 2-inch disks; place them about 1 inch apart onto the baking sheet. Bake until golden brown around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Gently sandwich the macaroons with the vanilla ice cream; freeze until set, at least 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 28275,&quot;Chinatown Steamed and Roasted Duck 1 whole (4 to 5 pound) duck 1 tablespoon Chinese five-spice powder 2 teaspoons sugar 2 teaspoons salt 5 big slices fresh ginger 4 garlic cloves 1/2 bunch green onions 1 tangerine,peel cut in big strips 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup soy sauce Instructions: Duck is notoriously a fatty bird, to diminish the fat and produce a crispy skin, begin by trimming the excess fat from the neck and body. Rinse the duck, inside and out, and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Combine the Chinese five-spice, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture all over the duck, inside and out. Salt and five-spice powder makes a fragrant dry marinade, which draws some of the moisture from the duck so that the spices penetrate. Stuff the duck cavity with the aromatics: the ginger, garlic, green onions, and tangerine peel. Fold the wing tips back under the duck and tie the legs together with kitchen string. Poke the duck breast a few times, piercing the skin. Place a roasting pan on the stovetop over 2 burners and fill with 2-inches of water, turn the heat to medium. Set a V-rack insert inside the pan and lay the duck on the rack, breast-side up. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Steam the duck for 45 minutes, checking the water level periodically. Steaming the duck first melts away some of the fat and shrinks the skin. In a small saucepan combine the vinegar, honey, and soy sauce over low heat. Cook and stir for 5 minutes until thick. The duck will be lacquered with the sweet glaze, which caramelizes during roasting, making the skin crisp and brown. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Take the foil off the duck, remove the rack with the duck, and pour out the water and all the fat that has rendered out (this is great to use in other dishes like fried rice.) Put the rack with the duck back inside the roasting pan. Baste the duck with the vinegar mixture, until all the skin is completely coated in the glaze. Stick the whole thing in the oven. Roast the duck for 1 hour, basting periodically with any remaining glaze to set in a deep mahogany color. Tent the breast with some foil if it gets too dark. The legs will wiggle easily when it&#39;s done. Carve and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 28276,&quot;Pulled Pork Tacos with Citrus Salsa One 3-pound boneless pork shoulder, trimmed, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil One 14.5-ounce can low-sodium chicken broth (2 cups) 1 cup orange juice 1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds or 1 teaspoon ground cumin 3 jalapeno chiles, halved lengthwise 3 cloves garlic, smashed 1 onion, coarsely chopped 3 large oranges 1 grapefruit 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 tablespoon agave or honey 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Eight 6-inch corn tortillas 1/2 head napa cabbage, finely shredded (about 2 cups) Instructions: For the pork: Sprinkle the pork with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a 5-quart saucepan. Cook the pork until brown, about 10 minutes. Add 3 cups water, the chicken broth, orange juice, cumin, chiles, garlic and onion. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the pork is very tender, for 2 hours. Shred the pork into small pieces, using 2 forks. Season with salt and pepper. For the salsa: Cut the ends off the oranges and grapefruits, place cut-side down on the counter, and cut away the peel. Using a paring knife, cut along the membrane on both sides of each segment. Coarsely chop the fruit segments. Squeeze the juice from the membranes and reserve. Whisk together 2 tablespoons of the reserved citrus juice, oil, honey, vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl until smooth. Add the fruit segments and toss until coated. To serve: Warm the tortillas by holding them over a burner for 30 seconds on each side or place in a dry skillet and heat over medium heat until warmed through.

Toss scallops with melted butter, garlic, shallots, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Transfer to shallow casserole dish. Combine extra-virgin olive oil and bread crumbs. Scatter bread crumbs over scallops and place in the casserole. Bake scallops 10 to 12 minutes or until bread crumbs are deep golden and scallops are opaque. Heat a small skillet over medium to medium high heat. Coat pan with oil and butter and add room temperature fillet of beef steaks. Meat will sear in hot pan. Cook beef 4 minutes on each side for medium. Season meat with grill seasoning or coarse salt and pepper once meat is fully cooked so the salt will not draw out juices prematurely. Let meat rest 5 minutes for juices to redistribute. Return pan to heat and deglaze, using liquid to combine any pan drippings. Add Madeira, reduce by half, and add tarragon to the pan. Set aside. Steam asparagus tips in 1/4 inch boiling water for 3 minutes and drain. Return tips to warm pan and combine with drained artichoke hearts, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Toss half the butter and lard in the flour to coat, then use a pastry blender or knives or your fingers to cut in the fats until pea sized or a bit smaller. Toss the rest of the butter and lard into the mixture, then cut in again until the mixture resembles coarse meal with some larger chunks of fat throughout. Use your finger to draw a trench down the center of the mixture, and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the water down the trench and around the outside of the flour. Toss the flour with the water using your fingers or a rubber spatula. Repeat until the dough comes together in shaggy chunks. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured board and use the heel of your hand to smear pieces of dough away from you. Gather the dough together with a pastry scraper and press into a large disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate a few hours before using. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough just slightly thicker than 1/8-inch. Cut out 5-inch circles, place on parchment on a baking sheet, and chill while you prepare the filling. Melt the butter in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the brown sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the Calvados and cook for 1 minute. Add the apples and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the lemon juice, cinnamon and ginger and cook until the apples are caramelized and just cooked through, about 10 minutes longer. Scrape into a shallow bowl or onto a baking sheet and let cool to room temperature. Place 1 of the dough circles on a flat surface and place a few tablespoons of the apple filling onto one half of each circle of dough.

Insert a chopstick through the neck opening and force along the wing bone under the skin until it protrudes slightly at the second joint. Push other end along other wing so that you end up with a duck that has its arms straight out like a crucifix. Tie a string onto the middle of the stick so you can hold the duck and hang it up. Bring 6 cups of water to boil in a wok, over medium heat. Add maltose or honey and stir to dissolve. Stir in the sherry, vinegar and cornstarch slurry. When liquid returns to a boil, dip the duck into liquid and spoon liquid over duck. Repeat until duck is thoroughly moistened. Repeat dunking once more. Hang duck by the string in a cool airy place with a bowl underneath to catch drips. Leave for 4 to 6 hours until skin is dry and taught. Put roasting pan on lower oven rack and fill with 2 to 3 inches of water. Oil the upper rack above pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the chopstick and string. Put duck on oiled rack in center of oven breast side up and cook for 30 minutes. Turn duck breast side down for 45 minutes, then turn breast side up for 30 minutes or until skin is dark brown. While duck is roasting, make scallion brushes. Trim roots, and cut off most of green part, leaving 3-inch pieces. Make several 1-inch lengthwise slits in each end of scallion, and put in a bowl of ice water for 20 minutes, drain and refrigerate. Mix hoisin with sesame oil and 1 tablespoon water, in a small serving bowl. Carve the duck, separate meat and skin. Place on a serving platter and surround with the scallion brushes. Serve the sauce with the duck. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28306,&quot;Steak Sandwich 1 (12-ounce) 1-inch thick New York strip boneless beef top loin steak Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Olive oil 2 yellow onions, sliced in rings 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 1 recipe Mustard Mayo, recipe follows 2 mini focaccia buns, sliced in 1/2 1/2 cup baby arugula 3/4 cup good mayonnaise 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard 2 tablespoons sour cream 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Season the steak liberally with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium saute pan over high heat until it&#39;s almost smoking, then sear the steak on each side for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low and cook the steak for about 7 to 10 minutes, turning once, until very rare in the middle. Remove to a plate, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to sit for 10 minutes. Slice the steak into strips. Using the same saute pan, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and thyme and saute for 10 minutes, until the onions are brown and caramelized, stirring occasionally. To assemble the sandwiches, spread a tablespoon of Mustard Mayo on the bottom half of each bun. Place a layer the steak strips on top of the mayo, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and top with the caramelized onion rings. Place the baby arugula on top of the onion rings, and cover the sandwiches with the top half of the buns. Mustard Mayo: Whisk the ingredients together in a small bowl. Serve at room temperature.

Remove the excess fat from the tripe and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Rinse the hominy well in a colander under running water. Wash the pigs feet well also. Combine all ingredients, except for garnishes, in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to low and simmer slowly until hominy opens and is cooked. Do not overcook. Skim the excess fat from the surface. It is best if you can refrigerate the Menudo in order to remove all of the grease. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with additional fresh cilantro, chopped green onions, minced pequin chiles, and lemon wedges. Serve with toasted bolillos (a Mexican bread made with corn flour). &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 28308,&quot;Jansson&#39;s Temptation 8 medium all-purpose potatoes (about 3 3/4 pounds), peeled and halved lengthwise 2 large yellow onions, peeled and halved lengthwise 1 (2-ounce) tube anchovy paste 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup heavy cream, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups milk, at room temperature Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly coat a shallow 3-quart baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Equip the food processor with the slicing disk (the thin slicing disk, if you have one). Stand as many pieces of potato in the feed tube as will fit, then exerting gentle pressure on the pusher, pulse the potatoes through the slicing disk. Repeat until all the potatoes have been sliced. As the work bowl fills, scoop the potatoes onto a large piece of waxed paper. Scoop the last batch of sliced potatoes onto the waxed paper and reserve. Slice the onions just as you did the potatoes, transfer to a second sheet of waxed paper, and reserve. Remove the slicing disk from the processor and insert the chopping blade. Add the anchovy paste, butter, flour, pepper, and 1/2 cup of the cream to the processor and churn 3 to 5 seconds until smooth. Add the remaining cream and the milk and pulse 4 to 5 times to incorporate. Layer 1/3 of the potatoes in the prepared casserole, spreading evenly, top with 1/3 of the onions and 1/3 of the anchovy mixture. Repeat twice. The anchovy mixture should just be visible in the casserole; it should not cover the onions and potatoes. Bake uncovered on the middle oven rack until bubbling and nicely browned, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let stand 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28309,&quot;Vegetable \Frankie<br> 3 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 cups yellow squash, quartered and sliced 1/4-inch thick 1/2 cup zucchini, quartered and sliced 1/4-inch thick 2 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 cup English peas, shelled and blanched in salted water 1/2 cup sugar snap peas, blanched in salt water 1/2 cup haricot vert, cut into 1-inch pieces and blanched 1 large onion, peeled and sliced thin 1 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon turmeric One 1-inch piece fresh ginger root, peeled and minced 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic Salt Freshly crushed black pepper 4 tablespoons canola oil Mixed vegetables 2 eggs beaten with 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro 4 wheat flour tortillas 1 fresh chili, sliced thin Coriander Chutney Chat masala Cilantro Mint sprigs Salt and pepper Instructions: Method for the vegetables: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the zucchini and the yellow squash with 1 tablespoon of the oil, salt, and pepper and roast until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. In a large rondeau, add 2 more tablespoons of the canola oil and heat over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the cumin and cook for 2 more minutes. Add the onions and continue to cook until lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Next, add the garlic, ginger, and turmeric and cook for 3 more minutes. Season well and cool the onions down. Combine the onions with the rest of the cooked vegetables and mix well. Reserve.<br> For the Frankie: Heat the mixed vegetables in a saute pan until warm. In a large saute pan heat a very small amount of oil. Add the tortilla and a ladle of the beaten eggs. Lift the tortilla up so that the eggs are underneath the tortilla. Once the eggs on that side are cooked (1 minute), flip the tortilla and cook the eggs on the other side. Remove the tortilla from the pan onto a tray. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and eggs. Place the vegetables on top and season with salt, chaat masala and pepper. Place a few sprigs of mint and cilantro on top of the vegetables. Add a few chilies and cover with the chutney. Roll and slice in half.

Cover, set the slow cooker on HIGH, and cook for 1 hour. Reduce the heat to LOW and cook until the duck is very, very tender--at least 4 and up to 8 hours. Use a slotted spoon to remove the duck from the fat, which can be strained, frozen, and reused. Serve the duck hot or at room temperature, or use it to make cassoulet. There are three ways to get chicken fat for this recipe: You can skim congealed fat off the top of chicken soup or stock, buy it in a plastic tub from a kosher butcher, or make it yourself. To make your own, place raw chicken fat in a heavy saucepan and cook very slowly over medium-low heat until the fat has melted, the connective tissue has darkened and crisped, and any water has evaporated. Strain the rendered fat into a bowl. Rendered chicken fat can be kept in a sealed container in the freezer for up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28311,&quot;Twice-Baked Potatoes 8 baking potatoes, washed 3 tablespoons canola oil 2 sticks salted butter 1 cup bacon bits (fry your own!) 1 cup sour cream 1 cup Cheddar or Jack cheese (or a mix of both), plus more for topping 1 cup whole milk 2 teaspoons seasoned salt 3 green onions, sliced Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet. Rub them with the canola oil and bake for 1 hour, making sure they&#39;re sufficiently cooked through. Slice the butter into pats. Place in a large mixing bowl and add the bacon bits and sour cream. Remove the potatoes from the oven. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F. With a sharp knife, cut each potato in half lengthwise. Scrape out the insides into the mixing bowl, being careful not to tear the shell. Leave a small rim of potato intact for support. Lay the hollowed out potato shells on a baking sheet. Smash the potatoes into the butter, bacon and sour cream. Add the cheese, milk, seasoned salt, green onions and black pepper to taste and mix together well. (IMPORTANT: If you plan to freeze the twice-baked potatoes, do NOT add the green onions.) Fill the potato shells with the filling. I like to fill the shells so they look abundant and heaping. Top each potato with a little more grated cheese and pop &#39;em in the oven until the potato is warmed through, 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28312,&quot;Supreme Pizza Pasta Salad 2 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped 1/2 medium red onion, chopped 8 fresh white button mushrooms, sliced 1 small green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 1 stick pepperoni, casing removed and cut into a small dice 1 pound ball fresh mozzarella or fresh smoked mozzarella, diced 20 leaves fresh basil, torn or thinly sliced 1 pound wagon wheel pasta, cooked to al dente and cooled under cold water, then drained 1 teaspoon garlic salt 1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves or Italian dried seasoning 1 rounded tablespoon tomato paste 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, eyeball it 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine tomatoes, onion, mushrooms, peppers, pepperoni, mozzarella, basil and pasta in a big bowl.

Line 2 (1/2 cup-12 capacity) muffin tins with cupcake papers. In a small bowl, combine the flours. Set aside. In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugar gradually and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, alternating with the milk and vanilla. With each addition, beat until the ingredients are incorporated but do not over beat. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the batter in the bowl to make sure the ingredients are well blended. Carefully spoon the batter into the cupcake liners, filling them about 3/4 full. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cupcake comes out clean. Cool the cupcakes in tins for 15 minutes. Remove from the tins and cool completely on a wire rack before icing. Place the butter in a large mixing bowl. Add 4 cups of the sugar and then the milk and vanilla. On the medium speed of an electric mixer, beat until smooth and creamy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Gradually add the remaining sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition (about 2 minutes), until the icing is thick enough to be of good spreading consistency. You may not need to add all of the sugar. If desired, add a few drops of food coloring and mix thoroughly. (Use and store the icing at room temperature because icing will set if chilled.) Icing can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 28317,&quot;Pull-Apart Cupcake Snowman 23 vanilla cupcakes 13 chocolate wafer cookies 5 cups vanilla frosting 5 small chocolate candies (such as Junior Mints) 1 circus peanut 6 ounces blue fondant Instructions: Arrange 14 cupcakes in a tight circle on a platter or cake board for the body and 7 cupcakes in a smaller tight circle for the head.

Mix the mint and vanilla extracts with the egg in a small bowl with a fork. Beat together the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed until the butter has picked up the sugars, about 30 seconds. (If using an electric hand mixer, beat about 2 minutes.) Increase the speed to medium and beat, stopping halfway to scrape the bowl, until slightly creamy, about 1 minute (about 3 minutes with a hand mixer).<br> Reduce the speed to low, slowly add the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture a heaping cup at a time in 2 additions, stopping a few times to scrape the bowl and beaters. (If using a hand mixer, increase the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning.) Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium (higher with a hand mixer) and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 2 minutes (about 5 minutes with a hand mixer).<br> Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide the dough into 2 even pieces, each about 11 ounces. Shape each piece into a 6-inch square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.<br> Remove one of the dough squares from the refrigerator and let soften until just pliable but still cool and firm, about 15 minutes. Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Dust a piece of parchment with flour. Dust the dough square with flour and roll it out on the parchment to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Lift the dough occasionally by sliding a metal spatula or bench scraper underneath to make sure it isn&#39;t sticking to the parchment. Cut out Christmas trees with a 2-inch cutter as close together as possible and transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1 inch between the trees. Gather together the scraps and roll and cut more cookies. Chill the cookies on the baking sheets in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking.<br> Bake, rotating the baking sheets from front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until the cookies are light golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool the cookies about 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, remove the second dough square from the refrigerator to soften until just pliable but still cool and firm, about 15 minutes. Repeat the rolling, cutting, chilling and baking procedures with the second dough square. For the green royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until the frosting thickens. The icing should be pure white and thick but not fluffy and bubbly. (If the frosting is overbeaten, it will get aerated, which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit for a bit to settle, then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the icing.) Add the green and red food coloring and beat until evenly distributed and the color is a deep hunter green. Put the icing in a resealable plastic bag and snip the corner to make a tiny opening (or put the icing in a piping bag with a 1/16-inch tip).<br> To decorate: Pipe a dot of icing onto the top point of each tree. Stick a chocolate nonpareil candy on each dot. Pipe the icing onto the cookies in zigzags to make a tree design. Sprinkle white nonpareils around the icing as snow. Let the icing set at room temperature, at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28329,&quot;Cajun Hollandaise 3 large egg yolks Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) salted butter, melted and hot<br> 1 tablespoon Creole mustard<br> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Add the egg yolks and lemon juice to a blender and blend for several seconds.

Using an electric mixer, whip the cream cheese and sour cream in a small bowl until fluffy. Add the granulated sugar and whip until well combined, making sure there are no lumps. Reserve for later use. Beat the egg and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl with a fork. Unfold 1 pastry sheet on a lightly floured flat surface. Roll the pastry into a 14-by-12-inch rectangle. Spoon half of the cream cheese mixture lengthwise down the center of the pastry. Cut slits 1 inch apart from the 2 sides of the pastry rectangle within 1/2 inch of the cream cheese mixture. Arrange half of the strawberries down the center of the pastry on top of the cream cheese mixture. Starting at one end, fold the pastry strips over the strawberries on a diagonal, alternating sides, to cover the strawberries. Repeat the entire process with the remaining pastry sheet, cream cheese filling and strawberries. Brush the pastries very lightly with the egg wash (otherwise they won&#39;t rise). Sprinkle with the demerara sugar and top with pistachios. Bake until golden brown, 30 minutes.

Place the egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof mixing bowl and beat until pale yellow in color and all of the sugar has dissolved. Temper about 1/2 a cup of the cream mixture into the egg mixture and whisk vigorously to incorporate well. Add the remainder of the cream mixture to the bowl and whisk vigorously to incorporate. Strain the brulee base through a fine mesh sieve and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the custard into 6 (5-ounce) oval ramekins or gratin dishes, and place the dishes in a sheet pan or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come up half way on the sides of the ramekins. Place the pan in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 30 minutes, turning the sheet pan around after 15 minutes to ensure even cooking. To test for doneness, jiggle the pan slightly to see if the custard is set, if so, remove from the oven and let cool at room temperature before placing them in the refrigerator for 2 hours to completely cool. Once the brulee has cooled, evenly spread 1 tablespoon of sugar over each ramekin and using a blowtorch, caramelize the sugar to form a candy coating. Be sure to keep the blowtorch moving in a circular motion to prevent the sugar from burning. Serve once the sugar has cooled and is hard like candy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28355,&quot;Guasacaca Sauce 1 medium onion, roughly chopped 2 green peppers, seeded, deveined, and roughly chopped 2 ripe avocados, peeled and seeded 2 cloves garlic 1/2 bunch fresh parsley leaves 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro leaves 1/3 cup red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon salt, or to taste 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1 cup olive oil Instructions: Put everything except the olive oil into a food processor and process until mostly smooth.

Combine the beef, salt, allspice, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, pepper flakes, brown sugar, thyme and black pepper in a large bowl and gently mix until just combined. Form the meat into eight 2-ounce patties, then press the center of each with your thumb to create an indent. Coat the grill pan with cooking spray. Grill the sliders indent-side up until the internal temperature registers 150 degrees F, 2 to 3 minutes per side, placing a slice of cheese on each patty once you flip them. Cover the patties on the grill pan with a metal bowl to allow the cheese to melt. (The cheese will melt over the sides of the patties.) Remove the patties to a plate and cover loosely with foil to rest. Meanwhile, brush the buns with the melted butter and grill until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes per side. Assemble the sliders by putting a tablespoon-sized dollop of the Ketchup on the bun tops and bottoms, then top each bottom with a patty. Finish with one Onion Ring on top of each slider. Close sliders and serve immediately. Combine the ketchup, lime juice, allspice, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, pepper flakes, brown sugar, thyme and salt in a medium nonreactive bowl and mix until incorporated.<br> Pour 4 inches oil into an 8-quart Dutch oven and bring to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, peel the onions and slice into 1/2-inch-thick rings. Combine the flour, salt, garlic powder and black pepper in a large bowl. Whisk in the ale until the ingredients are combined. The batter should be thick but slightly loose. Place a wire rack in a sheet pan. Working in batches, dip the onion rings into the batter. Drain any excess batter back into the bowl, then slowly lower the onions into the hot oil. Cook, flipping the onions every 30 seconds, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the onions to a wire rack with a spider and lightly season with sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 28362,&quot;Caprese Salad with Homemade Mozzarella 2 gallons water, divided 2 pounds whole milk mozzarella curd (available at specialty Italian markets) 2 tablespoons kosher salt, divided, plus more for serving Roma tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick Fresh basil Extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large pot, heat a gallon of water to a simmer. In a large bowl, break up the mozzarella curd into small pieces. Coat the curd with 1 tablespoon salt, and set aside. In another large bowl, add remaining salt to the second gallon of water along with as much ice as it can hold. This is where it gets a little tricky. Carefully pour the hot water over the salted curd. As the curds begin to melt, carefully stir with a wooden spoon or spatula for 1 minute. Submerge both of your hands in the ice water for as long as you can stand it, because you&#39;re about to stretch the mozzarella in hot water. To protect your hands, you may wear rubber gloves if desired. The curd will have settled into the bottom of the bowl, and at this point you have to work quickly or risk over-cooking the curd and it becoming rubbery. Dip your hands into the hot water and begin stretching the mozzarella. By stretching the cheese, you insure that all the curds have completely melted. Form the mozzarella into tomato size balls, and then drop the mozzarella into the ice water to set. Slice the mozzarella in 1/4-inch slices. On a serving platter, arrange mozzarella and tomato slices, alternating and overlapping a bit. Top with basil. Drizzle with olive oil; season salt and pepper. Wrap remaining mozzarella balls tightly in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 28363,&quot;Striped Bass with Tomato and Basil Cream 1 teaspoon olive oil 1/4 cup chopped scallions 1 large ripe tomato, chopped 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 1/2 cup chardonnay (recommended: Wolffer Estate Selection Chardonnay) 1 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup chardonnay (recommended: Wolffer Estate Selection Chardonnay) 1/4 cup verjus* (recommended: Wolffer Verjus) 1 (4 to 5-pound) striped bass fillet, cut into 6 equal pieces Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Add heavy cream, reduce the heat, and simmer until the desired thickness is reached. Keep warm until ready to serve. After you have started the sauce, bake the fillet: place butter, chardonnay, and verjus in a baking pan. Season fish with salt and pepper and place in pan. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until fish is cooked through; the fish should be opaque throughout and a knife should slide in easily. Place fillets on a serving plate and spoon over the sauce.

Add the steak to the bag and flip so the steaks are coated with the marinade. Marinate for 2 hours in the refrigerator. Heat one side of the grill to medium-high heat and the other side of the grill to medium-low heat. Let the steaks come up to room temperature for 30 minutes before grilling. Let the excess marinade drip off the steaks and sprinkle the steaks generously on both sides with the salt and pepper. Place the steaks on the hotter side of the grill and sear on each side until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side. Move the steaks to the cooler side of the grill and continue cooking until a meat thermometer reaches 120 degrees F, another 3 minutes per side. Let the steak rest for 10 minutes, the temperature will rise to 125 degrees, for medium rare. If you prefer a medium steak, cook until the temperature reaches 130 degrees, and after resting it should rise to 135 degrees. Slice and serve the steaks. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 28400,&quot;Four Flowers Juice 4 bananas, peeled, cut into pieces 2 cups chilled orange juice 1/2 fresh pineapple, peeled, cored, cut into chunks 1 cup cold water 2 1/2 tablespoons pure maple syrup 2 tablespoons grenadine 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 6 fresh strawberries Instructions: Combine bananas and 1/4 cup orange juice in processor and puree.

When they are full, empty the excess back into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the molds should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the molds clean and place them upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet to drain. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, use a wide pastry scraper to clean the edges of each cavity clean. This is important because when the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Place the champagne and cream into a small saucepan and heat the mixture to a boil. Pour the hot champagne mixture over the chopped chocolate and corn syrup and blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender. Add the marc du champagne and the butter and blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender. Allow the mixture to cool until it has a thick consistency (thick enough to pipe). Place the mixture in a piping bag and pipe it into the chocolate filled molds. Let set overnight. Close the bottom of one mold by apply chocolate with an offset spatula. Scrape clean then press the two molds together evenly. Allow to set. When the chocolate has set, remove the whole \corks\ from the molds. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 28412,&quot;Fresh Herb Roasted Chicken with Burnt Orange-Black Pepper Sauce and Green Onion Puree 12 fresh sage leaves 1 bunch fresh oregano 1 bunch fresh thyme 1 bunch fresh basil 2 (2 1/2) pound chickens Olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 6 cups orange juice 8 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon cold butter 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper Salt 6 scallions, blanched, cooled and chopped 1/4 cup spinach leaves 1/4 grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon pine nuts 4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 6 large potatoes, peeled, boiled and mashed Instructions: Place herbs under the skin of the breast of the chicken.

Grill the corn, rotating occasionally, until cooked and charred in spots, about 20 minutes. Grill the tomatoes, rotating occasionally, until the skins start to burst and are charred in spots, about 7 minutes.<br> Peel the skins away from the tomatoes, then chop the tomatoes into small cubes. Transfer to a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Slice the kernels from the cobs, transfer to a small bowl and season with salt and pepper.<br> Spoon 2 tablespoons corn into the bottom of each of 6 half-pint mason jars. Top each with 2 tablespoons tomato, then 2 tablespoons mozzarella. Repeat the process one more time so there are 6 layers total, ending with the mozzarella on top. Drizzle with some of the cider vinaigrette. The salads will keep, refrigerated, for up to 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28414,&quot;Deviled Portuguese Grilled Lobsters 4 (1 1/2-pound) live lobsters 12 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 pound linguica (Portuguese sausage), finely chopped 6 cloves garlic, chopped 1 3/4 cups panko (coarse Japanese breadcrumbs) 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish 3 tablespoons minced chives Juice of 1 lemon, plus lemon wedges for garnish Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Prepare the lobsters (see Cook&#39;s Note). Preheat a grill to medium. Melt the butter with the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook until the fat begins to render, 1 to 2 minutes.

Add the minced goat, panko, egg, cilantro and mint. Put the garlic and ginger in a mortar and grind with the pestle into a paste. Add the garlic-ginger paste and lemon juice to the meat mixture and gently combine everything. Thread the meat mixture on soaked skewers to form a hot dog shape. (If you have time, refrigerate the meat kebabs for 30 minutes before searing.) Add the ghee to a griddle pan over medium-high heat and allow to melt and heat thoroughly. Add the kebabs and cook until just seared on all sides. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. For the mint-mustard sauce: Meanwhile, add the Dijon, honey, horseradish, podina masala, mint and salt and pepper to taste to a bowl. Stir to combine and set aside. For the corn dogs: In a deep-sided pot, heat 3 inches oil to 350 degrees F. Pour the Dosa Batter into a tall glass. Gently pat each kebab to remove any excess moisture, then dip it in the batter. Ensure that the entire kebab is coated. Place dipped kebabs in the hot oil, in batches, and cook until golden brown and puffed, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and serve with mint-mustard sauce. Wash the parboiled rice, dal and fenugreek seeds in cool water a few times till the water runs clear. Soak in cold water in for 6 hours. Wash and soak the flattened rice in water for 5 minutes. Strain, then combine in a blender and put just enough water to cover the rice and lentils. Blend to a smooth batter. Pour the batter into a large bowl. It should reach halfway up the side, giving enough space for the batter to rise during fermentation. Cover the container loosely (not airtight) and rest in a warm place overnight. Add the salt and mix gently to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 28416,&quot;Aunt Anne\u2019s Broccoli-Cheese Rice Casserole 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, plus more for the baking dish 1 medium red onion, diced 1 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 slices white sandwich bread (about 4 ounces), crusts removed and cut into bite-size pieces 2 cups cooked white rice, fresh, day-old, or cold 20 ounces frozen chopped broccoli (do not thaw) 8 ounces shredded sharp cheddar cheese (about 2 cups) 1 cup sour cream 1 cup whole milk, plus more as needed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or large ovenproof pot with a lid over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the meat fat-side down and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Carefully flip the meat with tongs and brown on the other side, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet.<br> Add the onions, carrots and celery to the pot and stir to scrape up the browned bits. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, thyme and rosemary and cook, stirring frequently, until very fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently to avoid scorching, until the tomato paste is dark red and slightly sticky, about 2 minutes. Stir in the wine and cook, stirring frequently, until mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, broth and bay leaves and season generously with black pepper.<br> Submerge the brisket in the sauce fat-side down; pour in any accumulated juices from the dish. Bring the sauce just to a boil, then cover the pot and immediately transfer to the oven. Cook until the sauce is thickened and the brisket is very tender, 2 to 3 hours.<br> Discard the bay leaves. Transfer the brisket to a rimmed baking sheet. Shred the brisket with two forks. Stir the meat back into the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. The sauce can be made up to 2 days ahead. For the gnocchi: Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover by 1 inch with salted water. Bring to a boil, adjust the heat and simmer until they are tender when pierced with a fork or the tip of a paring knife, about 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set them aside until cool enough to handle.<br> Remove the skins with a paring knife and cut the potatoes into large chunks. Pass the chunks through a potato ricer (see Cook&#39;s Note) onto a clean work surface. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of salt over the potatoes and let them cool completely.<br> While the potatoes are cooling, pulse the matzo meal in a spice grinder or blender until very finely ground (it should be similar in texture to flour). Line a baking sheet with parchment.<br> Sprinkle 2 cups of the matzo meal over the cooled potatoes. Pour the eggs over the matzo meal and begin to work the mixture together with a fork. Once the mixture begins to clump together, use your hands to gently knead until the ingredients are fully combined, about 2 minutes. Gather the dough into a smooth ball and let rest for about 15 minutes.<br> Lightly dust a work surface with a some of the reserved matzo meal. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into a 12-inch rope. Use a knife or bench scraper to cut the rope into 3/4-inch pieces; place the cut gnocchi on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Gnocchi can be prepared to this point up to 2 days ahead; wrap the baking sheet in plastic and refrigerate.<br> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches, add about a third of the gnocchi at a time and cook until they begin to float and the water returns to a rapid simmer, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider to transfer the gnocchi to a platter or individual serving bowls.

Whisk until smooth and pour into a baking dish. Lay the chicken halves, skin-side up, in the yogurt mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a couple of hours to marinate. Preheat a very clean grill to medium. When the grill is hot, brush with the oil. Remove the chicken from the yogurt, leaving any excess behind, and lay them out on the grill, skin-side down. Cook until the skin is brown and crispy, and then flip. You want to roast them, essentially, on the grill, and avoid \flaming\ them or cooking them over too intense heat. That would dry them out. Grill the chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers between 155 degrees F and 160 degrees F, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the chicken from the grill to a cutting board. Cut into small pieces or serve whole, family style. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with lemon juice. Top with some of the Harissa and serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and caraway seeds. Add the spices to a sheet tray and toast in the oven for 1 to 2 minutes; you should faintly detect the scent of the spices. Remove the tray from the oven and set aside to cool. Add the paprika and cl flakes to the spice mix. Using a mortar and pestle (or, alternatively, a food processor), grind the garlic cloves until they become a paste, and then add the red bell pepper. Season with salt, and then add the spices and the 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and blend well. When blended, transfer the harissa to a container and top with some additional olive oil.

Cut the carrots into halves equal in length. Then cut the smaller tip of the carrot into fourths lengthwise and the larger half into sixths or eighths. The key is making the spears all the about the same size. Line up the prepared carrots, corn and pineapple slices on a tray and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle all with a pinch or two of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Flip the pineapple rings and repeat the process for them only. Roll and jiggle the rest to fully coat them. Grill the prepared ingredients. Heat the grill or grill pan to medium-high. Place the carrots, corn, and pineapple rings directly on the grill. Use tongs to tend to the grill. Roll and flip the vegetables until your personal preference for doneness, pulling each off to a tray when done. The carrots are best when charred, caramelized and a bit crispy on the ends, 10 to 12 minutes. Corn is great fresh, so just go for color on all sides, about 8 minutes total. The pineapples are best when slightly charred, but still juicy, about 6 minutes total, flipping once. Combine the salad ingredients. When the grilled goods are all cool enough to handle, chop the carrots, pineapples and trim the kernels off the corn. Add to a bowl along with the scallions, celery and cucumber. For the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, add the pineapple juice, mustard, apple cider vinegar, sugar and liquid smoke and whisk until combined. Continue to whisk rigorously while slowly pouring the olive oil into the bowl with your other hand, or with the help of a friend, nice to have them in the kitchen! Taste the vinaigrette and season with a pinch of salt and few grinds of black pepper. Dress the salad. Pour the vinaigrette over the bowl then gently toss using tongs. Serve room temperature or chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 28436,&quot;Harry T&#39;s Stuffed Chicken 2 ounces ground andouille sausage, casings removed 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1 ounce yellow onion, brunoise<br> 1/2 ounce green bell peppers, brunoise<br> 1/2 ounce celery, brunoise<br> 1/4 ounce minced garlic (from 1 to 2 cloves)<br> 1/4 ounce green onion, diced<br> 4 ounces homemade or store-bought cornbread<br> 1/2 tablespoon olive oil One 8-ounce boneless skinless chicken breast, 1/2 ounce unsalted butter 1 ounce minced garlic (about 2 cloves) 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 ounce grated smoked Gouda<br> 1/2 ounce grated Parmesan<br> Instructions: For the cornbread stuffing: Heat the andouille in a skillet or saute pan over low heat until the fat is rendered (it will separate and become liquid in the pan). Drain the liquid and set it aside in a small bowl to cool (you will use this to bind the stuffing). Set aside the andouille. In a separate saute pan, add the butter, onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic and green onion and sweat over medium heat until the color begins to come out, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Crumble the cornbread into a mixing bowl. Add the andouille and crumble it together with the cornbread until large crumbs form. Add the reserved rendered fat and the onion mixture and gently fold them into the cornbread mixture. Set aside. For the chicken: Grease a baking sheet with the oil. Grill the chicken in a grill pan or on an outdoor grill on medium-high heat until cooked throughout, about 8 minutes per side. Preheat the broiler to high. Scoop enough of the cornbread stuffing to cover the breast and press it down onto the top of the chicken. Place the chicken on the prepared baking sheet and broil until the stuffing browns, 4 to 5 minutes. For the smoked Gouda sauce: Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook to just release the flavor, no more than 2 minutes. Add the heavy cream and bring to a boil, then add the Gouda and Parmesan and stir to thicken the sauce. Once all the ingredients are melded together, remove from the heat and pour the sauce over the top of the broiled chicken and cornbread stuffing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28437,&quot;Vegetable Paella 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, diced<br> 1 stalk celery, diced<br> 3 cloves garlic, sliced<br> 16 yellow cherry tomatoes, halved (1 cup) 3/4 teaspoon salt<br> 6 red radishes, quartered<br> 1/2 cup dry vermouth<br> 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br> 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads<br> 1 cup bomba rice, or other short-grain rice<br> 1/4 pound green beans, trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces<br> 1 red pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips<br> 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed<br> 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br> Instructions: Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a 10-inch saute pan with a lid. Add the onion and celery and saute until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, cherry tomatoes and salt and cook an additional 6 minutes, until the tomatoes begin to break down. Add the radishes and saute another 2 minutes. Add the vermouth and allow it to reduce by half. Add the chicken broth and then the saffron, rubbing it between your fingers to crumble a bit. Bring to a simmer and stir in the rice and the green beans. Simmer over medium-high heat, uncovered, for 5 minutes without disturbing. Scatter the red peppers and peas over the top and gently press them into the rice mixture; do not stir. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer for 7 minutes. Uncover, raise the heat to high and cook for 3 minutes more, to make sure all the liquid is evaporated and to help develop a crust on the bottom. Remove the pan from the heat, cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with the smoked paprika and the parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 28438,&quot;Chocolate Tofu Mousse Pie 1 (12-ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips 1 (12-ounce) package silken firm tofu Splash vanilla extract 2 egg whites* Prepared chocolate cookie crust (recommended: Oreo) or graham cracker crust Whipped cream or raspberry sauce, for serving.

Brush the bottom and sides of four 9-inch round cake pans with vegetable oil. Dust with flour and tap out the excess; set aside. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Stir the milk and vanilla together in a large liquid measuring cup. Set both aside. Beat the butter, lemon zest and juice, vegetable oil and sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally using a rubber spatula. Beat in the eggs 1 at a time until combined and then continue to beat on medium-high speed until mixture is thick, smooth and shiny, about 3 minutes more. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add one-third of the flour mixture until just combined. Beat in half the milk mixture until combined. Repeat these additions, ending with the final one-third of the flour mixture, and beating just until smooth. Stir a few times with the spatula to make sure the batter is well blended. Evenly divide the cake batter among 4 medium bowls. Tint one bowl with 1 drop of pink food coloring, tint another with 2 drops of food coloring, the third with 1 teaspoon food coloring, and the last with 1/4 teaspoon food coloring. Stir each bowl until no streaks remain; the batters should have gradually lighter shades of pink. Transfer each bowl of batter to one of the prepared pans. Bake until the tops are lightly browned, the edges of the cake are beginning to pull away from the side of the pan and the center lightly springs back to the touch, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans 10 to 15 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely. For the frosting: Fill a medium saucepan about one-third full of water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Whisk the egg whites, sugar, 1/4 cup water, the corn syrup, vanilla, cream of tartar and salt in a large (preferably glass or metal; see Cook&#39;s Note) heatproof bowl that will sit over the pot without having the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Set the bowl over the pot and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until the sugar dissolves and the mixture starts to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. If the mixtures starts to crystallize on the side of the bowl, brush down the bowl using a wet pastry brush. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and continue to beat until the mixture is glossy and holds firm peaks, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and continue to beat until the mixture cools slightly, about 30 seconds more. Beat in the lemon juice and 2 drops of pink gel food coloring. The frosting will start to firm up even more as it cools. While the frosting is still slightly warm, start to assemble the cake. Place the most vibrant pink cake layer (tinted with 1 teaspoon food coloring) on a cake stand or serving platter. Spread a heaping 1/2 cup frosting on top of the cake into an even layer using a small offset spatula. Stack the second most vibrant pink cake layer (1/4 teaspoon food coloring) on next, followed by another heaping 1/2 cup of frosting. Repeat with the third most vibrant pink cake layer (2 drops food coloring) and another heaping 1/2 cup frosting. Then top with the lightest pink cake layer (1 drop food coloring). Spread the remaining frosting on the sides and top of the cake, using the offset spatula to create a swirled design. Do not refrigerate; the frosting will set once completely cooled, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 28478,&quot;Lemon And Herb Roasted Chicken With Baby Potatoes 1 (4 to 5 pound) free-range chicken Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon, halved 1 head garlic, halved 1/4 bunch each fresh rosemary, thyme, and parsley 1/4 cup olive oil 11/2 pounds red new potatoes Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse the chicken with cool water, inside and out, then pat it dry with paper towels. Season the cavity with salt and pepper, and then stuff the lemon, garlic, and herbs inside. Place the chicken, breast-side up, in a roasting pan. Tie the legs of the chicken together with kitchen twine to help hold its shape. Toss the potatoes around the chicken. Season the whole thing with a fair amount of salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Roast the chicken and potatoes for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Don&#39;t forget to baste the chicken with the drippings and rotate the pan every 20 minutes or so to insure a golden crispy skin. The chicken is done when an instant-read thermometer says 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (the legs of the chicken should wiggle easily from the sockets too.) Remove the chicken to a platter and let stand for 10 minutes, so the juices settle back into the meat before carving. Serve with the roasted potatoes on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 28479,&quot;Celery Root and Potato Mash with Horseradish 2 celery roots (about 1 1/2 pounds each), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 3 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 1 teaspoon salt, plus kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, for seasoning 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 tablespoon grated fresh or prepared horseradish Chopped fresh chives, for garnish Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Place the celery root and potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water; add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to boil over medium heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until the celery root and potatoes are very tender. Drain the water from the vegetables and pass them through a food mill or a ricer into a large mixing bowl. Stir in the cream, butter, and horseradish until the cream is absorbed and the mixture is smooth. Season with kosher salt and pepper and garnish with chopped chives. Drizzle with a healthy dose of olive oil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 28480,&quot;Brownie Cookies 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 large eggs, at room temperature 3/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Combine 6 ounces chopped chocolate and the butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 45-second intervals, stirring after each, until melted, about 2 minutes. Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, combine the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until very thick and pale, about 5 minutes. Stir the espresso powder and vanilla in a small bowl, then beat into the egg mixture. Beat the warm chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until combined. Beat in the remaining 2 ounces chopped chocolate; finish mixing with a rubber spatula (the dough will be soft). Drop mounds of dough (1 1/2 tablespoons each) about 2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are just set around the edges and the tops are puffed and cracked, 10 to 14 minutes. Let cool completely on the pans. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 28481,&quot;Porchetta, Egg and Cheese 1 cup salt 1 cup sugar One 8- to 10-pound side pork belly 2 cups cooked spinach 3/4 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 bunch fresh thyme 12 slices American cheese 12 kaiser rolls Mayonnaise, chopped cherry peppers, thinly sliced white onion and ketchup Instructions: For the brine: Stir the salt and sugar into 8 gallons of cool water in a large container. Add the pork belly and let brine, refrigerated, for 48 hours. For the porchetta: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Remove the pork belly from the brine.

Bring to a boil- you should hear the pot going all a flutter under the lid and puffing steam out the seam. Reduce to a low simmer, and let the rice cook for 15 minutes, until the water is absorbed. Remove the rice pot from the heat.<br> Once the rice is cooked, whisk the egg in a medium bowl, and then whisk in the evaporated milk. Stir the coconut and sweetened condensed milks into the rice, then add the egg mixture. Return the saucepan to heat and cook the mixture over medium- low heat until it looks mostly, or about 90 percent, absorbed (the pudding will thicken a lot as it cools), about 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in the vanilla extract, then divide the pudding among serving dishes. Keep the puddings in the fridge until fully chilled, about 1 to 2 hours.<br> To serve: Whip the heavy cream with the confectioners&#39; sugar until soft peaks form.

Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and toss to combine, adding more water, if necessary, to form a dough. Chill the dough, wrapped in plastic, until firm. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle 1/8-inch thick and fit it into a 9-inch pie pan. Crimp the edge, prick the bottom, and chill while making the filling. Filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the ricotta with the sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla and cinnamon. Stir in the candied fruit and chocolate chips. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Bake the pie for 45 minutes, or until just set.

Remove from the heat, add the cardamom, cover and let steep 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bring a small pot or kettle of water to a boil. Place a folded damp kitchen towel in a 2-quart baking dish; arrange 8 espresso cups in the dish (the towel will keep the cups from moving). Whisk the egg yolks and salt in a bowl. Return the cream to medium heat, add the sugar and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Strain the cream into the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Stir in the espresso and vanilla until combined. Transfer to a liquid measuring cup, then divide among the espresso cups. Place the baking dish in the oven and pour boiling water into the dish until it reaches halfway up the outside of the espresso cups. Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake until the custard sets around the edges but still jiggles in the center, 35 to 45 minutes. Let the custards cool in the water bath, about 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.

Quickly saute the minced garlic and onions. Add the tomatoes and saute for 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes soften. Add cinnamon, cloves, shrimp (reserved from the stock), olives, chiles, stock, wine, and salt, and then simmer until all the liquid in the stuffing is cooked off. Preheat a grill to medium-high. Spoon about 4 or more tablespoons of stuffing inside the cavity of each boned fish. Thread a large upholstery needle with a 15-inch length of cooking string. Knot the string, and sew the fish closed. Rub the fish with generous amounts of butter, and then roll it in bread crumbs. Wrap each fish twice over in parchment paper making sure to butter the side of the paper that will touch the fish. Wrap the fish up in the paper, firmly tying off each end with a bit of string. Repeat this procedure with each fish. Place the fish on the grill for about 15 minutes, turning fish about halfway through cooking. A rich aroma of shrimp and toasted bread will indicate when the fish is finished cooking. Remove the parchment paper, snip away string, and promptly serve the fish on a platter with parsley sprigs and lemon wedges. Serve with the Salsa for Fish. Pour 2 cups water into a 5-quart soup pot and bring to a boil. Add the unshelled shrimp, garlic, and salt. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the shrimp, cool, peel, and chop into small chunks. Reserve both the stock and shrimp for the stuffing. Heat a dry heavy skillet over a medium flame and toast the chiles for 30 seconds or until the skin turns a dark red. Set aside. Place the garlic, onion, and salt in a food processor or blender and grind to a coarse consistency. Add the allspice and chiles and continue grinding until well blended. Add the tomatoes and grind them to a pulpy consistency. Pour the sauce into a serving bowl. Stir in rice wine vinegar, olive oil, and minced cilantro.

And, like so many of these recipes, it&#39;s pretty well instant. After all, if you haven&#39;t got time to shop, it&#39;s hardly likely you&#39;ll be able to spend many hours at the stove. I am, anyway, a huge fan of bulgar wheat - think couscous, only more robust - but cooked like this, with some strands of pasta tossed in hot oil first, it really has something extra. I was taught to do this, just chatting stoveside, by an Egyptian friend when I was in my twenties, and I&#39;ve never seen any reason to change the drill. He, actually, didn&#39;t use torn-up spaghettini but, rather, lokshen, which are the short lengths of vermicelli customarily found in echt chicken soup. This is a tradition about as far away from the chorizo-cooking culture as you could get, but the chickpea-studded, tomatoey and paprika-hot stew goes extremely well with the nubbly grain. I keep a stock of cherry tomatoes in sauce in the cupboard, but regular canned tomatoes could be substituted easily enough. Warm the olive oil in a thick-bottomed saucepan on a medium heat. Fry the pasta bits in the oil for a minute, stirring, until they look like slightly scorched straws. Then add the bulgar wheat and stir for another minute or two. Stir in the cinnamon and the salt, and then pour the water into the pan. Add the bay leaves, and bring to a boil, then turn down to the lowest heat, add a lid, and leave for 15 minutes, until all the water has been absorbed. Put another thick-bottomed saucepan on a medium heat, add the chorizo pieces and fry until the orange oil runs out. Then add the sherry and let it bubble away. Add the apricots (if using), along with the chickpeas (or beans) and canned tomatoes, and 3/4 fill each empty tomato can with water and swish it out into the pan. Put on a high heat to bubble for about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Serve with the bulgar wheat and, if there&#39;s any to hand, some chopped cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 28492,&quot;Peach Fondue with Meringue Cookies 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 bag (12-ounces) premiere white morsels 1 can peaches, drained and pureed (recommended: Dole) 1/4 cup white chocolate liqueur (recommended: Godiva) 1 package meringue cookies Instructions: Heat cream in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat until bubbles appear around the edges; remove from heat.

Prepare the cake mixes. Fill the cup two-thirds full with batter; divide the rest between the bowls. Bake 15 minutes for the cup and 35 to 40 minutes for the bowls. Let cool. Trim the tops of the bowl cakes with a serrated knife to make them level. Sandwich the cut sides together using a little frosting. Trim a 1-inch slice from one side of the sandwiched bowl cakes; turn cut-side down. Trim a little from the side of the small cake so it will lie flat, then attach to the bowl cake with frosting as shown. Cover the cake completely with frosting and freeze until firm, 30 minutes. Place the cake on your serving platter. Combine the food coloring and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Gently brush on the wider half of the cake. Arrange the sunflower seeds in rows on the red part of the cake. Microwave the semisweet chocolate with the butter in 30-second intervals, stirring, until melted. Spread the chocolate over the bottom two-thirds of the cake, letting it pool around the cake. Arrange the mint leaves around the top of the strawberry and stick a long mint stem into the cake.

Garnish with parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28496,&quot;Lobster with Sweet Ginger 1 piece fresh ginger, approximately 1-inch 2 cloves garlic, minced 3/4 cup plum wine or Port 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons peanut oil 1 (2-pound) lobster, split lengthwise 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 scallions, cut into 3/8 inch slices 1 to 2 teaspoons curry powder 1/4 cup dry white wine 1/2 teaspoon dried hot cl flakes 1/2 cup fish stock, recipe follows 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar or balsamic vinegar Salt Freshly ground pepper Fried Spinach Leaves, recipe follows 2 pounds fish skeletons, cut into pieces 2 tablespoons vegetable or other flavorless oil 1 small carrot, peeled and sliced 1/2 onion, sliced 1 small stalk celery, sliced 2 cups dry white wine 1 bouquet garni (parsley, thyme, peppercorns and a bay leaf tied together in cheesecloth) 1 quart water, approximately Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Peel the ginger, reserving the peels, and cut it into fine julienne strips. Cut the peels into coarse strips and set aside. In a small saucepan, cook the ginger and garlic with 1/2 cup of the plum wine and the rice wine vinegar until 1 tablespoon of liquid remains. Remove from the heat and reserve. Place a heavy heatproof 12-inch skillet over high heat until it is very hot. Add the oil and heat it almost to the smoking point. Carefully add the lobster halves, meat side down. Cook 3 minutes. Turn the lobster over and add 1 tablespoon of the butter. Continue to saute until the lobster shells get red and the butter is nutty red. Transfer the lobster to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the lobster is just cooked. Remove from the oven, remove the lobster from the skillet and keep warm Add the scallions, ginger peels and curry powder to the skillet. Saute the mixture lightly for 10 to 15 seconds, then whisk in the remaining plum wine and the white wine, stock, cl flakes and the vinegar. Reduce the liquid to 1/2 cup. Add the cream and reduce it by half. Add any liquid from the julienne of ginger, then whisk in the 1 tablespoon of butter. Season the sauce to taste, with salt and pepper. Crack the lobster claws with the back of a large chef&#39;s knife. Arrange the lobster halves on a warm oval platter, meat side up. Strain the sauce over the lobster, then sprinkle the sweet ginger on top. Garnish with Fried Baby Spinach Leaves. Clean the fish bones under cold running water, removing the gills from the head and any traces of blood on the frames. In a large saucepan, heat the oil. In it, sweat the fish bones and vegetables over low heat, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring once or twice to prevent them from browning. Deglaze the pan with the wine, and then add enough water to cover the bones and vegetables by 2 inches. Add the bouquet garni and bring the liquid to a boil. Skim the froth from the surface, reduce the heat and simmer the stock for 20 to 25 minutes. Strain the stock into a clean saucepan. Bring it to a boil and reduce it over moderate heat to 1 quart. Wash some large spinach leaves, cut off the stems and dry them well. Heat peanut oil to 375 degrees F, and in it, fry the spinach until crisp and translucent. Be careful not to get splattered. Remove the leaves to paper towels to drain and salt them lightly (just like potato chips). The spinach should have a jade green color. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28497,&quot;Sugar Cookies 1 cup granulated sugar 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, at room temperature 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract One 1-pound box confectioners&#39; sugar (3 3/4 to 4 cups) 2 tablespoons meringue powder Food coloring, as desired Candy and sanding sugar, for decorating Instructions: For the cookies: Put the sugar in a food processor and pulse a few times to finely grind. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and pulse just to combine. Add the butter and pulse until all of the butter is incorporated into the flour and the mixture is sandy. Add the egg and vanilla and pulse until the mixture comes together in big clumps. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead a few times to form a ball. Divide the dough in half, pat into 2 discs about 1/4 inch thick, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Let the dough sit at room temperature for a few minutes to make rolling easier. Put 1 disc of dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thick. Cut out with desired cookie cutters and arrange on one of the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake until the bottom of the cookies are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. Gently gather any scraps into a ball and press into another disc. Chill the disc until firm enough to roll and cut out as many cookies as possible. For the icing: Sift together the confectioners&#39; sugar and the meringue powder in a large bowl and add 6 tablespoons water. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high until the mixture is glossy and soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Add food coloring if using or divide into several batches and color with different shades of food coloring. Decorate cookies as desired. The cookies can be store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 28498,&quot;Cheese Twists 2 large egg yolks 1 large egg 1/4 cup whole milk Store-bought puff pastry, rolled into 1 (12 by 20-inch) rectangle, about 1/8-inch thick 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese Pinch salt Pinch finely ground pepper Instructions: Prepare the egg wash: Combine the yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small mixing bowl and whip with a hand whisk until well combined. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Flour the dough and table as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the table or the rolling pin. Place the dough on your work surface with a long side facing you. Use a pastry brush to coat the surface of the rectangle with some egg wash. Liberally sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the rectangle, followed by the salt and pepper. Use a sharp paring knife to cut the rectangle into 1-inch-wide strips from top to bottom. Flip each strip so that the cheese is on the bottom. Twist each strip by rolling each end in opposite directions. Always remember to twist so that the topping faces out --that way you can see how they are flavored. Place the strips on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and bake until well risen and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving. These puff pastry items are best eaten the day they are made. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28499,&quot;Strawberry-Cucumber Margarita 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/4 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup tequila reposado Splash orange liqueur, such as triple sec 12 strawberries, stemmed and quartered, plus 4 whole strawberries, for garnish 1/2 English or hothouse cucumber, peeled, seeded and diced, plus 8 slices, for garnish 2 cups ice 1 lime, quartered Instructions: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 cup sugar with 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. In a shallow bowl, mix together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and salt. Set aside. In a blender, combine 3/4 cup of the simple syrup, the tequila, orange liqueur, quartered strawberries, cucumber and ice. Blend until fully pureed and smooth. Using a lime wedge, moisten the rim of a margarita glass. Dip the moistened rim into the bowl of sugar-salt. Pour the margarita into the prepared glass. Slice the whole strawberries crosswise along its pointed end and place a strawberry onto the rim of each glass for garnish. Float 2 cucumber slices in the glass. Repeat with the remaining 3 margaritas. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 28500,&quot;Galette des Rois 1/3 cup/70 g butter, softened 1/2 cup/70 g confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup/70 g ground almonds 1 egg 1 tablespoon dark rum 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 sheets store-bought puff pastry, about 1/4-inch/5 mm thick, chilled 1 magic bean, for hiding in the cake 1 egg, lightly beaten, for sealing the pastry Sifted confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting (or a few spoonfuls of apricot jam, heated until runny) Instructions: For the cream filling: Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the almonds, then the egg, rum and vanilla. Beat until smooth with a fork. Cover and chill until firm, at least 1 hour. For the pastry shell: Lay an 8-inch/20 cm round plate on one sheet of cold pastry and go around it with a knife. Do the same for the top round, but then roll this one a little with a rolling pin to make it slightly larger than the bottom round. Lay the smaller round of chilled dough on a dampened baking sheet. Spread the chilled cream filling over, leaving a good 1-inch/2.5 cm margin all around the edge. Hide a bean somewhere in the cream. Brush the border with egg wash. Lay on the top round and press the edges well to seal. Score the edge all around with the blunt side of a knife to seal. Make a cross in the center for steam to escape and draw spirals out to the edges for decoration. Brush with egg wash all over the top, avoiding the edges, so that they&#39;ll puff up easily. Chill in the freezer until very firm, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F/230 degrees C. Bake the cake until puffed up high and dark golden in color. Sprinkle with a thin coating of confectioners&#39; sugar and blast under the broiler or melt with a blowtorch. You can also brush with melted apricot jam for a glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 28501,&quot;Chunky Tomato Soup with Blood Sausage Extra-virgin olive oil, for cooking 2 onions, diced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 cloves garlic, sliced<br> 2 carrots, peeled, halved and sliced into half-moons<br> 1 rib celery, thinly sliced<br> 1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> One 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes<br> 8 ounces blood sausage<br> 2 scallions, thinly sliced<br> Tombstone Crackers, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons fresh thyme<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup cold water<br> Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then add the garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, 3 cans of cold water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the flavors develop, at least 20 minutes. Adjust for seasoning, if necessary. Meanwhile, cut the blood sausage into 1/2-inch rounds. Heat a small amount of oil in a nonstick skillet and add the blood sausage slices in small batches. Cook until the blood sausage is crispy and browned and has a deep flavor, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Set aside to drain on a rack or on paper towels. Repeat until all the blood sausage is cooked. Serve the soup hot in bowls with the blood sausage and scallions on top. Serve with Tombstone Crackers.<br> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pulse the flour, thyme, pepper, baking powder, salt and sugar in a food processor until thoroughly mixed. Add the melted butter and pulse 5 to 6 times. Add the water and pulse just until the dough starts to stick together (about 10 seconds). Remove the dough, press together gently with your hands to form a single square mass, and cut into four squares. Let the dough rest for about 10 minutes at room temperature. Roll out each individual piece of dough on a lightly-floured surface into a rectangle as thin as you can possibly get it. If the dough starts to shrink up, let it rest a little longer. Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 2-inch-wide pieces. Place the pieces on the baking sheet. Bake, checking periodically to make sure the crackers aren&#39;t getting too brown, for 4 to 5 minutes, then flip each cracker piece and bake another 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet to get crispy. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 28502,&quot;Seared Salmon with Artichoke Salsa 1 (6-ounce) jar marinated artichokes 1 cup chopped vine ripe tomatoes 3 tablespoons minced shallots 1 tablespoon capers 1 lemon, zested and juiced 2 garlic cloves, minced 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 (6 to 8-ounce) salmon fillets, skin on Instructions: To make the salsa, combine all of the ingredients together, mix well, and season with salt and pepper.

Put the spinach in a pot with just the water that clings to the leaves and sprinkle with salt. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until all the spinach is wilted. Drain in a colander and press with a large spoon to remove as much water as possible. Lay the veal flat and trim the excess fat (do not remove all of it, or the roast will be too dry when done). Spread the spinach over the veal and add the garlic cloves evenly spaced apart. Roll up the veal jelly-roll fashion and tie it securely with kitchen twine. Put the butter and vegetable oil in a heavy braising pan that will hold the veal comfortably and place it over high heat. When the oil and butter are hot, put in the veal and brown it well on all sides. Season with salt and pepper, then add the wine. Allow the wine to bubble for 1 to 2 minutes to evaporate the alcohol and use a wooden spoon to loosen the tasty bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the tomatoes. When they begin to bubble, lower the heat so that the contents of the pan cook at a gentle but steady simmer. Cover the pan with the lid slightly askew and cook until the meat is tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn the meat from time to time and add a little water to the pan if all the liquid evaporates before the veal is done. When ready to serve, cut the veal in slices about 1/2 inch thick and remove the twine. If the sauce in the pan needs to be reduced, raise the heat and cook until it is thick enough to coat a spoon. Arrange the veal slices on a platter and pour the hot sauce over them. Serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 28504,&quot;Soy-Da Glazed Pulled Pork 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed black pepper<br> 1 bone-in pork shoulder (about 5 pounds), fat cap scored<br> 2 cups orange soda 1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce<br> 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 2 cloves garlic, zested<br> Instructions: For the pork: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

For the soy-da glaze: In a small saucepan, simmer the orange soda, soy sauce, crushed red pepper and garlic until reduced by half. Set aside. Remove the pork from the oven, uncover and drain any liquid fat. Brush the soy-da glaze all over the pork and continue to roast, re-glazing every 30 minutes, until the pork is well browned, fork-tender and the meat pulls away from the bone (and registers 200 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer), 1 to 2 more hours. Transfer the pork to a large dish and let rest 20 minutes before pulling. For even more crispiness, pull the meat, mix with the remaining glaze and broil on a baking sheet until extra crispy, 3 to 5 minutes! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 28505,&quot;Three-Bean Salad Kosher salt 1/2 cup white vinegar Juice of 1 lemon 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon crushed coriander seeds Freshly ground pepper 1 small red bell pepper, thinly sliced 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 1/2 pound green beans, trimmed and halved crosswise 1/2 pound wax beans, trimmed and halved crosswise 1 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed 1 teaspoon dijon mustard 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Pulse until roughly pureed. Remove the contents to a small bowl and stir in the mayonnaise and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Season with the salt. For the seafood: Fill a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven with 3 inches of oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Whisk together the rice flour, cornstarch, polenta, pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Working in batches, dredge the shrimp and calamari in the flour mixture and add to the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan and drop the temperature. Fry until light golden brown and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Use a spider to remove the seafood to a paper towel-lined tray and season with a pinch of salt. Continue with the remaining shrimp and calamari. Serve hot alongside the pesto dipping sauce and lots of lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 28518,&quot;Seven-Minute Frosting 3 large egg whites, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/4 cup water 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk the egg whites, sugar, water, corn syrup, vanilla, cream of tartar and salt in a large heatproof glass bowl. Set the bowl on top of the pan (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water).

Remove the bowl from the pan and beat until the frosting cools slightly, about 30 seconds. Use while still slightly warm -- the frosting will firm up and form a hard shell when it cools. Do not refrigerate the frosted cake or the frosting may weep. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 28519,&quot;Cold Roasted Veggies with Herbed Yogurt Dip 2 cups plain Greek yogurt 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill 2 cloves garlic, grated<br> Zest of 1 lemon plus juice of 1/2 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 parsnips, cut into sticks 3 carrots, cut into sticks<br> 2 zucchini, cut into sticks<br> 2 red onions, cut into quarters<br> 1/2 cup olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the herbed yogurt dip: Combine the yogurt, mint, parsley, dill, garlic, lemon zest and juice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl and mix well; taste to check the seasonings.

Add the onion and garlic and season with salt and red pepper flakes. Cook until the onions become translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the sugar and the canned tomatoes. Use a wooden spoon to break up some of the whole tomatoes and cook 10 to 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring from time to time. Taste for seasoning, the tomatoes should be fairly broken down and the flavors coming together. Cook for another few minutes if the tomatoes still taste like they need a little more time to break down. Set aside to cool. For the eggplant (this step is optional, leave it out if you have limited time): Arrange the eggplant rounds in a single layer on 2 baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt on both sides of each slice and allow it to sit for about 1 hour. Salting it draws out the liquid and bitter flavor. After an hour, rinse with cold water and dry them thoroughly with a kitchen towel. Put the flour in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk and season with salt and pepper. In a third bowl, combine the breadcrumbs with the oregano and fresh thyme leaves and season with salt and pepper. Dip each eggplant slice in the flour and shake off any excess. Then, dip in the egg mixture, and finally in the breadcrumbs. Make sure to coat both sides of each slice of eggplant. Arrange them in single layers on the baking sheets. In a large skillet, pour enough oil to accumulate about 1/2-inch in the bottom. Heat the oil until it begins to smoke lightly (alternatively, test with a thermometer and wait until the oil registers between 380 degrees F and 400 degrees F). Use a pair of kitchen tongs to add a single layer of the eggplant to the pan. Cook them until they are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the oil and transfer to a baking sheet fitted with a kitchen towel so the eggplant can drain as the others cook. Season lightly with salt. Take care to reheat the oil back up to temperature before adding another batch of slices to the pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To assemble: In a 9 by 13-inch flameproof baking dish, spoon about 1/4 of the tomato sauce on the bottom. Top with a layer of the fried eggplant; the eggplant slices can overlap slightly. Top with about 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. Sprinkle with about 1/4 of the Parmesan and provolone cheeses. Top with a layer of torn basil leaves. Spoon sauce and repeat the layering 2 more times to make 3 layers. End with the remaining mozzarella. Carefully press the layers down firmly into the dish once assembled. Place the dish in the top part of the oven and cook until the cheese is melted and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. For extra browning, put the dish under the broiler for a minute or two just before serving to get an extra brown cheesy top.

Microwave in 30-second increments, checking the texture in between, until they begin to harden but are still red and slightly pliable, 1 to 2 minutes. (They may begin to brown and taste bitter if cooked too long.) Let sit until cool and completely hardened, about 2 minutes. Repeat with the remaining tomato strips. Transfer the cooled tomato strips to a spice grinder, and grind to a powder. Discard any pieces that won&#39;t grind. Add the nutritional yeast, chili powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt, and grind to a fine powder. Make the taco popcorn: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the popcorn kernels. When one pops, cover the pot, and cook, shaking the pot constantly, until the popping subsides to 1 pop every 20 seconds. Pour in the melted butter, and toss to coat.

While the crust is chilling, bring the sugar, salt and 1/3 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Let cool to warmish. In a measuring cup (or something with a spout), beat together the whole eggs and yolk. Add the warm sugar syrup and whisk to combine. Add the cream and almond extract and whisk to combine. Strain the filling through a mesh sieve. Pour the filling into the prepared shells (they should be about 85% filled). Bake until the filling has puffed up and set and the crust is golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool slightly before removing from the muffin tin and eating. The egg puff will fall, but it\u2019s ok. These will keep in the refrigerator for a couple of days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 28563,&quot;Fish Stock 2 pounds fish bones from non-oily fish (such as red snapper, flounder, sea bass or sole. Avoid salmon, pompano, and tuna) 1 large onion, peeled and diced 2 stalks celery, washed and chopped including leaves 1 leek, split, washed, and sliced 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, leaves and stems 1 tablespoon dried thyme 2 bay leaves 1 teaspoon white peppercorns 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 quarts water 1/2 cup dry white wine, such as Chardonnay Instructions: Wash the bones in cold water to remove any scales or unwanted materials, then combine all ingredients in a large pot.

You will occasionally have to skim the foam off the top of the beer. You will know you have hit 1/3 of a cup of liquid as the liquid will suddenly begin to aggressively foam due to the high concentration of sugar (This looks different from foaming due to carbon dioxide, the bubbles are much larger with the sugar foaming). Let this reduction cool to room temperature. Cream the butter and sugar together. Add the egg and blend thoroughly. Then add the vanilla, orange zest, coriander, and beer reduction and blend again. Mix the flour and baking soda together then slowly add to the batter. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Using a uniform scoop (I use a 1-ounce disher) scoop mounds of cookies onto an aluminum cookie sheet lined with parchment. Make sure you do not overcrowd the cookies; you should be able to fit about 12 cookies on a half sheet pan. Bake for 20 minutes (depending on your oven it may take more or less time, for some ovens it could take 15 minutes for others it could take 25; 20 minutes is an average time). Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet until they are cool enough (about 10 minutes) to transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Optional Icing: Using the icing ingredients whisk the vanilla into the sugar. Mix the orange juice and milk together. Add milk and orange juice mixture until you reach the consistency of a thick paste; you should only need to add 1 tablespoon of the mixture (half of what you made). Using a butter knife put a dollop of icing on each cool cookie and spread it over the top. Put a small piece of orange zest from the bar grater as garnish, if desired. Let the icing harden to desired hardness and consume or store. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]</p><p>&quot; 28568,&quot;Whole Grilled Achiote Striped Bass with Spicy Pickled Red Onions 1/2 orange, juiced (1-ounce) 1 lime, juiced (1-ounce) 1/2 cup achiote paste, 3 1/2-ounce package* 2 teaspoon ground cumin 2 teaspoon ground oregano, preferably Mexican 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 whole striped bass, scaled, gutted and cleaned Vegetable oil or canola oil 1 cup Pickled Red Onions, recipe follows 1 avocado, halved, pitted and sliced, for garnish<br> 1 avocado, halved, pitted and sliced, for garnish 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves cleaned and roughly chopped, for garnish<br> 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves cleaned and roughly chopped, for garnish 1 red onion, sliced thin 2 limes 1/2 orange habanero pepper or 1 whole jalapeno cl, seeded and chopped<br> 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the grill to medium-high.<br> In a medium bowl add the orange juice and the lime juice.

Bring the milk to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Immediately remove from the heat and add 1 of the bags of chips. Stir gently to make sure all the chips are covered with milk. Let sit until the milk is bright orange and the chips are no longer coated with the cheese powder, about 2 minutes. Strain the milk and return it to the saucepan (you should have 2 1/2 cups of milk). Discard the wet chips.<br> Add the macaroni to the steeped milk and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently to keep the macaroni from clumping, until the macaroni is tender and the milk has thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, 4 to 5 minutes.<br> Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the Cheddar, cream cheese, butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir until smooth, thick and creamy. Spread the macaroni into the prepared baking dish and freeze until firm and stiff, about 1 hour.<br> Meanwhile, pulse the remaining bag of chips in a food processor until fine crumbs. Put the eggs, flour and chip crumbs into 3 separate shallow dishes. Lightly beat the eggs.<br> Lift the macaroni slab from the baking dish using the parchment overhangs for handles. Cut the macaroni into 3-inch equilateral triangles. Dredge each triangle in the flour, then dip in the eggs, letting any excess drip off, and finally press into the chip crumbs to cover completely. Put the triangles on a baking sheet and freeze until chilled, about 10 minutes.<br> Fill a large heavy pot with 2 inches of oil and attach a deep-frying thermometer to the pot. Heat the oil over medium heat to 375 degrees F.<br> Working in batches, fry the triangles until golden brown on the outside and heated through on the inside, about 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to lift the triangles from the oil and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; let the oil come back to temperature between batches. Season with salt and serve the triangles in a chip bowl with ranch dressing for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28584,&quot;Toffee, Chocolate and Orange Cookies 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying pan 1/3 cup raspberry jam 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup evaporated milk 1/3 cup butterscotch chips, melted One 7-ounce jar marshmallow creme, such as Marshmallow Fluff 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/3 cup toffee bits 48 ounces coating chocolate (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 cup candied orange peel, chopped into small pieces, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the cookie crust: Beat the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until fluffy. Mix in the egg and vanilla extract. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix until well combined. Spray a 9-inch square pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper. Press the cookie dough evenly into the pan. Prick the dough with a fork or toothpick and bake until golden brown, approximately 20 minutes. Let cool, and then spread the raspberry jam evenly over the top. To make the nougat: Place the butter, sugar and evaporated milk in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and boil until the mixture develops a syrupy texture, for about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the butterscotch chips, marshmallow creme and vanilla extract until smooth and well combined. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Fold in the toffee bits and spread evenly over the cookie and raspberry jam. Allow to set up in the freezer for at least 30 minutes before cutting. Using a ruler as a guide, cut the cookie into 1-by-3-inch bars and return to the freezer while you prepare the chocolate. Melt the coating chocolate over a double boiler. (Or, place the coating chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on medium power for 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval. Continue until the chocolate is thin and completely smooth, about 4 minutes.) Set a cooling rack over a baking sheet. Using a fork or a chocolate tool, dip the chilled bars into the chocolate, coating completely. Let the excess chocolate drip off, and then transfer to the cooling rack to set. Place the bars back in the freezer to set, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the chilled bars from the freezer and enjoy. Alternatively, if using the candied orange peels, slightly melt the top of each bar using a kitchen blowtorch. Sprinkle with the candied orange pieces. Torch the tops of the bars further, until the orange pieces are slightly toasted and brown. Place back in the freezer until ready to enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 28585,&quot;Pistachio-Crusted Tilapia with Chard, Flash-Fried Prosciutto, Gorgonzola and Pine Nuts 1 cup shelled pistachios 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 4 tilapia fillets Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons honey mustard 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided 4 ounces prosciutto, diced 4 tablespoons pine nuts 6 cups fresh chard leaves 1/4 cup crumbled Gorgonzola or blue cheese Instructions: In a food processor, combine pistachios, oregano, thyme, and garlic powder.

Stir about 1/3 of the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture to lighten the cream cheese. Gradually fold in the remaining whipped cream to make a light mousse. Transfer mixture into the lined sieve and fold the cheesecloth over top and press gently. Cover and refrigerate to drain for at least 4 hours or up to 3 days. Just before serving, prepare the berries: Cook about half of the blueberries in a small skillet with the water and sugar, over medium heat until the berries get juicy, about 8 minutes. Toss all the berries together in a large bowl, along with a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Unwrap the cheesecake and invert onto a platter. (Discard the cheesecloth.) Use a large ladle or spoon to press a well in the center of the cake. Spoon the berries into the well and drizzle the juices over the top or serve on the side. Serve a scoop of summer cheesecake with some of the fresh berries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 28606,&quot;Fried Rice with Egg 2 cups long-grain converted white rice, rinsed Salt 1/4 cup oyster sauce 2 tablespoons light Japanese soy sauce 3 large eggs, beaten until just blended 2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil 1 cup frozen baby peas, thawed 2 or 3 scallions, thinly sliced, including some of the green tops, 1/3 to 1/2 cup 2 cups diced store bought roast pork, optional Sesame oil, as needed Instructions: At least 1 day before you plan to make the fried rice, place the rinsed rice in a heavy, medium-sized saucepan. Add 2 cups of cold water and salt, to taste. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, and cook at a gentle boil until the water has cooked down to the level of the rice. With a spoon (not a fork), stir the rice well. Cover, and reduce the heat to low. Continue to cook for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Fluff with a fork. Cool to room temperature before covering and refrigerating for 24 hours. Break up any clumps of the cold rice with your fingers and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the oyster sauce and soy sauce and set aside. Coat a large, nonstick skillet with nonstick vegetable spray and set over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add the eggs, swirling them around to make sure they coat the whole bottom of the pan. Cook, without stirring, and adjusting the heat as necessary, until the eggs are firm and cooked through but not yet starting to brown, lifting the skillet and tilting it so that the eggs cook evenly. Slide the eggs onto a plate and when they have cooled, cut into small pieces and set aside. Return the skillet to the burner and heat the oil over high heat. When it is hot, add the peas and scallions, and cook, stirring constantly, until the scallions are limp, about 1 minute. Stir in the rice, sauce mixture, eggs and roast pork until well mixed. Continue to cook, stirring, until the rice is heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Plate and drizzle with sesame oil, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 28607,&quot;Rotelle with Roasted Corn, Braised Zucchini, Roasted Garlic, Oregano and Feta 2 ears roasted corn 1 pound rotelle pasta, or any spiral-shaped pasta 2 teaspoons olive oil 2 medium zucchini, chopped 1/2 cup diced red onion 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth 1/3 cup roasted garlic cloves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves Salt and ground black pepper 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Add enough milk to make a fluid batter. The batter may be covered and refrigerated up to 24 hours. For the topping: Line large baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside. Slice pineapple quarters crosswise, 1/8-inch thick. In a 7-inch nonstick pan over medium heat, melt 1/4 teaspoon of butter, spreading with a spatula. Remove pan from heat and allow to cool slightly. With pan off heat, ladle in about 3 tablespoons of batter and roll around pan until bottom is evenly coated. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of macadamia nuts. Return pan to medium heat. Just as crepe sets, but while it is still wet on top, remove pan from heat and arrange pineapple slices on an overlapping circular pattern, completely covering the surface of the crepe. Use a skewer or fork to arrange any of the pineapple slices that fall out of place. Shake crepe slightly to keep it from sticking to pan. Return pan to heat, sprinkle pineapple with 2 teaspoons of sugar and about 1/4 tablespoon of cold butter, cut into bits. Use a rubber spatula to loosen edge of crepe and check underside. When bottom is golden brown, loosen crepe by running a rubber spatula around edges and carefully flip crepe over in pan. Continue cooking until sugar underneath begins to turn a light caramel color. Add 1 tablespoon of cream around edges of crepe, and tilt pan so that cream blends with sugar and runs under edges of crepe. Spray a flat metal surface like the bottom of a cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place sprayed side over crepe, and invert skillet to remove crepe. Slide crepe onto prepared baking sheet. Repeat process, wiping pan clean between crepes, to make 10 to 12. Sheet of crepes may be covered and refrigerated up to 4 hours. To serve, reheat crepes in a 350 degree oven until hot, about 4 minutes. Transfer to serving plates. Pour rum into small pitcher or gravy boat and set aflame. Top crepes with burning rum.

In a medium bowl, combine the potato flesh, melted butter, heavy cream, 1 egg, cornstarch, chili powder, garlic powder, and kosher salt and pepper, to taste, and mash until evenly combined; set aside. For the filling: In another medium bowl add the peppers, chicken, oregano, and kosher salt and pepper, to taste. Stir well to combine and reserve. In a deep heavy-bottomed 12-inch pan, add about 3 inches of oil. When ready to fry the balls heat the oil to 375 degrees F. Scoop 1 tablespoon of the potato mixture into your hand and roll it into a ball. Using the back of a 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon scoop or your finger, make an indentation in the ball leaving a pocket for the filling. Scoop a small amount of the chicken filling into the center of the potato and repeat to make a second ball. With the chicken filling facing the center, sandwich the first disk with the second and pinch to close off any seams. Roll lightly between your palms to form a ball. Continue with remaining filling and potato mixture. Lightly beat the remaining egg in a small bowl. Add the potato flakes to a shallow bowl or plate and season lightly with salt. Dip each ball into the beaten egg, then into the potato flakes. If the ball is not completely covered, put it back into the egg, then into the potato flakes for a second time. Set aside and repeat to coat all the balls. Fry the balls, in batches, until cooked through and golden, about 4 minutes.

Put the beef in the freezer for 30 to 45 minutes to firm it until tight but not frozen. Remove the plastic wrap and, working quickly; use an electric knife to slice the beef into paper-thin slices, almost shaving the beef. If this does not produce very thin results, cut the beef into the thinnest slices possible and flatten, using a meat pounder. Once all the beef has been cut, refrigerate until the remaining ingredients are ready. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy-bottomed saute pan set over low heat. Put in the onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook until nicely softened and lightly caramelized but not browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl and set aside. Add the pepper halves to the pan, season with salt and pepper, and fry until soft and tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the onions. Keep the onions and peppers covered and warm. In a clean, heavy-bottomed saute pan, heat the remaining oil over medium heat. Add the beef in batches and lightly brown, seasoning with salt and pepper as you cook, adding more oil if necessary. Pull out a little of the doughy insides of each loaf, then drizzle lightly with the oil, a splash of vinegar, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Put 1/4 of the beef inside each roll, top with onions and peppers, and finish with several slices of cheese. Cover with the top half of the bread. Wrap snugly in sandwich wrapping paper, slice diagonally in half, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 28621,&quot;Christina&#39;s Gingerbread Dough 5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface 1 tablespoon ground ginger 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 cup all-vegetable shortening 1 cup powdered sugar 1 cup dark brown sugar 1 cup molasses 1/4 cup plus 2 to 3 tablespoons strong coffee, cooled Instructions: Combine the flour, ginger, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside. In a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the shortening, powdered sugar, dark brown sugar, and molasses. Mix on low speed, just until smooth, trying not to incorporate too much air. Add the flour mixture all at once, and mix on low to medium-low speed. As this begins to mix, add the 1/4 cup of cooled coffee. Watch closely as the dough begins to come together. If it looks and feels dry and crumbly, begin to add the remaining coffee, 1 tablespoon at a time as needed. The dough should be firm, but evenly moist. Alternatively, this dough can be mixed by hand. If you choose to do this, add the flour mixture in 3 or 4 batches, instead of all at once, to the sugar and shortening mixture. Add the coffee, a little at a time, along with the flour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and shape into 2 flattened rectangles. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, then place into an air-tight container or zip-top plastic bag. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours before rolling and cutting. The dough keeps for 4 days, refrigerated. If dough has been chilled for longer than 1 to 2 hours, allow it to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment or foil, or very lightly grease. Working with 1 piece of the chilled dough at a time, roll out on a lightly floured surface to 3/8-inch thick (small, decorative pieces may be rolled thinner; pieces that will need to provide support may be rolled thicker). Transfer to prepared baking sheets, then cut to desired shapes using templates that have been lightly floured. Cut out desired shapes (use templates and lightly flour them before placing on the dough and cutting). If cutting windows, doors, etc., start by cutting them first, then cut the overall shape. This prevents distortion of the pieces. Keep similar sized pieces on each sheet for even baking. If you have the refrigerator space, a brief chilling at this point (15 minutes) will help the dough hold its shape in the oven, but this step is optional. Lightly brush or spray the surface with water and bake 15 minutes for medium to large pieces (7 to 10 minutes for smaller pieces). Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes. With a sharp knife, carefully re-cut the hot gingerbread (using your templates) if any spreading occurred. Remove all scraps from the tray. Return the baking sheet to the oven. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes more, even longer for very large or thick pieces, until dark brown, but not burned. You must bake gingerbread for houses much longer than you would bake cookies. It must be very dry throughout, and quite dark in color. The low oven temperature helps to keep the browning even, as opposed to dark around the edges. As oven temperatures will vary, check the pieces during the second baking frequently. If they are browning too quickly, lower the oven to 300 degrees F. Remove from the oven and allow to cool 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Loosen the pieces from the tray with a thin spatula and continue to cool on the tray until firm. Remove the pieces from the tray and allow them to cool on a wire rack for several hours before assembling your house. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 28622,&quot;Orzo with Spinach and Tomatoes 1 pound spinach, washed, dried, stems removed 1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes, halved 2 lemons, zested 1 1/2 cups orzo, cooked to al dente 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the bowl 24 basil leaves, torn or thinly sliced Salt and pepper Instructions: Pile spinach leaves in stacks 1 on top of the other. Thinly slice stacks of leaves to make spinach confetti. Pile shredded spinach into the bottom of a medium sized mixing bowl. Halve grape or cherry tomatoes with a paring knife and add them to the mixing bowl. Add the zest of 2 lemons to the bowl and save the lemons in the refrigerator to juice for another recipe. Add hot cooked and drained orzo pasta to the mixing bowl. The heat of the pasta will wilt the spinach and warm the tomatoes at the bottom of the bowl and get the juices flowing from veggies. The heat of the pasta will also release the flavor and oils in the lemon zest. Drizzle 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil over the pasta and toss to combine the veggies and orzo. Add basil and salt and pepper and toss to combine. Taste your orzo to adjust seasonings and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 28623,&quot;This Brittle Piggy 1 stick unsalted butter, plus more for the baking sheet 16 slices bacon 1 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup light corn syrup 1 1/2 cups mixed cocktail nuts Kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda Instructions: Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil and generously butter it. Working in batches, cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain on paper towels, then break each slice in half. Combine the sugar, corn syrup and 1/2 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until a candy thermometer registers 260 degrees F, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the butter, nuts and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir once, then continue cooking over medium-high heat, undisturbed, until the syrup turns golden and the candy thermometer registers 285 degrees F, 5 to 10 more minutes. Carefully stir in the prepared bacon, the vanilla and baking soda. (The mixture will foam a bit.) Cook, stirring several times, until the foam subsides and the mixture darkens slightly, 1 to 2 more minutes. Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, then carefully tilt to spread it into a thin layer. Use tongs to redistribute the bacon pieces if necessary.

Spray a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray. In the bowl of a food processor, grind the cookies and pecans into a fine crumb. Add the coconut, butter and salt and pulse a few more times to combine. Dump the mixture into the prepared pie plate and press the mixture evenly up the sides and along the bottom. Bake until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack until slightly cooled. Leave the oven on. For the fresh pineapple layer: Add the pineapple and granulated sugar to a saucepan. In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch and lime juice, then add the mixture to the saucepan with the pineapple. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking until combined. Continue cooking and whisking until the mixture starts to thicken, about a minute. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool slightly. For the creamy coconut layer: In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until very smooth. Add the coconut cream, zest and rum extract and beat until combined and smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Spread the pineapple mixture into the cooled crust. Pour the cream cheese mixture on top of the pineapple mixture. Bake until the filling is set, 40 to 50 minutes. Tent the edges of the crust with aluminum foil if the crust gets too dark.

Set aside. Place 4 cups of water in a medium saucepot and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Add the snap peas and blanch for 1 minute. The pea pods will turn bright green and become tender. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and place in the ice water; this will stop the cooking. Transfer the peas to a double layer of paper towel to wick away the water. Heat a large skillet on medium-high heat. Add the oil and get it hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Place the radishes cut-side down in the skillet. Season with the salt. Turn down the heat to medium. Cook the radishes until the bottoms just begin to brown and the radishes feel tender when tested with a knife, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. While the radishes are cooking, trim 20 to 24 wooden kebab skewers (depending on how many radishes are in your bunch) to 3 1/2 inches long--kitchen shears should do the trick. Thread the peas on the skewers to prepare the bites. Five minutes before the radishes finish browning, prepare the brown butter sauce. Heat a skillet on medium-high heat until hot. Add the butter. It will immediately sizzle and foam. Stir with a wooden spoon for 4 to 5 minutes. The butter will begin to darken. Add the rosemary. The butter will crackle and foam again and release the fragrance of the rosemary. Continue to cook until it turns a beautiful, deep brown color yet doesn&#39;t burn, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the radishes to the skewers and finish each with 1 radish leaf. Place the bites on a cake stand or platter. Drizzle with the brown butter. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 28626,&quot;Chocolate-Peanut Butter Thumbprint Cookie 1 cup crunchy peanut butter 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 large egg 1/4 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and move a rack to the middle of the oven.

For the salad: Preheat the grill to high heat. Separate the tentacles and head of the octopus. Skewer each leg, weaving the legs through the skewers. Using tongs and an oil-blotted paper towel, wipe down the grill grates to clean and create a nonstick surface. Drizzle the octopus with a few tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper. Place the octopus onto the hot grill and sear. Allow to char around the edges then turn, 3 to 4 minutes per side. The octopus is done when just cooked through yet nicely charred around the edges. Do not overcook or it will be tough. Remove and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut the octopus tentacles and head into bite-size pieces, and then toss with about 3 tablespoons of the lemon vinaigrette. Set aside.

Cooking the meat: Chop the pork butt into 3-inch cubes; reserve the bone.<br> Add the oil to a large pot or Dutch oven and place over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven because it seems to cook faster). Add the pork butt to the pot. Sear the sides slightly until just golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add the peppercorns, bay leaves, onion, 3 cloves of the garlic and 1 tablespoon salt. Add 2 to 4 cups of water, or enough to cover the pork butt, then add the reserved bone. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and bring it to a boil. Cook on medium heat until very tender, about 2 hours.<br> Preparing the corn husks: Separate the corn husks and take off all the little hairs and dust from them. Allow them to soak in hot water while the pork is cooking (or soak overnight).<br> Carefully remove the pork from the broth with tongs to a plate or cutting board. Pour the leftover broth through a colander into a large bowl so that all the onion and other ingredients stay behind. Set the strained broth aside for later (about 4 cups).<br> Shred the meat with 2 forks into small bite-size pieces. (You want it small enough that you aren\u2019t getting large pieces or chunks into the tamal.) Transfer to a medium saucepan.<br> Preparing the cl: Cut the stems from the ancho chiles, open them and remove all the seeds and veins. Put them in a 3-quart saucepan, cover with water and add 1 teaspoon salt. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat, set aside, cover and let steam for 5 minutes. To a blender, add the softened chiles, ground cumin and 1/4 teaspoon salt and blend. Press in the remaining clove of garlic and slowly add 2/3 cup of the reserved pork broth. Continue to blend until smooth. Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cl mixture for the masa, then pour the remaining red cl sauce over the shredded pork and mix together to combine. Keep warm over low heat.<br> Preparing the masa: Melt the lard in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Pour the melted lard into a large bowl. Add the masa harina to the bowl of lard, then add the baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, reserved 1/4 cup of the red cl sauce and 1/2 cup of the reserved pork broth. Knead well. Add more pork broth as needed until the dough is moistened and fluffy.<br> Assembling the tamales: Drain the husks and pat them dry with a clean towel. Spread the kneaded masa onto the smooth side of the corn husks with a spoon in the center of the husks (2 to 3 tablespoons of masa per husk). Add the meat to the center of the masa, 1 to 2 tablespoons per husk. Fold over the husks in half vertically so that the masa wraps around the filling completely. Fold the pointy side up at the end to hold the tamale in place.<br> Cooking the tamales: Arrange the tamales open-side up around the inside of a steamer basket that fits into a large (10-quart) pot, packing the tamales together. If there&#39;s extra space in the steamer basket, place a mason jar or small heatproof ceramic bowl upside down in the center, arranging the tamales around it. Arrange a layer of husks around the sides of the steamer basket and up over the top of the tamales and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Fill the large pot with 1 to 2 inches of water. (Note: You can put a penny at the bottom of the pot so you can hear it rolling when you need more water.) Bring the water to a rolling simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium low, set the steamer basket inside of the pot and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Allow the tamales to steam for 1 to 2 hours or until the masa pulls away from the husks. Let sit to cool down for 5 to 10 minutes. Use tongs to remove the tamales afterwards and set on a jelly roll pan to cool down.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 28692,&quot;Hummus-Masbacha 1 pound dry chickpeas 1 tablespoon baking soda 1 whole head garlic, skin on 12 ounces unhulled sesame paste 4 ounces grape seed oil 2 ounces fresh-squeezed lemon juice Kosher salt Ground cumin 4 ounces unhulled sesame paste 1/2 cup warm water 2 ounces lemon juice 1 clove garlic, germ removed 4 ounces extra-virgin olive oil (preferably from Turkey or Israel) 2 ounces extra-virgin olive oil (preferably from Turkey or Israel) 1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley, chopped Instructions: For the hummus: Combine the chickpeas and baking soda in a large bowl or pot and cover with at least double their volume of water.

Discard the garlic bulb. Combine the remaining chickpeas, the sesame paste, grape seed oil and lemon juice in a food processor and puree to a smooth, creamy consistency, adding reserved cooking liquid as needed. Season with salt and cumin. For the tehina: Combine the sesame paste, water, lemon juice and garlic in a blender and blend at high speed until smooth. Blend in the olive oil.

I stick with beef such as top round steak, flank steak or brisket) 2/3 cup Worcestershire sauce 2/3 cup soy sauce 2 teaspoons ground black pepper 2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon liquid smoke 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon honey Instructions: Place the meat in the freezer for 1 hour, so that it will be easier to cut. Slice the meat with the grain as thin as humanly possible. Mix brine ingredients right in a resealable plastic bag (placing the bag inside a large plastic container will make this easier.) Place meat strips in brine. Move the meat around so the marinade is evenly distributed around it. Seal bag, working out as much air as humanly possible. Lay bag flat in the plastic container and refrigerate for 3 to 6 hours. Remove meat from the brine and drain on cooling racks. Discard the brine. When the meat is dry place it inside Blo-hard 3000 and set fan to medium. Leave overnight or for at least 12 hours. If you don&#39;t find yourself in possession of a Blo-hard 3000, place strips directly on oven racks. Heat oven to lowest setting and use a blob of foil as a wedge to hold door ajar. Oven-dry overnight or until meat reaches a consistency of your liking. Store in zip-top bag or jar in a cool dark place for 30 or 40 years or until fuzzy stuff starts to grow on it. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 28701,&quot;Mashed Tofu Salad (Shira-ae) 1 14-ounce package firm tofu Kosher salt 8 cups spinach leaves 1 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon mirin (sweet rice wine) 1 teaspoon soy sauce Instructions: Drain the tofu and wrap in paper towels to absorb excess water. Puree in a food processor until smooth, then transfer to a bowl and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Fill a bowl with ice water. Cook the spinach in the boiling water until wilted, about 2 minutes, then drain and plunge it into the ice water. Drain and squeeze out the excess water. Toast the sesame seeds in a skillet over medium-low heat, tossing, until golden, about 3 minutes. Cool, then grind in a spice grinder. Stir the ground seeds, sugar, mirin, soy sauce and spinach into the tofu. Season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 28702,&quot;Pea and Goat Cheese Stuffed Ravioli 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 4 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons water Kosher salt<br> 3 cups frozen peas, thawed 2 cups goat cheese<br> 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for garnish<br> 4 large eggs<br> Kosher salt<br> All-purpose flour, for dusting Semolina flour, for dusting<br> 1 1/2 cups chicken stock<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter<br> Pea tendrils Sugar snap peas<br> Chopped fresh mint<br> Instructions: For the dough: Mound the flour on a clean, dry work surface and make a big hole in the center of the pile. Crack the eggs into the hole along with the extra yolks, olive oil, water and some salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs. Incorporate the flour, a little at a time, into the egg mixture, being careful not to break the well (or the egg mixture will run everywhere). When enough flour is incorporated that you can handle the dough, use your hands to combine everything really well. (If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands a bit.) When the mixture is homogeneous, start kneading. Knead until the dough is smooth and supple, anywhere from 8 to15 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least an hour. For the ravioli: In a food processor, pulse the peas to make a coarse paste. Mix the pea paste, goat cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano and eggs in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt. Set aside. With a rolling pin, roll out the dough into sheets about 1/4-inch thick and 12 inches long, using extra flour as needed to prevent sticking,. (Reserve the excess dough for another use.) Brush the bottom half of the pasta sheets lightly with water. Fill a disposable pastry bag (or a resealable bag with one corner snipped) with the pea mixture. Pipe 1-inch balls of filling onto the pasta about 1 1/2-inches apart on the bottom half of the pasta sheets. Fold the top half of the pasta sheets over the filling so the top edges meet the bottom edges. Use your index fingers to press around the filling and seal the edges shut. Use a fluted ring cutter or fluted pasta roller to cut out the ravioli. Place the ravioli on a semolina-dusted baking sheet. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Heat the chicken stock and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; season with salt. Add the ravioli to the boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the ravioli to the sauce and cook, shaking the pan frequently, until the sauce begins to thicken and cling to the pasta, a few minutes. (If the sauce seems too thick, add a bit more stock.) Place five ravioli on each serving plate, spoon a little extra sauce on top and garnish with pea tendrils, sugar snap peas and mint. Sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 28703,&quot;Chicken or Turkey Spanakopita Burgers and Fries with Yogurt Dip Hot pepper rings or pepperoncini, optional 1 package store-bought frozen fries, any variety 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, plus some for drizzling 1 tablespoon butter 3 cloves garlic, 2 chopped, 1 crushed 1 red onion, 1/2 chopped, 1/2 thinly sliced 1 box, 10 ounces, frozen spinach, defrosted 2 teaspoons dried oregano, lightly crushed in the palm, divided 1/4 pound feta crumbles 1 1/3 pounds ground chicken or ground turkey breast, 1 package 1 tablespoon grill seasoning (recommended: Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick) 1/3 seedless cucumber, thinly sliced lengthwise, plus 1 small, 2-inch piece of cucumber peeled, trimmed and chopped 2 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced lengthwise Salt and pepper 1 1/2 to 2 cups good quality plain yogurt, look for Greek yogurt 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 cup arugula, coarsely chopped or shredded 4 crusty rolls, split 2 roasted red peppers, drained 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, a generous handful 1/4 cup 10 to 12 pitted kalamata olives Instructions: Preheat oven to directions on the package and bake fries until crisp.

Add 2 cloves of garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper and cook until the garlic is golden, about 1 minute. Remove the garlic and discard. Add half of the spinach to the pan, season with salt and saute until gently wilted. Remove the spinach from the pan to a towel-lined colander set inside a bowl to let the spinach drain and cool. Repeat the process with the remaining garlic and spinach and another pinch of crushed red pepper. Squeeze the towel to remove most of the liquid from the spinach. Remove any liquid from the bottom of the saute pan and coat lightly with olive oil. Heat the oil over medium heat, add the shallots and season with salt and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Saute until the shallots are translucent and very aromatic, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the butter and, when melted, stir in the flour. Cook until it is the texture of wet sand, 5 to 6 minutes. Whisk in the milk and heavy cream. Taste for seasoning and season with salt, if needed, (it will). Bring the milk and heavy cream to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally so the milk doesn&#39;t scorch on the bottom. Stir in the Gruyere and Parmigiano until melted. Add the reserved spinach and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed.

Brush the baked pie shell up to the rim with the melted chocolate. Set aside to cool and harden at room temperature or, uncovered, in the refrigerator. Bring the milk, cream of coconut, and vanilla bean to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes. Do not remove the vanilla bean. Meanwhile, whip the egg yolks and sugar together in mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer) until pale yellow and fluffy. With the mixer running at low speed, mix in the cornstarch, then gradually pour in the hot milk mixture. Strain the mixture back into the saucepan to smooth it. Whisking constantly, cook over medium high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Pour the mixture into a bowl and stir in the butter. Half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Rest the bowl containing the custard in the ice water and let cool, stirring frequently to cool the mixture. When the custard is cool, whip the cream until stiff. Fold the whipped cream and coconut into the custard. Pour the mixture into the chocolate-coated pie shell and smooth the top. Refrigerate uncovered at least 24 hours.

Toss the slices in a bowl with the lemon juice and zest to keep them from browning. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Sprinkle this over the apples and toss until the fruit is evenly coated. Melt the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the apple mixture and saute for 5 minutes. Add the cream and vanilla and continue to cook the apples, stirring often, until the juices thicken and the apples are just tender, 5 to 10 minutes more (see Cook&#39;s Note). Set aside to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Roll out one-third of the tripled pie dough into a large (about 14-by-19-inch) rectangle. Wrap the dough loosely around the rolling pin and transfer it to a half-sheet pan, gently pressing it into the edges and corners of the pan. Prick the bottom of the dough all over with a fork, then refrigerate. Roll the remaining two batches of dough into one large, rough 1/4-inch-thick rectangle. Slice into lattice strips. (You can cut them all even thickness or alternate between thick and thin strips. I cut 1 1/4-inch strips and 1/2-inch strips.) Gather any dough scraps, wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Build the lattice on a sheet of parchment set on the back side of a half-sheet pan sprinkled with flour. Start by laying strips crosswise about 1/2 inch apart. Gently fold every other strip halfway over. Place a strip lengthwise on the parchment and fold the shorter strips back over. Fold up the opposite strips you just used and place another strip lengthwise; fold the short strips back over. Repeat on both sides until you have a basket weave pattern. Roll out any remaining dough scraps and use cookie cutters to cut leaf or flower shapes. Place the lattice and sheet pan in the freezer while the filling cools. Assembly: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spoon the cooled filling onto the bottom crust in an even layer. Slide the chilled lattice top onto the bottom crust, using the parchment to help. With a sharp knife, cut the lattice flush with the edges of the pan. Use egg wash to adhere any cut-outs to the top of the pie. Brush egg wash over the crust and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Bake until the filling is bubbling in the center and the top and bottom crusts are golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the flour, salt, sugar and butter until the mixture resembles cornmeal with some pea-size pieces of butter remaining. In a small bowl, stir together the ice water and the lemon juice. Slowly add the liquid to the flour mixture, pulsing, until the dough just comes together. Squeeze a small piece of dough between your thumb and index finger to make sure it holds its shape. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently turn it over each a few times so that any dry bits are incorporated. Form into a disk or rectangle, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.

Spread the garlic cloves onto a sheet tray and roast, 20 minutes. Set up a deep fryer with canola oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Fry the brussels sprouts until crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt. Lower the temperature on the fryer to 275 degrees F. Combine the cornstarch, baking powder and salt to taste in a wide shallow dish. Dredge the chicken halves in the cornstarch mixture and shake off any excess. Deep-fry the chicken for 10 minutes, then remove from the oil onto a paper towel-lined tray. Increase the temperature on the fryer to 400 degrees F. Place the chicken back into the fryer to crisp for 5 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Add 1/4 cup each of the apple cider and apple cider vinegar to a large saute pan placed over medium-high heat. Allow to reduce by half, about 5 minutes. Add half the chicken stock and salt to taste. Reduce by half, about 5 minutes, then add the remaining chicken stock. Add the roasted garlic and allow the sauce to reduce, 5 to 7 minutes. Finish the sauce with the remaining 2 tablespoons each apple cider and apple cider vinegar and the butter. For the dirty rice: Add the onion, salt to taste and 2 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil to a medium saucepan and turn the heat to medium high. Sweat the onion until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat. Toast for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock, bay leaves and salt to taste. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce to a simmer and cook until the rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork and set aside.

Add the chicken livers and blood sausage and brown until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the cooked rice to the pan and stir to combine, tossing to thoroughly coat the rice in the chicken livers and blood sausage. Remove the pan from the heat, add the brandy and ignite with a click lighter. Put the pan back on the heat and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the alcohol has cooked off. Turn off the heat and stir in the scallions. For the glazed carrots: Season a pot of boiling water generously with salt. It should be as salty as the sea. Prepare an ice bath and season generously with salt. Add the carrots to the boiling water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until tender but still slightly crisp. Remove the carrots and immediately plunge into the ice bath. Set aside. Melt the butter, brown sugar and cayenne together in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken stock and the blanched carrots. Toss to coat the carrots, then allow the liquid to reduce until the glaze has thickened, 5 minutes. If the mixture needs to be thinned out, you can add a bit more chicken stock. To plate: Place a scoop of dirty rice onto the plate. Top with the glazed carrots, followed by the chicken. Spoon the sauce over the chicken, making sure to include the roasted garlic cloves. Garnish with the crispy Brussels sprouts and micro radish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 28740,&quot;Jack&#39;s Peach BBQ Beans 8 strips bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 1 large yellow onion, chopped 1 (#10 can, about 6 pounds and 10 ounces) baked beans (recommended: Bush&#39;s) 3 cups canned peach pie filling 1/2 cup barbecue sauce 2 tablespoons Jack&#39;s Old South BBQ Rub, recipe follows 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup sweet paprika 1/4 cup kosher salt 3 tablespoons black pepper 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon dried basil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Using a paper towel, grease a rectangular baking pan with the butter, making sure to get the bottom and sides. Sprinkle the pan evenly with the flour. In a large mixing bowl, combine the vinegar, vanilla extract and egg whites. Using an electric mixer, beat until foamy. Slowly stream in the sugar and continue to whip the mixture until stiff peaks form. Spoon the meringue onto the baking sheet, and delicately shape it into an even \crust\ layer, bringing it up the sides of the baking sheet as well. Bake for 2 1/2 hours; turn off the oven and leave it in there for another 30 minutes. The dissipating heat will finish cooking the meringue. Remove from the oven and let cool.

Slice the steak thinly, across the grain on the bias and serve with the chimichurri sauce.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/cup sugar, divided.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/cup%20sour%20cream.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>cup sour cream</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/cup%20sweet%20chili%20sauce.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>cup sweet chili sauce</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
