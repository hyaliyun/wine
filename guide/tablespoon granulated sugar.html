refrigerated or frozen naengmyeon noodles (see Cook\u2019s Note) Distilled white vinegar and yellow mustard, for serving<br> Instructions: For the broth: Put the shank and brisket in a large bowl and add cold water to cover. Let soak, changing the water halfway through if it gets too discolored, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Meanwhile, add 4 quarts cold water and the dasima to a 6-quart Dutch oven or pot. Let sit until the dasima doubles in size and the water turns a slight green-yellow, 30 to 45 minutes.<br> Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat; boil until the dasima starts to foam around the sides, about 2 minutes. Discard the dasima, then add the shank, brisket, black peppercorns, garlic, scallion whites, onion and fresh radish. Bring to a boil again, then lower the heat to medium and cook at a gentle boil (where you see 2 to 3 bubbles appearing on the surface at most), keeping an eye on the broth and adjusting the heat if necessary every 30 minutes to ensure it&#39;s not boiling away, until just slightly reduced, 1 hour 15 minutes. Cover with the lid, lower the heat to low and simmer until the broth is darker and reduced further, another 1 hour 15 minutes.<br> Remove the meat from the broth and let cool on a plate. Once cool, thinly slice the meat and refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use. Using a slotted spoon or hand-held strainer, pick out and discard the vegetables and black peppercorns from the broth. Transfer the broth to an airtight container and refrigerate until cooled completely, 8 to 12 hours. Once the broth is completely cool, strain through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth.<br> Season the chilled broth with the soup soy sauce and 2 teaspoons salt. Combine with the dongchimi liquid and adjust the seasoning to taste with more dongchimi liquid, salt and/or vinegar to your preference. Refrigerate until ready to use.<br> For the garnish: Add the eggs to a small saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover by at least 1 inch. Bring the water to just under a boil and cook over medium heat for 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and plunge in an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Once cool, peel and halve vertically. Set aside.<br> Toss the cucumber in a medium bowl with the vinegar, 2 teaspoons of the sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and mix to ensure each slice is seasoned and coated well. Refrigerate until ready to use.<br> Whisk the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar with 1/2 cup water in a small bowl. Add the sliced pear and set aside (this helps the pears from oxidizing and turning brown).<br> For the naengmyeon: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse under running cold water, rubbing the noodles between your fingers and gently massaging in the water. Drain and then rinse again, repeating this process 2 more times to rid the noodles of excess starch. Allow to drain well and set aside in the colander until ready to use. (When ready to plate, rinse the noodles once more, as they tend to stick together.)<br> Divide the noodles, boiled eggs, cucumber, pear, fermented radish and chilled broth among 4 large soup bowls. Add ice cubes to the broth. Serve immediately with white vinegar and yellow mustard on the side.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]&quot; 18082,&quot;Ligurian Fish Stew 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling 1 medium carrot, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces 1 onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped Kosher salt 3/4 cup white wine, such as Pinot Grigio 1 (28-ounce) can crushed or pureed Italian tomatoes (recommended: San Marzano) 1 cup water 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus extra for garnish 1 1/2 pounds whitefish fillets, halibut, cod or arctic char, skinned and cut into 3/4-inch chunks 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 (1-pound) loaf ciabatta or rustic bread, trimmed and cut into 3/4-inch thick slices Olive oil, for drizzling, plus 3 tablespoons 1 garlic clove, halved Instructions: For the stew: In a 6-quart, heavy bottomed stock pot or Dutch oven, heat 1/3 cup of oil over medium-high heat. Add the carrot, onion, and garlic. Season with salt and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 to 8 minutes. Turn the heat to high. Add the wine and scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, water and red pepper flakes. Reduce the heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 18 to 20 minutes. Season the fish with salt and add to the stew. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 to 8 minutes. Season the stew with salt, if needed. For the Crostini: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange the bread slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake until light golden, about 12 minutes. Cool for 2 minutes. Rub the warm toasts with the cut side of the garlic. Ladle the stew into serving bowls and garnish with parsley. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle a few red pepper flakes on top. Serve with the crostini. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 18083,&quot;Flambeed Shrimp Chipotle Tostadas 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 cup milk<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> Pinch salt and coarsely ground black pepper Pinch salt and coarsely ground black pepper<br> 3 canned chipotle chiles in adobo, plus more if desired 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/4 onion, finely chopped<br> 2 pounds peeled large or jumbo shrimp Salt and coarsely ground black pepper 1/4 cup tequila, for flambeing<br> 8 tostadas<br> Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish Instructions: For the spicy chipotle crema: In a blender, add the sour cream, milk, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper and chiles and blend until combined. You can always add more peppers for a hotter sauce. Set aside. For the tostadas: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the garlic and onion and saute until translucent. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and add to the skillet. Cook until the shrimp start to change to a pinkish tone, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the tequila to the skillet and tilt the skillet slightly over the burner to ignite it. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the flames subside, then return it back to medium-high heat. Add the chipotle crema, bring to a simmer and cook until fully combined and warm, about 2 minutes. Divide the shrimp mixture among the tostadas and sprinkle with the cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 18084,&quot;Waldorf Salad with Roast Beef Sandwich 2 tablespoons mayonnaise made with olive or soybean oil 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon) Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 8 pecan halves, broken into pieces 4 celery stalks, sliced (1 cup) 2 small red apples, cored and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 1 1/2 cups) Several romaine lettuce leaves, washed and dried 4 slices rye bread 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1/2 pound sliced lean roast beef 2 small tomatoes, sliced 2 cups light fruit-flavored yogurt Instructions: Combine the mayonnaise and lemon juice in a medium-size bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Toast the pecans in a toaster oven for 1 minute, or until brown to bring out their flavor. Be careful-they burn easily. Toss the celery, apple and pecans in the mayonnaise mixture. Place lettuce leaves on 4 plates and spoon the salad onto the leaves to serve. Spread the bread with mustard. Divide the roast beef between each slice of bread. Top with the tomato slices. Serve any extra tomato slices on the side. Divide yogurt between 4 dessert bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 18085,&quot;Greek-Style Fresh Tomato Sauce Salt 2 tablespoons EVOO 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 large red onion, chopped 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 pints cherry tomatoes, halved if large Freshly ground pepper 1 pound penne with ridges (penne rigate) 12 ounces Greek feta, crumbled (about 1 1/4 cups) 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Heat the EVOO in a large skillet or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium to medium-high heat. Melt the butter into the oil. When the butter begins to foam, add the oregano, garlic and onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until the tomatoes have burst and the sauce is thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid, then drain the pasta. Stir the sauce, then add the feta and cook until melted, about 1 minute.

Lightly butter three 8-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Combine the milk and the vanilla and peppermint extracts in a small bowl; set aside. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in 1 cup sugar, then increase the mixer speed to high and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the milk mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, until just combined. Scrape down the side of the bowl, then increase the mixer speed to medium and beat until smooth, about 5 more minutes. In a separate large bowl (using clean beaters), beat the egg whites with a mixer on high speed until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue beating until stiff, shiny peaks form, about 6 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the whites into the batter in 3 additions until combined. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans. Bake, switching the position of the pans about halfway through, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let the cakes cool 10 minutes in the pans, then run a knife around the edges and invert onto racks to cool completely. Peel off the parchment. (The cakes can be made up to 1 day ahead; wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.) Make the frosting: Fill a medium saucepan with 1 to 2 inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Combine the sugar, corn syrup, egg whites, 2 tablespoons water and the salt in a heatproof bowl and set over the saucepan (do not let the bowl touch the water). Whisk until the sugar dissolves and the mixture registers 165 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 8 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan and beat with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 5 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until fluffy and cool, about 4 more minutes. Add the vanilla and peppermint extracts and beat until combined, 1 more minute. Assemble the cake: Place 1 cake layer on a platter and spread 1 cup frosting on top; sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons crushed candy canes. Top with another cake layer, spread with 1 cup frosting and sprinkle with another 2 tablespoons crushed candy canes. Top with the final cake layer, then frost the top and side of the cake with the remaining frosting. Sprinkle more crushed candy canes on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18096,&quot;Pan Steamed Broccoli 1 to 1 1/2 pounds broccoli with stalk, rinsed and trimmed 1/3 cup water Pinch kosher salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: Peel the stalk of the broccoli, remove the florets and cut into 1-inch pieces.

Trim off any excess fat from the short ribs. In a large saucepan or flameproof casserole, combine 3 quarts of water, the black, white, and Szechuan peppercorns, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the short ribs and partially cover the pot. Reduce the heat to low. Simmer the ribs, skimming off any foam from the surface, until the meat is almost tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, about 1 1/2 hours. Do not overcook, because the ribs will cook further in 2 later steps. Remove the ribs from the braising liquid and let cool to room temperature. Bring the Shanton Broth and red miso to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat, whisking to dissolve the miso. Add the short ribs and reduce the heat to low. Simmer uncovered, turning occasionally, until the ribs are very tender but not falling apart, about 1 1/2 hours. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the short ribs to a plate and let cool completely. Then remove the meat from the bones, trying to keep each rib in 1 chunk. While the ribs are cooling, skim off as much fat as you can from the Shanton-Miso broth. Boil over high heat until the liquid is reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Strain the sauce and set aside. (The short ribs and sauce can be prepared up to 1 day ahead, separately cooled, covered, and refrigerated. Remove from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before deep-frying.) Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or pour vegetable oil into a large saucepan to reach halfway up the sides. Heat over high heat to 350 degrees F. Working with half of the short ribs at a time, coat the ribs with the all-purpose flour, shaking off any excess. Dip in the tempura batter and let extra batter drip back into the bowl. Add the coated ribs to the hot oil and deep-fry until light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted skimmer, transfer to a wire rack set on a baking sheet to drain. Keep warm in the low oven while frying the remaining short ribs. To serve, spoon equal amounts of the sauce onto 4 dinner plates. Top each with 2 pieces of Short Rib Tempura and serve immediately. In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolk with a fork. Whisk in the vegetable oil until blended and then the club soda. Add the flour and stir with chopsticks until just barely combined. Don&#39;t worry if some flour floats on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18099,&quot;Mini Strawberry Mascarpone Tarts 8 ounces frozen pizza dough, thawed 1/2 cup sugar, plus 1 tablespoon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 8 large strawberries, hulled and finely diced 4 ounces mascarpone cheese, whipped Instructions: Special equipment: 3-inch round cookie cutter Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. In a small bowl add 1/2 cup of sugar and the salt. Stir to combine and pour about half of it evenly onto a work surface. With your hands, press the dough into the sugar and roll out into a flat disk, about 1/2-inch thick. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 of the sugar evenly over the top of the dough and press it a few times to adhere. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a thickness of about 1/8-inch, turning and flipping as you roll to incorporate the sugar into the dough and to keep it from sticking to the surface. With a 3-inch round cutter, cut out 12 dough rounds and arrange them on the lined baking sheet. Transfer to the oven and bake until crisp and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool the crisp rounds completely on the pan. Meanwhile, pour the balsamic vinegar into a small saucepan and bring it to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer until thick and syrupy, about 4 minutes; it should still swirl in the pan. If too thick, simply add about a teaspoon of balsamic, stir, and remove from the heat. Put the strawberries in a small bowl and sprinkle them with 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let them stand until juicy, 5 to 10 minutes. To assemble the tarts, spread about 2 teaspoons mascarpone on each crisp dough round with a spoon or small offset spatula. Using a spoon to drain any excess liquid, put about 1 tablespoon of diced strawberries on the top of each tart. Drizzle a little balsamic syrup over the tarts and serve immediately. Cook&#39;s Note: The sugared dough scraps can be tossed with cinnamon and baked in the 400 degree F oven until browned and crisp as a treat for the little ones. Leftover strawberries or balsamic syrup are delicious over ice cream! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 18100,&quot;Holiday Honey 1 oz.

Use 1 tablespoon of the oil to smear a patch in the center of the foil, large enough to hold the chicken. Make a bed of the lotus root or jicama in the center, then top with the chicken breasts, red pepper, mango, lime lives, scallions, coconut milk, nam pla, and another tablespoon of the oil. Fold the foil over the chicken onto itself and crimp the edges as tightly as possible by making 1- or 2- inch folds, one after the other, each sealing the other. Seal the package very tightly, but leave plenty of room around the chicken. (You can prepare the recipe up to 3 hours in advance to this point; refrigerate the package as is for up to 3 hours before proceeding. Place a skillet large enough to hold the package over high heat. A minute later, add the remaining oil, then pour out all but a film. Put the package in the skillet; it will sizzle. About 2 minutes later, the package will expand like a balloon; be careful of the escaping steam. Cook for 5 minutes longer from that point. Remove the package from the heat, again taking care to avoid any escaping steam. Let rest for 1 minute, then cut a slit down the length of the top with a knife. Use a knife and fork to open up the package, then spoon the chicken, garnish, and juices onto a plate and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18142,&quot;Salmon Quesadillas with Sun-Dried Tomatoes Cooking spray 8 flour or whole-wheat tortillas 2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend or shredded Monterey Jack 2 cooked salmon fillets, pulled apart with 2 forks into 1-inch pieces 1 teaspoon chili powder 1/2 cup sliced pickled jalapeno peppers 2 Hass avocados, pitted and flesh removed from skin 1/2 cup drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves Salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Coat a large griddle with cooking spray and preheat to medium-high.

Remove the skin from the legs and reserve with the neck, heart, and gizzard. Heat an 8-inch saute pan over high heat. Add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add the duck legs and sear until well browned on all sides, but not cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Lower the heat to medium-low, pour off any excess fat and add the white wine. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover with a tight lid and cook slowly over low heat for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat falls off the bones. Remove the legs from the liquid and remove all the meat from the bones and set aside. Pour the braising liquid into a shallow container and remove the fat - if you refrigerate the braising liquid overnight the fat will solidify and be easy to remove. There should be at least 1 cup of braising liquid left after the removal of the fat, if not, add chicken stock to make up 1 cup. Add the braised meat back to the braising liquid and cook over low heat, just until the meat is heated through. Set aside and keep warm. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the duck breasts, skin side down, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook without turning for 20 minutes, lowering the heat if the skin gets too dark and removing excess fat from the pan as it renders from the duck. During the last few minutes of cooking, season the flesh side with salt. Turn the breasts over and cook for 3 minutes. The duck breast should be medium rare to medium to be perfect. Remove the duck breast from the pan and let rest on a plate, reserving any juices that accumulate. Slice each breast into 4 to 6 slices. Remove the stewed duck meat from the braising liquid. Add the Pear Sauce to the braising liquid and strain through a fine strainer. Add any juices from the duck breast, the pear brandy and the butter and whisk well. Place a scoop of Barley Risotto slightly off center. Place some of the braised meat in front and the Wilted Greens on either side of the risotto. Place slices of the duck atop the braised meat. Drizzle the meat with the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts and place the dried pear slices into the risotto. Using a juicer, juice 2 pears to get 1/2 cup of juice. The pears can also be grated into a bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel. Once the pulp is in the towel, close the towel and squeeze all the juice out into the bowl. Thinly slice the remaining 4 pears lengthwise. Place in a food dehydrator and dry until crisp according to manufacturer&#39;s recommendations. Save the best looking dry pear slices to garnish the plate.<br> Using a spice grinder grind the dried pears to a powder. Add 1/2 cup of the pear powder to the 1/2 cup of juice and let sit. The juice will thicken quickly and be about the consistency of peanut butter. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Halve the butternut squash lengthwise and scoop out the seeds and discard. Lightly oil a sheet pan, place the squash flesh side down, and roast until soft, about 45 minutes. Set aside to cool, then scoop out of the skin and puree until smooth using a food mill or food processor. Refrigerate.<br> Soak the barley in the water, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Pour the barley and the soaking water into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer until softened, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the butternut squash puree and season with salt and black pepper and keep warm until needed. Add butter right before serving. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add enough canola oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add the greens and cook, tossing often, just until greens are wilted and stalks are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.

Place over medium-high heat and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and place a cooling rack on top. Make the batter: Pour the cake mix into a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the flour and baking powder. Add the milk and eggs. Use a hand mixer to blend the wet ingredients into the dry, until the batter is smooth and free of any lumps. Scrape the batter into a pastry bag and snip a small hole in the tip. Quickly squeeze the batter in a circular motion into the hot oil, creating a lacey round about 3 inches wide. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Gently remove from the oil and flip onto the cooling rack (they are fragile). Repeat to make 16 funnel cakes. They will become crispy as they cool. Allow the ice cream to soften on the counter for about 5 minutes. Scoop the ice cream onto 8 funnel cakes. Top each scoop with another funnel cake and gently press down. Dust the ice cream sandwiches with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 18154,&quot;Pasta with Grilled Poultry Sausages 1/2 pound ziti 4 tomatoes, seeded and cut into 1/2inch dice 7 ounces pimientoes or roasted red peppers, finely sliced 1/4 cup olive oil 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads dissolved in 2 tablespoons sherry wine vinegar 1 pound spicy chicken or turkey sausages, pricked with a fork Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 scallions, green parts only, thinly slice Instructions: Cook the pasta in 2 quarts of salted water.

If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Heat about 4 inches of oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot over direct heat until it reaches 360 degrees F. For the beer-battered fluke: Whisk together 3 cups of the instant flour with the cornstarch, seafood seasoning, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a large bowl. Whisk together the eggs and beer in a separate large bowl. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until there are no lumps. Let the batter rest for 5 minutes so the flour can bloom. Meanwhile, make the tartar sauce: Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, garlic, jalapeno, lime zest and juice in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. You can add a splash of the jalapeno pickling liquid if desired for extra flavor. Dry the fish fillets with paper towels and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Working in batches, dredge each piece of fish in the batter. Using a fork, lift each fish fillet out of the batter, let the extra batter drip down and then carefully drop the battered fish into the oil. Do not overcrowd the pot. Fry until the batter is golden brown and crisp and the fish is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and season with sea salt. Season the remaining 1/2 cup of instant flour with salt and pepper. Dredge the lemon slices and parsley in the seasoned flour, then fry until crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove to the paper towel-lined plate. Add the fried fish, lemons and parsley to a platter and serve immediately with the jalapeno tartar sauce for dipping.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cherries have released all of their juices and the mixture is bubbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix the remaining 2 tablespoons orange juice with the cornstarch and add it to the cherry mixture. Stir until thickened, about 1 minute. Turn the heat off and cool the mixture to room temperature. Preheat a well-oiled grill over medium heat. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly flour a clean work surface. Roll the pizza dough into a circle 1/4-inch thick.

Slowly sprinkle the calcium lactate into the pan and mix with a hand blender. Chill. Meanwhile prepare the molds (I use a small flexi-mold, but any mold that is able to be flexible will do) with a dot of melted chocolate to resemble a pupil, and place in the refrigerator to set. Then brush the blue cocoa butter to resemble the iris, and pipe in the jelly to resemble bloody veins. Once the cream mixture is cold, whip to a soft peak using a hand mixer. Pipe into the prepared molds and freeze until set. Unmold the eyeballs and leave them soaking in the Alginate Solution for about 2 minutes. Then rinse with cold water and store in the fridge until you are ready to serve. Place the eyeballs in a dish (2 each is appropriately scary) and top with the lime soda. I find that a clear soda without color gives the eyeballs a better look and flavor. Sprinkle the sodium alginate into the water and, using a hand blender, mix the solution until there is no more visible powder left. This takes a couple of minutes.

Cook, whisking gently, until the sauce has returned to the consistency of heavy cream, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the heat to low and begin mixing handfuls of cheese into the sauce. Stir in the nutmeg, mustard and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook until all the cheese has melted and the sauce is creamy. Fold in the bacon or lobster if using. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Remove the sauce from the heat. In a large serving bowl, combine the pasta and half of the cheese sauce, stirring to coat the pasta evenly. Stir in the remaining sauce. For the pork chops: In a bowl, mix together the chipotles, brown sugar, Worcestershire, liquid smoke, ginger, onion powder, garlic, 2 tablespoons sea salt and 2 tablespoons black pepper. Pour half the mixture into a large bowl; add the pork chops, turning to coat in the marinade. Let sit at room temperature for at least 10 minutes, turning occasionally, or for maximum flavor, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Refrigerate and reserve the remaining marinade. Preheat a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Remove the pork chops from the marinade, shaking off any excess; discard the marinade. Lightly oil the skillet, then immediately add the chops. Cook, using the rosemary sprigs to baste with the reserved marinade, until the meat is well-browned and crisp on the outside and no longer pink inside, 8 to 10 minutes per side -- a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F. Pour the remaining reserved marinade into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Serve the chops with the sauce and the mac and cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 18176,&quot;Gina&#39;s BBQ Brie with Raspberries 2 cups fresh raspberries 1/3 cup red wine vinegar 1/2 cup light brown sugar Pinch red pepper flakes 1 small wheel brie cheese Crackers, for serving Instructions: Preheat grill to medium-high heat.

Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the cocoa powder and baking soda, and blend in 1/3 cup of the melted butter. Add the hot coffee and stir until well blended. Stir in the sugar, eggs and remaining 1/3 cup melted butter to combine. Sift together the flour and salt, and set aside. Add the vanilla to the wet mixture, then stir the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Pour half of the brownie mixture into the prepared baking pan, top with the chocolate bars, and then pour the remaining brownie mixture over chocolate bars. Smooth the top with an offset spatula. Bake until the brownies begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the brownies cool completely before cutting, at least 1 hour. For the crispy rice treat \corn-on-the-cob: Heat the butter and marshmallows in a large skillet over medium-low heat. When the marshmallows are completely melted, turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla. Add the puffed rice cereal and mix well. Spray a jellyroll pan with nonstick spray and pour the cereal mixture out onto pan. Spray your hands with nonstick spray and press the mixture evenly into the pan. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then cut crosswise into 3-by-10-inch strips. Roll up strips and press in the ends to smooth. Knead the fondant to soften, then roll out to a 1/8-inch thickness. Using a roll of puffed rice as a template to measure, cut a strip of fondant. Roll the puffed rice in fondant and press the seam to seal. Measure out circles on the fondant that fit ends of your \corn; press the edges to seal. Using a Dresden tool, make horizontal and vertical lines in the fondant to create the look of corn kernels. Using an airbrush machine, lightly cover the \corn\ with yellow coloring, leaving random areas without color. Then use the flesh color to create shadowing and depth. For the drunk cherry \BBQ sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook down the cherries with the sugar, cornstarch and 1/2 cup cold water until tender, about 15 minutes. Run the cherry mixture through a blender and then strain back into the saucepan. Stir in the orange liqueur, cider vinegar, vanilla and cayenne, and cook over low heat until reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Take off the heat and let cool. To finish the brownie \ribs: Melt the chocolate melts in a heatproof bowl set over an inch of simmering water. Stir until smooth. Spread the melted chocolate to a 1/8-inch thickness on a silicone baking mat. Run through the chocolate with a fork to create texture. Carefully pull the baking mat onto a baking sheet.

To prepare the cl con Queso, mix the cheese and Roasted Jalapeno Salsa in a cazuela or an ovenproof serving dish and bake until the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately. In a cast iron skillet, over a very high heat, char the onion slices and remove. Toast the garlic, remove and peel. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to the skillet and sear the chilies until charred. Add the remaining oil, the oregano, lime juice, and salt ingredients and cook 1 minute. Place all the ingredients in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Process until they are roughly chopped but smooth. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, mix the brine: salt, cayenne, lime juice, water and oil. Warm over a low heat and whisk thoroughly. Cut the stale tortillas into strips or wedges. (If the tortillas are fresh, dry them by spreading them on a baking sheet and letting them sit out, room temperature, for 1 hour or more.) Briefly dip the tortilla pieces into the brine, then shake off the excess water. (A longer soaking in the brine will make the tortillas take on a more pronounced flavor.) Spread the prepared tortilla chips in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake, turning occasionally, until they are crisp and golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 18247,&quot;What Zane Eats Sandwich 2 slices double rye bread 4 tablespoons Elinor&#39;s Chopped Liver, recipe follows Five 1/4-inch-thick slices salami 1/4 cup red onions, sliced into thin rounds 2 tablespoons Russian honey mustard 1 sour pickle, for serving 1 pound beef liver, cleaned of outer skin and veins Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 hard-boiled egg<br> 1/2 cup liquid schmaltz (rendered chicken fat), plus more for cooking onions 1 cup onions, caramelized in schmaltz Instructions: Preheat the grill to high heat.<br> Smear both slices of bread with the Elinor&#39;s Chopped Liver.

Place the potatoes on a cutting board. With the tip of a small, sharp knife, score a lid shape on the top of each potato about a third of the way down, cutting in about 1/8 inch all the way around. Spread a 1/4-inch-thick bed of rock salt on a baking tray. Place the potatoes on the bed of rock salt. Bake the potatoes until tender enough to be pierced easily with a wooden skewer, about 45 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and leave them for a few minutes to cool slightly. Leave the oven on. Heat a saute pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and, as soon as it swirls easily, add the butter. When the butter foams, add the ham and mushrooms and saute until they are hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the ham and mushrooms to a small mixing bowl. Using a small, sharp knife, and protecting your hand from the heat with a folded kitchen towel, carefully cut off the lids from the still-hot baked potatoes, following the scoring marks. With a sharp-edged tablespoon, scoop the flesh from the potatoes, including the lids, leaving a wall about 1/4-inch thick, and transferring the scooped-out flesh to a large mixing bowl. Return the potato shells and lids to the bed of rock salt. Put the tray back in the hot oven, leaving the oven door open, to keep the potato shells and lids warm. With a potato masher, mash the potatoes. Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and generously with pepper. Add the creme fraiche or sour cream and the butter and mash to combine them with the potatoes. Stir in the ham, mushrooms, and 2 ounces of the cheese. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and turn the temperature up to 500 degrees F. Carefully spoon the mashed potato mixture back into each potato shell. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the filling on each potato. Leave the lids unfilled, placing them around the side of the tray. Return the tray to the oven and continue baking the potatoes until they are heated through and the cheese has melted, 7 to 10 minutes. If the cheese has not browned, turn on the broiler and broil the potatoes briefly, keeping a close eye on them to prevent burning. Using tongs, transfer the potatoes to a heated serving platter or individual plates. Place the lids on top of the potatoes at an angle, inserting 1 end partway into the filling to secure them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 18256,&quot;Swanson® Roast Beef with Gravy 3 1/2- to 4-pound boneless beef bottom round roast or chuck pot roast 1 3/4 cups Swanson?

With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 to 2 cups at a time, allowing each batch to incorporate with the butter. (Use less confectioners&#39; sugar for a slightly more buttery, looser frosting; use more confectioners&#39; sugar for a slightly sweeter, stiffer frosting.) Increase the speed to medium, and add the salt, vanilla extract and cream. Beat until smooth, an additional 3 minutes.<br> Use a serrated knife to level the cake and to carve off any dark brown spots. Place the cake on a serving plate.<br> Frost the cake with an initial thin layer of buttercream. Place the cake in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to allow the frosting to harden. (Note: This first layer doesn&#39;t need to look perfect, as the next layer of buttercream will cover it up.)<br> Using an offset spatula, and working in an upward direction around the cake, add a second layer of frosting, approximately 1/2 inch thick. Add the remaining buttercream to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag fitted with a star tip (such as a Wilton #32 tip). Working in rows, pipe small dollops of frosting onto the top of your cake.<br> Sprinkle with the red, white and blue sprinkles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 18264,&quot;Grilled Corn on the Cob with Garlic Butter, Fresh Lime and Cotija Cheese 8 ears corn Garlic butter, recipe follows 1/2 cup grated cotija cheese 4 fresh limes, quartered 2 tablespoons chopped chives, for garnish 2 sticks unsalted butter, slightly softened 8 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped 1/4 habanero pepper, seeded 1/4 bunch fresh chives Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat grill to medium.

Stir often as the caramel slowly melts. When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and stir. Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take 1 to 2 minutes. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don&#39;t let it sit too long-- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it. Take a teaspoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll with the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long. Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on waxed paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center rolls sit out for 1 to 2 hours to firm up. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and working quickly, \paint a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn the center over, caramel side down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto waxed paper, and repeat with the remaining centers. Place the bars into your refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours so that they firm up. Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the microwave for 2 minutes on 50 percent power. Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds. Don&#39;t over-cook the chips or the chocolate will burn and seize up on you. Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate. Cover the candy bar with chocolate using 2 forks, 1 in each hand. When the candy is covered with chocolate, balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off. Carefully place the candy bar onto waxed paper and remove the 2 forks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, and then chill the candy bars until firm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 18267,&quot;Chai 2 cups water 1 (1-inch) piece cinnamon stick 4 green cardamom pods, smashed 4 whole cloves 1/2 star anise 2 quarter-sized coins fresh ginger 2 scant teaspoon black tea leaves (recommended: Taj Mahal) or black tea of choice 2 teaspoons honey, or more to taste Whole milk or half-and-half Instructions: In a medium pan, bring the water, all of the spices and the ginger to a boil over medium heat.

Preheat pan or skillet, add 2 teaspoons olive oil to heat, add onions, and begin to saute. While onions are cooking, clean the chanterelles (preferably without water, by using a brush, paring knife, and damp cloth), and cut into small pieces. Keep an eye on the onions, adding 1 ounce of wine as they begin to stick. Clean and chop the pepper, drain, rinse, and chop the olives and peel and chop (or use press) the garlic. After about 1/2 hour of cooking, the onions will be partially caramelized. Add the garlic to the onions, then mix in the chanterelles, with a splash of wine. Stir the mushrooms frequently. They should begin to release their own natural moisture into the pan after a few minutes of cooking. If the liquid builds up more than 1/2 inch in the pan, carefully pour off the excess liquid, reserving it for later use. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then add the pepper and olives and 1 ounce of marsala. If there&#39;s extra chanterelle liquid, add it back at this time. Cover and simmer another 5 minutes.

Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, thyme, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper in a large bowl. Whisk the eggs and milk in another large bowl. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper. Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, then dip in the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off. Return the chicken to the flour mixture and turn until well coated. Transfer to a large plate or baking sheet. Carefully add about half the chicken to the hot oil (do not crowd the skillet). The oil temperature will drop; adjust the heat as needed to maintain a temperature of 350 degrees F. Fry the chicken, without turning, until the crust starts browning, about 2 minutes. Flip the chicken and continue cooking, turning occasionally, until browned and crisp all over and a thermometer inserted into the breasts registers 160 degrees F and the thighs 170 degrees F, 13 to 16 minutes. Remove with tongs and transfer to a rack set on a baking sheet; sprinkle with salt. Let the oil temperature return to 350 degrees F before frying the remaining chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 18283,&quot;Rosti 6 large russet potatoes 4 tablespoons salt 4 tablespoons clarified butter or olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 leek, split and sliced 4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled 4 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated Salt and pepper Instructions: Place potatoes in large pot of cold water to cover and add 4 tablespoons of salt to pot. Slowly bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and simmer until tender. Drain and let cool. Refrigerate potatoes overnight. The following day, peel potatoes and grate into a bowl. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of clarified butter in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the unsalted butter and melt. Add leeks and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add crumbled bacon and set aside. For the first Rosti: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Add half of the remaining clarified butter and unsalted butter to a small or medium non-stick saute pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 of the potatoes and 1/2 the leeks and spread evenly over the top. Cover evenly with 1/4 more of the potatoes. Brown the potatoes for about 5 minutes and then place a plate over the top. Flip the potatoes over, and slide them back into the pan. Brown for another 5 minutes. Sprinkle 1/2 of the Gruyere over the top and melt. Remove from the pan and place in the oven to keep warm. For the second Rosti: Add remaining clarified butter and unsalted butter to the saute pan. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes, leeks, and Gruyere. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 18284,&quot;Jam-Filled Almond Macarons 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup whole blanched almonds, very finely ground 2 large egg whites, at room temperature Pinch kosher salt 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 2 to 4 drops gel food coloring, optional 1/4 cup apricot preserves or seedless raspberry jam Instructions: A camera-ready macaron has a smooth top and the coveted \foot: a lacy ring around the bottom. But macarons are tres temperamental. These detailed directions - and practice - will guide you to macaron success. If your first batch is less than perfect, savor your macarons in all their crispy chewy glory, and try again. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a small glass or cookie cutter (1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch wide), trace 15 circles on each piece of parchment, leaving about 2 inches between each round. Flip the parchment over; the lines will be visible through the paper but you will not have to pipe directly onto the ink. Fit a pastry bag with a round tip about 1/4 inch wide. Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar and ground almonds into a bowl and discard any larger nut chunks. (If you have more than a tablespoon of bigger chunks, grind those until powdery and then resift.) Combine the egg whites and salt in a large bowl and whip on medium-low speed with an electric mixer until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the granulated sugar, increase the speed to medium-high and whip until very soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the almond extract and a few drops of food coloring (if using); a little goes a long way so add with caution. Whip until stiff peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. Fold about one-third of the sugar-nut mixture into the egg whites until blended, and then carefully fold in the remaining two-thirds. The batter should be a bit fluid but not runny. It should slowly drip off the spatula and sit on top of the batter in the bowl for a bit before eventually oozing back into it. If it seems a bit stiff at this point, fold once or twice more until it relaxes, although be careful not to over-fold. This correct texture is the key to the macaron and it is better to have a stiffer batter than a looser one. Transfer the batter to the prepared pastry bag. Holding the bag perpendicular over the baking sheet, squeeze until the batter fills a circle drawn on the paper. Release the pressure on the bag and pull towards you to prevent a pointy tip on the center of the cookie. Repeat with the remaining circles. Gently flatten any points on the cookies with a damp fingertip. Firmly rap the baking sheets against the counter to release any air bubbles and let stand at room temperature until the tops of the cookies no longer feel wet, 10 to 15 minutes. Bake, one sheet at a time, until the macarons are slightly crisp, about 15 minutes. Rotate the sheet halfway through for even baking. Cool the cookies on the sheets 5 minutes, and then peel them off the paper and cool completely on a rack. To assemble the cookies, spread a thin layer of the preserves on the bottoms of half of the cookies, about 1/4 teaspoon per cookie. Top with a second cookie, gently pressing to squeeze the preserves to the rims.

Butter two 8-inch cake pans, then fit each with a parchment round. Butter and flour the parchment. Separate the eggs into whites and yolks. Set the yolks aside. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks, then set aside until ready to use. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat together the granulated sugar, butter and coconut oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer or with a stand mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg yolks, coconut cream and vanilla and beat until just combined. Alternate adding the buttermilk and flour mixture to the butter mixture, being careful not to overmix. Gently fold in the beaten whites until completely incorporated, but keeping the volume! Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cakes comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack to cool completely. For the coconut cream cheese frosting: Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese and butter in a stand mixer or in a bowl with a hand mixer until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the coconut extract and salt, then slowly start to add the powdered sugar, beating it in a little at a time. Beat until all the sugar is combined and the frosting is stiff but still light and fluffy. Add more sugar if it is too loose, or a little milk if it is too thick. Set aside at room temperature until you are ready to decorate. If the cakes have domed at all, shave down any uneven parts to make the tops of the cakes flat and smooth. Spread 1 tablespoon frosting on a cake plate or stand; this will help keep the cake in place while you decorate. Place one cake cut-side up on the plate. Dollop about 1 cup frosting on top of the cake and spread it in an even layer using a spatula, knife or spoon. Place the second cake on top of the first. Add another 2 cups frosting to the top of the cake and smooth it over the top and down the sides. Repeat with any remaining frosting until the outside of the cake is frosted and smooth.

Mix well with a whisk. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and place in the marinade. Stir everything together so the chicken is coated evenly, cover, and set aside in the fridge to marinate for 12 hours. Fill a heavy-based pot (such a deep cast iron skillet) with canola oil and set over medium-high heat. Using a thermometer, heat the oil until 375 degrees F. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare the coating by adding the all-purpose flour, salt, paprika, mustard powder, and garlic powder together in a large bowl. Mix with a whisk. Take the chicken pieces out of the marinade and dredge lightly in the seasoned flour, 1 at a time. Set the coated pieces on a wire rack over a tray as you work. Add the chicken, 3 to 4 pieces at a time, to the hot oil, skin-side down. Cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Increase the heat on the oil if you need to as the chicken will bring the temperature of the oil down. Remove the chicken from the pot with a wire strainer and set over a clean rack over a tray. Season with salt while still hot. Continue to cook in batches, allowing the oil to heat up again before adding the chicken to the pot each time. Place the chicken into the oven and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes until cooked through. Allow the chicken to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Pulse until it looks like finely grated Parmigiano. Add the egg yolk and 1 to 2 tablespoons of the water. Pulse, pulse, pulse until the mixture comes together. If it seems a bit dry add a little more water and pulse, pulse, pulse. The mixture should come together into a ball. Dump the whole thing out onto a clean lightly floured work surface. Knead the mixture 1 or 2 times only to make it a smooth ball. Using a rolling pin or your fingers roll or press the dough out to an even circle about 11 to 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a cookie sheet lined with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight, covered with plastic wrap. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. To make the filling: While dough is chilling, place the sugar, apple cider, lemon juice, and vanilla bean seeds in a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof pan. Stir to combine. Over high heat bring the mixture to a boil brushing down the sides of the pan occasionally with a pastry brush dipped in water, if necessary. After 6 to 7 minutes the mixture will eventually begin to turn light brown. Swish the pan around gently to promote even cooking. Cook the mixture for another minute or so until the mixture becomes a much deeper amber color. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, 2 pats at a time. The mixture will bubble up. That is okay, just be VERY CAREFUL not to get any of this on you. When all of the butter has been incorporated, begin to arrange the apples rounded side down in circles. Try to do this neatly and in a pretty way. Remember, the bottom will be the top! Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Retrieve the chilled pastry from the refrigerator and place it on top of the apples. Tuck the pastry in around the edges of the pan. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the dough is golden brown and crispy. Let the tart cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Place a serving platter upside down on top of the pastry and CAREFULLY flip the platter and the pan over. Let the tart fall gently out of the pan.

Add the salt and flour. With the mixer on low, mix until the dough starts to come together. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl and crawls up to dough hook. Grease a mixing bowl with the oil. Place the dough in the greased bowl and turn once. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft free place until the dough doubles in size about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the dough from the bowl and invert it onto a heavily floured surface. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Pat each portion into a large rectangle, about 3/4-inch thick. Roll up the dough, beginning with the short side and stopping after each full turn to press the edge of the roll firmly into the flat sheet of dough to seal. Press with your fingertips. Tuck and roll so that any seams disappear into the dough. Sprinkle a baking sheet evenly with 2 tablespoons of the cornmeal. Place the loaves on the baking sheet, about 3 inches apart. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons cornmeal. Cover the loaves with a cloth and let rise until double in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. With a sharp knife, make diagonal slashes, about 1-inch apart, on the top of each loaf. With a pastry brush, brush the egg wash evenly over each loaf.

While the dough is still streaky, remove the bowl from the mixer and scrape the paddle clean. Lightly flour a clean, flat work surface. Scrape the dough onto the lightly floured surface. Lightly flour your hands and finish mixing the dough by using a light kneading motion, working until the dough is just blended. Do not overwork the dough, you just want to be certain that all of the ingredients are just blended together. Cover the dough tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until firm. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with nonstick silicone baking sheets or parchment paper. (Alternatively, use nonstick baking sheets or lightly butter conventional baking sheets.) Set aside. Lightly flour a clean, flat work surface. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and unwrap. Place the dough in the center of the floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out to a piece about 1/2-inches thick. Using a 2-inch round biscuit cutter, cut out the cookies. Place the cookies about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. If you wish to create the traditional crisscross pattern on top of the cookies, press the surface using the tines of a fork. When all of the cookies are formed, place in the oven and bake for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges. Remove from the oven and transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool. When completely cool, spread the jam on the flat side of a cookie. Top with a second cookie, flat-side down, and press together gently. Store, airtight, at room temperature for up to a week. For the Peanut Butter Base Dough: Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl Set aside. Place the butter in the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle. Begin beating on low speed. Add the sugar, increase the speed to medium, and beat for about 4 minutes, or until light and creamy. Add the peanut butter and beat to incorporate; then, beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula after each addition. With the motor running, gradually add the flour mixture, beating just to blend. While the dough is still streaky, remove the bowl from the mixer and scrape the paddle clean. Lightly flour a clean, flat work surface. Scrape the dough onto the lightly floured surface. Lightly flour your hands and finish mixing the dough by using a light kneading motion, working until the dough is just blended.

Line a 9-by-13-inch cake pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the long ends; this will help you remove the lemon bars from the pan later. Lightly spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray. Add the flour, cheese and confectioners&#39; sugar to a food processor. Pulse to incorporate all the ingredients. Slowly stream in the butter while pulsing, stopping occasionally to scrape the bowl down and to loosen any caked flour on the base of the bowl. Continue to pulse until the mixture has the texture of wet sand and holds together when pressed together in your hand. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and press and mold to dough to cover the base of the pan and up the sides about 3/4 inch. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the crust is set and the edges are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. In the meantime, make the lemon curd filling: Add the granulated sugar, flour, lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla and eggs to a large bowl and whisk to evenly combine.

Heat over medium-low and toast, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 5 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder and process until finely ground. Season the chicken thighs liberally with kosher salt. Add the olive oil to a large, high-sided saute pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs and brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan, slice into strips and set aside.<br> Add the onion and a splash of beer to deglaze and release the chicken bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir to combine and cook until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the jalapeno and continue to cook until the onions and jalapeno are soft, another 2 minutes. Add the minced garlic, cilantro stems, sliced chicken, the remaining beer, toasted ground cumin and chipotle powder. Slice the lime in half and squeeze the juice into the pan, then drop the squeezed lime halves directly into the pan. Stir to combine and adjust seasoning with kosher salt. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then add the chicken stock. Continue to cook until the chicken starts to pull apart and most of the liquid has cooked away but the pan still has some moisture, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the lime halves and discard.<br> For the salsa verde: Preheat a cast-iron griddle over medium-high heat. Place the tomatillos and jalapeno onto the pan and roast, turning occasionally on all sides, until soft and charred, 10 minutes. Remove from the pan. Slice the jalapeno in half and remove half the seeds (or leave the seeds in if you prefer a more spicy salsa verde). Add the garlic, cilantro, roasted tomatillos and jalapeno, lime zest, lime juice, olive oil and kosher salt to taste to a blender and puree until smooth.<br> For the guacamole: Combine the avocado, tomato, jalapeno, onion, cilantro, lime zest and lime juice in a bowl and mash together but leave some texture. The guacamole should be chunky.<br> For the crema: Mix the crema, lime zest and lime juice together in a bowl.<br> To assemble, preheat the oven to broil. Scoop 1/4 cup salsa verde into the bottom of 4 small baking dishes and use a spatula to evenly distribute. Warm the corn tortillas on the cast iron griddle over medium heat until slightly toasty and pliable. Scoop about 1/4 cup of chicken filling into each tortilla and roll. Place into the baking dish, seam-side down, and repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling, using 2 tortillas per serving dish. Top each with another 1/4 cup sauce, 1/2 cup Monterey jack and the crumbled cotija. Transfer to the oven and broil until the cheese is bubbly and melted, about 5 minutes. Serve with the guacamole and crema.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 18456,&quot;Pirate&#39;s Booty: Bbq Ribs 1 teaspoon ground pepper 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon dried onion 1 teaspoon dried or fresh bell pepper Pinch of basil 2 racks of baby back ribs Instructions: Combine all ingredients (except for ribs) in a bowl and rub into meat.

Allow it to sit for 5 minutes then rinse. This helps plump the shrimp especially if they were previously frozen. Add the Cajun seasoning to the shrimp and let it marinate for 20 minutes, while you make the chutney. In a skillet, warm 1 tablespoon olive of oil over low heat, until shimmering Add the cumin and fennel, it should splutter. Stir in the onion and serrano pepper and saute until softened and has picked up a little color. Add the turmeric and saute for 30 seconds. Stir in the pineapple and toss to coat with the spices. Cook for about 5 minutes. Add the cilantro and mayonnaise and stir to combine. Add some cornmeal to a shallow plate. Coat each shrimp evenly with cornmeal, while you warm up a few tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is shimmering (hot), add the shrimp in batches. Flip after 2 minutes, or when they start to change color. Cook another 2 minutes on the other side, until cooked to your liking (don&#39;t overcook, and should only take 5 minutes, tops!). Remove the shrimp from the skillet to a paper towel-lined plate. To build the po&#39; boy: Slather the pineapple-mayonnaise mixture on 1 side of each bun bottom. Spoon a generous helping of shrimp over the top. Add some lettuce and tomato and cover with the bun tops. Wrap in plastic and aluminum foil and you&#39;re ready for the picnic! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 18459,&quot;Fudgy Cake Pops Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup cocoa powder<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 3 large eggs<br> 3/4 cup sour cream<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup powdered sugar<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/2 lemon, juiced<br> 1 pound dark chocolate chips 1 pound white chocolate chips<br> 1/4 cup small candy eyes<br> 1 small bottle red food coloring<br> 1/2 cup small black nonpareils<br> 1/2 cup small orange nonpareils<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a quarter sheet tray with parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Reserve. Combine the granulated sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat until light and fluffy. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Slowly add the sour cream, milk and vanilla. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on medium speed, gradually mix in the flour mixture. Spread the batter onto the sheet tray and bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack. For the cream cheese frosting: Beat together the cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, vanilla and lemon juice in a stand mixer or with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Set aside. Place the cake into a food processor and pulse to crumble. Transfer to a bowl, then add 2 cups of the frosting and stir to combine. Take some of the cake and frosting mixture and roll into a ball, roughly the size of a golf ball. Insert a candy stick into the center. Place onto a parchment-lined sheet tray. Repeat with remaining cake and frosting mixture, to make about 12 pops. Place into the freezer to chill for 15 to 20 minutes. For the decorating: Set up 2 double boilers with a glass bowl fit over the top of each. Add the dark chocolate to one bowl, and the white chocolate to the other. Gently melt the dark and white chocolate over the double boilers, stirring frequently to ensure the chocolate is not burning on the bottom of the bowls. For the white chocolate eyeball cake pops: Dip half of the chilled cake pops into the white chocolate, rotating to make sure they are fully coated. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off. Place right-side up into a piece of Styrofoam and stick one candy eye into the center of the cake pop. Repeat with remaining cake pops, transfer to the fridge to chill for 10 minutes. Scoop 1/2 cup frosting into a small bowl and add 2 drops red food coloring. Mix to combine, then transfer into a pastry bag. Cut a very small amount off the tip, then pipe squiggly lines coming out from the candy eyes to resemble red veins. For the chocolate-dipped cake pops: Take the other half of the cake pops and dip into the dark chocolate, making sure to fully coat the cake and allowing any excess to drip off. Roll immediately in the black and orange nonpareils. Place right-side up into a piece of Styrofoam, then into the fridge to chill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18460,&quot;Apple Harvest Oatmeal 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 crisp apple, such as Braeburn or Crispin, cored and diced with skin 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar, plus more to taste 3 cups water 2 cup quick-cooking oats 1/2 cup wheat germ 1/4 cup ground/milled or whole flax seed (or a combination of both) 1/4 cup chopped dried apples 1/4 cup golden raisins 3/4 cup 1 percent milk Instructions: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and the apple and cook until lightly brown and soft, 2 minutes.

Put all the ingredients for the cupcakes except the milk into a food processor and blitz furiously. Then pour in the milk, and process again until you have a smooth batter. Divide the mixture between either the big muffin pans or the 3 small pans. Cook the big cupcakes for about 15 to 20 minutes, and the small ones for about 10 minutes, although you might need to keep a closer eye on the little ones. Cool the cupcakes on a wire rack. To ice the mini-cupcakes, mix the confectioners&#39; sugar with a tablespoon or 2 of water from a recently boiled kettle or cold water (according to package instructions) for instant royal icing until you have a smooth, spreadable paste. In both cases add water slowly: you don&#39;t want this runny, and nothing is more irritating than having to start sifting more sugar. The merest, tiniest blob of food-coloring paste- in this case, as I said, Grape Violet - will be enough to bring a dizzy and rich-toned intensity to the proceedings; you can always add more coloring if you want, but again the important thing is to guard against having to do any more sifting. And if you have been too heavy-handed and landed yourself with a batch of unusable dark icing, then just make up some more plain white icing and add to tone down. Slice any peaking humps off the tops of the cakes with a sharp knife and then pour, from a dunked-in spoon, the icing over each cake until the tops are thickly and smoothly covered. Let stand for a couple of minutes until the icing has set a tiny bit and then dot a gold button or other decoration of your choice on top.

Stir together the garlic, parsley, olive oil, salt and pepper to make a paste. Spread that over the inside of the leg of lamb. Tie the leg crosswise with several lengths of butchers twine. Coat the outside of the leg of lamb with the Turkish Spice Mix and set it on a rack in a roasting pan. Put the fennel in a small, deep baking dish (or souffle dish) and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the lemon juice and enough oil to entirely cover the fennel (2 1/2 to 3 cups, maybe more depending on the size of the dish). Cover with aluminum foil. Put the lamb and the fennel in the oven and cook until the fennel is very soft and the lamb is medium (140 degrees F), about 1 hour for the fennel, and about 1 1/2 hours for the lamb. Let the lamb rest 10 minutes before slicing. While the lamb is roasting, make the mayonnaise: Grind the walnuts to a coarse powder in a food processor. Add all of the remaining ingredients and puree; set aside. Slice the lamb against the grain and serve it with the roasted fennel and sweet red pepper mayonnaise. Combine the spices in a spice mill or clean coffee grinder and grind to a powder. Store in an air-tight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Grenache Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 18478,&quot;Yogurt Creme Brulee with Fresh Fruit and Granola 16 ounces plain 2% Greek yogurt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped<br> 1 pint fresh blueberries, raspberries or strawberries (or a combination) Granulated sugar 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1/2 cup granola 8 teaspoons turbinado sugar Instructions: Mix together the yogurt and vanilla in a medium bowl until combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Put the berries in a small saucepan, add 1/4 cup water and simmer until just softened, about 5 minutes. Add granulated sugar to taste and stir in the lemon juice. Let cool slightly. Divide the fruit among four 8-ounce ramekins and top with the granola. Fill the ramekins to the top with the yogurt (discard the vanilla bean if using). Cover and put in the freezer for 5 minutes. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of turbinado sugar over each ramekin. Caramelize the sugar with a blowtorch by slowly sweeping the flame back and forth. Let the sugar harden, about 2 minutes, before serving. You&#39;ll need a small blowtorch to caramelize the sugar. (A broiler will melt the yogurt.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18479,&quot;Junior&#39;s Most Famous Cheesecake 7/8 cup sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1 pound 14 ounces cream cheese 1 extra large egg 1/2 cup heavy cream 3/4 teaspoon vanilla Instructions: Mix 7/8 cup sugar with 3 tablespoons corn starch. Add to 1 pound and 14 ounces cream cheese and mix. Add 1 extra large egg and blend. Then add 1/2 cup heavy cream a little at a time and mix. Then add 3/4 teaspoons vanilla and mix.

Return a list of the wine types only. recipe: Baked Ziti with Meat Sauce 1 pound ziti pasta 1 pound ground beef 1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 cup mar&quot; 18480,&quot;Sticky Buns 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon active dry yeast 1/2 cup whole milk 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon olive oil (melted butter would be great, also) 6 to 8 cups unbleached white flour, plus more for flouring 1 tablespoon salt Vegetable oil, for oiling the pan 1/2 cup butter 1 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups pecan halves 1 cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon cinnamon Instructions: For the white trash dough: Mix together the sugar, yeast and 1 cup very warm water (not hot) in a measuring cup and proof to test the liveliness of the yeast. When this bubbles and looks healthy, hopefully in 5 minutes or so, transfer to a mixing bowl and add 1 1/2 cups warm water, the milk, honey, olive oil and 5 cups of the flour. Mix this by hand or in a mixer until it just barely comes together, and then cover and let rest for 20 minutes or so. This is referred to as an &#39;autolyze&#39; or resting period, and it allows the flour to absorb the moisture without the salt hampering the process. After the time is up, stir in the salt and an additional 1 cup flour. The dough should be coming together now and may need the addition of up to 2 more cups of flour. It should be a medium-soft dough that stands up to kneading but is not too firm. Knead until silky in texture and thin bands form when pulling it apart. Let rise, covered, until doubled in bulk. (This recipe makes double the amount of dough needed for the sticky buns. After rising and dividing the dough, reserve the other half of the dough for another use.)<br> In the meantime, oil a 9- by 13-inch baking pan and line with parchment paper. Now is a good time to make the sticky goo, as we so affectionately call it.<br> For the sticky goo: In a 3-quart saucepan, melt the butter and pour off about 2 tablespoons into a glass bowl and set aside. To the butter in the pan, add the brown sugar, honey, granulated sugar, heavy cream and salt. Whisk together over medium heat until smooth. Pour into the prepared baking pan and sprinkle with the pecan halves.<br> Once the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured board but do not knead! Just spread it out in all its flattened glory. Divide the dough in half. (Knead together one half and put it into a loaf pan for sandwich bread or something; you won&#39;t need it for this.) Take the other half and roll it out on your floured board to a rectangle about 12 inches by 20 inches. Brush with the reserved melted butter.<br> For the topping: Sprinkle on the brown sugar and cinnamon and roll it longways into a tidy log. Cut the log into 12 equal pieces and place the pieces cut side up in the pan over the pecan mixture of love. Let rise, covered, in a warm place, about 1 hour.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake until an instant-read thermometer placed in the buns registers 200 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Once you pull the buns from the oven--and this is important--let them sit in the baking pan for 5 minutes or so to cool before dumping them out upside down onto a tray. This will allow the caramel to thicken slightly and it won&#39;t all just run off. You will be greatly rewarded for your patience! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 18481,&quot;Simple Broiled Flank Steak with Herb Oil 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 clove garlic, minced Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 flank steak, 1 1/2- to 2-pounds Instructions: Position an oven rack 5 to 6 inches from the broiler unit, and preheat the broiler. Line a broiler pan or baking sheet with foil, and set the broiler insert on top of the broiler pan if using. Place the pan on the oven rack, and preheat until hot, about 5 minutes.

Slice, across grain, into 3 by 1/2 inch strips. Stir marinade ingredients together in a medium bowl. Add chicken strips and toss to evenly coat. Set aside at room temperature, uncovered, 30 minutes. It&#39;s important not to marinate any longer, or the acid in the lemon will break down the fibers of the chicken. Meanwhile, prepare the salad. Whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Tear watercress into bitesized pieces and toss with dressing. Divide salad among 6 serving plates. Thinly slice avocado halves into strips lengthwise and arrange on salad. Reserve in refrigerator. To cook chicken, heat a large dry cast iron skillet over high heat 15 minutes. (Yes, 15 minutes.) Heat peanut oil for frying. Lift chicken strips from marinade, one at a time, and add to pan, standing as far away as possible to avoid splatters. Fry until dark golden brown and crisp, about 1 minute per side. Arrange about 8 hot chicken strips on each salad in a spoke pattern.

Allow the fire to burn for about 2 hours until the temperature in the cooker is 225 degrees F. Meanwhile, remove the pork shoulder from the refrigerator and it rest at room temperature for 1 hour. Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 cups of the rub, then add the sugar, barbecue sauce, and Worcestershire sauce and simmer until dissolved. Using a handheld mixer or whisk, gradually incorporate the melted butter and olive oil. Mix until the broth and fat emulsify then set the marinade aside to cool. Rub the pork shoulder all over with the remaining cup of dry rub then set the meat aside for 20 minutes. Measure the marinade, and then add enough apple juice to achieve a 3 to 1 marinade-to-juice ratio. Inject the marinade and juice mixture into the pork repeatedly until the meat is saturated and can absorb no more. Cook the pork shoulder at 225 degrees F in the grill or smoker (adding more coal or wood as necessary to maintain the temperature). After about 4 hours the pork should have turned a rich red-brown. Remove the meat from the cooker, wrap it in aluminum foil, and then return it, fat side down, to the grill or smoker. At this point begin checking the temperature of the meat with a thermometer every hour until it reaches an internal temperature of between 180 and 190 degrees F. at the center. (This should take about 4 more hours; the bones will pull clean while the meat stays firm.) Glaze the shoulder with barbecue sauce, mixed with a little corn syrup for extra shine if you like. Using a large fork, pull the meat from the bones and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 18494,&quot;Macaroni and Egg Salad 1/4 cup minced red onion 8 ounces elbow macaroni 1 chopped celery stalk 1 chopped hard-cooked egg 1/3 cup mayonnaise pinch of cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 3 tablespoons chopped parsley salt and pepper Instructions: Soak 1/4 cup minced red onion in cold water, 10 minutes; drain.

For the wing sauce: Place a medium saucepan over medium heat and add the sriracha, apple cider vinegar, and honey (or to taste, depending on preference of sweetness versus spicy and vice versa) and place over medium heat to combine. Once the sauce is heated, taste and season with salt. When the fat is heated and the wings and legs have smoked, add the legs to the heated duck fat and cook for about 4 minutes, being careful of any of the fat spattering. Once they crisp and brown, flip the legs and add the wings. Be careful of splatter when adding the wings and cook until brown and crisp, about 2 minutes. Flip the wings to finish cooking, about 2 more minutes or until caramelized and crispy on all sides. If desired, use a meat thermometer and make sure the temperature reaches 160 degrees F.

Add the remaining ingredients except for the cornmeal and mix on slow speed with a dough hook until a ball is formed. Change the speed to medium and mix for an additional 1 to 2 minutes until a sooth and elastic dough is formed. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl or pan cover and allow the dough to rest for approximately 4 hours. To make the tomato sauce, place all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl, combine well and adjust the seasonings. Let the flavors combine for approximately 30 minutes or longer. To make the yellow tomato sauce, combine all of the ingredients into a blender and puree. Adjust the seasoning. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Rub the pork with the smoke flavoring and sea salt. Using a roasting pan, line the bottom with 1/2 of the leaves and place the pork butt on top. Add the chicken stock, being careful not to pour on top of the pork. Cover with the remaining leaves. Cover tightly with foil and roast for approximately 3 1/2 hours. Cook the pork to a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees F. When done the pork should shred easily and be very moist. To make the pizza, press or roll out the dough to approximately 1/4-inch thick. Transfer the pizza to a pizza peel dusted with cornmeal. Add the yellow tomato sauce and spread evenly. Add the fontina cheese, shredded pork, tomato mixture, and finish with some grated Parmesan. Place pizza in a hot oven turning occasionally until crust is evenly browned and the bottom is golden in color. Remove from oven, slice, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 18519,&quot;Rocco&#39;s Famous Hot Sticks Rocco&#39;s Deep-Dish Pizza Dough (see below for the link) 1/2 cup Rocco&#39;s Hot Wing Sauce (see below for the link) Blue cheese or ranch dressing, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Turn out the pizza dough onto a cutting board. Flatten the dough and press out the bubbles. Pull the dough into a rectangle roughly the size of a sheet of notebook paper. Dump out the wing sauce into the center of dough, and use a spoon or cake server to evenly spread the sauce all over the dough. Cut the sauced dough in half the short way, then cut each half further into 3 even strips. Grab the ends of one strip and fold the sauce side over onto itself, twirling the dough strip into a tube so the hot sauce is inside and the white dough is on the outside. Transfer the dough twirls to a cookie sheet, making sure they do not overlap. Bake on the center rack of the oven until browned but still soft inside, 8 to 10 minutes. Cut in half, pile onto a serving tray, and serve with your favorite blue cheese or ranch dressing for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 18520,&quot;Fried Chicken with \Creamed\ Corn and Quick Collard Greens 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1/4 cup black peppercorns<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 2 fresh bay leaves<br> 2 cloves garlic<br> 1/2 yellow onion, sliced thin<br> 4 skin-on, boneless chicken breasts with drummettes (lower part of the wing) attached 8 cups canola oil<br> 3 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 tablespoon celery seeds<br> 1 tablespoon paprika<br> 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 cups buttermilk<br> 6 ears fresh corn 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/2 yellow onion, diced<br> 2 cups chicken stock Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 yellow onion, diced<br> 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 2 cups chicken stock<br> 2 bunches collard greens, stemmed and coarsely chopped<br> Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the fried chicken: Bring 8 cups water, 1 cup of the salt, the peppercorns, sugar, bay leaves, garlic and onions to a low boil in a large pot. Remove from the heat, add 8 cups crushed ice and stir until cool. Taste to check if it is too salty, adding more water if necessary. Add the chicken to the brine and refrigerate for 6 hours. For the \creamed\ corn: Allow yourself a large working surface. Cut the corn kernels off the cobs, moving slowly as they have a tendency to fly everywhere. Using the back of your knife, scrape the cobs to extract the \milk\ into a bowl. In medium saute pan, heat the olive oil until almost smoking. Add the onions and cook until lightly caramelized. Add the corn kernels and \milk\ and cook until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat. In a blender, pulse half of the corn with the stock to achieve a coarse consistency. Return the mixture to the pan with the remaining corn and heat through, reducing until desired thickness. Season with salt and pepper. In a 5-quart Dutch oven (or similar pot), heat the canola oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, the remaining 2 tablespoons salt, the cayenne, celery seeds, paprika and ground black pepper. Pour the buttermilk into another medium mixing bowl. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry. Designate one hand the wet hand and one hand the dry hand. Working one at a time, dredge each breast in the flour mix (dry hand), then in the buttermilk (wet hand) and then back in the flour mix (dry hand). Shake off the excess flour and put the chicken on a plate to dry. Repeat with the remaining breasts. Carefully place the chicken breasts, one by one, into the oil in the Dutch oven and cook for about 5 minutes, moving the pieces occasionally to avoid sticking. Turn over and cook until golden brown and an internal temperature of 180 degrees F, about 10 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to rest for 5 minutes. For the quick collard greens: Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until caramelized. Add the sherry vinegar and sugar and cook for 1 minute. Deglaze with half of the stock, reducing for 2 minutes. Add the collards in two batches and saute for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the remaining stock and season with salt and pepper. Serve the chicken with the collard greens and corn. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18521,&quot;Orange Olive Oil Cake Butter, for greasing the pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan 3/4 cup sugar 2 eggs 1/3 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Juice and zest of 1 orange (about 3 tablespoons juice, 1 tablespoon zest) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt Confectioners&#39; sugar for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan. Mix together the sugar and eggs in a medium bowl with a hand mixer on medium speed until blended and light. Drizzle in the olive oil and vanilla and mix until light and smooth. Add the orange juice and zest and mix well. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in another medium bowl. Add the flour mixture half at a time to the wet ingredients and mix on low just to incorporate. Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake, 25 to 30 minutes.

Add the flour mixture to the pate fermentee mixture and mix by hand until firm and cohesive, about 3 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes.<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough until very elastic and smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 78 degrees F. Transfer the dough to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap (the plastic should not touch the dough). Place the bowl in a warm place (about 75 to 78 degrees F.) and let rise for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes, fold the dough and turn it over in the bowl. (It will somewhat deflate the dough, but it is gentler than what&#39;s commonly referred to as \punching down.)<br> Let the dough rise, undisturbed, for 1 hour more. (The dough will rise considerably at this point.)<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough gently into a rectangle, to degas it. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and, using your hands, mix until incorporated, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, mix in a mixer on the lowest setting possible.) Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm place (about 75 degrees F.). Let the dough ferment for 1 hour. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 75 degrees F.<br> Refrigerate the dough at least 10 hours and up to 36 hours. When ready, it will be roughly doubled in size and have a fine network of filaments and holes. Make this recipe the night before you mix the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 18523,&quot;Stovetop Bread 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the Dutch oven 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> Instructions: Butter a 9-inch Dutch oven and set aside.

Add the red onions, apples, salt and pepper, to taste. Saute until the mixture softens, about 5 minutes. Add the cabbage and stir until it begins to soften and wilt down; season again with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the chicken broth and the apple cider vinegar and reduce over medium-low heat. Cover and stir occasionally until the cabbage is tender. Once cabbage is cooked, remove the lid and add the Neely&#39;s BBQ sauce. Turn heat to medium and let the liquid reduce until it&#39;s nice and syrupy. Transfer to a serving bowl and top with pat of butter. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Malbec, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 18526,&quot;Samoa Tartlets 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus more for greasing 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup shredded coconut, toasted, plus more for garnish 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 5 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, very finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup dulce de leche, warmed (available in the dessert-topping section) 1 quart coconut ice cream Instructions: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan with butter. Pulse the flour, 1/4 cup coconut, brown sugar and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the cold butter and pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand with pea-sized pieces, about 5 times. Put 1 heaping tablespoon of the mixture in each muffin cup and press to make even rounds. Bake until the crusts are golden, about 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle the chocolate evenly over each crust. Turn off the oven; return the pan to the oven to melt the chocolate, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle each crust with 1 tablespoon of the remaining coconut. Cool slightly, then freeze crusts in the pan until set, about 15 minutes. With a thin spatula, gently remove each crust from the muffin pan. Top with a small scoop of coconut ice cream, drizzle with dulce de leche and garnish with more coconut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18527,&quot;Raspberry and Balsamic Parfaits Vegetable oil cooking spray 2 cups fresh raspberries (8 ounces) 3 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar (aged for 5 to 10 years) 1/3 cup turbinado sugar (recommended: Sugar in the Raw) 1 cup mascarpone, at room temperature (8 ounces) 1/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature 3 tablespoons honey Instructions: Line a small baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Spray with cooking spray and set aside. In a small bowl, carefully toss the raspberries and vinegar together. Let the mixture stand for 15 minutes. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar melts, about 5 minutes. Pour the sugar onto the prepared baking sheet and allow to cool, 5 to 10 minutes (the sugar will be hot). When cool enough to handle, crumble into small pieces. In another small bowl, mix together the mascarpone cheese, sour cream, and honey until smooth. Spoon the raspberry mixture into 4 (8-ounce) glasses. Dollop the mascarpone mixture on top. Sprinkle with the crumbled sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Brachetto, Cava]&quot; 18528,&quot;Buttermilk Biscuits 3 cups self-rising soft wheat flour 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and chilled, plus 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted for brushing the tops 1 1/4 cups buttermilk Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place the flour and chilled butter in a medium mixing bowl. Work the butter into the flour with a pastry cutter, a fork, or your fingertips until the butter pieces are a little larger than an English pea, but not larger than a lima bean. If you are using your fingers, work quickly so that the heat of your hands won&#39;t melt the butter. Pour in all of the buttermilk and, using light pressure, fold the mixture a few times with a plastic spatula until it holds together. Do not overmix. In order to make light biscuits, it is important to work the dough as little as possible. Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead it quickly and gently 6 to 10 times or until it begins to be almost homogenized. There will be large pieces of butter throughout. Sprinkle a little flour under the dough so that it won&#39;t stick to the board and lightly dust the top of the dough so that it won&#39;t stick to the board and lightly dust the top of the dough so that it won&#39;t stick to the rolling pin. Roll the dough out to about 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into 2-inch rounds, place on an ungreased baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. I like the biscuits to be crispy and brown on the top and bottom, but not dry in the middle. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter. Serve right away. Now comes the important part: deciding how many biscuits you want to eat. When they are served, take that many. Then, instead of using a knife to cut them, use your fingers to separate the tops from the bottoms. Butter the centers lavishly and replace the tops. Another taste treat, a southern tradition that has all but become history, is to mix together equal parts sorghum and butter with a fork and spread on your hot biscuits. If you can&#39;t find sorghum, use regular molasses. The results won&#39;t be quite as exquisite, but you&#39;ll get the idea. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 18529,&quot;Grilled Zucchini Pizza Boats 4 large zucchinis (about 2 pounds) 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the grill grates 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, plus more for sprinkling 1 teaspoon garlic powder Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional 1/2 cup jarred pizza sauce 1 cup shredded mozzarella 1/4 cup mini pepperonis Instructions: Preheat a grill for medium heat. Slice the zucchinis in half lengthwise. Score the cut side of the zucchinis in a cross-hatch pattern to create 1/2-inch squares across the surface, making sure not to cut through the skin. Mix the olive oil with the Italian seasoning, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt and red pepper flakes if using. Spread 1 teaspoon oil mix on the cut side of each zucchini, dividing any extra between the zucchinis. Lightly oil the grill grates with olive oil. Place the zucchini halves cut-side up on the grill. Close the lid and grill until the skin side has dark grill marks, 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce the grill heat to medium-low and flip the zucchini cut-side down. Grill, covered, until softened, marked by the grill and golden brown, about 6 minutes. Flip the zucchinis again so they are cut-side up. Spread 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce onto each zucchini, then sprinkle each with about 2 tablespoons mozzarella and a few pepperonis. Cover and grill until mozzarella is melted, bubbling and starting to brown at the edges, 5 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle with more salt and Italian seasoning. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 18530,&quot;Indian Fudge 2 tablespoons butter, plus more for greasing pan 2 cups dry milk powder 1/4 cup cashews, ground in a food processor, plus 2 tablespoons chopped 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped pistachios 1 teaspoon ground cardamom One 10-ounce/300 ml can sweetened condensed milk Instructions: Grease an 8-by-8-inch square pan. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and add the dry milk powder, ground cashews, chopped cashews, 1/4 cup chopped pistachios and ground cardamom. Stir and cook until the mixture begins to turn golden, about 10 minutes. In a separate pot, heat the sweetened condensed milk over low heat. Pour into the nut mixture and turn the heat off. Stir to combine, and then pour into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons chopped pistachios and let set for at least 20 minutes.

Using a plate or cake pan as a guide, trace a 9-inch circle on the parchment with a pencil, then flip over the parchment on the baking sheet (the circle should still be visible); set aside. Make the meringue: Whisk the egg whites, 1/4 teaspoon vinegar and the salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, 2 to 4 minutes. Gradually beat in the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dissolved. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cornstarch, vanilla and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon vinegar and beat until just combined, 10 to 15 seconds.<br> Spread the meringue into a 9-inch round on the prepared baking sheet (use the pencil marking as a guide) and make a shallow well in the center. Transfer to the oven and immediately reduce the oven temperature to 225?. Bake until crisp and dry, about 2 1/2 hours. (The meringue should still be white or a very pale cream color.) Turn off the oven and open the door slightly (use the handle of a wooden spoon to prop it open about 1/2 inch). Let the meringue cool completely in the oven, about 1 1/2 hours. Carefully remove the meringue from the parchment and transfer to a platter. Make the whipped cream: Beat the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.<br> Just before serving, top the meringue: Gently stir the passion fruit pulp to loosen. Top the meringue with the whipped cream and passion fruit.

This will create the waffle appearance. Place the potatoes in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Cover and place in the fridge for 1 hour. Mix the seasoning salt, paprika, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne in a small bowl and set aside. Remove the potatoes from the fridge and drain. Transfer to a baking sheet and pat dry with paper towels. Heat a few inches of vegetable oil to 260 degrees F in a large heavy pot. Fry the potatoes in one batch for about 2 minutes, or until soft. They should not be brown at all at this point; you just want to start the cooking process. Remove and drain them on new, dry paper towels. Turn up the heat until the oil reaches 325 degrees F. Return the potatoes to the oil and fry until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove the fries from the oil and drain on fresh paper towels.

Make the cake batter: Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, granulated sugar, 1/2 stick butter, the shortening, milk, eggs, vanilla and 2 tablespoons pineapple juice in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium speed until well combined. (There will still be a few small lumps in the batter.) Set aside.<br> Melt the remaining 1/2 stick butter in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat; swirl to thoroughly coat the skillet. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the butter, making sure it&#39;s evenly distributed-you want the entire surface of the butter to be covered in brown sugar. Do not stir. As soon as the sugar dissolves, remove from the heat and layer the pineapple slices over the top. If desired, place maraschino cherries in the centers of the pineapple slices.<br> Pour the batter evenly over the pineapple slices and gently spread to even out the top. Bake the cake 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Immediately run a knife around the edge of the cake, then put a plate upside down on top of the skillet.

Whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter, egg and vanilla in a medium bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment add the flour, brown sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt and mix together on low speed until well combined. Add the buttermilk mixture and mix on medium speed until the dough comes together and holds its shape but is still a bit sticky, 3 to 5 minutes (add more flour if needed). Generously coat the work surface with flour and turn the dough out onto the floured surface. Dust the top of the dough with more flour, then roll the dough into a 3/4-inch thick sheet. Use a 3-inch donut cutter to stamp out circles from the dough, then place the circles on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bring the scraps together, re-roll them and stamp as many circles from the dough as possible (discard the remaining scraps); you should get about 12 doughnuts. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Add 2 to 3 doughnuts to the hot oil and cook until the doughnuts are golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Transfer to the paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain and cool and repeat with the remaining doughnuts, making sure the temperature of the oil returns to 350 degrees F between batches. For the marshmallows: Return the oil to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt. Add the milk, melted butter and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Dip a few marshmallows in the batter then add them to the hot oil (take care not to overcrowd the pot so they don&#39;t stick together) and fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Transfer the fried marshmallows to the paper towel-lined baking sheet and repeat with the remaining marshmallows. For the glaze: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa powder in a medium bowl, then add the milk and whisk until smooth. Dip one side of the cooled doughnuts into the glaze and return them to the baking sheet. For the icing and for finishing the doughnuts: Place the marshmallows in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on low power until they are melted (be careful-they melt quickly!). Stir until smooth, then immediately dollop a spoonful on top of each doughnut. Stick a fried marshmallow on top of the icing and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 18564,&quot;Pigs in a Blanket 1 head green cabbage, cored and separated into 12 leaves 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup chopped onion 1/2 cup chopped green pepper 2 cloves garlic, chopped 8 ounces ground round 1 teaspoon thyme salt &amp; pepper 2 cups crushed tomatoes 1 1/2 cups cooked white rice 1/2 cup chicken stock 3 tablespoons chopped parsley Instructions: In a pot of salted boiling water, cook the cabbage leave for about 2 minutes.

Crumble the yeast in a small bowl then add 1/4 cup of warm water and the syrup. Stir together and leave for 5 minutes to dissolve. Put the flour and salt in a mixer fitted with a dough hook and give it a quick spin to mix. Pour in the yeast mixture, the remaining warm water and the olive oil at the same time, see Cook&#39;s note*. Spin on low until the flour and water come together and the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Put the ball of dough in a large bowl and drizzle a few drops of olive oil on top to keep it from forming a skin as it proofs. Cover with a towel and leave in warm place for 30 minutes to let the dough proof. When the dough has proofed it will double in size and look spongy. For the topping: Caramelize the onions in a frying pan over low heat with a little olive oil and one of rosemary sprigs. When the onions are golden season with sea salt and black pepper and a few drops of lemon juice to bring out the flavor. When the dough has proofed, roll it out onto to a floured surface and punch the air out with your hands, then start shaping it into a circle When it&#39;s stretched out, dust a pizza paddle with flour and place the dough on it. Cover with a generous splash of olive oil and scatter with pieces of Robiola. Shingle the pancetta slices around and add the caramelized onions, and the stripped needles of the remaining rosemary sprig. Drizzle with olive oil. Add salt and black pepper.

Store them in water. Fill a large pot halfway with the oil or fill a deep-fat fryer with oil. Heat to 275 degrees F. Thoroughly drain the chips and add them to the oil, working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry the chips until they are soft enough to squeeze but not yet browned, about 10 minutes. Once all the chips have been blanched, spread them on a sheet tray and store them in the fridge overnight. When ready to serve, heat the oil to 375 degrees F and fry the blanched chips, in batches if necessary, until golden brown and crispy on the outside and still fluffy on the inside, about 5 minutes. For the seasoned flour: Mix the flour, salt and black pepper in a large bowl and set aside. For the beer batter: Thoroughly mix the flour, paprika and salt in a large bowl. Whilst constantly whisking, add enough beer to stiffen up the mix. Whilst still continuing to whisk, add cold water until the batter resembles heavy cream consistency and contains no lumps. For the fish: Fill a large pot halfway with oil or fill a deep-fat fryer with oil. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F. Fillet the fish into six 8-ounce portions, removing any bones, skin or blood lines that are present. Dip the fish into the seasoned flour, tapping off any excess. Dip the fish into the beer batter, briefly allow the batter to drain off, and then gently place the fish into the oil, allowing the fish to float away from you. Cook, in batches if necessary, until golden brown and trying to float, 5 to 7 minutes.

Plunge the crabs headfirst into the water, and cook for 12 minutes from the time the water returns to the boil. Remove the crabs with tongs and set aside. When cool, remove the triangular belly flap on the underside and discard. Turn crab over and starting from rear of crab, pull firmly to lift off top shell, and discard. Pull off and discard the spongy fingers from the body and the tiny paddles from the front. Scoop out the orange crab butter and, if desired, reserve for another use. Cut the body into quarters and pick the crabmeat from inside, using a small fork or a metal pick, and reserve. Twist the claws and legs off of the body. Crack the claws and legs along the edges of the shells, using a heavy nutcracker or a small hammer. Pick the crabmeat from the claws and legs, and reserve. Try to keep the crabmeat in fairly large chunks, but make sure you get all of it. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs lightly. Add the sour cream, diced poblano and yellow peppers, celery, salt, and pepper. Toss together until well mixed. Add the crab, shredding it into approximately 3/4 inch chunks, and the bread crumbs.

In a medium stainless steel or glass bowl, combine the chocolate chips and heavy cream. Set the bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth, about 6 minutes. Whisk in the cinnamon. Refrigerate the ganache until very firm, about 2 hours. Using a 1-ounce cookie scoop or a round tablespoon measure, scoop the ganache into 18 (1-inch) round pieces and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Working quickly, with dry hands, roll the mixture into balls. Put a pop stick into each ball and freeze, stick side up, until firm, about 30 minutes. Add the 2 cups of chocolate chips to a medium stainless steel or glass bowl. Set the bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted, about 4 minutes. Put the chopped nuts, mini-chocolate chips and chopped candy bars in 3 small bowls. Dip the pops in the melted chocolate, allowing the excess chocolate to drip off, and then dip into the toppings until coated. Arrange the pops, stick side up, on the baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30 minutes until the chocolate has set. Let the pops stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving. Store the pops, refrigerated, in an airtight container. Cook&#39;s Note: If the scooped ganache is too sticky to roll into balls, put the pan in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes to harden. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18577,&quot;Sweet Italian Fennel Sausage 5 pounds pork butt, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 3/4 ounces curing salt (salt peter) 2 teaspoons black pepper 2 tablespoons fennel seeds, toasted 1/4 cup chopped garlic 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 3/4 cup chicken stock, iced Court bouillon, for poaching Olive oil, for sauteing Honey mustard, to taste Minced onion, to taste Instructions: In a bowl combine the pork, curing salt, black pepper, fennel seeds, garlic, sugar and cayenne pepper.

Alternatively, heat oil in a deep fryer to 340 degrees F. Cut steak into 1/2-inch thick slices to make 6 (6-ounce) portions and remove any fat or gristle. Pound it with the coarse side of a tenderizing mallet until it is double in size and half as thick. In a shallow bowl, make an egg wash by combining the eggs and milk. In another shallow bowl or pan, make a seasoned breading by combining the flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge the steak in the seasoned flour, dip it in the egg wash, and then return it to the flour and push the flour into the steak with your fingers so that there are no moist spots. Immediately slide the steak into the hot oil, in batches as necessary to prevent overcrowding, and fry on 1 side until golden and crispy; then turn over and cook the rest of the way. The steaks are done when you lift them with a pair of tongs and they are stiff, not floppy. Keep warm while making the gravy. To make Cream Gravy: Mix the canola oil and flour in a saucepan and cook this roux over medium heat until it looks grainy and becomes slightly golden in color, just a couple of minutes. Remove from heat. Add pepper and salt and mix well. Add milk, return the pan to the heat, and increase heat to high. Whisk until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Add hot water to thin, if gravy is too thick. Remove from heat to prevent scorching. The gravy should be as thick as pancake batter. Pour over chicken fried steak and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 18594,&quot;Chocolate and Caramel Nougat Bars 2 egg whites 1 3/4 cups unsweetened chocolate 1 1/2 cups whole almonds 1 1/2 cups pistachios 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons honey (from Provence) 1 1/3 cups sugar 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup glucose 1 cup cream Pinch baking soda 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons water 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons glucose 1 cup butter 4 cups tempered bittersweet chocolate Instructions: Whip egg whites to soft peaks.

Or, try a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon to make my personal childhood favorite flavor.<br> 1 extra-large egg, whisked with a pinch of sugar<br> 2 cups powdered sugar 1/2 cup milk<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon for the brown sugar-cinnamon flavor (optional)<br> Colored sprinkles or sanding sugar to make it cute<br> Instructions: To make the crust and filling: With a hand or stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar until smooth. Add the yolks, salt, and vanilla and mix well. Gradually mix in the flour. While the mixer in going, add the cream and mix until the dough is smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for an 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and spray it with cooking spray. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick. Use a ruler to make uniform rectangles, or to be totally exact, trace a 3-by-5-inch card (that&#39;s how big the store brand is). Reroll the scraps, getting as many rectangles as you can until you&#39;re out of dough. Place half the rectangles on the prepared baking sheet. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of filling into the center of half the rectangles, leaving a 1/2-inch edge uncovered. Don&#39;t overfill them! Try to make these look legit. Using a finger or pastry brush, spread water around the 1/2-inch border of the filled rectangles. Fit a top rectangle on each filled rectangle, pressing with the tines of a fork around the border to seal the top and bottom crusts together. Brush each tart with a bit of egg wash and poke a few tiny holes in each so the steam can escape. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges start to turn golden. Let the tarts cool completely on a wire rack. To make the topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk (and cinnamon, if using) to make the icing. When the tarts are completely cool, ice them if desired, and add some sprinkles if you like. But seriously, add those sprinkles. Let the icing set up for about 10 minutes and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 18618,&quot;Pappa al Pomodoro 2 garlic cloves 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving 1 pound ripe tomatoes, peeled and diced Basil leaves, chopped, plus extra for serving Salt Pepper 1 quart chicken or beef stock, boiling 12 ounces stale homemade or stale Italian bread, thinly sliced Instructions: Cut the 2 garlic cloves in half and brown in 2 tablespoons of oil.

Line a 9-by-13 straight-sided baking pan with parchment, letting the parchment hang over the long sides by about 2 inches (this will help you remove the bars from the pan later). Spray all the parchment, including the exposed ends, with non-stick cooking spray. Add the flour, graham cracker crumbs, baking powder and salt to a medium-sized bowl then whisk to combine. Set aside. Add the butter and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. On medium-low speed, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Turn the mixer off and add in the flour mixture and stir by hand until just combined. Divide the dough in half. Using clean hands, place pieces of the dough all over the base of the prepared pan (this will make it easier to spread it into a crust that covers the base of the pan). Lightly spray your clean hands with the non-stick spray then gently press and mold the dough to cover the base of the pan. Place the chocolate bars on top of the dough in an even flat layer. Press slightly to adhere the chocolate to the dough. It will not cover the dough completely but will melt and spread as it bakes. Similar to the dough, dollop the marshmallow creme all over the chocolate bars. Spray your clean hands with the non-stick spray then use them to gently spread the marshmallow creme to completely cover the chocolate bars and dough. Sprinkle the peanut butter chips and the semi-sweet chocolate chips on top of the marshmallow creme. Spray your hands once again then take the remaining half of the dough and gently flatten into pancake-like pieces. Place them on top of the chips allowing some of the marshmallow creme and chips to peek through. Bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let the bars cool completely before cutting into squares. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 18633,&quot;Crab Cakes 1 pound Chesapeake Bay crabmeat 1 egg, beaten 2 teaspoons yellow mustard 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup diced onion 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 3/4 teaspoon crab seasoning 1 cup fresh grated bread crumbs Instructions: Put crabmeat in mixing bowl.

Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick baking spray. Sift the cake flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl, then whisk to combine. Whisk the buttermilk and vanilla bean paste together in a liquid measuring cup until smooth. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium-high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs to the mixer; reduce the speed to low and alternately add the flour mixture and buttermilk mixture until just incorporated. Add the blueberries and fold gently with a rubber spatula until just combined. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops. Bake the cakes until golden on top and a toothpick inserted in the middle of each comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the cake pans to a cooling rack, let cool for 10 minutes, and then invert onto the rack and unmold the cakes from the pans. Flip the cakes right-side up and let cool completely. For the filling: Place a metal bowl on top of a saucepan filled with 1 inch of water so the bowl fits snuggly inside the pan without touching the water. Remove the bowl from the pan and bring the water to a boil. Combine the sugar, egg yolks, lemon zest and juice in the bowl and whisk until smooth. Reduce the heat to medium-low, set the bowl over the simmering water and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 8 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and slowly whisk the butter, one piece at a time, into the curd until melted and smooth. Let the curd cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours. (Makes approximately 1 cup.) For the buttercream: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, egg whites and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on low speed until all of the sugar is absorbed, then increase the speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, about 8 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, waiting until each tablespoon is absorbed before adding the next. Beat until smooth; the mixture will look curdled at first but then will come back together once all the butter is added. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat on high speed until fluffy and smooth, about 2 minutes. To assemble: Shave the cake layers down to a level surface with a serrated knife, then cut each in half to torte, using a turntable if available. Divide the filling into thirds and spread liberally between each cake layer. Ice the cake with a thin layer of the buttercream to crumb coat, then chill for 15 minutes. Frost to your liking with the remaining buttercream, and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18651,&quot;Baked Beans 1/2 pound slab bacon, thickly sliced and chopped into 1/2-inch dice 2 (32-ounce) cans baked beans 1/2 cup ketchup 1/3 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: In a heavy pot or Dutch oven, add the chopped bacon and cook over medium heat just until the fat begins to render, about 4 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine yogurt, mustard, curry powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Add the cubed chicken and raisins. Season with salt, pepper and more cayenne, if desired. Mix in the cashews right before serving so they stay crunchy. Serve as a sandwich on bread or on a bed of lettuce as a salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Garnacha]&quot; 18684,&quot;Bacon, Shrimp and Basil Skewers 24 extra large shrimp (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and deveined 24 fresh basil leaves 24 thin strips bacon, each 6 to 7 inches long 24 slender bamboo skewers (8 to 10-inches long), soaked in water for 30 minute Instructions: Hold a shrimp into a straight position in your left hand (or right hand, if you&#39;re left handed). Starting at the tail end, insert a skewer running the length of the shrimp. Place a basil leaf on the \back\ (the formerly rounded part) of the shrimp. Wrap the shrimp in bacon, tucking in the ends. Skewer and wrap the remaining shrimp the same way. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to high. Arrange the shrimp on a grate, placing an aluminum foil protector under the exposed portion of the skewers to keep them from burning. Grill the kebabs until the bacon is nicely browned and the shrimp are cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side, 4 to 6 minutes in all, turning the kebabs to insure even cooking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 18685,&quot;Shanghai Sticky Rice Siu Mai 4 to 6 dried black mushrooms 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce 2 teaspoons dark soy sauce 2 teaspoons sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon sugar 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/4 pound ground pork 1/4 cup finely chopped smoked ham 2 cups cooked glutinous rice, at room temperature 1/4 cup finely chopped bamboo shoots 1/4 cup finely chopped water chestnuts 1 green onion, trimmed and finely chopped 1 package (16-ounce) siu mai wrappers 1/4 cup frozen peas, thawed Cabbage leaves, optional Instructions: Pour enough warm water over the mushrooms in a medium bowl to cover them completely. Soak until softened, about 20 minutes. Drain. Discard the stems and chop the caps finely. To prepare the seasonings: Stir the soy sauce, oyster-flavored sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved. To make the filling: Heat a wok over high heat until hot. Add the oil and swirl to coat the sides. Add the ground pork and ham and stir-fry until the pork is crumbly and cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Add the rice, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, green onion, seasonings, and reserved mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until heated through, for about 1 minute. Remove the filling from the wok and let cool. To make the dumplings: Place 1 tablespoon of the rice mixture in the center of a wrapper. (Keep remaining wrappers covered with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out). Gather up the wrapper around the filling, pleating it as you go to form an open-topped pouch. Carefully squeeze the sides of the dumpling about half way up to give the dumpling a &#39;waist.&#39; Center a pea over the top of the dumpling. Repeat with the remaining dumplings, keeping the formed dumplings covered with a damp cloth while filling the remaining wrappers. Pour enough water into a wok to reach about 2 inches up the sides and bring to a boil. Line the inside of a bamboo steamer with cabbage leaves or parchment paper and set it over the water (the steamer shouldn&#39;t touch the water). Place as many dumplings in the steamer as will fit without touching each other. Steam the dumplings until the wrapper is cooked and tender to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with classic dim sum accoutrements like hot mustard, chili paste and soy sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 18686,&quot;Sassy Sangria 3 cups chianti or other fruity red wine 1 cup brandy 1/4 cup orange flavored liqueur (recommended: triple sec) 1 orange, sliced 1 lime, sliced, optional 1 lemon, sliced, optional 1 apple, cored and diced 8 fresh raspberries 2 cups club soda, chilled Instructions: In a large pitcher, combine all ingredients except club soda. Cover tightly and refrigerate 3 hours to let flavors meld. Pour 3/4 cup sangria mixture into each of 8 wine glasses, dividing fruit equally. Top each glass with 1/4 cup club soda. Serve immediately.; &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 18687,&quot;Parker&#39;s Beef Stew 2 1/2 pounds good quality chuck beef, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes 1 (750-ml bottle) good red wine 3 whole garlic cloves, smashed 3 bay leaves 2 cups all-purpose flour Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Good olive oil 2 yellow onions, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut diagonally in 1 1/2-inch chunks 1/2 pound white mushrooms, stems discarded and cut in 1/2 1 pound small potatoes, halved or quartered 1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves) 2 cups or 1 (14 1/2-ounce can) chicken stock or broth 1 large (or 2 small) branch fresh rosemary 1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 (10-ounce) package frozen peas Instructions: Place the beef in a bowl with red wine, garlic, and bay leaves. Place in the refrigerator and marinate overnight. The next day, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Combine the flour, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 tablespoon pepper. Lift the beef out of the marinade with a slotted spoon and discard the bay leaves and garlic, saving the marinade. In batches, dredge the cubes of beef in the flour mixture and then shake off the excess. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot and brown half the beef over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes, turning to brown evenly. Place the beef in a large oven-proof Dutch oven and continue to brown the remaining beef, adding oil as necessary. (If the beef is very lean, you&#39;ll need more oil.) Place all the beef in the Dutch oven. Heat another 2 tablespoons of oil to the large pot and add the onions, carrots, mushrooms, and potatoes. Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes. Place all the vegetables in the Dutch oven over the beef. Add 2 1/2 cups of the reserved marinade to the empty pot and cook over high heat to deglaze the bottom of the pan, scraping up all the brown bits with a wooden spoon. Add the chicken stock, rosemary, sun-dried tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 teaspoons pepper. Pour the sauce over the meat and vegetables in the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium heat on top of the stove. Cover the pot and place it in the oven to bake it for about 2 hours, until the meat and vegetables are all tender, stirring once during cooking. If the stew is boiling rather than simmering, lower the heat to 250 or 275 degrees F. Before serving, stir in the frozen peas, season to taste, and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 18688,&quot;Steamed Halibut with Coconut Sauce Two 13.5-ounce cans coconut milk Juice of 3 limes<br> 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br> One 3-inch piece lemongrass, split in half and smashed<br> 1/2 serrano cl, thinly sliced (seeds included)<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons turbinado sugar<br> 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons fish sauce<br> Four 6-ounce halibut fillets, skin removed (see Cook&#39;s Note) Kosher salt Cilantro sprigs, for garnish<br> Instructions: Special equipment: a large bamboo steamer In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the coconut milk, lime juice, garlic, lemongrass, serrano, turbinado sugar and fish sauce. Whisk it all together, then bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve. Remove the lemongrass before serving. Fill a large pot with 2 inches of water and bring to a light boil over medium heat. Line a bamboo steamer with parchment paper. Sprinkle the halibut with salt and place in the steamer. Cover the steamer and set it over the pot of boiling water. Steam until the fish is cooked through and tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer the fillets to shallow bowls and top each serving with about 1/2 cup of the coconut sauce. Garnish with a cilantro sprig and serve. Cook&#39;s Note: Cod or sea bass can be substituted for halibut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18689,&quot;Rice Cooker Pork Belly with Mui Choy 1 cup lightly packed mui choy, leaves and tender stems (about 4 ounces) 1 pound center-cut pork belly, preferably skin-on, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices and halved crosswise Two 1-inch thin slices ginger, skin-on 1 star anise 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 2 tablespoons light soy sauce 1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine, such as Shaoxing rice wine 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon fish sauce 2 cubes Chinese fermented red bean curd (about 1 tablespoon) 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 clove garlic, grated Kosher salt 1 1/4 cup jasmine rice 10 ounces napa cabbage, cored and cut into 2-inch pieces (about 1/3 large head) Thinly sliced scallions, for garnish, optional Instructions: Put the mui choy in a large bowl and add at least 8 cups of cold water. Refrigerate and soak until hydrated, 4 to 8 hours. Lift out the mui choy into a small bowl, leaving the water and any grit behind. Rinse out the large bowl and add the drained mui choy and more water. Swish the mui choi and drain. Repeat until there is no grit at the bottom of the large bowl, 2 to 3 times more. Shingle the pork belly slices in a single layer in a programmable locking 10-cup rice cooker (not a steamer-style cooker; see Special equipment). Top with the ginger and star anise. Mix the chicken broth, light soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, dark soy sauce, sugar, fish sauce and Chinese red fermented bean curd in a medium bowl until the sugar dissolves and the red fermented bean curd breaks into small pieces. Pour the mixture over the pork belly. Squeeze out any water from the mui choy and place in a small bowl. Add the vegetable oil, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss together, then sprinkle the mui choy over the pork belly. Close the lid and set to cook on white rice/sushi rice mode until the pork belly is cooked through, 1 hour. Using a large rubber spatula, carefully transfer the pork belly and mui choy to a large plate. Pour the cooking liquid into a liquid measuring cup and add enough cold water to measure 1 1/2 cups. Rinse and drain the jasmine rice until the water runs almost clear. Add the rice and reserved cooking liquid to the rice cooker. Place the pork belly on top, followed by the mui choy, then the napa cabbage. Close the lid and cook on white rice/sushi rice mode until the rice is cooked and the pork belly is tender, about 50 minutes (see Cook\u2019s Note). Serve the pork belly, mui choy, rice and cabbage sprinkled with scallions if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 18690,&quot;Smoked Salmon Tea Sandwiches 1/2 pound unsalted butter, room temperature 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced scallions (white and green parts) 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill 1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 loaf dense 7-grain or health bread, unsliced 8 slices smoked salmon Instructions: For the herb butter, combine all the butter ingredients in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat until mixed, but do not whip.<br> For the sandwiches, have the store slice the bread lengthwise on a meat slicer into 1/4-inch-thick slices. (If that isn&#39;t possible, you can slice it crosswise with a very sharp knife.)<br> Lay out 8 slices of bread and spread them all with a thin layer of herb butter. Place smoked salmon on 4 of the slices. Top with the other 4 slices of bread, butter side down. Place the sandwiches on a baking sheet and wrap with plastic. Refrigerate until the butter is very cold. Place the sandwiches on a cutting board. With a very sharp knife, cut off the crusts, cut each large sandwich in half crosswise, and then cut each half diagonally twice to make a total of 8 small triangles. (If the bread was cut crosswise, follow the assembly directions, then cut off the crusts and cut diagonally, twice, to make 4 small triangles.) Serve chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 18691,&quot;Picadillo 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 pounds lean ground beef 1/2 cup chopped white onion chopped 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper 1/2 cup diced yellow bell pepper 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic 3 bay leaves 1 teaspoon toasted ground cumin 1/4 cup sliced green olives 1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted 1/4 cup golden raisins 3/4 cup tomato paste 1/4 cup parsley, chopped Salt and pepper Instructions: Begin by heating a medium Dutch oven over high heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and the ground beef; be sure to distribute it evenly throughout the pan. Allow to brown on the bottom without moving it for 5 minutes. As the meat begins to loose its red tint start mixing in onion, peppers, garlic, bay leaves and cumin. Let it cook for 7 minutes until the vegetables become translucent. Then add olives, almonds, raisins, tomato paste and parsley. Make sure to mix it thoroughly with a spoon so that the tomato paste is well incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 18692,&quot;Honey Vinegar Glaze 1/2 cup honey 3 tablespoons black vinegar 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger Instructions: In a medium saucepan, bring the honey to a simmer. When it starts to foam and turn light brown, pour in the black and red wine vinegars. Simmer over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes so the vinegars meld with the honey and reduce slightly. Remove from the heat and stir in the ginger. Use the glaze on pork, chicken or salmon. Brush the glaze on towards the end of the cooking process or drizzle over the fully cooked meat or fish of choice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 18693,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Grilled Chicken and Kale Salad with Sunny&#39;s Creamy \Equal-Parts\ Harissa Salad Dressing 1/4 cup harissa paste 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/4 cup buttermilk<br> 1/4 cup packed chopped fresh cilantro 1/4 cup chopped scallion, white and green parts (2 to 3 scallions) Freshly ground black pepper<br> One 8-ounce container kale salad mix with red cabbage and carrots 2 grilled chicken breasts, chopped, or 2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken 2 handfuls seedless red grapes, halved<br> 2 handfuls strawberries, hulled and quartered<br> 2 handfuls multi-colored (red and yellow) cherry tomatoes, halved<br> Instructions: For the dressing: In a large bowl, whisk together the harissa paste, mayonnaise, buttermilk, cilantro, scallions and a few grinds of black pepper. For the salad: In the same large bowl, add the kale salad mix, chicken, grapes, strawberries and tomatoes. Use 2 serving spoons or tongs to toss and coat everything with the dressing on the bottom.
