Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart baking dish and set aside. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the onions begin to caramelize, about 20 minutes. Add the thyme and garlic and cook 1 minute. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the Swiss chard and blanch until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and squeeze on towels to remove excess liquid. Spread a layer of potatoes in the bottom of the prepared dish, slightly overlapping the slices. Season with Essence, and top with a layer of the onions. Place a layer of Swiss chard on top, followed by more potatoes and onions. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Add the cream, top with cheese and cover with foil. Roast until nearly all the liquid has been absorbed, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until golden brown and bubbly, an additional 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container. Recipe from \New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch. Published by William and Morrow, 1993. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 1230,&quot;Sweet and Savory Bread Pudding 2 tablespoons butter, plus extra for greasing the pan 1 pound butternut squash, peeled, and cut into 3/4-inch pieces 4 parsnips, peeled, and cut into 3/4-inch pieces Kosher salt for seasoning Freshly ground black pepper for seasoning 1 (1 pound) loaf brioche, challah, or sourdough bread, cut or torn into 1-inch pieces 3 cups heavy cream 8 eggs, beaten 3/4 cup brandy 1/4 cup vegetable oil 3 tablespoons brown sugar 2 tablespoons cinnamon 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped Instructions: Set an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish. Set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the butternut squash and parsnips. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes until slightly softened. Set aside to cool. Add the bread to a large bowl. In another bowl mix together the heavy cream, eggs, brandy, vegetable oil, brown sugar, cinnamon and thyme. Pour the cream mixture over the bread and toss gently to coat. Add the cooled vegetables and toss until the bread is coated. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until the bread pudding is puffed and golden. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1231,&quot;Fruit Lassi 1 ripe mango, banana, or papaya peeled and pureed Honey to taste (1 to 2 teaspoonfuls) 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads steeped in 2 teaspoons hot water 1 cup ice water Lemon juice to taste - 2 to 3 tablespoons 1 cup plain yogurt Instructions: In a blender, puree the mango or other fruit with other ingredients; chill for 2 hours before serving and stir before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 1232,&quot;Lemon Knots 12 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 cups granulated sugar 12 teaspoons baking powder 12 tablespoons all-vegetable shortening, such as Crisco 1/2 cup 2-percent milk 2 teaspoons lemon extract 12 eggs 2 drops cinnamon oil 2 cups powdered sugar 1/4 cup milk or water Instructions: For the lemon knots: Combine the flour, granulated sugar and baking powder together in a bowl. Add the shortening and work it into the flour. Add the milk, extract, eggs and cinnamon oil in a separate bowl. Mix well. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and work with your hands until combined. The dough will be sticky to the touch. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Dust your hands with flour and roll a 5-inch rope-like log out of the dough. Make the dough log into a knot. Place the dough knot onto a cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Bake until firm to the touch, about 6 minutes. For the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar and milk and use to glaze the lemon knots. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 1233,&quot;Roasted Tomato and Goat Cheese Salad 2 large Beefsteak tomatoes (about 12 ounces each) 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 12-ounce log Montrachet goat cheese 1/2 cup all purpose unbleached flour 2 eggs, beaten 1/2 cup bread crumbs combined with 2 tablespoons each chopped fresh thyme, sage, oregano and basil leaves Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 2 cups mixed salad greens 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Halve and seed the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Lay the tomatoes on a baking rack set over a cookie sheet in the 300 degree oven for 20 minutes or until the skins slip off easily. Remove the tomatoes from the oven, slip off their skins, and brush the tomato halves lightly with olive oil. Return the tomatoes to the oven to roast for an additional hour or until they take on a brilliant, burnished color.<br> Meanwhile, slice the Montrachet log into 12 equal-size disks. Dredge each disk of goat cheese with flour then egg then seasoned bread crumbs. Heat a saute pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and quickly cook the cheese on both sides. When all the cheese has been cooked in this manner, divide them among 4 salad plates, alternating slices of goat cheese and roasted tomato halves.<br> Combine the remaining olive oil with the balsamic vinegar, toss the salad greens with the vinaigrette and place some salad alongside each serving of tomatoes and cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 1234,&quot;Lingue di Gatto: Cat Got Your Tongue Cookie 7 tablespoons (3 1/2 ounces/100 g) unsalted butter 1 tablespoon/14 g vanilla powder 7 tablespoons/100 g icing sugar (confectioners&#39; sugar) 4 egg whites 1 whole egg 3 1/2 ounces/100 g flour Instructions: Preheat the oven to about 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, add the butter, vanilla powder, and icing sugar. Whip the mixture to a creamy and fluffy consistency. Slowly add the egg whites and the whole egg to the mixture and continue mixing until fully combined. Then slowly add the flour and mix well until fluffy and uniform in texture. Place the mixture into a piping bag and squeeze out approximately 2 1/2-inch/6 cm long strips (about 2 1/2-inch/6 cm apart) onto a greased baking sheet. Strips will flatten and expand in the oven into the shape of a &#39;cat&#39;s tongue&#39;. Bake for approximately 6 minutes, or until golden. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1235,&quot;Steak and Egg Sandwich with Creamed Spinach and Onion Rings Kosher salt 2 pounds baby spinach<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter<br> 1/2 cup diced Spanish onion 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups milk<br> 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg<br> 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 2 large Spanish onions, cut into 1/2- thick inch rings, separated 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 cup club soda<br> Vegetable oil, for deep frying<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 pound skirt steak, cut into 4 portions 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 4 Kaiser rolls, split, buttered, and lightly toasted on a griddle 4 large eggs, fried Instructions: For the creamed spinach: Put some ice and cold water in a bowl. Bring a pot of salted water up to a boil. Add the spinach, cook it for 2 minutes, and then transfer it to the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain the spinach in a colander, and then squeeze it with your hands until all the excess liquid has been removed. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onion, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt and sweat the vegetables, stirring frequently, until they are soft but have taken on no color, about 6 minutes. Add the flour and stir to create a roux. Cook, stirring continuously to make sure it doesn&#39;t burn, for 3 minutes. Whisk in the milk and cook until the flour is completely dissolved and there are no lumps. Turn down the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Whisk in the cream, return the mixture to a simmer, and fold in the spinach. Stir in the nutmeg, cayenne and 2 teaspoons salt. Cook for 2 more minutes and season with additional salt. Keep warm. For the onion rings: Heat about 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees F in a large, wide heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Whisk the flour, Old Bay and baking powder in a medium bowl. Slowly stir in the club soda until smooth. Working in batches, dip each onion ring in batter to evenly coat. Fry the onion rings until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes. Drain the rings on paper towels and immediately season with salt. For the steak: Put a large pan over high heat. Allow the pan to get very hot, almost smoking. Pat the steak dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the meat on both sides with the salt and pepper. Add some oil to the hot pan and carefully add the steak. To ensure a good sear, do not move steak in the pan. Cook for 4 minutes, flip, and cook for another 4 minutes for medium-rare. Let the steak rest for 3 minutes before slicing.

Line two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, add the sugar, gluten-free baking mix, cocoa powder and salt and mix on low speed until combined. Add the eggs one at a time, waiting until each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the milk, oil and vanilla and mix on low speed until combined. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Turn the mixer to low and slowly pour in 1 cup hot water, making sure it is evenly incorporated into the batter. Fill the cupcake liners two-thirds full with the batter and bake until the top of each cupcake is slightly springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 14 to 16 minutes. Immediately turn the cupcakes out of the pans onto a cooling rack and let cool completely. For the chocolate ganache: Put the cream in a saucepot and heat to a scald over medium heat. Do not boil! Put the chocolate in a mixing bowl and pour the hot cream over it. Let it sit a moment and then gently stir to combine and melt the chocolate. Set aside to cool and thicken up slightly. The ganache can be made several days ahead of time and kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the caramel corn: Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Spread the popcorn out on the baking sheet and carefully pick out and discard any unpopped kernels. In a saucepot, bring the butter, sugar, salt and 1/4 cup water to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Stirring constantly, boil until the mixture thickens and darkens to the color of peanut butter. Just before the mixture starts to smoke, quickly pour it over the popcorn on the baking sheet. Using two spatulas, quickly toss the popcorn in the caramel to coat the corn, and spread it out on the baking sheet. Set aside to cool completely, and then break up into pieces. For the marshmallow creme mascarpone frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer using a whisk attachment, combine the marshmallow creme, mascarpone, heavy cream, vanilla extract, vanilla bean paste and salt and whisk on low speed until there are no lumps and all the ingredients are combined. Turn to medium-high speed and whip to medium-firm peaks. Fit an 18-inch piping bag with a round tip and twist and hold the bag right by the tip to prevent the frosting from leaking out. Fold the top of the piping bag over your hand and spoon the frosting into the bag. To assemble, dip each cupcake in the chocolate ganache, roll in the caramel corn pieces to create a crunchy shell, top with the marshmallow creme mascarpone frosting and drizzle with more chocolate ganache.

Add the quinoa, and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Strain well, and cool completely. (The quinoa can be cooked a day ahead.) Put the vinegar, 1 tablespoon of the oil, mustard, 1 tablespoon water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a jar or other container with a lid. Secure the lid, and shake until combined. (The vinaigrette can be made a day ahead; shake well before serving.) Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the peppers and onions, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are just tender and browned in some spots, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the hot sauce, and stir. Remove the skillet from the heat, and let the vegetables cool completely. Wipe out the skillet, and set aside. Toss the quinoa, pepper-onion mixture, spinach, ham, Cheddar and scallions with the vinaigrette in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide among 4 serving bowls. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pour in the eggs, and add a pinch of salt. Tilt the skillet so the eggs completely cover the bottom. As the eggs turn from runny to cooked at the edge of the skillet, push the cooked eggs all around the edge to the middle of the skillet with a heatproof spatula so the uncooked eggs can spill into the free space and cook (this helps the eggs cook faster, and you won&#39;t have to flip the omelet). Once all the eggs are just cooked through, slide the omelet out onto a cutting board. Let it cool for a few minutes, then roll it up into a cylinder and cut it into 1/2-inch slices.

With the motor running, add a few drops of the oil, the mixture will begin to thicken. Then, begin adding the remaining oil in a thin, steady stream. Scrape down the sides of the processor and pour the mayonnaise into a small bowl. Mix in the black pepper and parsley, cover, and refrigerate; may be kept for up to 3 days. To prepare the soft-shell crabs: Pour the buttermilk in a shallow bowl large enough to hold all the crabs. Season the buttermilk with crab boil seasoning, salt, and pepper. Lay the crabs in the buttermilk mixture and marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 hour; soaking the crabs in buttermilk helps plump them up when cooked. Remove the crabs from the milk bath and let the excess drip off. Pour 2 inches of oil in a heavy frying pan or large pot and heat to 350 degrees F. Put the flour in a pie dish or plate and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper. Dredge the crabs in the seasoned flour to coat, shaking off the excess. Lay the crabs in the hot oil in a single layer without crowding; you may have to fry them in batches. Be careful, the crabs have a tendency to pop and spatter. Cook the crabs for about 3 minutes on each side, turning once, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. To build the sandwich: Spread the lemon pepper mayonnaise on both halves of the toasted bread, add the lettuce, tomato, bacon, and avocado.

Turn heat to medium and allow to cook, uncovered, without stirring, until you can hear some sizzling at the bottom of the pan and it starts to crisp on the bottom, for about 25 minutes. Add the chorizo and squid back to the pan and distribute evenly on top. When squid is heated through, remove paella from heat and serve right out of the pan. Serve with dollops of saffron mayo, parsley and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Rioja, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 1275,&quot;Raspberries &amp; Cream Sgroppino 1 pint raspberry sorbet 1/4 cup vodka, chilled in the freezer 1 (750 ml) bottle Prosecco, chilled 1 pint vanilla ice cream, softened Instructions: Place the raspberry sorbet and vodka in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on low speed for 30 seconds, until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Spoon the sorbet mixture into 3 low cocktail glasses and, while beating with a fork, add enough Prosecco to each glass so the sorbet is still creamy but not thick. Add one small scoop of ice cream to each glass and top with another splash of Prosecco. (The sgroppino should be the texture of a light slushy. The ice cream will melt into the raspberry slush.) Serve immediately with a small spoon. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 1276,&quot;Buffalo Potato Chips One 8-ounce bag ruffled potato chips 1/4 cup hot sauce (use a milder one such as Frank&#39;s)<br> One 4-ounce container crumbled blue cheese.<br> Instructions: Pour the chips into a large mixing bowl and drizzle the hot sauce over top. Sprinkle in the blue cheese.

Remove the saucepan from the heat, and sprinkle the yeast over the liquid. Sprinkle a pinch of the sugar over the top, and let sit without stirring until foamy, about 5 minutes. Then whisk in the butter and egg yolk. Whisk together the flour, remaining sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon until you have a thick, sticky dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Add the dough ball, turning to coat lightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, trace a circle the size of the dough ball on the plastic and note the time. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl, and knead briefly to release excess air. Re-form it into a ball, and return it to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap, and lay it on the dough. Cover the entire bowl tightly with the rest of the plastic, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight to let the dough proof. For the filling: Melt the butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped shallots, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach, and cook until it is cooked through and nearly all the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the feta, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, lemon zest, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Transfer the filling to a medium bowl, and let cool completely. (The filling will firm up a bit, but if it&#39;s too warm, it will be difficult to form the buns.) To fill and form the buns: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and press it flat. Roll it into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle, with a long side facing you. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving about a 1-inch border on the side opposite you. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan evenly over the filling. Starting from the side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight roll. Lightly brush the 1-inch border with water, and continue rolling to seal the roll. Fold the ends in just a bit, and if any spots look thicker than others, even out the roll with your hands. Cut the roll every 1 1/2 inches with a serrated knife, to make 12 buns. Place the buns cut-side down (except for the end pieces) in the prepared pan, spacing them 1 inch apart. Cover them loosely with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place to rise until the buns double in size, leaving no gaps in between, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. For the topping: Stir together the butter, dill, lemon zest and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a small bowl; set aside. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the buns until they&#39;re golden brown and the tops spring back when pressed lightly, 25 to 30 minutes. Spread the topping evenly over the buns, and return them to the oven until the butter is melted and the topping is fragrant, 5 minutes more. Let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1278,&quot;Lasagna al Pesto Genovese 1 quart plus 1 cup whole milk 2 ounces butter 1 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted 8 ounces pesto Genovese, such as Broders&#39; 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 pound 8 ounces fresh egg pasta sheets (about 9 sheets), such as Broders&#39; 1 bunch asparagus, chopped<br> 1 pound low-moisture whole milk mozzarella, shredded<br> 8 ounces Pecorino-Romano, finely grated<br> 2 ounces fresh basil, chopped<br> 2 ounces pine nuts, lightly toasted<br> 4 ounces croutons, blended fine in a food processor<br> Alfredo sauce, such as Broders&#39;, for serving Instructions: For the besciamella sauce: Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a whisk to avoid scorching. Meanwhile, dice the butter and begin to melt it over medium heat in a separate saucepan. In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt and nutmeg. When butter has fully melted and has stopped bubbling, whisk the flour mixture thoroughly into the melted butter. Allow this flour mixture to simmer, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. When the milk is steaming and looks like it is about to simmer, quickly add all of the flour roux to the hot milk while stirring vigorously with the whisk. (The whisking will allow the roux to fully incorporate into the milk and you will start to see it thickening.) Bring to a full rolling boil, whisking constantly, to thicken the milk and flour mixture. Transfer mixture to a bowl or casserole dish to fully cool down in your refrigerator. For the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish. In a bowl, combine the besciamella sauce with the pesto Genovese and salt. Begin assembling the lasagna by laying a sheet of raw fresh pasta down in the greased baking dish (cut and piece together the pasta if necessary to fit your vessel). Next, pour a half cup of the sauce mixture onto the pasta. Using a spatula or desired utensil, spread the sauce evenly, making sure to get it to the edges and in the corners of the dish. Sprinkle over the sauce layer a handful of asparagus, handful of mozzarella, light handful of pecorino, light handful of basil. (Keep in mind, there are 7 layers with these ingredients, so use sparingly on each layer; the pine nuts will be distributed on 2 layers of your choosing, as they are not needed on each layer.) For the 8th and final layer, begin by laying the rest of your pasta on top of the 7th layer, then spread the rest of your sauce on top of the pasta, and sprinkle the rest of your mozzarella on the sauce. Finish the assembly by evenly sprinkling the crouton crumbs on top of the mozzarella. Cover the dish well with foil to trap in moisture to allow the raw pasta to cook. Bake, covered, for 30 minutes, then uncover the lasagna and bake until the lasagna has crisped and browned to your liking, another 15 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and serve with warm alfredo sauce or as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 1279,&quot;Mojo Cuban Sandwich 1 boneless pork shoulder (2 to 3 pounds) 1 1/2 cups fresh orange juice 1/2 cup fresh lime juice Zest of 1 lime Zest of 1 orange 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh oregano 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro 2 tablespoons finely minced garlic 2 teaspoons cumin 1 cup olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil 4 cups low-sodium chicken stock 2 bay leaves 1 sweet onion, rough chopped, medium/large size pieces Four 6-inch loaves Cuban bread 1/3 cup Dijon mustard 4 pickles, thinly sliced (about 20 slices) 12 ounces shaved deli ham 8 slices Swiss cheese 4 tablespoons olive oil<br> Instructions: For the mojo marinade: Trim the pork shoulder, removing any excess fat, and tie. Make the mojo marinade by combining the citrus juices and zest, oregano, cilantro, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the garlic and the cumin in a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the olive oil. Place the tied roast into a resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Allow to marinate for 30 to 40 minutes at room temperature. Once marinated, remove from the bag and wipe away any excess liquid. Reserve the marinade.<br> For the pork roast: Preheat a 6-quart pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil to the pressure cooker pot and turn to high heat. Sear the roast on all sides. Then add the chicken stock, bay leaves, onions and the reserved marinade. Replace the lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the roast is tender, 30 to 45 minutes.<br> Remove the roast, transfer to a cutting board and rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Slice thinly.<br> For the Cuban sandwiches: Using a serrated knife, halve the Cuban loaves. Begin building the sandwiches. First, spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard onto the bread. Add 5 pickle slices, about 3 ounces of ham and a few slices of roasted pork. Top with 2 slices of the cheese. Finish with the top half of the Cuban loaf. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches.<br> To serve: Heat a flat-top griddle pan to medium heat with the olive oil. Place the sandwiches on to the griddle pan and place a weighted cast-iron pan on top to press. Press the sandwiches until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and cut in half.

Combine the raisins and brandy in a small bowl. Set aside for about 15 minutes to allow the raisins to plump slightly. Trim the crusts from the bread and cut the slices into 1/2-inch cubes. Place the bread cubes on a baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and transfer the cubes to a mixing bowl. Set aside. Do not turn off the oven. Fill a large mixing bowl with lightly salted cold water and, 1 at a time, thoroughly rinse each hen in the salted water. Place the rinsed hens under cold running water to remove excess salt. Drain well and pat dry. Set aside. Drain the liquid from the raisins, separately reserving both the raisins and the liquid. Combine the oil with 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the celery, onion and 1 tablespoon of the garlic and saute for 3 minutes. Add the reserved soaking liquid from the raisins and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes or until the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the parsley, pine nuts, and reserved raisins. Scrape the mixture into the reserved toasted bread cubes and add just enough chicken stock or broth to moisten without letting the bread cubes get soggy. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Using a large spoon, lightly push some stuffing into the cavity of each bird. (Do not pack the stuffing in tightly or it will get very soggy and may not cook properly). Combine the remaining butter and garlic and coat each hen with a light layer of the seasoned butter. Sprinkle lightly with paprika and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place the hens in a roasting pan. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and place in the preheated oven. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to roast for an additional 20 minutes or until the hens are golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the bird and into the stuffing reads 165 degrees.

Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 320 degrees F. Remove from the heat and carefully divide the cooked sugar between 2 medium-size microwaveable glass bowls. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown. A glass bowl will hold the temperature of the sugar. I put a towel under the bowl to keep the bowl from tipping over and to protect my hands from the heat of the glass. (The sugar will stay liquid enough to work with easily for about 10 minutes; after that it will start to thicken. If this happens before you are finished, just pop the bowl in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sugar is liquid enough to work with once again.) Add a few drops of orange food coloring to 1 bowl and mix with a wooden skewer. Add a few drops of black food coloring to the other bowl and mix with a wooden skewer. To make the brim: Trace a large circle onto a piece of parchment paper. Turn over the paper and give it a light coating of vegetable cooking spray. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot orange sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the circle, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly around the side of the circle, making sure to come all the way to the edges of the brim. Then dip the tines of the fork into the hot black sugar. Repeat the process. You will be able to see the paper through the sugar but you want to make this layer thick. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. To make the cone of the hat: Wash, dry, and lightly but thoroughly spray the clean, dry mold with the baking spray, wiping out excess with a paper towel. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot orange sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the outside of the mold, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly around the side of the mold, making sure to come all the way to the top and the brim. Then dip the tines of the fork into the hot black sugar. Repeat the process. You should still be able to see the mold through the sugar. Make a nice thick layer of sugar so the hat will be sturdy. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. To unmold, place your hands on the inside of the mold and let your fingers gently pull or slide the sugar loose from the side of the mold. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside. Keep moving the sugar as it cools. This will keep it from resticking but you need to wait until the sugar has cooled. Once the sugar has released from the mold, carefully lift it out and place it over the brim. If the sugar is still too warm, the hat may begin to collapse. That is why it is a good idea to release the sugar from the mold but leave it in the mold until it has cooled completely. (At this stage, the cage can be stored, right side up, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for 1 to 2 days.) Carefully remove the parchment paper from the brim. You should be able to pull it out from under the brim. Do not worry if the brim cracks or breaks. You can use a blow torch to melt the sugar back into place. Carefully lift the cone of the hat and center it on top of the brim. I used a special Croquembouche mold to make my Witch&#39;s Hat because it is exactly the right shape. You do not need to buy this expensive mold to make your decoration. Use any metal or ceramic shape, preferably one that does not have outside handles or seams. Remember you are working with hot sugar so be sure to have a bowl of cold water ready in case you get any of it on your skin. It is best to work with sugar on a dry day, as the humidity will melt the sugar. To be on the safe side, make your sugar decoration no more than one to two hours before you are ready to serve them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 1294,&quot;Champagne Cocktail 2 1/2 ounces vodka 1/2 ounce Chambord Splash of champagne Instructions: In an ice filled mixing glass add vodka and Chambord.

Transfer the corn to a large pot and measure the soaking liquid. Add enough water to make 15 cups. Pour the liquid back over the corn, and add the pineapple, quince, cinnamon sticks, cloves, lemon juice and sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove from the heat, remove the corn cobs and strain the mixture, pressing against the strainer with a spoon to extract all the juice from the fruits and spices. There should be about 8 cups of liquid. If not, place the corn and fruit in a saucepan with water just to cover and simmer for about 20 minutes. Strain and add amount needed to total 8 cups. Discard the corn and fruit. Place the liquid in a heavy saucepan, reserving 1 cup of the liquid. Add the dried prunes, cherries and apricots to the 7 cups of liquid. In a small bowl, combine the reserved 1 cup of liquid and the sweet potato flour or cornstarch. Mix thoroughly with a fork until dissolved. Pour this mixture back into the saucepan with the liquid and dried fruits. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking until the mixture is thick, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour the pudding into a deep 2 quart serving dish or individual ramekins. Let cool. To serve, dust the top with ground cinnamon. Serve the pudding with crema. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 1296,&quot;Two-Potatoes Anna 3 large sweet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds) 6 medium russet potatoes (about 2 1/2 pounds) 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, melted Kosher or sea salt 3 tablespoons fresh rosemary Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Peel the sweet potatoes and slice into 1/8-inch-thick rounds (use a mandoline if you have one). Peel half of the russet potatoes and slice into 1/8-inch-thick rounds. (Do not rinse-you&#39;ll need the starch for the dish to set.) Coat the bottom of a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof skillet with 4 tablespoons melted butter. Starting in the center of the skillet, arrange a layer of russet potato slices in concentric circles, slightly overlapping them. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and some of the rosemary leaves. Set the skillet over medium heat. Working quickly, add the remaining sliced russets in 2 more layers, then the sliced sweet potatoes in 2 layers, sprinkling lightly with more salt and rosemary between layers. (Check to make sure the bottom is browning evenly; adjust the heat as needed.) Drizzle with 4 tablespoons melted butter. Peel and thinly slice the remaining russet potatoes and add them to the skillet in 2 or 3 more layers, lightly seasoning each layer with salt and rosemary. Drizzle with the remaining 4 tablespoons melted butter. When the potatoes are golden brown on the bottom, transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the potatoes soften slightly, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven; center the bottom of a 9-inch cake pan on the surface of the potatoes and press firmly a few times to help the layers stick together. Remove the cake pan and return the skillet to the oven; bake until the potatoes are tender and the top is golden brown, about 20 more minutes. Let the potatoes cool 5 minutes in the skillet, then run a small knife around the edge to loosen. Set an inverted serving plate on top of the skillet and carefully flip the potatoes onto the plate. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 1297,&quot;Fran Mcgovern&#39;s Torte 5 pounds red potatoes 1 1/2 sticks sweet butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 large onions, diced Pinch dried basil 1/2 cup parsley, chopped 1/2 pound aged Parmesan cheese, grated 4 eggs Salt and pepper, to taste 2 cups flour 2 egg yolks 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 cup cold water 1 egg, slightly beaten Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 13 by 9 by 2-inch pan. In a large pot cover potatoes with water. Boil until skin cracks and potatoes are not mushy. While potatoes are still hot, peel of the skin. In a large saucepan melt butter and add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and onions, saute until soft and transparent. Add the basil and the parsley. Mash the potatoes and add onion mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon. Stir in Parmesan cheese a little at a time. Add eggs and pepper. Taste and add salt if necessary. (sometimes salt isn&#39;t necessary because cheese has salty taste) Crust: Put flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the flour. In the center add egg yolks and salt, then add oil. Mix with fingers. Add cold water, a little at a time, and work with your fingers. Start kneading the dough for about 10 minutes until it blisters. Roll out on a floured board. Dough will be very hard. Roll out to a rectangular shape. Lay the dough in the pan with edges hanging over the sides. Make sure the pan is greased with butter. Pour potato mixture into the pastry shell, spread the mixture evenly, fold over dough that was hanging over the sides the center will be exposed. Beat egg with a little water and brush over the top.

Hold at room temperature. For the tuna: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Season the steaks with salt and pepper on both sides and add to the hot pan in 2 batches. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the steaks, reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the steaks from the pan and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice the steaks on the bias, 1-inch thick. Reserve the pan for the pasta. For the pasta: Add the tomatoes, capers, olives, garlic, basil, and parsley to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add the orzo and spinach and cook for an additional minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter to finish the sauce. To serve: Spoon the orzo onto plates, top with tuna, Parmesan, and pancetta, and drizzle with the Chianti glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 1299,&quot;Salted Caramel Nuts 1 cup each whole roasted salted cashews, whole large pecan halves, whole unsalted almonds, and whole walnut halves (4 cups total) 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon fleur de sel Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine the nuts on a sheet pan, spread them out, and roast them for 7 minutes, until they become fragrant. Set aside to cool. After the nuts are cooled, place the sugar and 1/4 cup of water in a medium (10-inch) saute pan and mix with a fork until all of the sugar is moistened. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar melts -- from this point on, don&#39;t stir the caramel, swirl the pan! Don&#39;t worry -- the mixture may look as though it&#39;s crystallizing. Continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture becomes a clear golden brown, swirling the pan constantly at the end. (Careful -- the caramel is very hot!) Off the heat, quickly add the vanilla (it will bubble up!) and swirl the pan to combine. Working quickly (the caramel will continue to cook in the pan), add the nuts and the kosher salt and toss with 2 large spoons until the nuts are completely coated. Pour the nuts and any extra caramel in the pan onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Spread the nuts out in one layer, pulling them apart with two forks. Sprinkle with the fleur de sel and set aside to cool. When they&#39;re completely cooled, carefully break the nuts into large clusters with your hands, trying not to break the nuts too much.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 1300,&quot;Crispy Fish with Stir-Fried Vegetables 2 cups long-grain white rice 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 2 tablespoons chopped garlic 2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger 2 cups julienned carrots (matchsticks) 2 cups sliced shiitake mushrooms 2 cups sliced onions 6 heads bok choy, quartered Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cups chicken broth 1/2 cup sherry 1/4 cup fish sauce 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger 2 ounces cornstarch 3 large egg yolks Salt and freshly ground black pepper Juice of 1 lime 16 cups vegetable oil 1 pound cornstarch 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus additional for finishing 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus additional for finishing Six 6-ounce cod fillets 1 cup chopped scallions, for garnish Instructions: For the rice: Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Using a fine-mesh sieve, rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Stir the rice in the boiling water and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 12 minutes. Fluff with a fork and cover with a lid to hold warm for plating. For the stir-fried vegetables: Heat a wok until smoking. Remove the wok from the heat and add the grapeseed oil. Place the wok back over the heat, add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds, stirring to avoid burning the garlic. Add the carrots, mushrooms, onions and bok choy and stir-fry until the carrots are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl; cover to keep warm. For the sauce: Heat the wiped-clean wok over high heat. Add the chicken broth, sherry, fish sauce and ginger and bring to a boil. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 1/2 cup water and add it to the sauce slowly, whisking, until the sauce reaches the desired thickness (do not add it all if it thickens up enough first). Whisk the egg yolks into the sauce, then remove from the heat and season with salt, pepper and lime juice. For the fish: In a tall-sided pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F; line a plate with paper towels. In a shallow dish, season the cornstarch with the salt and pepper. Dredge the cod fillets in the cornstarch and immediately place them in the oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot.

In a large mixing bowl sift in the flour and bread soda, add the salt, sugar, and sultanas. Mix well by lifting the flour and fruit up in to your hands and then letting them fall back into the bowl through your fingers. This adds more air and therefore hopefully more lightness to your finished bread. Now make a well in the center of the flour. Break the egg into the bottom of your measuring jug, and add the buttermilk to the14 fluid ounce (425 milliliter) line (your egg is part of your liquid measurement). Pour most of this milk and egg into the flour. Using 1 hand with the fingers open and stiff, mix in a full circle drawing in the flour from the sides of the bowl, adding more milk if necessary. The dough should be softish, not too wet and sticky. The trick with spotted dick like all soda breads is not to over mix the dough. Mix it as quickly and as gently as possible thus keeping it light and airy. When the dough all comes together, turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. Wash and dry your hands. With floured fingers roll lightly for a few seconds just enough to tidy it up. Pat the dough into a round, pressing to about 2-inch (6 centimeter) in height. Place the dough on a baking tray dusted lightly with flour. With a sharp knife cut a deep cross on it, let the cuts go over the sides of the bread. Prick with knife at the 4 triangles as according to Irish Folklore this is to let the fairies out! Put in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then turn down the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 35 minutes or until cooked. If you are in doubt about the bread being cooked, tap the bottom: if it is cooked it will sound hollow. Serve freshly baked, cut into thick slices and smeared with butter and jam. Spotted Dick is also really good eaten with cheese. This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.

Add 3 cups of the flour, then 2 teaspoons of salt and mix for about 10 minutes, slowly adding up to 1 more cup of flour to just keep the dough from sticking to the bowl. When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured board and knead by hand a dozen times. It should be smooth and elastic. Brush a medium bowl with olive oil, place the dough in the bowl, and turn it several times to cover lightly with oil. Cover the bowl with a clean, damp kitchen towel and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes, until doubled in size. Divide the dough into 6 equal parts and roll each one into a smooth ball. Place the balls on a sheet pan and cover them with the damp towel. Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Sprinkle 3 sheet pans with cornmeal. If you&#39;ve chilled the dough, leave it at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow it to come to room temperature. Press each piece of dough into a circle with your fingertips. Stretch the balls of dough into rough 8-inch circles and place them on the prepared sheet pans. Brush the dough with olive oil and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned and crisp, rotating the pans to bake evenly. Set aside to cool slightly. Whisk the mascarpone with 1 tablespoon of the chives, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spread the mixture on the pizzas, and place one layer of smoked salmon on top. Place the pizzas on a serving board, top them with dressed mesclun, and serve immediately. Whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, dill, salt, and pepper. Toss the mesclun greens with enough of the vinaigrette to moisten. Sprinkle with chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1337,&quot;Molten Chocolate Espresso 6 ounces excellent-quality bittersweet chocolate 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs 1/2 cup heavy cream, plus 1 cup for whipping 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch salt 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon espresso powder Unsweetened cocoa powder, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the chocolate with the butter in the top of a double boiler; set aside to cool. In an electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or by hand, with a spoon), mix the sugar and eggs until lightened in color, about 1 minute. Pour in the cooled chocolate-butter mixture, then beat or stir in the 1/2 cup cream, vanilla, and salt. Beat well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as you go. Add the flour and mix just until blended. Divide the mixture between 4 (6-ounce) oven-proof cappuccino cups. (They should be filled to 1/4-inch below the rim of the cup.) Put them on a baking sheet and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, just until the tops begin to crack. Do not over bake (the top should be crisp but the interior soft). Let them cool for about 15 minutes while you make the whipped cream. Dissolve the espresso powder in the remaining 1 cup of heavy cream, then whip the cream until it forms soft peaks. Put a dollop of the flavored whipped cream on each warm \cappuccino\ and garnish with a dusting of cocoa. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo, Pinotage]&quot; 1338,&quot;Raspberry Tart 3/4 cup unsalted butter at room temperature 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour Pinch salt 1 cup good raspberry preserves 1 1/2 pints fresh raspberries (3 packages) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar together until they are just combined. Add the vanilla.

Fill the ring molds about three-quarters full. Bake until the cakes look set but are still a little wiggly in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Let the cakes cool, then remove from the molds. (The cakes may be made earlier in the day; let cool completely, then cover and keep at room temperature.) To serve, reheat the cakes briefly in a warm oven and serve with orange gelato on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 1355,&quot;Coconut Pandan Chiffon Ice Cream 1/3 cup coconut milk 1 to 2 frozen pandan leaves Oil, for oiling the cake pan 1/2 cup sugar 4 eggs, separated 1/3 cup avocado oil (makes cake texture better when frozen) 1 teaspoon salt 1 to 2 drops pandan extract 1/2 cup self-rising flour 1 cup milk 1 cup heavy whipping cream 1/3 cup coconut cream (Coco Lpez is the best) 1/2 cup sugar 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste 1/2 cup egg yolks Shredded coconut, for topping Instructions: For the cake: In a saucepan, pour the coconut milk and set on medium heat. Cut the frozen pandan leaves into small chunks and place in the coconut milk to steep. Cook until the temperature reaches 180 degrees F, then turn off the heat and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Strain and reserve the coconut pandan milk. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Oil a 9-inch springform pan and line with parchment paper. To a stand mixer, add the sugar, egg yolks, avocado oil, salt, pandan extract and reserved coconut pandan milk blend. Beat with the whisk attachment until foamy, then sift in the flour. Pour the batter into a separate mixing bowl. In the now empty mixer bowl, add the egg whites and beat until stiff, about 5 minutes. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter. Do not overmix or you will knock out the air in the egg whites and the cake will be flat. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer the cake in the pan to the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes. (Freezing your finished cake has many benefits in ice cream making; you can easily cut into chunks, the cake has more body and it doesn\u2019t tear apart when folding into ice cream. Because it is already cold, you also don\u2019t have to worry about ice crystals forming around the cake when it freezes.) Cut into hunks. For the ice cream: In a saucepan, pour the milk, cream and coconut cream together. Turn the heat to medium and slowly stir. Bring to 120 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine the sugar, salt and egg yolks. Mix thoroughly with a whisk, but not to the point where it is foamy. When the milk blend reaches 120 degrees F, slowly add the egg mixture, whisking constantly. It\u2019s important to pay attention and not pour too quickly, or you could curdle the egg (super gross). Continue to slowly stir with a silicone spatula, making sure to constantly scrape the bottom. Keep an eye on the temperature of the custard; at 138 to 140 degrees it will start to slightly thicken. When temp reaches 145 degrees F, turn off the heat and remove the pan from the range. Pour the custard into a mixing bowl and float the mixing bowl in an ice bath to cool to 40 degrees F. (The colder the custard pre-churn, the creamier the result will be.) Pour the cold custard into an ice cream maker and turn on. Let churn until it has a soft serve-like consistency, 10 to 15 minutes. Scrape the finished ice cream into a mixing bowl and fold in hunks of pandan chiffon cake. Freeze to finish hardening, about 1 hour. Top scoops of the ice cream with some shredded coconut before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 1356,&quot;Duck a l&#39;Orange 3 cups fresh orange juice 2 cups sugar<br> 1 head garlic, sliced in half crosswise 2 tablespoons orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier<br> One 4-inch piece fresh ginger, coarsely chopped<br> 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons Chardonnay vinegar 1 habanero or scotch bonnet pepper 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives<br> 2 teaspoon coarsely crushed pink peppercorns<br> 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon 3 tablespoons ancho cl powder 3 tablespoons pasilla cl powder 3 tablespoons ground cumin 3 tablespoons ground coriander 3 tablespoons ground ginger 3 tablespoons brown sugar 2 tablespoons garlic powder 2 tablespoons onion powder 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon allspice 1 tablespoon ground cloves 1 tablespoon ground fennel seed 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon dried ground cl de arbol 2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper plus more for seasoning 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> 1/4 pound slab bacon, sliced into three even strips 4 bone-in duck confit legs 4 duck breasts, skin scored Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 kumquats, thinly sliced 1 cup fresh orange juice 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries<br> Fresh thyme sprigs, for garnish Instructions: For the gastrique sauce: Combine the orange juice, sugar, garlic, orange liqueur, ginger and 2 cups of the vinegar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.

Fit a baking sheet with a wire rack. Heat a griddle pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Zest the orange and set aside. Working over a medium bowl, segment the orange; squeeze the juice from the remaining orange membranes. Whisk the eggs, orange zest, milk, cinnamon and orange juice in a baking dish or shallow bowl. Add the cornflakes and bacon to another baking dish and toss together. Dip the bread slices in the egg mixture and let them soak for 1 minute. While the bread is soaking, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter on the griddle pan or skillet. Working with one slice of bread at a time, let the excess egg mixture drip off and then dredge the bread in the cornflake mixture. Add the bread to the griddle, carefully placing as many slices of bread as can comfortably fit without touching too much (it\u2019s OK if the edges need to touch a little). You can dredge the bread, transfer it to an unlined baking sheet and hold for 5 minutes while one batch is cooking. Cook on one side, rotating occasionally, until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until it is equally browned, another 2 minutes. Transfer the slices to the prepared baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you complete the next batches. Repeat the cooking process, melting 2 tablespoons of butter for each batch. When all of the French toast is cooked and you are ready to serve, gently stir together the maple syrup and orange segments, making sure not to break up the segments. Spoon the syrup over the French toast and sprinkle with cinnamon.

Spray the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Set the pan on a large piece of aluminum foil and fold up the foil around the sides of the pan. Stir the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, cinnamon and butter together in a medium bowl until combined and crumbs are moist. Remove 1/2 cup of the graham cracker mixture and transfer to a medium bowl. Stir the flour into the smaller bowl of crumbs and set aside to use as the crumb topping. Firmly press the remaining crumb mixture over the bottom and slightly up the sides of the prepared pan, using your fingers or the bottom of the greased drinking glass to make level. Refrigerate while making the filling. For the cheesecake filling: Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. (Fit a stand mixer with a paddle attachment.) Add the sugar and mix on medium speed, scraping the sides as needed, until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the eggs, one at the time, mixing well between additions. Mix in the sour cream, lemon zest and vanilla until combined, but do not overmix. Pour the filling into the prepared pan and smooth the top with an offset spatula. Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan and set in the middle rack of the oven. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until the water is halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Bake until the sides of the cheesecake are firm, but the center still jiggles, about 50-55 minutes. For the peach topping: While the cheesecake is baking, combine the peaches, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring, until peaches are softened, about 5 minutes. Whisk the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water together in a small bowl, then whisk into the boiling peach mixture. Cook, stirring, until thick and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Let cool while the cheesecake continues to bake. Gently open the oven and pull the rack halfway out, so that you can easily reach the cheesecake. Spoon the filling over the top of the cheesecake, then top with the reserved crumble mixture, squeezing it to create clumps. Carefully push the rack back into the oven and continue baking until the crumble is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes more. Loosen the cheesecake from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim, then let cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for at least 6 hours and up to overnight before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 1394,&quot;Italian Steak Salad with Parmesan Croutons 2 cups grape tomatoes (1/2 cup whole, 1 1/2 cups halved) 1/2 small red onion (1/2 cut into chunks, 1/2 thinly sliced) 1/4 cup fresh basil 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/4 pounds flank steak, halved lengthwise 3 cups torn Italian bread (about 4 ounces) 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese, plus shaved parmesan for topping 3 heads endive, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 head radicchio, torn 1 romaine lettuce heart, torn Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425?.

Sift the cocoa powder and flour together at least 3 times. Set aside. Place the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Bring this mixture just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and add the sifted cocoa and flour in all at once. Stir with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together to form a ball. Return the pan to medium-high heat and beat constantly until a film develops on the bottom of the pan, about 2 minutes. Do not let it burn. Transfer the dough to the bowl of an electric mixer with a paddle attachment. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the side of the bowl and continue to beat the dough for 4 minutes at high speed. Transfer the dough into a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and pipe 3 to 4-inch log shapes onto the paper. Bake for 10 minutes; then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Bake for another 15 minutes. Turn the oven off. Remove the eclairs from the oven and poke a hole in each one using a skewer or piping nail. Place the eclairs back in the oven and leave the door ajar for 10 minutes, allowing the eclairs to dry. Cut the eclairs in 1/2 lengthwise with a serrated knife. Place the bottom halves of the eclairs on a sheet pan and put 3 marshmallows into each. Place under the broiler until golden, watching closely. Remove from oven. Place tops on and ladle the chocolate sauce over top. Place the chocolate in a stainless-steel bowl. Pour the heavy cream into a small saucepan over medium-high heat and heat the cream until just before the boiling point. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit for 1 minute.

This will result in 8 chicken breast pieces that are thinner and uniform in size. Next, make the marinade. In a large bowl mix together the honey, mustard, paprika, salt, pepper to taste, lemon juice and crushed red pepper flakes if using. Stir to combine. Add the chicken to the marinade and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge, 2 to 4 hours. While the chicken marinates, fry up the bacon until chewy. When finished cooking, reserve 1/4 cup of the bacon grease and pour off the rest of the grease (but do not clean the skillet). When you are ready to cook the chicken, remove it from the marinade and cook it in the skillet over medium-high heat, 3 to 4 minutes each side. Brush a little reserved bacon grease on the chicken as you cook it. (Or you can grill the chicken breasts on an indoor or outdoor grill.) When a couple of minutes grilling time are left, lay 2 pieces of bacon onto each chicken breast. Top with some Cheddar and allow it to melt on the grill (if you need to remove the chicken you can finish melting the cheese under the broiler). Halve the rolls and immediately load with the bacon-and-cheese covered chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 1402,&quot;Tako Poke 2 tablespoons sesame oil (1 tablespoon to brush on octopus and 1 tablespoon to mix in) 3 to 4 pound octopus, debeaked Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 English cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced 5 scallions, white and tender green parts only, sliced on the bias 1 red cl, stem and seeds removed and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon nori (from about 3 seaweed sheets used to wrap sushi, such as from a package of 10 yakinori), pulverized Salt, if needed Instructions: Brush 1 tablespoon of the oil on the octopus (reserving the rest), season with salt and pepper, and add to a pot with enough water to cover.

Line a muffin tin with paper liners. For the cupcakes: Stir together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the granulated sugar, brown sugar and eggs together in a large bowl until smooth and light. Whisk in the oil until combined. Whisk in the pumpkin until completely smooth. Add the dry ingredients and fold until the batter is just smooth.<br> Divide the batter among the muffin cups. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the muffins comes out just clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack and cool 5 minutes, then remove the cupcakes from the pan and cool on the rack completely.<br> For the chocolate buttercream: Sift the confectioners\u2019 sugar and cocoa onto a piece of parchment paper. Beat the butter and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar mixture and beat on low speed until just combined. Add the vanilla and 1 tablespoon cream. Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes, adding more cream as needed to make a light, spreadable frosting.<br> Generously frost the cupcakes. Use an offset spatula to make the tops smooth and flat.<br> For decorating: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and a tablespoon of lemon juice in a small bowl and whisk with a fork until smooth. Add more lemon juice, as needed, to make a frosting the consistency of glue.<br> Use the confectioners\u2019 sugar glue to adhere 7 peanut butter candies to each ginger cookie like the feathers of a turkey\u2019s tail (make a row of 5, then place 2 underneath). Lay flat until set, about 15 minutes.<br> To make the heads, cut a small slice from the side of each doughnut hole so the heads will sit flat on the cupcakes. Glue 2 eyeballs to each head. Cut the yellow end from each piece of candy corn and discard it. Use a paring knife to cut a slit just below the eyes in a head and stick in a candy corn to make a beak. Repeat with the remaining heads. Cut each of the 4 red jelly candies into 3 half-moons. Glue each to the side of the candy corn for the wattles.<br> Cut two \u201cwings\u201d from each peanut butter cookie by laying the cookie horizontally and cutting each side on an angle to make 2 wings; a triangular piece of cookie will be left over in the middle (snack on it, or save it for another use).

Take the saucepan off the heat, remove the lemon and spices, and allow the syrup to cool to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pistachios and 1 tablespoon of the sugar, to coat the nuts, in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Using the pulse method, process them until they are coarsely ground. Be sure not to over process the nuts because they will turn to paste. Remove the ground pistachios from the processor and place in a bowl and set aside. In a saucepan, melt the butter slowly on very low heat. Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the ground pistachios, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl. Take 4 sheets of phyllo dough and brush each sheet with melted butter, layering the sheets as you go. Once the 4 sheets are pressed together, sprinkle 1 cup of the nut mixture over the top sheet and roll, lengthwise, until you reach the end. Keep the roll as tight as possible without breaking. It should look like a long cylinder. Repeat with remaining sheets, 4 at a time. Cut the roll into 2-inch pieces, and dip each into the melted butter and then place on a baking sheet. Place into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and with a pair of tongs remove each piece from the pan, dip in the syrup, and place on a cake rack to drain. If the syrup begins to thicken, it can be reheated slightly.

Line cupcake pans with 30 cupcake liners. Sift together the all-purpose flour, pistachios, almond flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a large bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the sugar and eggs until light yellow in color, about 3 minutes. Mix in the oil until combined. Add the sifted ingredients and mix until incorporated. Mix in the buttermilk. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the almond emulsion, vanilla and green coloring and mix until incorporated. Fill the cupcake liners three-quarters full with batter. Bake until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool 15 minutes, and then pull them from the pans and place on a cooling rack or baking sheet to cool completely. For the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, combine the egg whites and cream of tartar and whip at medium speed until frothy. Add 1 1/2 cups of the sugar and whip at high speed until stiff peaks form. In a saucepan, stir the remaining 1/2 cup sugar into 1/2 cup water. Put a candy thermometer in the pan and place the pan over medium-high heat. When the simple syrup reaches the soft-ball stage (235 to 245 degrees F), immediately pour it into the egg whites while the mixer is on low speed. Once all the syrup is added, turn the mixer to high and whip until the bottom of the bowl is cool, about 15 minutes. Add the butter and whip until smooth and silky. Add the raspberries and vanilla and mix until incorporated.<br> Put the frosting in a pastry bag with the desired decorating tip.

With a rubber spatula, scrape down any batter which adheres to the sides of the processor. If the batter appears thick, add more water; if too thin, then gradually whisk in more flour. Let the batter set, in the refrigerator for an hour or so. Rub an 7-inch crepe pan or non-stick pan with oil or melted butter. Set over high heat until pan just begins to smoke. Ladle about 3 tablespoons of batter into the hot pan. Lift the pan from the heat and swirl the batter around so that it evenly coats the bottom. Pour excess back into the batter for the next crepe. Let the crepe cook on one side for about a minute or until it looks dried out. Flip the crepe over and cook it for 30 seconds on the other side. Repeat until all are done. To store, stack them, with waxed paper or parchment squares in between each one and freeze in batches. Heat butter and add flour. Cook slowly for a minute or two. Add the hot liquid and bring to a boil, stirring continuously. Season to taste with salt and pepper; beat in cream. Off heat, add cheese and adjust the seasoning. Yield: 3 cups of sauce Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 9-inch deep pie plate and center a crepe in the bottom. Mix the spinach filling with 1/2 cup of the cheese sauce and spread some of this over the first crepe. Center a crepe on top of spinach filling and spread it with ricotta cheese and pepper filling. Top with a crepe and continue this way until you end with a crepe. Spoon cheese sauce over the top of the tower and sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes or until bubbling hot. You can assemble the \tower\ of crepes and fillings in advance and make the sauce in advance, but spoon sauce over crepes right before baking. If you have made this in advance and it is cold you will have to bake it for 45 minutes to heat it through.

Set aside for 10 minutes to allow the raspberries to macerate and the sugar to dissolve. Meanwhile, place a small plate in the freezer to chill; this will be used to test the doneness of the jam. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium, stirring frequently. Continue to cook until the jam becomes thick and syrupy, about 25 minutes. To test doneness, place a small amount of the jam onto the chilled plate and freeze for 2 minutes. Drag your finger or spoon through it. If the jam holds its shape and thickness, the jam is done; remove from the heat. If it&#39;s runny, continue to cook and test again in 5-minute increments. Once the jam has reached the right consistency, transfer to jars and cool completely before storing, covered tightly.

Then round it all out with cookie-coated Caramel Apples. Insert a wooden stick into the stem end of each apple. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Make the caramel: Melt the sugar and corn syrup in a large pot over medium-high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until combined. Don&#39;t stress if it starts to clump: It will eventually even out. Cook, swirling the pan but not stirring, until dark amber in color and a candy thermometer registers 245 degrees F, 8 to 12 minutes. Add the butter all at once, stirring until incorporated. Turn down the heat to medium and pour in the heavy cream (the mixture will foam up); whisk until smooth. Increase the heat to medium high and bring the caramel up to 250 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Dip the apples in the caramel and roll in crushed cookies; place on the baking sheet to set, 5 to 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 1476,&quot;Oatmeal Movie Cookie Ice Cream Sandwiches 3/4 cup (168 grams) creamy unsweetened almond butter 2/3 cup (132 grams) light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup (100 grams) unrefined coconut oil, melted<br> 1/3 cup (67 grams) granulated sugar<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 3 cups (270 grams) old-fashioned rolled oats<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 cup (20 grams) popped buttered popcorn, plus extra for topping<br> 2 cups (430 grams) mix of chocolate covered raisins, white nonpareil coated chocolates, candy-coated chocolates, plus extra for topping. Flaky salt, optional<br> 3 cups vanilla ice cream<br> Instructions: Place an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone mat and set aside. Place another baking sheet, plate or airtight container in the freezer. In a large bowl, whisk together the almond butter, brown sugar, coconut oil, granulated sugar vanilla, cinnamon and salt in until creamy, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Add the oats and baking soda and mix to combine. Add the popcorn, chocolate-covered raisins, nonpareils and candy-coated chocolates. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in until evenly incorporated. Scoop 1/4-cup-sized balls of dough (about the size of a plum) onto the baking sheets 2 inches apart (see Cook&#39;s Note). Dot each cookie with a few pieces of popcorn and candy. Sprinkle each with a pinch of flaky salt, if desired. Bake until lightly browned and just set in the center, begin checking for doneness at 14 minutes. These cookies have a tendency to spread into uneven blob shapes in the oven, so I like to shape them back into circles as soon as they come out of the oven using an inverted bowl on top of the cookies to gently curve the edges back into alignment. Let cool on the pan completely (well, enjoy one or two while they\u2019re still warm but then let the rest cool on the pan). While the cookies cool, remove the ice cream from the freezer to slightly soften. Scoop 1/3 cup of ice cream onto the flat, bottom side of half the cookies. Top with another cookie and gently press down to flatten. Place the ice cream sandwich in the freezer on the cold baking sheet, plate or container. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ice cream.

Heat a large pot of generously salted water over medium-high heat and prepare an ice bath with a few pinches of salt. When the water comes to a boil, blanch the cauliflower florets until just cooked, about 2 minutes. Immediately shock in the ice bath to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside. For the fish: Combine the ground fennel seed, olives, cherry tomatoes, celery, lemon juice, shallot, fennel, zucchini, a drizzle of good finishing oil, red pepper flakes and some salt in a medium bowl. Cut 2 large sheets of parchment paper into heart shapes and brush the paper with olive oil, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Arrange half of the vegetable mixture on one piece. Top with a piece of fish, then top with two lemon wheels and some fennel fronds. Repeat with the remaining vegetables, fish, lemon wheels and fronds on the other piece of parchment. Fold and crisply crease each heart into a half-heart, enclosing the fish and vegetables inside but leaving a small opening on one end. Pour 2 tablespoons wine into the openings on each packet, then finish enclosing the packets tightly. Place the packets on a rimmed baking sheet and bake 7 to 8 minutes. For the cauliflower: Meanwhile, coat the bottom of a cold, large skillet with a decent amount of olive oil. Add 3 cloves garlic and 1 anchovy fillet. Put the skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until the garlic is golden brown and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic from the skillet. Add the panko and cook, stirring in the warm oil, until golden and toasty, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the parsley, toss to combine and transfer the mixture to a plate. Wipe out the skillet, add more oil to coat, and place back over medium-high heat. Add the Calabrian cl paste, remaining 2 cloves garlic and 1 anchovy fillet and stir to combine. Cook until the garlic is golden brown and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic from the skillet. Add the capers and blanched cauliflower. Gently mix to coat the cauliflower and cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Plate the cauliflower and sprinkle with the panko breadcrumbs.

Tuck the beans in the jar or bottle and pour in the vodka. Close the jar, shake it a few times, and place it in a cool, dark space. Let the jar rest for 6 to 8 weeks, shaking it again once or twice a week. The mixture will get darker and darker over time. When the extract starts to run low, top it off with more vodka and shake again. Also, whenever you use a vanilla bean, don&#39;t hesitate to add it to the jar after you&#39;ve used it. This will continue to \feed\ your vanilla extract and it should keep forever. Vanilla Variations: Vanilla Sugar: Split 2 vanilla beans and scrape the seeds into an air-tight container with 3 cups granulated sugar. Cover the beans in sugar and tightly seal. Let the sugar sit for 2 weeks. Use just as you would use regular granulated sugar. Vanilla Almonds: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Beat the egg white with the vanilla extract, add the almonds and stir to coat. Combine the sugar, salt, and cinnamon and combine with mixture. Place in a single layer on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 300 degrees F for 20 minutes. Remove and cool on wax paper and break into clusters. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1479,&quot;Pickled Watermelon with Peppers and Celery 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 8 to10 medium cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 1 large jalape?o pepper, stemmed and halved lengthwise (seeded for less heat if desired) 3 bay leaves, preferably fresh One 3-pound wedge seedless watermelon 1 large red bell pepper, stemmed and cut into 2-inch pieces 2 large stalks celery, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths 1/2 bunch dill, tough stems removed 2 cups cold filtered water, plus 1 1/2 cups more if needed Instructions: Combine the sugar, salt, both vinegars, peppercorns and 1 cup cold water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring, until the sugar and salt are dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; add the garlic, jalape?o and bay leaves. Let steep until the brine has cooled slightly, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, scrub the watermelon rind several times with a damp clean dish towel, making sure to remove any excess dirt or debris. Cut the wedge in half lengthwise then slice each half crosswise into 1-inch-thick wedges, each no more than 3 inches wide. Place in a clean 1-gallon wide-mouth glass jar, alternating with the bell pepper, celery and dill sprigs (so that all the watermelon isn\u2019t sitting on the bottom). Set aside. Once the brine has cooled slightly, add 2 cups ice and stir until the ice melts completely. Add the 2 cups cold filtered water and stir until fully incorporated. The brine should be fully cooled by this point. If not, let it cool completely on the counter. Pour or ladle the brine into the jar. The watermelon and vegetables should be fully submerged. If not, add up to 1 1/2 cups cold filtered water. Close the jar with the lid and let sit in a cool place away from direct sunlight for 2 hours, then refrigerate for 24 hours. After the 24 hours, the pickled watermelon and vegetables are ready to enjoy!

There shouldn&#39;t be any rapid bubbles while cooking. Instead, the ragu should release occasional small bubbles. If the ragu reduces too quickly, add 1/2 cup of water and continue cooking. Repeat if necessary. The ragu needs the full 2 to 2 1/2 hour cook time to develop the flavors.<br> Discard the bay leaf, basil and Parmesan rind. Break up any remaining clumps of meat with the back of a spoon, making an even textured sauce. Season with salt and set aside until ready to assemble.<br> Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.<br> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook the noodles, stirring occasionally and separating them to prevent sticking, until softened and bendable but are still hard and chalky in the center, about 5 minutes. Transfer the noodles to a large bowl of cold water and set aside until ready to assemble.<br> Stir together the ricotta, 1 cup of the Parmesan, the remaining grated garlic and 2 teaspoons salt in a medium bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside until ready to assemble.<br> Lightly oil a 13-by-9-inch glass or ceramic baking pan. Spread 1 cup of the ragu evenly in the bottom of the pan. Lay a single layer of noodles over the ragu (if you&#39;re using long noodles, you will need to cut some noodles to fill the gaps). Spread 1 1/2 cups of the ragu over the noodles. Dollop 3/4 cup of the ricotta mixture over the ragu and spread lightly with a small offset spatula. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the mozzarella, followed by another layer of noodles. Repeat with the remaining pasta, ragu, ricotta mixture and mozzarella, creating 4 layers of pasta and ending with the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella. (The lasagna should come just above the top of the pan but it will sink down slightly as it cooks.) Top with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.<br> Lightly oil a piece of foil and cover the pan. Put the pan on a rimmed baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake the lasagna until bubbling gently around the edges, about 1 hour.<br> Remove the lasagna from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Remove the foil and then continue to bake the lasagna until the top is browned and crisp around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes.<br> Let sit 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 1482,&quot;Rhubarb Rose Jam 1 pound (454 grams) rhubarb, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 2/3 cups (333 grams) sugar Juice of 1 lemon 1 vanilla bean 1 tablespoon (15 grams) rosewater Instructions: In a large heavy-bottomed pot, toss the rhubarb with the sugar, cover, and macerate for 1 hour, tossing occasionally.

Place on the other prepared baking sheet. Bake until the hearts are golden, 5 to 10 minutes, and the phyllo around the salmon is crisp, flaky and golden, about 20 minutes. In a small saucepan, whisk together the reserved mascarpone mixture, the cream, Dijon mustard and salt and pepper. Warm (do not boil) over medium heat. Serve the salmon packets with a drizzle of cream sauce and top each with 3 hearts. Serve extra sauce on the side.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the water, oil and egg. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and using a wooden spoon or a Danish whisk, stir the mixture until a shaggy dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until the dough is a bit smoother. Then \slap\ the dough and turn it over and knead it until smooth; this could take between 5 to 10 minutes. You can also mix the dough in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. This takes about 10 minutes. Cover the dough in plastic wrap and allow to rest a room temperature for 2 hours. Cover a table (at least 36 inches square) with a clean tablecloth. Sprinkle the cloth all over with flour. Gently press the dough into a rough 12-by-12-inch square and then gently pull the dough into a large square, about 36 inches. Use a pair of clean kitchen scissors to cut the thicker edges off the perimeter and discard them. Allow the dough to rest to dry out just a bit, about 5 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil. In a large bowl, add the mushrooms, a generous drizzle of oil, Italian seasoning, paprika and red cl flakes and toss to coat. Spread the mushrooms out on the lined baking sheet. Bake until they shrink a bit and the moisture looks mostly wicked away, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove and lightly season with salt. Allow to cool a bit on the sheet, then transfer to a bowl. Make the patties: In a large bowl, add the beef in chunks and sprinkle with the salt and plenty of pepper. With your less dominant hand, fold and mix the burger with your fingers stretched open like a pitchfork. Mix until just combined. Divide into 4 equal parts and make a ball out of each. Flatten to a size just a bit wider in circumference than your buns. Fit a baking sheet with a rack and set aside. In a cast-iron pan or griddle on medium heat, add a bit of oil, then the patties. Cook, flipping once, until desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to the baking sheet and top each with two slices of cheese. Tent with aluminum foil or cover with an upside-down metal baking dish for about 5 minutes. Make the onion rings: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Pour 2 inches of peanut oil in a tall pot and heat on medium-high heat until the temperature registers 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Fit a baking sheet with a rack and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups of the flour, the smoked paprika and a nice pinch of salt. Whisk in the beer until the mixture resembles a thick pancake batter. Drink the remaining beer. In a separate bowl, add and separate the rings of onion, then dust them with the remaining 1/2 cup flour, tossing with your hands to ensure that they are all coated. Working in small batches so as to not overcrowd the pot, dunk the flour-coated onions into the batter, then directly into the oil. Fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the onion rings to the wire rack and keep warm in the oven. Continue to fry the onion rings, allowing the oil to return to 350 degrees F before adding more. Assemble burgers: Place a patty on each bun bottom, then add some mushrooms, 2 to 3 onion rings and drizzle of your favorite barbecue sauce. Top with the bun tops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 1508,&quot;Chunky Chicken Chili 1 stick butter, divided 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed into 1/2-inch pieces 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 large onion, chopped 1/4 cup red pepper, diced 1/4 cup green pepper, diced 2 cups chicken stock 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 (14.5-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained 2 (4-ounce) cans mild green chiles 1/2 cup sour cream 1 1/2 cups grated Cheddar, for garnish 3 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves, for garnish Instructions: In a large Dutch oven, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat.

Add the eggs and ice water and whisk vigorously to combine. Sift the flour and cornstarch directly over the liquid and stir only a few times to combine. (It&#39;s okay if the batter has some lumps. The gluten in the flour must not be overworked or the batter won&#39;t be light.) Pour the oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of about 4 inches and heat to 360 degrees F over medium heat. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and get a slotted spoon ready. Cut a few incisions down the inside length of each shrimp tail so it relaxes, straightens out and no longer curls. Sprinkle with salt. Dunk the shrimp into the batter to coat. Carefully transfer to the hot oil, gently swirling the oil for even frying on all sides. Fry until the shrimp are light brown with a crispy exterior, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to the paper towels and immediately season with salt. For the spicy mayonnaise: Stir together the mayonnaise, sriracha, dark soy sauce, lime zest and lime juice in a medium bowl. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Set aside. For the sushi roll: Completely wrap a bamboo sushi-rolling mat in a tight layer of plastic wrap. (This keeps the rolls from sticking to the mat.) Put one nori sheet shiny-side down on the wrapped bamboo mat. Gently press and spread about 1/2 cup sushi rice into a shape that matches the nori, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Starting at the end closest to you, spoon spicy mayonnaise along the edge of the rice layer. Lay 2 cucumber batons on top and another drizzle of spicy mayo. Place 2 pieces of shrimp tempura on top. Roll the nori up over the fillings, tucking the clean edge underneath to completely encase them. Top with the bamboo mat and gently press, curling your fingers to tighten up the roll. Remove the roll from the mat and cut into 8 even pieces with a serrated knife, but do not separate them. Shingle the pieces on a plate, slightly overlapping. Top each piece with tobiko wasabi and drizzle the roll with spicy mayonnaise. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining ingredients. Serve the rolls with freshly grated wasabi, pickled ginger and soy sauce on the side.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1519,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Easy Bruschetta Burger 1 1/3 pounds ground chuck 1/4 cup grated red onion (grated on a box grater)<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 2 ounces shaved Parmesan 2 loaves frozen garlic bread (or 8 pieces frozen Texas toast garlic bread), cooked as directed, cut into 8 bun-size circles (see Cook&#39;s Note) 4 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped<br> 1/2 cup torn fresh basil Balsamic syrup, to taste<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, add the ground chuck, onion and oregano. Sprinkle the salt evenly over the bowl and add a hefty amount of black pepper. Gently mix, divide into 4 balls and allow to dry-marinate at room temperature for 1 hour. Preheat a gas grill or large griddle on high. Divide each ball in half to create 8 smaller balls, then press each into a thin flat patty between 1/4 and 1/8 inch thick. The easiest way to do this is between 2 pieces of parchment paper, using a glass or rolling pin. Brush the top side of each patty with the olive oil. Add the patties oiled-side down to the grill and cook until the edges are golden, about 5 minutes. Top half of the patties with the Parmesan and cover each with another patty, creating 4 sandwiched patties. Turn off the heat and cover with aluminum foil or an upside-down metal bowl to tent for just 2 minutes. Place the patties on a garlic bread round (crust-side down) and top each with some tomatoes and basil and a drizzle of balsamic syrup.

If the batter is thick, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of warm water and mix again. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter sit at room temperature until it has bubbles on the surface and smells yeasty, about 30 minutes. For the syrup: Meanwhile, put the sugar, rosewater and 1 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring it to a rolling boil, then lower the heat to medium low and simmer for 10 minutes, undisturbed. The consistency will be like pancake syrup. Set aside so the syrup comes to room temperature. Heat a large nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat. Whisk the batter very well. Measure about 2 tablespoons of the batter per pancake and pour into the pan. Cook the pancakes on one side only, without flipping, until the tops are dry with many bubbles and the bottoms are golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer the pancakes pale-side up to a baking sheet or large platter in a single layer, making sure not to stack them. Cover the pancakes with a clean kitchen towel. Continue with the remaining batter. Let the pancakes cool completely before filling, keeping them covered to avoid drying out. For the fillings: To make the walnut filling, mix the walnuts with the sugar, cinnamon and coconut, if using. To fill the pancakes, hold one pancake pale-side up and add about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the walnut or cheese filling (or enough for the pancake to fold and seal easily). Fold the pancake and pinch the edges very well to seal completely. Place the stuffed pancake on a baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining pancakes and walnut and cheese fillings. For the frying and topping: Add enough oil to a medium cast-iron pan to come about 2 inches up the sides. Heat over medium heat until the oil registers 350 degrees F. Add a few of the qatayef and fry until golden, about 2 minutes on each side (see Cook&#39;s Note). Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. While they\u2019re still hot, add them to the pan with the syrup and toss them around to coat completely. Transfer to a cooling rack set over a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil (for easy cleanup) to drain. Repeat with the remaining qatayef and syrup. Arrange the qatayef on a platter and top with ground pistachios and crushed rose petals. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1522,&quot;\Aarti Party\ aka Savory Sling Ice, as needed 2 ounces vodka, such as Zubrowka 3/4 ounce Pineapple Reduction, recipe follows 3/4 ounce strawberry pickling liquid, from Pickled Strawberries, recipe follows 3/4 ounce ginger sake Soda water, for topping 5 Pickled Strawberries, recipe follows 17 ounces orange-flavored liqueur, such as Cointreau 12 ounces rice vinegar 2 ounces fresh lemon juice 2 ounces strawberry juice 1 pound strawberries, cleaned and hulled 2 pineapples, juiced Instructions: In a cocktail shaker glass filled with ice, combine the vodka, Pineapple Reduction, pickling liquid, ginger sake and 4 Pickled Strawberries.

Spread the frosting over the cooled brownies, chill until set, and cut into squares. Serve with coffee ice cream and/or chocolate covered espresso beans. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 1527,&quot;Turdilli 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting work surface 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup pure olive oil 3/4 cup red vermouth, Marsala, sweet sherry, or other sweet wine such as Vin Santo 2 large eggs 4 to 6 cups peanut or vegetable oil, for deep-frying About 2 cups honey, warm Instructions: Sift together the flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the olive oil, vermouth, and eggs until well blended. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until the mixture forms a cohesive mass. Scrape the dough onto a very lightly floured board. Knead lightly until smooth. Shape the dough into a ball, flatten, and place in a bowl. Dust the top lightly with flour, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight to allow the dough to relax. If necessary, lightly dust the work surface with flour. Cut the dough into 6 or 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 1/2-inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into 1/2-inch pieces. Shape into \gnocchi\ with a gnocchi board, butter paddle, or on the back side of the tines of a fork. The deeper the grooves on the cookies the better as they puff up as they fry and the ridges, unless deep, tend to disappear. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or deep pan to 350 degrees F. Fry the cookies in about 4 batches until puffed and medium to dark brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. It is easiest to pile the cookies in a sieve or fry basket and then dip them into the hot oil. Each batch should include enough cookies to cover the surface of the oil. Any fewer and the oil gets too hot and browns the cookies before they are cooked through. Stir the cookies while they fry so they do not stick together. The number of cookies you add to the oil and the amount of oil will change the timing. The cookies first turn light gold, then a light brown, and finally almost a light milk chocolate color. Remove just as they get to this color or a little before. Drain on paper towels. While still hot, put the cookies in a large shallow dish and pour the honey over them. Toss the cookies several times as they cool. If the cookies absorb all the honey, add more - they should be fully saturated. Serve in a pretty bowl or store in a covered container. They will keep for about 1 week. Chef&#39;s Notes: Starting with a 1/2-inch piece of dough yields a cookie about 1 inch long, perfect for popping in your mouth all at once. They can be made smaller or larger, depending on your preference. Two hundred sounds like a lot of cookies. But once you taste one you will understand why you should be thinking about making several batches in quick succession. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1528,&quot;Strawberry and Tofu Smoothie 1 cup frozen strawberries (don&#39;t defrost, if using fresh berries, freeze them first) 1 cup ice 1 cup ice water 1/2 cup heavy cream (to lighten up, substitute water) 1/4 cup sugar substitute (recommended: Splenda) 3 1/2 ounces soft or silken tofu 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (there should be no sugar in the ingredient list--usually artificial types are best) 4 fresh strawberries 4 sprigs fresh mint Instructions: Make the Smoothie: Combine all the ingredients in a blender and pulse to chop everything up.

Heat the olive oil in a large, wide pot over medium heat. Add half of the garlic and half of the red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the spinach, in batches if necessary, and cook, tossing, until wilted. Transfer to a cutting board and chop. Transfer to a bowl and cool slightly. Add the panko, mozzarella, Parmesan, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine. Cut the stems off of the artichokes so that you have a flat base, reserving the stems. Cut the top 1 1/2 inches off the artichokes with a serrated knife and rub the surface with half of the lemon. Use kitchen shears to cut any remaining pointy tips from the artichoke leaves. Starting from the base, gently pull a leaf away from the center and stuff in a little bit of the spinach filling. Continue to stuff the leaves, working inward to the center of the artichoke, until it is no longer possible to pull the leaves away. Repeat with the remaining artichokes.<br> Arrange the artichokes in a baking dish and fill the dish with about 1 inch of warm water. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the leaves pull out easily and the flesh is tender, 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, take the reserved artichoke stems and trim away all of the outer woody green parts, leaving just the pale green cores. Chop the cores. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the remaining garlic, red pepper flakes and the stems. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the stems are crisp-tender and the butter is fragrant with garlic, about 6 minutes. Squeeze in the juice from the remaining lemon half and stir in the parsley; season with salt. Serve the warm artichokes drizzled with the garlic-lemon butter; serve any remaining garlic-lemon butter on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 1531,&quot;Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, scooped and leveled 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, scooped and leveled 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon buttermilk<br> 1 teaspoon red food coloring<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 large eggs Confectioners&#39; sugar, for coating 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted One 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped<br> Instructions: For the cookies: Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl, then set aside. Whisk together the granulated sugar, butter, buttermilk, food coloring, vanilla and eggs in another bowl. Fold the flour mixture into the sugar mixture with a rubber spatula until smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes (it will still be soft).

Toss the oats, almonds and pumpkin seeds on a baking sheet and bake until just beginning to toast, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the chia and flax seeds. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Meanwhile, add the honey, almond butter, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup of the coconut oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until the ingredients are melted. Stir to combine. Pour the mixture into the bowl with the oat mixture. Spray a rubber spatula with nonstick cooking spray and gently fold until combined. Fold in the figs. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray, then line with parchment with a 1-inch overhang on 2 of the sides. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet and use the rubber spatula (or damp hands) to press into an even layer. Bake until light golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes then transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely, about 2 hours. About 30 minutes before the bar is done chilling, remove the yogurt from the refrigerator to bring to almost room temperature. Microwave the remaining 1/4 cup coconut oil in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 30 seconds. Let sit until cool to the touch but still liquid, about 10 minutes. Add the yogurt to the coconut oil and whisk until smooth. Spread the yogurt mixture on top of the bar with a small offset spatula. Chill until hardened, about 1 hour. Use the parchment to remove the bar from the baking sheet; cut into 16 bars.

Lightly coat three 8-inch cake pans with cooking spray. Whisk together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Set aside. Combine the granulated sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. With the mixer on low, add one-third of the flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture. Mix until the flour is just blended. Combine the Champagne and milk. Beat in half of the Champagne mixture. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the Champagne mixture, ending with flour and incorporating fully. Set aside. Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer just until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until stiff peaks form. Gently fold one-quarter of the egg whites into the batter. Then fold in the remaining egg whites. Spoon the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the pans and cool completely. For the stabilized whipped cream: Pour the heavy cream into a medium bowl. Add the powdered milk, vanilla and 6 tablespoons of the confectioners&#39; sugar. With an electric mixer, beat the cream until it reaches stiff peaks, adding additional confectioners&#39; sugar if needed for desired consistency. (Makes 2 cups.) For the strawberry Swiss meringue buttercream: Place a glass bowl over a saucepan filled with approximately 1 inch of water; bring to a simmer. Add the egg whites and granulated sugar to the bowl. Cook, whisking constantly, until the egg whites are hot, the sugar is dissolved and the temperature of the mixture has reached about 140 degrees F. (You can test this by rubbing a small amount between your fingers to make sure it&#39;s not gritty.) Pour the hot egg mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat with the whisk attachment until the bottom of the bowl is no longer warm and the meringue is thick and glossy, 7 to 10 minutes. Slowly add the butter cubes, one at a time, until incorporated. The mixture may curdle; keep beating and it will come back together. Continue beating until the mixture is silky and smooth. If it becomes too thin, refrigerate for around 15 minutes and then beat until it comes together. Add the pureed strawberries, vanilla extract, salt and a splash of lemon juice. Mix until smooth. (Makes 5 cups.) To assemble the cake: Fold the diced strawberries into the stabilized whipped cream, then spread half of the strawberry whipped cream on the top of one cake layer. Place a second cake layer on top of the filling. Repeat with the remaining half of the whipped cream. Place the third cake layer on top of the second. Frost the entire cake, top and sides, with the strawberry Swiss meringue buttercream. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1534,&quot;Matcha-Herb Scones 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons matcha tea powder, such as Kenko or The People&#39;s Republic of Tea, sifted 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes and chilled, plus 6 tablespoons, at room temperature, for serving 1/3 cup finely chopped fresh chives 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon 1 1/4 cups heavy cream, chilled, plus more for brushing 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Combine the flour, sugar, matcha, baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and whisk until evenly combined. Add the chilled butter and rub it into the flour with your fingers until it resembles a coarse meal. Combine the chives and tarragon in a small bowl, then scoop out and reserve 1 tablespoon of the herbs in another bowl. Sprinkle the remaining herbs in the flour mixture and toss until evenly incorporated. Form a well in the center of the flour mixture, then pour in the cream. Using a fork, stir until the dough just comes together (it will be wet and sticky). Transfer the dough to well-floured work surface and, using well-floured hands, pat into a 9-by-6-inch rectangle, about 3/4-inch thick. Using a large knife, halve the rectangle lengthwise, then cut crosswise into thirds, creating six 3-by-3-inch squares. Halve each square diagonally to create 12 triangles, then transfer all the triangles to the prepared baking sheet and space apart evenly. Freeze for 1 hour to firm up. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, add the room temperature butter, pepper and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the reserved herbs and stir to combine. Set aside.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Stir to moisten the rice, then drain and repeat until the water runs clear. When all excess starch and impurities have been removed in this way, let the rice stand to completely drain for 15 minutes. In the meantime, wash and dry the pot to have it ready to cook the rice. Return the cleansed rice to the pot and add 2 1/3 cups water. Cover and bring to a vigorous boil over medium-high heat. Do not remove the lid during any stage of the cooking process. Reduce heat to medium and let cook for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and let cook for 15 minutes, still leaving lid undisturbed. Remove rice from heat and let stand with lid still on pot for 5 more minutes. While the rice is cooking, make the vinegar mixture. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, salt, and miso over medium heat, stirring until the ingredients are integrated. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Separate the grains of rice with a wooden spatula and transfer to a shallow bowl, preferably wooden. Stir in enough of the vinegar to make the rice stick together in clumps when you squeeze some in the palm of your hand. Do not add too much vinegar mixture; it is better to have some left over than to over-moisten the whole batch of rice. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and allow to cool to room temperature before using in a sushi recipe. Note: This sushi rice recipe can be used in conjunction with the recipes for the elements of the Bento Box of sushi hors d&#39;oeuvres made on the episode which included: Traditional Osaka Style Sushi, Rice Balls, Maki, and Nigiri Sushi. Yield: 6 3/4 cups vinegared sushi rice for use in sushi recipes, enough for approximately 6 servings of sushi depending on the recipe &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 1541,&quot;Best Creamy Mashed Potatoes 5 pounds russet or Yukon gold potatoes 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) butter, plus more for topping One 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened<br> 1/2 to 3/4 cup half-and-half<br> 1/2 to 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, such as Lawry&#39;s<br> 1/2 to 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Peel and cut the potatoes into pieces that are generally the same size. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and add the potatoes. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes.

Drain the potatoes thoroughly in a large colander. Place them back into the dry pot and put the pot on the stove. Mash the potatoes over low heat, allowing all the steam to escape before adding in all the other ingredients. Turn off the heat and add the butter, cream cheese and about 1/2 cup of half-and-half. Mash, mash, mash! Next, add about 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Stir well, and then taste and add more half-and-half, seasoning salt and pepper if needed. Transfer the potatoes to a medium-sized baking dish. Throw a few pats of butter over the top of the potatoes and place in the oven until the butter is melted and the potatoes are warmed through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1542,&quot;Gayle&#39;s Sunshine Mocktail 2 cups ice 1 lime\u202f<br> 1 cup chilled pineapple juice<br> 1 cup chilled ginger beer<br> 2 sprigs fresh mint\u202f<br> Instructions: Take 2 glasses and fill them with ice.

Bring a medium pot of salted cold water to a boil. Add the yellow and green beans and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until just crisp-tender. Drain and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking. Let sit in the ice water for a few minutes, and then drain well. Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with salted cold water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the potatoes are almost cooked through (a knife or skewer inserted into the center should meet just a little resistance), 8 to 10 minutes. Drain well and let cool slightly. Heat your grill to high. Once cool enough to handle, slice the potatoes lengthwise, brush with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill, cut side down, and cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn over and grill until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Keep the grill on. Combine the cooked beans, grilled potatoes, tomatoes, onion, basil and parsley in a large bowl. Ad the vinaigrette and gently toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the shrimp. To make the spice rub, combine the fennel, mustard and coriander with the salt and pepper in a bowl. Put the shrimp in a large bowl and toss with the spice rub until evenly coated. Add the 1/4 cup olive oil and toss to coat. Place the shrimp on the grates of the grill in an even layer and grill until golden brown and slightly charred, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn the shrimp over and continue grilling until just cooked through, 45 seconds to 1 minute longer. Arrange the salad on 4 large plates and top with the shrimp. Whisk together the vinegar, mustard, honey, garlic and anchovy paste and season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 1562,&quot;Cory&#39;s Famous Mac and Cheese 1 stick (8 tablespoons) salted butter 4 blocks (8 ounces each) sharp cheddar cheese, such as Cracker Barrel, cut into 1-inch cubes<br> 1 egg<br> 1 teaspoon olive oil<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1 pound elbow macaroni<br> 1 can cream of mushroom soup<br> 1/2 can evaporated milk, such as Carnation<br> 5 tablespoons sour cream<br> 8 ounces extra-sharp cheddar cheese, shredded<br> 1 cup crumbled butter crackers, such as Ritz<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Melt the butter in a cast-iron skillet set over low heat?it is very important that this step be on low heat! Add the cubed cheddar and melt until creamy, stirring constantly. Stir in the egg, taking care not to let it scramble. While the cheese is melting, add the olive oil and salt to the pot of boiling water. Add the pasta; cook for 10 minutes. Strain and return the pasta to the pot. Add the melted cheese and egg mixture to the cooked pasta, along with the cream of mushroom soup, the evaporated milk and the sour cream; stir, then add half of the cracker crumbs.

Lay the unpeeled garlic on the hot surface and let it roast to a sweet mellowness, turning occasionally, until soft when pressed between your fingers (you&#39;ll notice it has blackened in a few small spots), about 15 minutes. Cool, then slip off the papery skins and roughly chop. While the garlic is roasting, break the stems of the chiles, tear the chiles open and remove the seeds. Next, toast the chiles a few at a time on you medium-hot skillet or griddle: Open them flat, lay them on the hot surface skin-side up, press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (if the temperature is right you&#39;ll hear a faint crackle), then flip them. (If pressed long enough, they&#39;ll have changed to a mottled tan underneath. If you see a slight wisp of smoke, that&#39;s okay, but any more will mean burnt chiles.) Now, press down again to toast the other side. Transfer to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes, stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. Pour off all the water and discard. The seasoning: If using whole spices, pulverise the oregano, pepper, cumin and cloves in a spice grinder or mortar, then transfer to a food processor or blender, along with the drained chiles and garlic. Measure in the broth and process to a smooth puree, scraping and stirring every few seconds. (If you&#39;re using a blender and the mixture won&#39;t move through the blades, add more broth, a little at a time, until everything is moving, but still as thick as possible.) With a rubber spatula, work the puree through a medium-mesh strainer into a bowl; discard the skins and seeds that remain behind in the strainer. Taste (it&#39;ll have a rough, raw edge to it), then season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 1567,&quot;Rice Whiskey Treats 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the pan ? cup Maker&#39;s Mark?

Using a zester or a strong vegetable peeler, peel the skin of each citrus fruit to create narrow ribbons.; When handling peppers, it&#39;s best to use rubber gloves; some varieties can sting or even burn the skin. Wash and dry the peppers and slit them lengthwise into slivers. For stronger flavor, leave the seeds intact. For milder flavor, remove. Avoid getting the juice near eyes. For Both Recipes: Clean bottle in warm sudsy water. Rinse and dry. Gently place the citrus peels or peppers into the gift bottle, pour in the vodka, and cover the top of the bottle. (Do not seal at this point) Place the bottle in the refrigerator and let the ingredients steep for at least 3 hours - 2 days is better. Before giving, top off the bottle with additional vodka. (The infusion ingredients will soak up some of the vodka.) Seal the bottle with a cork or glass bottle stopper and seal with sealing wax. Tie a thin metal wire or fabric ribbon around the top of the neck, if so desired. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 1589,&quot;Creamy Caramel Sauce 1/4 cup water 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 1/2 cup heavy cream, warmed to 100 degrees F 1/4 cup creme fraiche 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice Pinch salt (less than 1/8 teaspoon) Instructions: Heat a saucepan of water and place a whisk in it. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly. Combine the water, 1 cup of sugar, and the corn syrup in a medium saucepan. Stir them together with very clean fingers, making sure no lumps of dry sugar remain. Brush down the insides of the pan with a little water, using your hand to feel for any stray granules of sugar. Cover the saucepan and place it over medium heat for 4 minutes. After 4 minutes, remove the lid, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Do not stir from this point on. Keep an eye on the pan. It will be very bubbly. When stray sugar crystals appear on the side of the pan, brush them down with a wet pastry brush. As the sugar cooks, the bubbles will get larger. Insert a candy thermometer, and when the temperature reaches 300 degrees F, lower the heat to medium, which will slow the cooking. Continue to cook the sugar until it reaches 350 degrees F. It will be dark brown. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 1 minute, or until the bubbles subside. Add the cream to the caramel. It will bubble up vigorously, so be careful. Vigorously whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, creme fraiche, lemon juice, and salt. This sauce is now ready to be served warm or cooled to room temperature. It will keep stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. When cold, it has the consistency of peanut butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 1590,&quot;Crab Mold 1 1/2 pounds Chesapeake Bay crabmeat 2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened 1/8 cup chopped onion 1/4 cup chopped celery 1/2 teaspoon crab boil seasoning 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice 2 dashes hot pepper sauce Garnishes: black olives (used for eyes), crab claws, cocktail sauce (spread over top shell), parsley (place around the crab) Instructions: Place 1 pound of crabmeat in bowl.

Coat with some olive oil and add the garlic, onions, Italian seasoning and thyme. Thinly slice the Calabrese peppers and fold into the onion mixture. Season with some salt and pepper and saute until well caramelized, 7 to 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.<br> Trim the steak of any excess fat and remove any tough silver skin with the tip of a knife. Place the steak vertically on a clean cutting board (so the grain runs up and down). Using a sharp knife, make a flat cut down one side of the piece of meat and cut it open parallel to the board so you can open the steak up like a book. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. On one side of the steak spread out the onion mixture. Top with the tomato slices, panko and shredded cheese. Tear up the basil leaves and scatter on top for the last layer of filling. Fold the flap of beef over the top to cover. Using a bamboo skewer, thread the steak along the cut edge to seal the steak back together and hold the filling in.<br> Heat a large cast-iron skillet or grill pan (or outdoor grill) to high. Coat lightly with some oil to clean and create a nonstick surface. Sprinkle the flank steak with salt and pepper on both sides, and then place on the hot grill. Cook for 5 minutes on the first side, and then use a large spatula to carefully flip and cook for a further 5 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. (If you desire a more well done steak, cook for a few minutes longer on each side.)<br> When done, remove from the grill and set aside to rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 1-inch-thick slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 1596,&quot;Pinzimonio: Vinaigrette 1 large fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into 8 pieces 1 red pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips 1 yellow pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips 4 green onions, trimmed 2 artichokes, outer leaves removed, trimmed, quartered, husks removed, rubbed with lemon 4 celery stalks, halved 4 carrots, cut into sticks 2 cups extra-virgin olive oil, best quality possible Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Arrange the vegetables on a large platter.<br> Fill four small bowls with a 1/2-cup each of extra-virgin olive oil, so every person has their own bowl for dipping the raw vegetables.<br> Season the extra-virgin olive oil with the salt and freshly ground pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 1597,&quot;Easy Apple Tarte Tatin 1 stick unsalted butter 1 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon vanilla extract Pinch of salt 4 pounds apples, peeled cored and halved (small Fuji or Gala) 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a wide skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add in the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract and salt and whisk to combine. Add the apples to the caramel mixture and gently stir together, coating the apples in the caramel. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are slightly tender, 5 to 8 minutes depending on the size of your apples. Note: If the mixture begins to get too thick, add some water to loosen it up. Transfer the apples to a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof skillet and arrange them cut-side up, making sure to evenly cover the bottom of the skillet. Drizzle half the caramel sauce over the apples, then return the caramel to the heat and cook until thick and glossy, another 5 minutes. Set aside. Roughly measure and cut the puff pastry sheet to approximately the size of the top of the skillet. Place the puff pastry on top of the apples and gently tuck the sides in ever so slightly. Cut the remaining scraps of puff pastry and evenly spread across the top (this will give the tarte tatin some volume). Bake until the pastry is puffed up and golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, invert a plate on top and quickly (but carefully) flip onto the plate.

Add the butter to melt. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Slowly add the milk, about 1 cup at a time, whisking between additions until smooth. Add the garlic and reduce the heat to low to maintain a gentle simmer. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally with a whisk. Whisk in 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, the nutmeg and 2 teaspoons salt. Remove about 1 1/2 cups of the sauce to a bowl and set aside. Whisk in the pumpkin puree to the first batch of sauce and set aside to cool slightly. Place the bacon in a medium skillet set over medium heat. Cook the bacon, stirring often, until golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the bacon to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon, then stir in the mozzarella, ricotta, the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan, the red pepper flakes, orange zest and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Preheat the broiler to high. Place one oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and another in the top third. Ladle 1 1/2 cups of the pumpkin sauce on the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan and reserve the remaining for a later use. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Blanch the pasta sheets according to the par-cook method of package instructions, about 4 minutes. Remove the pasta from the water using tongs and lay out on a baking sheet to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, start assembling the rolls. Working with a pasta sheet vertical to you, place a small amount of the ricotta mixture on the end of a pasta sheet closest to you. Using a small spoon, spread the mixture evenly about halfway down the noodle. Roll the pasta around the filling, finishing with the end farthest from you. Lay the roll in the prepared pan, seam-side down. Repeat for the remaining filling and pasta. You should end up with two rows of 6 rolls. Use the two sauces to make stripes on the pasta. Ladle one-third of the pumpkin sauce along the side of the pan covering about half of a row of rolls. Right next to it, ladle half of the white sauce, covering another half of a row of rolls. Repeat with the remaining pumpkin and white sauces, finishing with pumpkin (5 rows of sauce altogether). Place the pan in the lower third of the oven and broil to warm through, 15 minutes. Move the pan to the top third of the oven and broil until the top begins to brown and the sauce is bubbling, 4 minutes. Garnish each roll with a fried sage leaf to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 1608,&quot;Grilled Flank Steak and Yuca with Sherry Vinaigrette 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 3 garlic cloves, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade and quartered 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, stripped from 3 or 4 sprigs 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 cup blackstrap molasses 2 pounds flank steak 1 head garlic 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 2 shallot cloves, minced 1 cup Madeira wine 1 cup water 1 teaspoon beef base Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds sweet yuca/cassava root, about 4 to 8 roots, rind and woody cordon removed, peeled, and light fleshy part cut into 1-inch segments (do not consume until thoroughly cooked) 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves Instructions: To make the marinade, add soy sauce and vinegar to blender, replace lid and turn on blender. Through the feed opening add, 1 at a time, the garlic, ground cloves, thyme, black pepper, mustard and molasses. Place flank steak in a nonreactive container, add marinade and coat steak. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. While the steak is marinating, roast the garlic for the demi-glace. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut root end from end of head of garlic and use a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil to mold an enclosure around the garlic to include a base to keep it from tipping over. Pour 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil over the garlic from the root end so the oil flows between the papery skins and the cloves, reserving the rest of the oil for sauteing the shallots. Roast for 40 minutes to 1 hour, being sure to monitor so the garlic doesn&#39;t burn. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature. To make yuca, boil until tender in enough water to cover. Drain well, rinse and set aside briefly. Make a dressing by adding vinegar, salt and thyme to a blender and adding the olive oil in a slow thin stream through the feed opening with the blender running. Mix yuca with enough dressing to coat and refrigerate. Heat grill (or use grill pan). Remove steak from marinade, discard marinade, and sear each side of steak. Cook to your desired level of doneness and transfer to a cutting board to let rest for 5 minutes. To complete the demi-glace, heat the remaining tablespoon of grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and saute until translucent. Deglaze pan with wine and allow most of it to evaporate. In a small bowl, whisk together water and beef base and add to pan. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves directly from their skins into a small bowl and mash them. Add the roasted garlic to the pan and stir until it is integrated with the rest of the contents of the pan. Allow to reduce by half. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, remove from heat and keep warm. Slice steak on the bias into 1/4-inch thick strips and arrange on plate alongside yuca. Spoon sauce over steak. Garnish with minced parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 1609,&quot;Dark Chocolate Coconut Cream Tart 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the tart pan 3/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted<br> 1 cup crushed chocolate wafer cookies, such as Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers (17 cookies) (crushed not crumbs)<br> 1/3 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> One 4-ounce semisweet chocolate bar, chopped<br> 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream<br> 1 tablespoon light corn syrup<br> One 13.5-ounce can coconut milk 1 cup whole milk 4 large egg yolks<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 3 tablespoons cornstarch<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 1/4 cups sweetened flaked coconut, toasted<br> 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 teaspoon almond extract, optional<br> Toasted coconut chips, optional Toasted sliced almonds, optional<br> Dark chocolate curls, optional<br> Instructions: For the crust: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 10-inch tart pan with a removeable bottom. Pulse the toasted almonds in a food processor until finely ground. Add the cookie crumbs, granulated sugar, and salt. Pulse until combined. Gradually add the melted butter and pulse until a dough forms. Pat the mixture into and up the sides of the tart pan. Bake until the crust is set, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring the heavy cream and corn syrup to a simmer in a small saucepan. Pour the cream mixture over the chocolate and stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Pour the ganache into the prepared crust. Refrigerate or freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. For the filling: Bring the coconut milk and whole milk to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks, granulated sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a heavy stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until pale and thickened. Gradually add a quarter of the hot milk mixture, whisking constantly. Whisk in the remaining milk and return the mixture to the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens (do not boil). Remove from the heat. Stir in the butter, vanilla, and toasted coconut. Pour into the prepared crust. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until cooled, about 30 minutes. For the almond whipped cream: Beat the heavy cream and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl until soft peaks form.

Add 3/4 cup lukewarm water and mix well until you have a smooth and thick batter. If the batter is too dry and not smooth, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have a smooth batter. The batter should be slightly thicker than pancake batter. Cover and let it ferment at room temperature until bubbly, 24 to 36 hours. Once the batter has fermented, add the food coloring gel or turmeric powder. The food coloring gives the jalebi a nice orange color and the turmeric results in a more yellow jalebi.<br> The fermented batter should be the consistency of pancake batter. If it\u2019s too thick, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have the right consistency. If too thin, you can add a little flour. To make good jalebis, the consistency of the batter is very important. If it is too thin, you won\u2019t get a nice round shape and it will be more like tape. And if it is too thick, the jalebis will be fat and soft. Transfer the batter to a squeeze bottle or piping bag with a 4- to 5-millimeter opening.<br> Combine the sugar, cardamom, saffron and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the syrup is thickened slightly and sticky, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the lemon juice. Keep warm.<br> Add about 1 inch of oil, ghee or a combination to a wide Dutch oven or deep saute pan. Attach a deep-frying thermometer and heat over medium-high heat to 340 degrees F. It is important that the oil be medium hot. If it\u2019s too hot, the jalebis will brown, and if it&#39;s not hot enough, they will turn out flat.<br> Squeeze out the batter into the hot oil in concentric circles or spirals from the inside out, 3 to 4 inches wide, ending with one quick stroke back toward the middle of each jalebi so it doesn&#39;t unfurl (see Cook&#39;s Note). Keep piping jalebis until the pan is about half full. Cook the jalebis, flipping them over, until crispy, about 45 seconds on each side. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove to a paper towel lined plate or tray. Repeat with the remaining batter.<br> Dunk the jalebis into the warm syrup. Depending how sweet you like your jalebis, you can either let them soak in the syrup for about 10 seconds or just do a quick dip. The jalebis are best eaten immediately. If not eating the jalebis right away, don\u2019t dip them in the syrup until ready to eat. Instead, heat up the syrup and dip the jalebis just before eating.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1614,&quot;Paellita en Relleno 2 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons plus 3 tablespoons virgin olive oil 3 cloves of raw, minced garlic 2 jalapenos, stems and seeds discarded, minced 1/2 of a red onion, diced medium 1 red bell pepper, stem and seeds discarded, diced small 1/2 bulb fennel, core discarded and diced small 1 bay leaf, broken 6 large shrimp still in their shells 18 tiny clams, scrubbed 1 cup white wine 1 cup arborio rice 1 medium pinch saffron 2 1/2 cups chicken stock Salt and pepper, to taste 6 small Poblano chilies, fried and peeled, seeds discarded, stem left on Instructions: Preheat an oven to 450 degrees.<br> Heat a large sauce pot on medium heat and add the butter and olive oil.

Paddle the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until soft and the consistency of mayonnaise, about 3 minutes. Use a kitchen torch to gently warm the bowl if necessary. Add the granulated sugar and salt and continue to paddle at medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and paddle at medium speed until well incorporated, about 3 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). Reduce the speed of the mixer to the lowest setting, add the flour, baking powder, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and allspice and mix until well combined. Scoop the cookie dough into a rough ball on a piece of parchment paper. Place another piece of parchment paper on top and roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick. Keep the dough between the 2 sheets of parchment, place on a baking sheet and chill until firm, about 10 minutes in the freezer. Peel off the top piece of parchment and then place it back on top. Flip the dough over and peel the bottom parchment off. Cut the dough to the desired shape: For this wreath, cut an 8-inch circle and then a 5-inch circle in the interior to make a ring. Reserve, re-roll and bake off scraps for another use. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake the cookie ring until set, 7 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool completely. For the langues de chats: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Paddle the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until soft and the consistency of mayonnaise, about 3 minutes. Use a kitchen torch to gently warm the bowl if necessary. Add the granulated sugar and salt and continue to paddle at medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Gradually add the egg whites and vanilla bean paste and paddle at medium speed until incorporated completely. Reduce the speed of the mixer to the lowest setting, add the cake flour and orange zest and mix until well combined. Your batter should resemble a thick cake batter. Fill a piping bag fitted with a number 3 or 4 tip (large round) with the cookie batter. Pipe cookies onto 3 parchment paper-lined baking sheets. The cookies should be 1 inch long and spaced about 1 inch apart; you should be able to fit 3 rows of 9 to 10 cookies on each baking sheet (see Cook&#39;s Note). Bake 2 baking sheets at a time, rotating the sheets halfway through, until the cookies have just started to brown on the edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool. Cookies will crisp as they cool. Repeat with the remaining baking sheet of cookies. (Makes 60 to 70 cookies) For the coconut lime Russian tea cakes: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Paddle the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until soft and the consistency of mayonnaise, about 3 minutes. Use a kitchen torch to gently warm the bowl if necessary. Add the granulated sugar and salt and continue to paddle at medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and lime juice and paddle at medium speed until well incorporated. Reduce the speed of the mixer to the lowest setting and add the lime zest, flour and coconut and mix until well combined, scraping as often as necessary Using a 1-ounce cookie scoop, scoop the dough about 1 1/2 inches apart onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake until set, about 15 minutes. You should be able to pick up a cookie off the baking sheet. The cookies will be very lightly browned on the edges, and should feel soft, yet solid. Allow to cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet, and then dredge the warm cookies one by one in confectioners&#39; sugar, ensuring complete coverage. Place back on the baking sheet to cool. (Makes 24 to 30 cookies) For the hippen tuile: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Paddle the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the sugar and paddle at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl often. Slowly add the egg whites and continue to paddle at medium speed until completely combined. Reduce the speed of the mixer to the lowest setting, add the flour and lemon zest and mix until combined. Your batter should resemble cake batter. Scoop the tuile batter into a pastry bag fitted with number 0 tip. Chill the batter until firm, about 20 minutes. Pipe the chilled batter into desired shapes (holly leaves for the wreath) on a baking sheet lined with a Silpat or silicone baking mat. The batter will be stiff; loosen it slightly by kneading the pasty bag with your hands. Chill the piped tuile cookies until the batter is firm, about 10 minutes. This is a very important step so that the cookies maintain their shapes. Bake the tuiles until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let cool completely before taking the cookies off the baking sheet. The tuiles will crisp as they cool. For the royal icing: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in the bowl of a stand mixer until combined. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, slowly add the water 1 tablespoon at a time and beat on low speed until the frosting is glossy and smooth. Fill a pastry bag with about 1/2 cup of the royal icing and cut off the tip to pipe fine lines. Reserve the remaining royal icing in the bowl. To assemble: Lay the spiced sugar cookie wreath on a flat surface. Dip one end of a langues des chats in the royal icing and lay it lengthwise on the wreath; repeat twice more so there are 3 across. Continue attaching the cookies, overlapping the ends to shingle all the way around the wreath; the royal icing should only touch the part of the cookies attached to the wreath base and should not be visible. Pipe along the edges and down the center of the hippen tuile holly leaves to accent them. Allow to dry. Attach the leaves and the Russian tea cookies to the wreath with the royal icing to make decorative holly and berry arrangements. Once complete, dust all over with confectioners&#39; sugar to look like snow. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1642,&quot;Apricot Puff Pastry Twists with Vanilla Ice Cream 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed according to package directions 1/4 cup apricot preserves 2 cups vanilla frozen yogurt or ice cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Top with the chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 1648,&quot;Ron&#39;s Braided Challah 1 tablespoon sugar 1 3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons water (warm but not boiling) 2 cups bread flour (scoop and sweep method, un-sifted), plus more for dusting 2 cups semolina flour (scoop and sweep method, un-sifted) 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more to drizzle 1 1/2 tablespoons honey 2 large egg yolks 1 large whole egg 3/4 cup raisins, optional 1 yolk 1 tablespoon cream or milk Sesame seeds, for sprinkling, optional Instructions: For the sponge starter: Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water. Mix to dissolve. Add about 1/2 cup of the bread flour and mix vigorously with a wire whisk. The mixture should look like a thick pancake batter. Cover with plastic or a plate and leave to ferment in a warm room temperature place for about an hour. This sponge will give the challah a rich flavor and will extend its shelf life. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups bread flour, the semolina flour and salt into a mixer bowl. Add the sponge starter, oil, honey, yolks and egg. Mix on low speed with the dough hook until the ingredients seem to come together. Then switch to medium speed and knead to develop the gluten, 5 to 7 minutes. The dough should be smooth and satiny, and have a nice stretch. Shape the dough into a ball and place it back in the mixer bowl. Sprinkle a bit of olive oil and turn the dough so it&#39;s lightly coated. Cover with plastic or a plate and let rise in a warm area until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. To test, lightly poke a finger in the dough. It should be relaxed and not pull back to shape immediately. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured counter and fold it over upon itself few times to redistribute the yeast. If using, sprinkle the raisins onto the dough and press them into it. Divide into desired number of braids (3, 4 or 6) and roll each braid to elongate. Braid the strands to a long loaf or a round shape and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Brush the braided loaf with the egg wash and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F as the challah rises. Reapply the egg wash and, if using, sprinkle the seeds before placing the tray with the challah in the oven. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until golden, 30 to 35 minutes. The challah will develop a deep brown and shiny crust, and will sound hollow when tapped on the underside. Cool on a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1649,&quot;Parmesan Kale Chips 1 large bunch flat-leaf kale Good olive oil Kosher salt Freshly grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Working quickly, add the white wine and mussels and cover the pan. Check mussels after 1 minute to see if they have opened, then cover and continue to cook for another minute if not. Uncover and add Cioppino. Cook until sauce is warm through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl, topped with Crab Cake and garnished with parsley. Heat an 8- to 10-quart stockpot over medium heat; add the oil. Add the carrot, celery and onion and stir to coat in oil. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are cooked through but not falling apart, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic puree, oregano, cl flakes, fennel seed, marjoram and thyme, and stir to coat; cook for 2 minutes. Turn the heat up to medium-high, then add clam broth, diced tomato, tomato sauce, tomato paste, red wine, basil, sugar, red wine vinegar, anchovy paste, lemon juice and bay leaves. Stir well to combine. Turn the heat down to low when it starts to bubble. Simmer, stirring occasionally so the bottom of the stockpot does not scorch, for 2 hours. Can be served immediately, or cooled completely and refrigerated to use within 3 days or frozen up to 3 months. Heat a large saute pan over medium heat; add the butter and onions. Sweat the onions until translucent in color and soft but not falling apart, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool. Meanwhile, combine the red pepper, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, hot sauce, eggs and the cooled onions in a large mixing bowl; stir to combine. Gently, working with your hands, mix in Dungeness crab and then 1/2 cup panko. Don&#39;t overwork the mixture; you want it to still have larger pieces of crab intact. Refrigerate 10 to 20 minutes. Portion the mixture into 3-ounce balls and roll them in a bowl containing the remaining 1 cup panko. Shape the cakes using either a 2-inch ring mold or by hand by sprinkling about 1 tablespoon panko onto a clean work surface and gently pressing the ball into a cake shape. Sprinkle a small amount of panko on top of the crab cake and gently press it into the cake. Press in the sides of the cake to repair any cracks or tears so it does not fall apart during the cooking process. (You can make the cakes up to 24 hours ahead of when you plan on cooking and serving. They hold well refrigerated in an airtight container with parchment paper in between them if you are going to stack them.) Deep fry crab cakes in canola oil at 350 degrees F until crispy and golden brown, about 2 minutes, or pan-fry in about 1/2 inch oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. You can also cook on a griddle or in a saute pan on medium to medium-high heat in about a teaspoon of cooking oil or butter each until a golden brown crust develops, 4 to 5 minutes per side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1655,&quot;Tuna Puttanesca Salt 1 pound penne pasta 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cans (about 5.5 to 6 ounces each) Italian tuna in oil or water, drained well 6 large cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes A generous handful black olives (Gaeta, kalamata or oil-cured), pitted and chopped 3 tablespoons capers, drained 1/3 cup white vermouth or 1/2 cup dry white wine - eyeball it 1 (28-ounce) can whole or diced tomatoes (recommended: San Marzano) A generous handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped 2 teaspoons lemon zest Fresh ground black pepper Crusty bread Instructions: Place a large pot of water over high heat and bring up to a boil. Salt the water and cook penne to al dente. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet with 3 turns of the pan extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, cook a minute or 2, then add tuna and break it up with your spoon.

Heat a few lugs of olive oil in a large casserole-type pan on a medium heat. Add the onions, carrot, leek, red pepper, yellow pepper and chiles, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes. Add the coriander (cilantro) stalks, cumin and paprika, and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring frequently until soft and delicious. Sometimes I like to add some honey and white wine vinegar at this point and let it cook for a couple of minutes. I find this adds a wonderful sheen and enhances the natural sweetness of the vegetables. While that&#39;s happening, shred the turkey meat off your carcass and roughly chop it. Add a good pinch of salt and pepper to the pan of vegetables, then add the turkey and take the pan off the heat. Add the tomatoes and chickpeas or butter beans and stir everything together. Pop it in the hot oven to blip away for 2 hours. Check on it after an hour, and add a splash of water if it looks a bit dry. For the guacamole: While that&#39;s cooking, make your guacamole by blitzing one of your avocados in a food processor with the tomatoes, onion, garlic, cl and coriander (cilantro). Use a fork to mash the other avocado in a bowl so it&#39;s nice and chunky. Taste the mixture in the food processor and add salt and squeezes of lime juice until the taste is just right for you. Whiz up one more time then tip into the bowl with your chunky avocado and mix together. Take the chilli out of the oven and scrape all the gnarly bits from the edge of the pan back into the chilli for added flavour. Squeeze in some lime juice, and stir through most of the coriander leaves. Have a taste to check the seasoning then serve with steamed basmati rice or tortillas, and a good dollop of sour cream and guacamole on top. Scatter over your remaining coriander leaves (cilantro) and some finely sliced fresh cl if you fancy then get everyone to tuck in.; &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Noir, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 1657,&quot;Egg Custard Tarts 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes, plus more for the pans 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 large egg<br> 2 tablespoons water<br> 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup water<br> 4 large eggs<br> 1/4 cup evaporated milk<br> 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Pinch of salt Instructions: Make the puff pastry: Cut the butter into 3/4 cup flour in a medium bowl with a fork, then knead with your hands until the dough comes together.

Heat a large saute pan over high heat. Add the grapeseed oil and then the eggplant, onions and garlic and saute until the eggplant and onions are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the salt, pepper and chili flakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the sauteed vegetables from the pan and let cool. Combine the cooled sauteed vegetables, white beans and parsley in a bowl and mix well. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse until the mixture is mostly pureed with some small chunks. Grind the oats in a spice grinder until a fine flour. Mix the oat flour into the pureed mixture. The mixture should hold together in a ball, if it is too wet add more oat flour. Form the mixture into 2 1/2- to 3-ounce balls and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until browned and hot in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. For the spaghetti squash: Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Drizzle the flesh with the grapeseed oil and season with the salt and pepper. Place the squash halves cut-side down in a casserole dish. Add 1/2 cup water to the dish and cover with foil. Bake until the flesh is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the squash from the oven and, while it is still hot, scoop the flesh out with a fork. Season with salt and pepper and hold for plating. For the tomato sauce: Combine the whole tomatoes, onion, basil, olive oil, garlic and oregano in a large pot. Puree with an immersion blender. Add the diced tomatoes and bring the sauce to a simmer over high heat. Stir in the tomato paste, season with the salt and pepper and simmer for 15 minutes. To plate: Strain the liquid off the spaghetti squash and divide the squash among 6 plates. For each plate, place 3 vegan meatballs on top of the spaghetti squash and top with 6 ounces of tomato sauce.

Add the shallot and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and cook until completely absorbed, 1 to 2 minutes more. Pour in the warm chicken broth, about 1/2 cup at a time; cook, stirring constantly and allowing all of the liquid to be absorbed before adding more, until the rice is just tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Transfer the risotto to a shallow bowl and refrigerate until completely cool, about 1 hour and up to 8 hours (cover with plastic wrap).<br> Stir 3 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs into the risotto until evenly combined. Form the mixture into 15 arancini (each about 3 tablespoons and 1 1/2 inches in diameter).

Put the bacon in a large high-sided skillet and cook over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve bacon in the pan. When the bacon is about halfway cooked, drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook about 4 minutes for fresh or according to the package instructions if using dried. Meanwhile, whisk the egg and yolks, 1 cup cheese and pepper together in a small bowl. When the pasta is ready, return the skillet with the bacon to medium heat. Using a ladle, slowly whisk about 1/2 cup pasta cooking water into the egg and cheese mixture until loosened. Reserve some additional cooking water. Drain the pasta and add it to the skillet. While tossing continually, slowly drizzle the egg mixture over the pasta until it is completely coated. Add more cooking water if pasta seems dry. Add the spinach leaves to the pan and toss until combined. Transfer the carbonara to a serving bowl and serve immediately with more cheese sprinkled over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 1673,&quot;Chocolate Mousse 6 ounces semisweet baking chocolate, chopped 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 large eggs, separated 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream, cold 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Whipped cream and chocolate shavings, for garnish Instructions: Put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl and place over a saucepan containing about 1-inch of barely simmering water (or use a double boiler). Stir with a wooden spoon until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool slightly. Then grab a whisk and beat the egg yolks into the chocolate, 1 at a time, beating until smooth after each addition. Set aside. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. In a chilled bowl, beat the heavy cream until it begins to thicken up. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and the vanilla and continue beating until the cream holds soft peaks. Now that you&#39;ve got the elements prepared, put it all together. Gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Then, fold in the whipped cream. Take care not over work the mousse or it will be heavy. Divide the mousse between 4 individual glasses, preferably Moroccan glasses. Cover and chill for several hours. Garnish with whipped cream and chocolate shavings before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Port, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 1674,&quot;Hummingbird Cupcakes 1 cup pecans, chopped 2 1/2 cups very ripe chopped bananas, (about 3 bananas) plus 1 firm banana, for garnish 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh pineapple 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3 large eggs, room temperature 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar, plus more for banana garnish 3/4 cup vegetable oil 2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cubed, at room temperature 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (about 1 lemon) 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 (12 capacity) standard cupcake pans with paper liners. Toss the pecans, banana pieces and pineapple with 1/2 cup flour in a small bowl. Set aside. Whisk the remaining 2 1/4 cups flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat the eggs and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until thick and light, about 5 minutes. While beating slowly, gradually add the oil to the egg mixture. Scatter the dry ingredients over the wet, and then gently fold them together to make a loose batter. Gently fold in the nut mixture. Scoop batter into cupcake tins until about 3/4 full. Bake until cupcakes are firm to the touch and a tester, inserted into the cupcakes, comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool cupcakes in pans on a rack; until cool enough to turn cupcakes out of pans. Cool completely on the rack. (For best flavor, wrap tightly and let cupcakes ripen overnight.) For frosting: Beat cream cheese and butter in a large bowl, with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy. Gradually beat in lemon zest and vanilla. Sift confectioners&#39; sugar over the cream cheese mixture, and beat until smooth. Refrigerate until just set, about 20 minutes. To finish the cupcakes, divide icing between the cupcakes, transfer icing to a big plastic bag or piping bag and snip the corner. Pipe a dollop of icing onto each cupcake and spread with the back of a spoon or an offset spatula to make large swoops. Thinly slice the remaining firm banana and place on a silicon mat-lined sheet tray. Sprinkle each banana lightly with granulated sugar and use a brulee torch on low to caramelize the sugar. (Alternatively, place the tray under a low broiler until sugar caramelizes. Use a small off-set spatula to transfer caramelized bananas to top each cupcake.)

Whisk to combine. Place the chicken thighs in a wide flat dish so they are in a single layer. Add the herb mixture. Massage the thighs to coat with the herb mixture. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Note: If doing a quick marinade, leave the chicken out of the fridge for up to 1 hour. Preheat grill. Brush and oil the grill to clean. Remove the chicken from the marinade and brush off any excess herbs and oil. Season the chicken generously with salt and drizzle with a little bit of fresh olive oil. Cut the 2 whole lemons in half and cut the tips off the ends; this will allow the lemons to stand up without rolling around. Place the chicken, skin side down, on the preheated grill. Place the lemons, flesh side down, on the preheated grill. Grill the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes and then rotate the chicken 90 degrees to create the lovely crosshatch pattern. Grill the chicken for another 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the chicken over and grill for another 4 to 5 minutes. Check for doneness (the chicken should be well cooked). Check the lemon halves to see if they are beautifully caramelized. Turn over to grill on the bottom for 2 to 3 minutes. Serve the chicken with grilled lemon. Call yourself a superstar!

Line a 10 1/2-by-15 1/2-inch baking sheet with parchment paper so it fits the bottom snuggly. Butter and flour the parchment and the sides of the baking sheet. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, pepper, allspice and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and set aside. Beat the egg yolks and 3/4 cup granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is thick and falls into heavy ribbons when the beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes. Beat in the melted butter, molasses and vanilla. Sift the spiced flour mixture into the egg yolk mixture and use a rubber spatula to gently fold together until just incorporated. Rinse the egg beaters and beat the egg whites and remaining pinch salt with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until frothy. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and continue to beat until soft peaks form. Fold one-third of the whipped egg whites into the cake batter to loosen it up a bit. Then gently fold in the remaining whipped egg whites until just combined. Pour the cake batter into the prepared baking sheet and spread it out in an even layer. Bake until the middle of the cake springs back when pressed, 12 to 15 minutes. To roll up or train the cake: While the cake is still hot, use a knife to cut around the sides of the baking sheet to release the cake. Dust the cake with confectioners&#39; sugar. Spread a large clean kitchen towel (preferably not terrycloth or microfiber) over the top of the cake. Quickly invert the baking sheet onto the towel. Tap the bottom of the baking sheet and slowly lift up; the cake should release and be positioned squarely on the towel. Carefully peel away the parchment paper, making sure not to tear the cake. Trim away any rough edges if desired. Then, while the cake is still warm and starting at the long side of the cake, roll it up into a tight log, taking the towel with it. Let the cake cool completely, rolled up just like this, about 30 minutes. For the filling: Beat the cream cheese and butter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a medium bowl until smooth. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, lemon juice, vanilla and salt and beat until thick and smooth. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the filling. To fill and roll the cake: Unroll the cooled cake and spread the filling over the top in an even layer. Then roll the cake back up (without the towel this time) and put it seam-side down on a serving platter. Dip each gum drop in some of the reserved filling and evenly space them down the center of the roulade. Dust the cake with more confectioners&#39; sugar. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1692,&quot;Peach-Cherry Galette 1 ( 9-inch) refrigerated pie crust 3 large ripe peaches, peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced or an equal amount of frozen, thawed sliced peaches 1/3 cup dried sweet cherries (sold in the produce aisle) 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Lay the bacon out on parchment lined, rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle each slice with a thin, even layer of brown sugar. Bake until the bacon is beginning to brown and crisp, but is not completely done, about 8 to 10 minutes. It will continue to cook with the hot browns. Remove from oven and set aside. Toast the bread in a toaster, until lightly browned. Cut each piece of toast diagonally into triangles and overlap 3 triangles into each of 4 individual oval-shaped baking dishes. Alternatively, hot browns can be assembled and baked on ovenproof dinner plates. Mornay Sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and cook until the bubbling begins to diminish, indicating that the water in the butter is evaporating. Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon to form a roux, cooking and stirring constantly for 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to let the roux brown. Add the milk all at once, and continue to stir with a wooden spoon or whisk, while bringing mixture to a simmer. Continue to cook until smooth and thick, using a whisk to break up any lumps that form. Turn off the heat and add the Cheddar and Swiss cheeses, stirring until melted and combined. The cheese will thicken the sauce, so additional milk may be added, if desired. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cover the toast in each baking dish with about 1/4 cup of sauce. Then top with a layer of roasted turkey. Cover the turkey with additional sauce and put 2 strips of the bacon on top in a crisscross fashion. Sprinkle each dish with about 1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan and bake until bubbly, about 10 minutes. While the hot browns are baking, combine all the ingredients for dressed tomatoes in a medium-size bowl and toss to combine. During the last 2 to 3 minutes of baking, turn on the broiler to brown the tops of the hot browns. Remove from oven and serve hot, with a small dish of tomatoes on the side or piled atop the hot browns, if desired. A viewer, who may not be a professional cook, provided this recipe.

Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Melt the butter over medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally. Continue to cook until the butter browns and gets a nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until light and pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the sugar while beating. Then slowly add the butter and vanilla until evenly mixed, about 30 seconds more. Add the peanut butter and mix until combined. While mixing slowly, add the dry ingredients to the wet, in 2 additions, mixing just until absorbed. Fold in the peanuts and chocolate pieces. Divide the dough evenly into thirds, and put each portion in the center of a baking sheet. Shape the dough with slightly wet hands into logs about 2-inches wide and 15 inches long. Bake until set and brown around the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes. (For even baking take care to rotate the pans-- top to bottom and front to back--about half way though.) Cool logs on the baking sheets for about 10 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Carefully transfer the logs to a cutting board. Cut logs crosswise, with a long serrated knife at about a 45 degree angle, into 1/2-inch thick cookies. Place cookies cut side down on the baking sheets. Bake until crisp, about 8 minutes. Flip the cookies over and bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes more. Cool biscotti on the baking sheets. Serve. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1715,&quot;Pork Scallopini with Spaghetti Squash 1 spaghetti squash (about 3 pounds) 8 pork scallopini or thin cutlets (about 1 1/4 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon capers, drained 1/2 cup dry white wine Juice of 1 lemon 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley and/or chives 1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.

The best advice I can give you is about flavoring them. A few smashed garlic cloves, a woody herb like rosemary, thyme, sage or bay, and a splash of vinegar, or squeezed lemon or orange juice, can accentuate their natural flavor. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put the carrots into a large pot and the beets into another, and add enough water to cover them. Season with salt and bring to a boil. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes until just tender, then drain and place in separate bowls. Peel the beets, and cut any larger carrots and beets in half or into quarters. Smaller ones can stay whole. Now add the flavorings while the vegetables are still hot. Toss the carrots with half the smashed garlic and a glug of olive oil, then lightly season. Add the orange juice and the thyme leaves and toss again. Mix the beets with the rest of the garlic, the rosemary, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper. You can now put the vegetables either into separate ovenproof dishes, or together on a large roasting pan with the carrots in 1 half of the pan and the beets in the other. Place in the middle of the preheated oven and roast for around 1/2 hour or until golden. While the carrots and beets are cooking, lay the chops on a board and score through the skin and the streaky-looking part of the meat. This will give you lovely crackling. Firmly press a sage leaf onto the eye meat on both sides of each chop. Season with salt and pepper. When the vegetables start to color, heat a large ovenproof frying pan or small roasting pan on the burner, add a good glug of olive oil and put in the chops. As soon as you&#39;ve got nice color on 1 side, turn the chops over and place the pan in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the chops are crisp on the outside and just cooked through and juicy in the middle. Remove the chops to a warmed plate. Pour most of the fat out of the pan and add a squeeze of lemon juice to it. Stir and scrape the lovely sticky bits off the bottom and drizzle all over the chops. Remove the carrots and beets from the oven - they should be nice and sticky by now. Serve them with the chops and a glass of wine. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Preheat your smoker or grill to 275 degrees F. If using a charcoal or gas grill, prepare for two-zone cooking with heat or coals on one side of the grill and none on the other. If using a gas grill, prepare your smoking pouches by tearing off 2 large pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil and layering them flat on your work surface. Place two cups of dry wood chips on the center of your foil. Fold up each long side and crimp to secure. Then roll up the ends to make a sealed wood chip pouch. Poke holes in the top of your pouch to allow the heat from the fire to singe the wood chips inside the pouch and make some gorgeous smoke that will be released through the holes and add a delicious smoke flavor to your food. Repeat this process so you have a total of 3 pouches. Combine the softened butter and the BBQ seasoning in a small bowl. Use your fingers to loosen the skin of the chicken and spread the seasoned butter up under the skin. Spread any remaining butter on top of the chicken skin. Use butcher twine to tie the legs together and tuck the wing tips behind the shoulder joint. Place your chicken directly on the grill grates over indirect heat on your smoker or grill. Add the wood of your choice; I recommend apple, cherry, maple, or pecan. If using a grill, place the smoking pouch on the direct heat. Close the lid and smoke for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, replacing the smoking pouch as necessary. Breasts should be about 160 to 165 degrees F. The thighs should be about 170 to 175 degrees F. If needed, rotate the chicken once during smoking. While your chicken is smoking, prepare your BBQ sauce. Combine the ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, honey, salt, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and allow to cool. Baste the chicken with the honey BBQ sauce during the last 30 minutes of cooking (this is optional). Once the chicken has reached the correct internal temperature, remove it from the grill, rest for 10 minutes, slice, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 1745,&quot;New England Lobster Roll 1 pound lobster meat, drained 1/2 cup finely diced celery 1/2 lemon, juiced 3/4 cup mayonnaise 1/2 teaspoon white pepper 4 hot dog buns, toasted Instructions: Toss all ingredients, except buns, lightly until mixed.

Halve the squash, leaving the skin on, and scoop out the seeds, then cut into 1-inch cubes; you don&#39;t need to be precise just keep the pieces uniformly small. Put into a roasting tin with the oil and strip about 4 stalks thyme of their leaves, sprinkling over the butternut squash. If you can&#39;t get any fresh thyme, sprinkle over dried. Roast in the oven for about 30 to 45 minutes or until tender. Once out of the oven, remove the squash to a bowl and scatter over the pecans and crumble over the cheese tossing everything together gently. Check the seasoning and add the last couple of stalks of thyme torn into small sprigs to decorate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1747,&quot;Coconut Cheesecake Thumbprints 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon finely grated lime zest 1 large egg yolk 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon coconut extract 3/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut 2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons sour cream 1/2 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon coconut extract Instructions: Make the cookies: Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, cream cheese, granulated sugar and lime zest in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg yolk and both extracts and mix until combined. Reduce the speed to low. Beat in the flour mixture in 2 batches until just combined. Chill until firm, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the filling: Whisk the cream cheese, sour cream, confectioners\u2019 sugar and both extracts in a medium bowl until smooth (the mixture will be stiff but will loosen as you whisk). Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350? F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the shredded coconut in a small bowl, breaking up any large clumps. Scoop heaping tablespoons of dough about 1 1/2 inches apart onto the baking sheets. Roll each into a ball and dip the top half in the coconut to generously coat. Make a deep indentation in the center of each ball using a 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon. Fill with the cream cheese filling. Bake, rotating and switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are golden on the bottom and some coconut has browned on top, 14 to 16 minutes. Let cool 2 minutes on the pans, then transfer the cookies to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 1748,&quot;Buchanan&#39;s Negra 1.5 oz.

Melt butter in large saute pan. Add quail and saute on both sides. Carefully add brandy and flame. Let flame die down and flip the quail in the brandy. Remove quail and place in a small oven-proof pan. Roast for 8 minutes, until internal temperature of quail is 150 degrees F. While the quail are roasting, add the drained dried cherries to the pan along with the cherry juice, sugar and thyme. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the arrowroot mixture and simmer until thickened. Arrowroot will produce a clearer sauce than cornstarch although both will work well. Return quail to the sauce mixture and simmer for 1 minute. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 1756,&quot;Pork Chops with Molasses Glazed Apples 4 double cut pork chops (ask your butcher) 4 cups Pork Brine, recipe follows Salt and pepper Salt and Pepper 2 tablespoons butter 2 Granny Smith apples, sliced thin 1/4 cup molasses 1/4 cup cider vinegar 4 ounces sugar 1/4 cup molasses 2 ounces kosher salt 2 quarts water 1/4 cinnamon stick 1/2 tablespoon coriander 1/2 tablespoon whole black pepper 2 garlic cloves, smashed 2 whole cloves Instructions: Place the pork chops in a glass or ceramic baking dish that will hold them comfortably in a single layer.

Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal and set aside. Cut a piece of the dough off the ball and shape into a rectangle about the size of a deck of cards. Cover the remaining dough with plastic wrap until you are ready to use it. Roll the rectangle of dough through the widest setting of the pasta machine a few times until it is smooth. Then roll it through the remaining settings to the thinnest setting. Sprinkle the sheet lightly with cornmeal, gently fold, place on the cornmeal-lined baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Continue rolling out the rest of the pasta. Next, in a medium bowl mix together the drained creamed corn, mascarpone cheese, goat cheese, tarragon, and pepper. Stir to combine and set aside. In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water and set aside. To form the tortelli, place a sheet of pasta on a dry work surface. Using a pastry brush dipped in the egg wash, brush the entire sheet of fresh pasta. Place rounded teaspoons (about 1 ounce) of the corn filling on the pasta sheet, about 2 inches apart. Carefully place another sheet of pasta over the mounds, smoothing out any air pockets and firmly sealing the pasta around the filling. Using a scalloped pasta cutter (or a sharp knife) cut the pasta into small squares. Transfer the Tortelli to the cornmeal-lined baking sheet. Continue forming the remaining tortelli. To make the Tarragon Butter: In a medium bowl, gently mix together all the ingredients. To serve, place the Tarragon Butter in a large serving bowl. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until they float, about 2 minutes. Drain pasta, using a large mesh strainer or slotted spoon, into the bowl with the Tarragon Butter. Toss to coat. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve immediately. Place the flour in a food processor. In a small bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Add the salt and olive oil to the eggs and stir to combine. Add the egg mixture to the food processor. Pulse to combine the ingredients, scraping down the sides once or twice. Continue, with the machine running, until the liquid is evenly distributed, about 1 minute. The dough should stick together if pinched between your fingers. The dough will be cornmeal-yellow in color. Some of the dough will be sticking together, but it will not form a single ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Press the dough into a ball and knead gently until the dough is smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Roll out the dough to your desired shape. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1774,&quot;Cinnamon Sugar Fry Bread 2 cups canola oil 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1/2 cup sugar 2 packages pizza dough, 8 to 10 ounces 1/2 cup fruit preserves, for dipping Instructions: In a large saute pan add about 1-inch of oil and heat to 350 degrees F.

Heat about 1/4 cup EVOO in a small skillet with the butter. When the butter foams, add the garlic and stir 1 minute. Add the breadcrumbs and stir to soak in the oil and butter. Toast until light golden, then remove from the heat and cool. Mix the cooled breadcrumbs with the cheese and parsley. Trim the tops off 6 peppers and reserve, then scoop out the seeds. Using a small, sharp paring knife, cut out a jack-o&#39;-lantern face in each pepper. Set the peppers upright, and if a pepper is very unstable, trim the bottom to make the pepper stable. Season the peppers on the inside with salt and pepper, invert the peppers and place on a baking sheet, tops alongside. Seed and chop the remaining bell pepper and reserve. Salt the eggplant and drain 15 minutes in a strainer or on a towel. Spray the peppers with a little cooking spray and roast to char the peppers at the edges and tender-crisp doneness, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to handle. Heat the remaining EVOO in a large, deep skillet. Add the reserved peppers, thyme, cl, eggplant, onions and zucchini, and some salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the tomatoes, stir another minute, and remove from the heat. Combine the breadcrumbs with the vegetables and taste to check seasoning. Pour the tomato sauce into a casserole dish. Stuff the peppers, overstuffing the cavity a bit, and set the tops in place to complete the Jack-o-Peppers. Place the peppers into the dish as you fill them. Cool and store for a make-ahead meal. To serve, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and roast until the peppers are hot through, 30 to 35 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 1776,&quot;Warm Fish Tacos 8 to 12 ounces tilapia or Dover sole Kosher salt and ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 package 6-inch flour tortillas Prepared guacamole Diced tomato Diced red onion Chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper.

Heat olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. When hot, sear fish skin side down. Saute for a couple of minutes, add some whole butter to pan and place in 500 degrees oven to finish, don&#39;t turn fish onto flesh side. This process should take 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Make sure the pan is oven proof, if not transfer fish to a baking sheet. For the asparagus, break them near the bottom at the natural breaking point. Add to heavily salted boiling water and cook until tender, drain and finish in a saute pan with whole butter. For the beurre blanc, place the shallots and white wine in saucepan and sweat the shallots. Add the butter a little at a time whisking constantly. When all of the butter is incorporated, whisk in the heavy cream. Finish with sweet port. Place the black bass in the middle of the plate, mound the asparagus on top of the fish, nap with beurre blanc, and garnish with chervil and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1780,&quot;Shakshuka 2 red bell peppers 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3 tablespoons Urfa Biber Harissa, recipe follows 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar 2 teaspoons Quick Preserved Lemons, mashed, recipe follows 2 pounds beefsteak tomatoes, halved and seeded 6 large eggs Chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnishing 2 tablespoons cumin seed 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon caraway seeds<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 8 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced<br> 1 medium onion, diced<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup urfa biber (aka urfa pepper)<br> 3 tablespoons tomato paste<br> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br> 4 lemons, scrubbed and dried, plus the juice of 1 lemon, if necessary 40 grams kosher salt Instructions: Position an oven rack 5-inches from the top of oven and set the broiler to high. Cut the peppers in half lengthwise, discard the seeds, and place cut-side down on a sheet pan. Broil until the skins are completely charred, about 10 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. (Or char the peppers over gas burners, turning often.) Transfer the peppers to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow then to steam for 15 minutes, then rub the skins off under running water. Drain and roughly chop into half-inch squares. Place a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the oil and heat until shimmering, or until it reaches 335 to 350 degrees F. Stir in the garlic and salt and cook until the garlic begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add the harissa, brown sugar and preserved lemons and cook, stirring vigorously, for 30 seconds. Follow with the peppers, then grate the tomatoes directly into the pan using the large holes of a box grater, discarding the remaining pieces of skin. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a small pot of water to a boil and prepare an ice bath in a large bowl. Carefully lower the eggs (in their shells) into the boiling water and cook for 1 minute then dunk in the ice bath for 30 seconds. Remove to a dish towel. Create 6 divots in the stew with the back of a large spoon or ladle, making them deep enough to hold the eggs without pushing through to the bottom of the pan. Crack the par-cooked eggs into the divots. (I usually break them one by one into a custard cup to protect the yolk.) Cook over medium-low heat until the whites are just set but the yolks are still runny, about 12 minutes. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately. Toast the cumin, coriander and caraway in a dry cast-iron skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in the olive oil, garlic, onion and salt. Cook until the garlic begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the urfa biber and tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Add the red wine vinegar and cook 2 minutes more. Transfer the mixture to a food processor fitted with a standard S-blade and process until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Store in a tightly sealed glass container in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.<br> Trim the ends off the lemons. Slice each lemon into 8 wedges, removing any seeds as you go. Reserve as much of the juice as possible. Layer the lemon wedges in a wide-mouthed 16-ounce canning jar, covering each layer with salt. Pack the jar as tightly as possible, pressing down to release the lemons&#39; juice as you go and leaving about 1/4 inch of headspace in the jar. Cover the wedges with the reserved lemon juice from the cutting board and the ends. If your lemons do not release a significant amount of juice, top off the jar with the juice of another lemon. Stash in the refrigerator for 4 days, then flip the jar over and age another 4 days before sampling. The peel should be nice and soft. Rinse before using. Expect peak flavor and texture after about a month. As long as they&#39;re kept refrigerated, preserved lemons should keep indefinitely. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barolo]&quot; 1781,&quot;Italian Egg and Pasta Scramble 1/2 cup orzo pasta 10 large eggs 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 ounces smoked mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves 1 tablespoon butter 4 ounces pancetta, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup chopped onion 8 thin asparagus stalks, trimmed, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces Instructions: Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil.

Add all the chopped vegetables and garlic cloves over and around the lamb. Pour in 4 of the 6 bottles of stout beer, then add enough water just to cover the lamb. Turn the slow cooker on high, cover, and cook for 4 to 5 hours, or until the lamb easily shreds from the bone. While the lamb is braising, combine the mayonnaise and teriyaki in a small mixing bowl and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. When the lamb is within 1/2 hour or so of being done, start reducing the other 2 bottles of stout in a small pot or saucepan on medium to high heat, allowing the beer to reduce by 1/2. When fully reduced, add the sugar and stir. Taste your reduction; depending on your favorite stout you may need to adjust the amount of sugar to counteract the bitterness of the beer. When seasoned to your liking, turn the heat down to low and cover. When your lamb is ready (the meat is tender and shreds easily), remove the leg from the slow cooker and place in a baking pan. Allow the lamb to rest and cool while transferring your braising liquid from the slow cooker into a large pot. Be sure to pour the liquid through a strainer to remove the cooked vegetables. Discard the vegetables and skim clear the fat and oil from the top of the braising liquid. Put over medium-high heat and reduce by 1/4. When reduced, add the au jus mix, to taste. Stir thoroughly and place over medium heat. The first step of shredding your lamb is removing the three main bones (while shredding, wear gloves and have a bowl of ice water to cool your hands as the meat will still be very hot). Next, remove all non-edible connective tissue and cartilage. As you begin shredding the meat you will be able to identify what is good meat and what isn&#39;t. After discarding the bad from the good, you are ready to shred the rest of the meat. Place 6 to7 ounces of shredded lamb per serving in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add a small ladle, or about 1/4 cup, of the stout reduction to the pan and cover. When the lamb comes back up to temperature, stir, then top with some shredded cheese and cover to melt. Toast your hoagie rolls to your liking and spread the teriyaki mayo on the rolls. Place the lamb on a hoagie. Cut in half and serve with the au jus and your favorite side. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 1785,&quot;Coconut Tofu with Snap Pea Salad 1 14-ounce block extra-firm tofu, drained Kosher salt 1/3 cup instant flour (such as Wondra) 2 large eggs 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus a pinch 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup rice vinegar 12 ounces sugar snap peas (about 3 cups) 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro 3 tablespoons apricot preserves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with foil. Slice the tofu from a short side into 1/2-inch-thick sticks. Press the tofu pieces gently between paper towels to remove the excess water, then season generously with salt. Place the flour in a shallow baking dish. Whisk the eggs and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes in another shallow dish. Pulse the coconut and panko in a food processor until roughly chopped; transfer to a third shallow dish and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Dip the tofu pieces in the flour, shaking off any excess, then dip in the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off, and press in the coconut mixture to coat. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until the tofu is golden brown, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk 2 tablespoons vinegar with the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl. Trim the snap peas and halve crosswise, adding them to the dressing as you go. Add the cilantro, season with salt and toss. In a small bowl, whisk the apricot preserves, 3 tablespoons water, the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar and a pinch each of red pepper flakes and salt.

Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Dry the entire tenderloin with paper towels and brush it all over (top and bottom) with the butter. Sprinkle it all over with 4 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of pepper. It will seem like a lot but trust me, it&#39;s important. Place the filet on the sheet pan and roast it for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the end of the beef registers 130 degrees F for medium rare. Remove from the oven, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Discard the foil and allow to sit at room temperature. Meanwhile, place the shallots, 3 tablespoons of tarragon, the wine, and vinegar in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 5 minutes, until only 1 tablespoon of liquid remains. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes. Place the egg yolks, lemon juice, mustard, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process for 10 seconds. With the processor running, slowly pour the vegetable oil and olive oil through the feed tube to make a thick emulsion. Add the shallot reduction and the remaining tablespoon of tarragon leaves and pulse to combine. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Slice the filet of beef between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thick, sprinkle with salt, and serve warm, at room temperature, or cold with the barnaise mayonnaise on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 1795,&quot;Ham and Eggs with Greens 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar 1 teaspoon dijon mustard Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 7-ounce boneless ham steaks, halved and patted dry 8 large eggs 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 5-ounce package mesclun greens (about 8 cups) 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 1 small baguette, halved, split and toasted Instructions: Whisk the vinegar, mustard and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a large bowl.

Cook until the onions and garlic become translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the vinegar, sugar, cloves and cinnamon stick. Stir to blend and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes to let the vinegar mellow. Add the raisins, apricots, figs, cognac and 1 cup water and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool. For the black beans: Meanwhile, heat a large saute pan over medium heat and add the onions, oil and a generous pinch of salt. Add the sugar and cook until the onions are caramelized and tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and beans and cook so the ingredients meld together, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside. For the spicy pork burgers: Break up the meat in a medium bowl and spread it up on the sides so that the seasoning can really permeate the meat. Add the sherry, soy sauce, Worcestershire and cayenne. Mix with your hands to make sure all of the flavors get integrated but do not overmix. (The more you work the meat, the tougher the burger.) Form the meat into 4 even patties about 3/4-inch thick. Heat a large cast-iron skillet and add the oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, remove the skillet from the heat and arrange the patties in a single layer in the skillet. Return the skillet to the heat and cook, undisturbed, for 5 to 6 minutes. Rotate the patties a quarter turn and cook until cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes. Use a metal spatula to flip the patties on their second sides and cook for an additional 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and place 2 slices of American cheese on each patty. Let the patties rest in the skillet so the cheese melts. Arrange the roll bottoms on a work surface and top with lettuce. Top the lettuce with the patties, spoon some of the chutney and black beans on each and finish with the roll tops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 1819,&quot;Mamie&#39;s Teacakes Vegetable shortening, for greasing cookie sheets 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter, room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar, plus more for sprinkling 2 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/4 cup sour cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

(an extra bulb for the mashers) 1/4 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon sea salt 3 cups fresh spinach 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, diced 1 pound fresh brie cheese 1/4 cup fresh rosemary, minced Instructions: Marinate the steaks overnight in olive oil, sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. You can utilize any fresh herbs you have in your garden or local market such as rosemary. Take the steaks out and let them rest about an hour before you start to work with them. In the meantime, fire up the oven to 350 degrees F. Take your garlic bulbs and slice them in half diagonally. Season with olive oil and sea salt. Roast on a pan in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the garlic is nice and golden brown and your house smells heavenly. Take out and set aside. Heat your saute pan with some olive oil and throw in about 6 cloves of fresh chopped garlic when hot. Add spinach and saute until spinach is just wilted. Season with salt and pepper. Chop up the sun-dried tomatoes and toss with the spinach. When the spinach has cooled, throw in the brie and the roasted garlic. You can easily pull the roasted garlic from the &#39;husk&#39; by using a toothpick to pull it out. Mix together very well! Season with salt and pepper. You can also throw in a teaspoon or so of fresh rosemary at this point. Set aside. Take your steaks and cut a slit into the side of them, just as you would with stuffing pork chops. Carefully stuff the steaks with your roasted garlic stuffing. Throw those guys on the BBQ for about 3-4 minutes per side pending your guests preference. I serve these steaks over garlic mashers which I usually just throw in an extra bulb of garlic to roast when making the stuffing and mash it all up with some fresh potatoes, butter and cream. A little parsley to garnish. For the sauce, take 4 tablespoons of butter and melt in a saucepan over low heat. Add about 6 cloves of fresh chopped garlic, 1/4 cup of cream and 4 tablespoons of good quality balsamic vinegar. Throw in a sprig of fresh rosemary and reduce the sauce by about 1/3. Take out the rosemary. To plate, place lean against a heap of the garlic mashers and drizzle the sauce around the plate and over the potatoes. Garnish with fresh rosemary. It is excellent to have a nice fresh loaf of bread to serve with this. I also BBQ up some fresh local corn on the grill to accompany this meal. It is a fairly easy and gourmet meal to prepare. You can even make the stuffing the night before. Enjoy!

Using a large spoon or ladle, randomly drizzle white and bittersweet chocolate onto the plastic. Using an offset spatula, spread the two drizzled chocolates evenly, creating a marbled effect. You can make the base whatever size and shape you&#39;d like it to be, however make sure it is at least 1/4-inch thick. Place in the refrigerator. For the Fish Mold: If you would like your chocolate fish to be painted on the outside, start by mixing together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food coloring, making as many colors as you&#39;d like. (Please note: The easiest way to work with chocolate paints is to store them in a yogurt machine to keep them warm.) Using a paintbrush, paint the inside of the mold, applying color wherever you are inspired to do so (eyes, fins, etc.) and let dry. Using a ladle, fill the fish mold or shell with white chocolate. When it is full, empty the excess chocolate back into the bowl. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the mold clean, and place it upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip clean again with a paring knife. This is very important because once the chocolate sets, it will shrink or retract from the sides of the mold, and a clean edge will prevent it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Once the chocolate has hardened, remove it from the mold, glue the two halves together with chocolate and let harden. Repeat with as many fish molds or shells as you like. For the Seaweed and Sea Grass: Make 2 cornets and fill 1 with bittersweet chocolate and the other with white chocolate. Draw some seaweed onto parchment paper using bittersweet chocolate then repeat the same technique with the white chocolate, painting over the bittersweet. Use this same technique to draw sea grass. When the chocolate sets, peel off the parchment paper, and reserve for assembly. For the Coral: Place large ice cubes in a tall, round plastic container. Pour the untempered bittersweet chocolate over the cubes and let set until the cubes have completely melted. Remove the chocolate from the container, drain off, and discard the excess water. For the Final Seascape: Arrange the pieces as you would like on the bubble wrap base and \glue\ them down using the melted chocolate. If you place all of the pieces in the refrigerator first, the sculpture will set faster, as the cold chocolate will cause the \glue\ to harden and set quickly. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. How to Make a Cornet (From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations. Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of one hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the two corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be one point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 1836,&quot;Veg-Sticks with Cheddar Ranch Dip 1 cup sour cream 1 cup cheese dip (recommended: Tostitos Salsa con Queso) 1 envelope (1 ounce) ranch dressing mix (recommended: Hidden Valley) 1 container (14 ounces) pre-cut carrot and celery sticks Instructions: In a medium mixing bowl mix the sour cream, cheese dip, and ranch dressing mix with a wooden spoon. Set aside. Place the veggie sticks on a serving plate in 2 piles. Place the dip in small serving bowl. Dip freely! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 1837,&quot;Burrata Ravioli with Fresh Tomato Sauce, Parmigiano and Basil Eight 6-by-6-inch sheets fresh pasta 1 large egg, beaten<br> 2 balls burrata, cut into 16 pieces total<br> 1 bunch fresh basil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1 1/2 cups San Marzano tomato sauce<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: Cut the pasta sheets into 3-by-3-inch squares. Brush one side of a pasta square with a small amount of egg, then place a piece of burrata in the center and top with a basil leaf. Season with salt and pepper, then top with one more pasta square to make a ravioli. Repeat to form a total of 16 ravioli for 3 portions. Allow the ravioli to set for 30 minutes in the fridge. In the meantime, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Bring the tomato sauce to a simmer in a separate saucepan. Add the ravioli to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the olive oil to the tomato sauce and stir together. Add the ravioli to the pan with the sauce and cook for 1 more minute, adding the butter at the same time. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the ravioli among 3 plates and garnish with extra basil and the Parmigiano-Reggiano. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 1838,&quot;Fried Meatball Sandwiches with Giardiniera 5 large eggs 1 1/2 cups grated Pecorino Romano 1 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3 pounds ground chuck 1 pound ground pork 1 pound ground veal (if you don&#39;t like veal, just use more beef) 1 cup panko breadcrumbs Olive oil, for frying 8 slices provolone 4 ciabatta buns, split One (32-ounce) jar your favorite marinara sauce, warmed 1 jar roasted red peppers, sliced into strips 1 cup Homemade Hot Giardiniera, roughly chopped (or store-bought) Instructions: For the meatballs: Preheat the oven to broil.<br> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, Romano, parsley, garlic, and some salt and pepper until it is all incorporated.<br> Add in the ground meats and breadcrumbs and, using your God-given hands, get after it and mix away. Do not overwork the meat or it will turn \meat-loafy.\ You want it loose and supple.<br> Using your hands again, make 4 loose patties to match the size of your bread. (The mixture will form at least 10 patties, depending on how big your buns are. But I like to make some patties for sandwiches and then roll the rest to make meatballs, which I then freeze so I have meatballs at the ready.)<br> Heat some oil in a large cast-iron pan (or use a griddle pan) over medium heat. In batches, fry the patties until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side.<br> For the sandwich build: Place the buns split-side up on a rimmed baking sheet. Add 1 slice of provolone to each side of the buns and broil in the oven until the cheese is brown and bubbly, 1 to 2 minutes, but keep watch! Add the patties to the bottom buns, spoon over some marinara, top with some red pepper strips and pile on some giardiniera. Then close the sandwiches and eat the hell out of them.<br> Serve with more marinara sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 1839,&quot;John Dory and Scampi Tails Carlina Style 2 (4 to 5-ounce) John Dory fillets 6 scampi tails, shells removed All-purpose flour 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper 3 tablespoons freshly made clarified butter 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh curly parsley leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped cucumber 1 tablespoon capers 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 4 tablespoons fresh tomato sauce Instructions: Rinse the fish fillets and scampi tails and then pat dry. Dredge the fish and scampi tails in flour on both sides. Heat olive oil in a medium non-stick pan over medium heat. Add fish and scampi to the pan and cook for about 2 or 3 minutes on each side (be careful not to break the fillets when flipping). Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to 2 dinner plates and keep warm. In a saute pan, heat the clarified butter over medium heat with the parsley until it is very hot. To serve, decorate the fish and the scampi with the chopped cucumber and capers. To each plate, add a few drops each of Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and tomato sauce. Pour the butter sauce over the fish and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1840,&quot;Cheech&#39;s Spring Medley Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette 1 pint strawberries, sliced 4 cups baby arugula 1/2 cup raisins 1/4 cup pine nuts 2 tablespoons kalamata olives, chopped in half 1 red onion, diced Fresh mint leaves, torn Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing, recipe follows Feta cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup raspberries<br> 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 1 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon sugar, optional Instructions: In a large bowl, add the strawberries, arugula, raisins, olives, pine nuts, red onions and mint. Top with Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing and feta cheese. Add the raspberries, oil, vinegar and sugar if using into a blender and blend until smooth.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 1841,&quot;Vegetarian Potato Salad 2 tablespoon red wine vinegar 5 tablespoons good quality olive oil 1 level teaspoon salt 1 level teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram 1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh basil 1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 2 tablespoons lemon juice 5 tablespoons good quality olive oil 1 level teaspoon salt 1 level teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Start with about 1pound of potatoes (it&#39;s important to use evenly sized new potatoes, and you can either scrape them or peel them). Cook the potatoes in boiling, salted water. Try to cook these perfectly so that they just fall off the blade of a knife when you stick it into the potato (you don&#39;t want the potatoes raw but you certainly don&#39;t want them falling apart either). As soon as the potatoes are cooked, drain them and put them into a bowl. It is very important to add your dressing at this stage, while the potatoes are still steaming hot (by allowing them to cool down in the dressing the flavors penetrate the potatoes). Here are 3 dressings that I like to use: Potato salad with salsa verde: All you do is dress the potatoes with 2 large tablespoonfuls of salsa verde. Potato Salad with olive oil, lemon and dill: Use olive oil and lemon juice dressing and add some roughly chopped fresh dill and a little salt and freshly ground black pepper. (Instead of dill you could try fresh mint, fresh parsley or fennel tops -- they&#39;ll all work). Potato salad with dandelion and shallot: Again, use olive oil and lemon juice dressing, add some thoroughly washed and roughly chopped dandelion leaves and some finely chopped shallot, and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix together all the ingredients, adding the shallots last. Yield: 4 servings Mix together all the ingredients. Yield: 4 servings MARJORAM AND BALSAMIC VINEGAR DRESSING: 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (just 1 tablespoon may be enough if it is a very good vinegar) 5 tablespoons good quality olive oil 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 heaping tablespoons chopped fresh marjoram Mix together all the ingredients. Yield: 4 servings &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1842,&quot;Pistachio Parmesan Crostini 1 loaf seeded sourdough baguette, sliced on the diagonal 1/2\ thick 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated 1/2 cup pistachios, shelled and finely chopped 2 teaspoons black pepper, freshly cracked 1/3 cup Good quality olive oil for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven on low broil. Have the rack about 8 inches from the broiling element. Slice the sourdough bread on the diagonal, about 1/2 inch thick slices. Lightly spread the pieces with the butter, then add the pistachios and the parmesan cheese, sprinkling evenly. Place under broiler and cook for 2 minutes, keeping a careful eye. When cheese just starts to melt and bread just starts to lightly tan, remove and crack the fresh pepper on top, then drizzle with the olive oil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 1843,&quot;Chicago-Style Italian Beef Sandwich 1 boneless beef chuck eye roast (about 3 1/2 pounds), tied with butcher&#39;s twine</li></ol></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/tablespoon onion powders powders.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/tablespoon%20onion%20powder.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>tablespoon onion powder</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/tablespoon%20toasted%20sesame%20oil.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>tablespoon toasted sesame oil</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
