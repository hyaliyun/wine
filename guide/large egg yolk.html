onions, sliced 3/4 pound smoked ham, cubed 8 large eggs 1 quart heavy cream Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> Kosher salt 2 pounds asparagus, trimmed 4 ounces parmesan cheese, shaved with a peeler 1 cup torn fresh parsley 1/2 cup torn fresh mint 1/2 cup torn fresh dill 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling Juice of 1/2 lemon Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Make the crust: Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a large bowl. Add the butter; mix with a pastry blender or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat the egg yolk and 3 tablespoons ice water in a small bowl; work into the dough until the dough holds together without being wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together: If it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Form into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 30 minutes.<br> Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 14-inch round. Carefully roll up the dough onto the rolling pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch springform pan. Press the dough firmly into the bottom and side; trim the excess. Put the pan on a sturdy baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to fill.<br> Prepare the filling: Put a skillet over medium-low heat and coat with the olive oil. Add the onions and slowly cook, stirring occasionally, until they caramelize, 40 to 45 minutes. (Add a couple of tablespoons of water to help the onions break down, if needed.) Toss in the ham and cook, stirring, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Whisk in the cream; season with salt and pepper. Arrange the onions and ham in the crust and carefully pour in the egg-cream mixture; the filling should be about 1/2 inch from the top. Cover loosely with foil and bake 1 hour, 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the quiche is set but jiggles slightly, about 30 more minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool 45 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, make the salad: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; blanch the asparagus until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, then drain. Slice into small pieces and put in a bowl; add the parmesan and herbs. Add the olive oil and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Toss gently to combine. Loosen the quiche from the pan with a thin metal spatula, then remove the ring. Transfer the quiche to a plate and cut into wedges. Drizzle with olive oil and season with pepper. Top with the salad.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66851,&quot;Eleuthera 1 (2 pound) pineapple, halved 3/8 cup plus 1 tablespoon cold water 2 limes, juiced 1/4 cup Kirsch 3 drops green food coloring 1/4 cup heavy cream, whipped 1/4-ounce packet of gelatin 1 banana, peeled and quartered lengthwise 1/8 cup flaked almonds 1 egg white 1/2 cup sugar 1/8 cup coconut flakes Instructions: Scoop out pineapple flesh and freeze shells. Discard core. Blend flesh with 1/4 cup water. Pour into saucepan and cook over medium heat. Add lime juice and bring to boil. Boil for 2 minutes. Combine gelatin and 1 tablespoon water. Dissolve this in pot with remaining water, over low heat. Add Kirsch and food coloring. Add to pineapple mixture and chill. Once cooled, beat in whipped cream. Chill again. Place two banana pieces in each pineapple shell. Sprinkle with almonds. Pour chilled mousse mixture over them. Place in refrigerator to set. Once mousse is set, preheat broiler and place rack 3 inches from heat. Beat egg white, gradually adding sugar until stiff. Place in piping bag and pipe decorative swirls on top of the mousse, covering it completely. Broil for 3 minutes. Remove and sprinkle with coconut. Broil again for another minute to toast. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 66852,&quot;Chicken and Chorizo Hash with OJ Gravy 8 ounces fresh Mexican chorizo sausage, casings removed 1 small green plantain, peeled, and diced<br> 2 medium carrots, halved lengthwise and sliced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped and chopped<br> 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced<br> 1 scallion, chopped (white and green parts)<br> 1 tablespoon chopped pickled jalapenos<br> 1/2 rotisserie chicken, skin removed, meat shredded or chopped<br> Chopped fresh flat leaf parsley, for garnish<br> For the gravy: 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 1/2 cups orange juice<br> 2 tablespoons sour cream<br> Instructions: To make the hash, put the chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat. Vigorously break up the sausage into bits with a potato masher or wooden spoon as it cooks. Once it resembles ground meat, add the plantain and carrots. Season with a tiny pinch of salt and some black pepper. Toss to coat everything in the fat and cook, without stirring, for a few minutes to develop color on the plantains and carrots, then toss and wait again. Cook this way until the plantains and carrots are caramelized on most sides and tender, and the chorizo is browned, about 15 minutes. Add the thyme, garlic, scallions, and jalapenos. Toss to coat and cook, stirring, until the garlic is tender and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and stir to coat. To make the gravy, sprinkle the flour over the top of the hash and stir with a wooden spoon until it disappears, then cook for a few more minutes to remove the flour taste. Add the Worcestershire sauce and orange juice. Continue to stir, allowing the juices to thicken. Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream. Garnish with the parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Barbera, Dolcetto]&quot; 66853,&quot;Stuffed Artichokes 1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons white vinegar 4 large artichokes 1 lemon, halved 1/2 cup onions, minced 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup zucchini, chopped 1 cup mushrooms, sliced 1 egg 1 cup mozzarella cheese, chopped Juice of one lemon 1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons Parmesan, grated 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic, minced 2 cups flavored bread crumbs Instructions: Put 2 cups of salted water and the vinegar in a large, stainless steel saucepan and bring to a boil. Slice 1-inch off the tops of the center cone of the artichokes and cut the stalks so they will sit flat. Trim the tips from the leaves and rub the surfaces with lemon. Put the artichokes in the water and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes. When the leaves pull off easily, put the artichokes on a rack; cool and drain them upside down. Remove the center leaves and the choke with a spoon and discard. Saute the onion in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, stirring until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes, then transfer to a bowl. Saute the zucchini in the remaining olive oil until lightly browned, add the mushrooms and cook for 2 more minutes, add to the onions. Mix the egg, mozzarella, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup of Parmesan. Add to the vegetable mixture, stir well. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan and add the garlic and the bread crumbs. Brown lightly. Remove from heat and stir in the vegetable-egg mixture. Stuff the center and the leaves of the artichokes with the mixture. Set the artichokes upright in a baking dish with the water below the first leaf, about 1 cup. Sprinkle the juice of one lemon and the remaining Parmesan over the artichokes. Bake them, covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover for the last few minutes to brown the cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 66854,&quot;Pasta Centerpiece 2 pounds angel hair pasta Olive oil, for the bowl and pasta 1/4 cup olive oil 4 cloves garlic, sliced 1/4 medium onion, diced<br> Three 28-ounce cans peeled whole tomatoes, roughly chopped<br> 3 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound ground beef 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup breadcrumbs 1/4 cup milk<br> 2 cloves garlic, grated 1 large egg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 ounces sliced prosciutto 2 balls burrata cheese Olive oil, for drizzling 1 large sprig fresh basil Instructions: For the pasta: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cook the pasta according to the package directions; drain. Spread out on a baking sheet and let cool until easy to handle, about 10 minutes.<br> Oil the inside of a 13-inch metal bowl with 1/4 cup olive oil. Put the pasta in the bowl and spread it evenly so that it goes all the way up the sides of the bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Oil the outside of an 11-inch metal bowl and place it inside the other bowl on top of the pasta, pressing down firmly to compact the pasta in the larger bowl.<br> Bake until the edges are golden, about 1 hour. Remove the smaller bowl and continue to bake until golden all over, about 1 hour more. Let cool for 5 minutes, then carefully transfer to a large rimmed serving platter.<br> For the marinara sauce: Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute the garlic and onion, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, thyme sprigs and basil and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Discard the thyme sprigs. Stir in 2 teaspoons salt and season with pepper.<br> For the meatballs: Combine the beef, Parmesan, breadcrumbs, milk, garlic, egg, 1 teaspoon salt and some pepper in a bowl.

Add the buttermilk, peanut oil, egg, and sugar. Mix well. Let the batter sit for 30 minutes before cooking the waffles. Preheat a waffle iron. Follow the directions on your waffle iron to cook the waffles accordingly- you will need at least 4 large size waffles to assemble the sandwiches. Once the waffles are golden, remove from the iron. Allow to cool and split them horizontally. Keep the waffles warm in a low oven, if necessary. Heat about 3-inches of peanut oil to 375 degrees F in a large enamel or cast iron Dutch oven. Place flour in a small bowl. In another bowl, mix panko and Cajun seasoning. In a third bowl, mix hot sauce, egg, and water. Remove the tough tendon from each tenderloin. Roll each tender in flour, then in egg mixture, then in panko mix. Fry immediately until the tenderloins are cooked through and golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside or keep warm in a low oven. In a medium bowl, mix mayonnaise, maple syrup, mustard powder, and horseradish. To assemble the sandwiches: Lay 1/2 of the waffle bottom on an ovenproof plate; top with the 3 chicken tenders, 3 slices of bacon, and 2 slices of Cheddar. Broil the sandwich for a few minutes until the cheese melts. Spread about 3 tablespoons of the maple mayonnaise on the top waffle, and place on the sandwich. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]</p><p>&quot; 66856,&quot;Mascarpone Chocolate Toffee Bars Vegetable cooking spray 1 pound refrigerated sugar cookie dough (recommended: Pillsbury) 2 (1.4-ounces) chocolate-toffee candy bars, coarsely chopped, divided (recommended: Skor) 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (recommended: Ghirardelli) 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1 cup (8 ounces) mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted * see Cook&#39;s Note Instructions: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 7 by 10 3/4-inch nonstick baking pan with vegetable cooking spray. Lay a 6 by 18-inch piece of parchment paper in the pan, allowing the excess paper to overhang the sides. Spray the parchment paper lightly with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, combine the cookie dough, 1/2 of the chopped chocolate-toffee candy pieces and vanilla extract. Using damp fingers, gently press the dough into the prepared pan. Using the tines of a fork, prick the dough all over. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes until the crust is lightly browned. Cool for 15 minutes. Place the chocolate chips and vegetable oil in a medium bowl. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir until the chocolate has melted. Cool the chocolate mixture for 10 minutes. Whisk in the mascarpone cheese until the mixture is smooth. Using a spatula, spread the chocolate mixture over the cooled crust. Sprinkle the remaining chocolate-toffee candy pieces and sliced almonds over the chocolate mixture. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours until the chocolate layer is firm. Peel off the parchment paper and cut into 1 1/2 by 2-inch bars.

First, not every balloon works. They don&#39;t always release. If you can find the strong punching bag type balloon, choose that one. Some people are allergic to latex so be aware that most balloons are made from latex. Inflate the balloon. Secure it closed with a ribbon (you will need to untie this later). Dip the bottom of the balloon in the dark chocolate. This will create a base. Set the wet chocolate onto a parchment paper-lined surface. Make sure it stands straight. Let the chocolate set until firm. Place dark chocolate in a cornet. The next step will be easier if you have an assistant. Have the assistant hold the balloon horizontally in front of you while you pipe chocolate lines from top to bottom all the way around the surface. When complete, drizzle more lines diagonally across the existing lines. Apply a bit more chocolate near the top opening and near the bottom to provide extra support. This will form a bird cage effect. Let the chocolate set. When the chocolate begins to harden, release a little bit of the air from the balloon, but just enough so the balloon retracts slightly (about 1/8-inch from the outside). Carefully set the chocolate covered balloon aside. Depending on your room temperature, it will take a good 10 minutes to set. To make the balloon flowers, inflate 10 small balloons and close them with ribbons. Your presentation will be more interesting if you inflate them to different degrees to make different sized flowers. Dip each balloon anywhere from 1 to 3 times to create a different number of petals on each. To accomplish this, dip the balloon once, spin it slightly, dip it again, etc. Set each dipped balloon on a parchment-lined sheet pan and allow the chocolate to set. When set, pop the balloon and remove the deflated balloon from the flower. Use cocoa butter paints to decorate the insides of the flowers. Let the paint set. If you made different sizes, you can layer the balloon flowers by setting one inside another. Use chocolate to \glue\ them together. Slowly deflate the large balloon that is inside the large chocolate cage by untying its ribbon. Carefully pull the deflated balloon through the hole at the top. Use tempered chocolate to \glue\ the chocolate flowers onto the large cage. Reserve one to cover the hole at the top. Your guests will certainly be fascinated by your creation. From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make at Home, by Jacques Torres How to Temper Chocolate: Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 66859,&quot;Fry Sauce 1/2 cup ketchup 1/2 cup mayonnaise Hot sauce, for spice, optional Instructions: Measure out the ketchup and mayonnaise into a bowl and mix together.

Puree until very smooth, about 5 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed. Spread the artichoke hummus layer in the bottom of the trifle bowl. Sprinkle with all but 2 tablespoons of the olives. Rinse out the food processor bowl and blade and wipe dry. Combine 1 container hummus with all but 2 tablespoons of the sun-dried tomatoes and 2 tablespoons water in the food processor. Puree until very smooth, about 5 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed. Drop dollops of the sun-dried tomato hummus over the olives, working around the outside first. Use a spatula to spread the mixture out to the side of the bowl, then spread the mixture towards the center. (This will keep the olives from being dragged around.) Sprinkle the layer with all but 1/4 cup of the cucumbers. Rinse out the food processor bowl and wipe dry. Combine the remaining container of hummus with all but 2 tablespoons of the basil in the food processor. Puree until very smooth, about 5 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed. Spread the basil hummus over the cucumber layer in the same manner as the previous layer. Sprinkle with all but 1/4 cup of the chickpeas. Spread the yogurt over the chickpea layer. Chop the remaining artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes and basil. Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the yogurt along with the olives, chickpeas and cucumbers. Serve with a large spoon and pita chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 66861,&quot;Smoky Yam Gratin 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 small onion, diced 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 smoky chipotles, minced 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 cup chicken stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds (about 5 to 7) yams (or sweet potatoes), peeled and cut into 1/4-inch disks 8 ounces smoked Gouda, grated 1/4 cup bread crumbs 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Butter a sheet pan. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the sugar, butter and shortening until fluffy. Add the egg, vanilla and baking powder and mix. Add the flour and mix. Shape the dough into a large flat disk, kneading briefly if necessary to bring the dough together. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill 1 to 2 hours. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough 1/4-inch thick. Using cookie cutters or empty tuna cans, cut out large round cookies about 3 inches in diameter. Transfer to the prepared pan. Cut a heart or circle out of the center of each cookie that will be filled later with lollipop syrup. Carefully slip the sucker sticks under the cookies and gently press dough down and around it to secure the stick. Bake until very light golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely on the sheet pan. Lollipop Centers: Combine sugar, glucose and water in a clean, dry, small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer and cook on high heat. While cooking the candy syrup, occasionally wash down the pan sides to prevent crystallization using a clean brush dipped in water. Without stirring, cook until mixture reaches 305 degrees F or hard crack on the candy thermometer. Remove the pot from the heat and dip it into an ice bath for 10 seconds to stop the cooking. Remove the pot from the ice bath and add food coloring, stirring well a wooden spoon so the color is evenly distributed. To avoid air bubbles, stir in both directions and be careful not to over mix. Pour the syrup into hole of the cookies. Cool at least 20 minutes to harden.

Cut the squash in quarters and remove the seeds. Brush the insides with a little oil and arrange them on a baking sheet, skin side up. Roast in the preheated oven until the squash is soft all the way through, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool. (This can be done 1 or 2 days ahead.) When the squash is cold, remove it from the skin and puree in a food processor. You&#39;ll need 2 1/2 cups of squash puree for this recipe. If the mixture is dry while pureeing, add a ladleful of the pudding mixture. Pudding: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the heavy cream, eggs, brown sugar, spices, and vanilla and mix well. Stir in the pumpkin puree. Combine the bread, raisins and ginger in the baking dish. Pour the pudding mixture over the bread to cover and let it sit for 15 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: You may not use all of the filling. Add more filling if there&#39;s room in the dish, once the bread has soaked. Bake in the preheated oven until the custard is set, about 20 to 25 minutes. It&#39;s fall in a dessert! To serve, spoon the pudding into bowls and sprinkle a dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 66886,&quot;Nutty Pasta 2 ounces almonds, shelled 2 ounces pine nuts 2 ounces pistachios, shelled 1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked 1 bunch fresh mint, leaves picked 12 ounces spaghetti Kosher salt Splash olive oil Parmesan cheese, for grating Zest of 1 orange, optional Instructions: Put the nuts and herbs in the food processor and whiz up. The mixture will be fine, but should still have texture, not be completely pulverized. Cook the spaghetti in boiling, salted water until al dente. Drain. Toss in a bowl with the nuts (reserving some for garnish), olive oil, cheese, and orange zest, to taste, if using.

Set a medium saute pan over medium to high heat and put in the lime juice. Heat for 1 minute. Add in the minced garlic and a dash of salt and pepper. Add in the shrimp and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Cook until the shrimp are no longer translucent and have turned a very faint pink/white color, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat. Put the shrimp in a small bowl with a couple of ice cubes. When the ice has melted, drain the shrimp and place back in the bowl. Put in the refrigerator to chill for 2 to 3 hours. (Alternatively, if you are in a hurry, put the shrimp in a small bowl, cover completely with ice cubes and add 1/2 cup water. Let the shrimp sit in the ice bath while you prep the rest of the recipe.) Chop the avocado and cucumber the same size as the shrimp for consistency and presentation. In a medium bowl, add the avocados, cucumbers, red onions, cilantro and serranos. Add the chilled shrimp and gently fold (stir) together the ingredients. Squeeze over the juice of 1/2 lime and add a dash of salt and 2 dashes pepper. Serve in chilled cocktail glasses, like martini glasses, or in wide-rim 8- to 9-ounce glasses or small glass/ceramic bowls. Place each glass on a nice plate, then arrange some tortilla chips around the glass. Garnish with a fresh lime wedge. Some people like to dash hot sauce over their shrimp as well. We like Tapatio or Tabasco. Fill a medium stockpot halfway with vegetable oil and heat over high heat until a drop of water added to the oil crackles and hisses back at you. Carefully add the tortilla chips in batches with tongs and fry until a golden color, 2 to 3 minutes. Use the tongs to transfer the chips to a large bowl. Sprinkle a few dashes of seasoning salt over the chips and toss (with tongs) while still hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 66888,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Brooklyn Iced Tea 6 ounces limoncello (recommended: Toschi Italian Lemon Liqueur) 3 ounces dark rum 3 ounces tequila 1 (24-ounce) bottle sweetened iced tea Ice Lemon slices, to garnish Instructions: Pour the limoncello, rum, tequila and tea into a pitcher filled with ice and stir vigorously.

Add the onion, garlic and zucchini and saute until the onion is soft, about 4 minutes. Add the kale and saute 1 minute. Add the vegetable broth, cover and cook until the kale is wilted, about 6 minutes. Uncover and simmer until almost all of the liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and cool slightly. Season with some salt and pepper. Stir in the cheese until melted. For the masa: Mix the masa and baking powder in large bowl. Add the vegetable shortening and mix using an electric mixer until it is the consistency of coarse meal. Pour in the vegetable broth and mix until the dough comes together (the dough should be moist). Mix in the salt and pepper by hand. To assemble the tamales: Place a corn husk, ridged-side down, flat on a work surface and spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of masa onto the corn husk. Then place a spoonful of the kale filling atop the masa. Fold the bigger sides in, and then the pointy tip up over the tamale. Repeat with the remaining corn husks, filling and masa. To steam, place a coin in the bottom of a pot and fill with 1 to 2 inches of water. Make sure that the steamer basket is not immersed in the water. Line the bottom of a steamer basket with some additional husks and stack the tamales in the steamer, with the exposed end facing upward. Top with more husks and cover with a moist towel. Bring the water to a boil and cook until the masa no longer sticks to the husks, 30 to 40 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: The coin will rattle during cooking. If it stops rattling, all the water has evaporated and you need to add more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 66896,&quot;Pomegranate Glazed Pork One 6- to 7-pound 8-rib bone-in center cut pork loin, chine bone removed, frenched 2 carrots, halved lengthwise<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cups pomegranate juice<br> 4 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 3 tablespoons maple syrup<br> 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard<br> Instructions: Remove the pork roast from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.

Place all of the veggies in a large bowl or baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and garlic. With your hands, toss to combine well. Stick onion pieces in with the vegetables to coat with the marinade; avoid tossing once onion is added so that the onion does not fall apart. Alternate the vegetables with the onions on wooden or metal skewers. The onions will get nice and juicy rubbing up against the other veggies. You can do this up to a few hours before you grill them. Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Arrange the skewers on the grill pan and cook, turning often, until slightly charred, about 15 minutes. Remove from grill and serve hot or at room temperature. *Cook&#39;s Note: To get skewer-able chunks of onions, cut the onions in half through the core and then cut each half into quarters. Remove 2 or 3 of the innermost layers, leaving the larger outermost layers. They will fit nicely on your skewers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 66902,&quot;Wormy Weenie Sandwiches 6 strips bacon, chopped One 14-ounce package foot-long hotdogs (8 hotdogs), each cut into 6 strips lengthwise 3 medium red and/or yellow bell peppers, cut into 1/4-inch-wide slices (about 3 cups) 1 large red onion, halved and cut into 1/4-inch-wide slices (about 3 cups) 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1/2 cup barbecue sauce 1/4 cup chicken broth 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon yellow mustard 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce 6 hoagie rolls, split 12 slices provolone (about 6 ounces) Instructions: Cook the bacon in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until crisp, about 6 minutes.

Roll out Canola Oil Dough into a rectangle (it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect) and transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine cinnamon and sugar, set aside. In a medium bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon-sugar mixture, along with flour and salt - stir to combine. Add pears and almond extract, if using and toss well to coat the pears. Arrange pears in a single layer on the dough, leaving a 1/2 -inch border. Gently fold in the dough on each side of the tart, slightly covering the edges of the pears. Sprinkle with remaining cinnamon-sugar and bake for 40 minutes or until golden. Serve warm or at room temperature. Top each serving with an additional sprinkle of cinnamon, if desired. Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl. Mix the oil and 5-6 tablespoons of the water in another bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the oil mixture. Mix with a fork until just combined (about 30 seconds). If it doesn?t combine immediately, add 1-2 more tablespoons water.

Spoon 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice into a very small bowl, sprinkle with the gelatin and set aside to thicken and almost set. Place the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, salt, and remaining lemon juice in the bowl with the lemon zest and whisk together. Pour into a saucepan, add the butter and cook over med-low heat, whisking constantly, until the custard begins to thicken. Just before boiling remove from the heat and add the now thickened lemon gelatin mixture. Pour the whole mixture through a fine mesh strainer set over a medium bowl. Cover the surface directly with plastic wrap and chill overnight until set quite firm. The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Unwrap the sheets of fillo and cover with damp cloth or a piece of plastic wrap. You should work quickly to avoid the fillo drying out. Lay two pieces of parchment paper measuring about 16 by 11-inches out on large chopping board. Brush each piece of paper with a thin layer of butter and sift two tablespoons of confectioners&#39; sugar onto each one. Lay a sheet of fillo onto each of the papers and now brush that with butter also. Continue to layer the fillo and butter on each stack to give 4 fillo layers in total, finishing with a butter layer. Finally, sift 2 tablespoons of confectioners&#39; sugar on top of each. Lay another sheet of parchment paper measuring 16 by 11-inches on top and use this as a guide to trim the pastry edges using a sharp knife. Next, remove the top sheet of parchment and using the knife, divide each fillo stack in half down the length (to give four 5.5-inches wide and 16-inches long rectangles). Make light score marks (not cutting through) with the knife across the opposite way and at 2-inch intervals to give 8 portion marks when serving. Slide each stack onto a sheet pan, butter the top sheets of parchment paper and place them butter side down on top. Finally, place another sheet pan on top of each stack (which will ensure the pastry will cook thin and crispy). Bake for 15 minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Remove the top sheet pans and allow the pastries to cool completely. To assemble, set one long rectangle onto a large platter and spread over 1/4 of the lemon cream evenly. Continue to layer up the fillo and lemon cream ending with a fillo top, to give 4 fillo layers and 3 lemon cream layers. There should be a remaining 1/4 of lemon cream still in the bowl to make a sauce with. To do this, add a 1/4 cup of hot tap water and whisk until smooth and drizzly in consistency. Finally, prepare the blackberries. Tip them into a small bowl and lightly crush them with a fork to bring out their juices. Add 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar and toss together. Using a very sharp knife carefully cut the Napoleon into 8 portions using the score marks as a guide. Drizzle some lemon sauce on each serving plate and place a portion of Napoleon in the center of each one. Spoon the crushed blackberries around and serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 66911,&quot;Mussel Cioppino 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, smashed 1 large onion, chopped Kosher salt and finely ground black pepper 1 cup red wine 1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 1 sprig fresh thyme One 28-ounce can whole tomatoes in juice, pureed in a blender 1 1/2 cups chicken broth 1 1/2 pounds mussels, scrubbed 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley Crusty bread, for serving Instructions: Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat until hot.

Cover with plastic wrap and let sit while you prepare the sauce and pasta. (The rub will actually begin to \cure\ the meat.) For the sauce, melt butter in a large saucepan which will be large enough to accommodate the pound of cooked pasta, and saute onion until it becomes translucent. Mix in the flour to make a roux. Gradually add chicken broth and allow thickening. Remove from heat and whisk in Parmesan. Immediately cover surface of sauce with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside briefly. Bring a pot of water to boil for the pasta. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet. Cook the sun-dried tomatoes for a few minutes, then with a slotted spoon transfer them to the cheese sauce and whisk in. Cover the pot of sauce and set aside. Reserve the skillet and all the bits in it for the meat. Boil the pasta until al dente and drain. Add the cooked pasta to the saute pan containing the sauce and fold to coat pasta.

Drain the sun-dried tomatoes in a sieve over a small skillet, letting the oil collect in the skillet. Roughly chop the tomatoes and reserve them in a small bowl. Heat the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden brown, about 30 seconds, stirring occasionally. Add the thyme and let it crackle in the oil for about 10 seconds. Add the balsamic vinegar and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Pour the warm oil over the reserved tomatoes. Stir to combine the ingredients well. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1 sheet of puff pasty on each baking sheet. Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 individual squares, each about 3 by 3 inches. For each square, use a paring knife to cut from each corner toward the center, stopping 1-inch from the center. You will have a 1-inch circle in the center of each square, and all of the corners will be cut in half. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of pesto in the center of each square and spread it into a 1-inch circle. For each square, lift one half of a corner and fold it toward the center of the square, gently pushing the point into the pesto. Continuing around the square, fold 3 more corner halves toward the center of the square, and gently press all 4 tips together to form a pinwheel shape. Draining away most of the oil, place about 1 teaspoon of the tomatoes where the tips meet. Brush the dough with the beaten egg. Bake at 350 degrees F until the dough is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 66924,&quot;Cheesy Corn Cakes 3/4 cup yellow cornmeal 1/3 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup boiling water 2/3 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed Instructions: Finely grind cornmeal in blender, 1/4 cup at a time.

Grease the insides of four 6-ounce souffle ramekins with butter. Add a small amount of granulated sugar to the interior of one ramekin, and coat thoroughly. Repeat with the remaining ramekins by turning the sugar out from the first into the second. Place the prepared ramekins on a sheet tray. In a small bowl, combine the butter and flour into an evenly mixed mass. Combine the milk, salt, cl flakes, orange zest and 1/3 cup granulated sugar in a small pot. Bring to a simmer, then whisk in the butter and flour mixture until combined. Cook the mixture over a low heat until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. In a medium bowl, combine the egg yolks and add about 1/4 cup of the cooked flour and milk mixture. Whisk to combine to temper the egg yolks. Stir the chocolate into the remaining flour and milk mixture and mix until the chocolate is melted and well combined. Add the chocolate mixture to the tempered egg yolks and mix to combine and fully incorporate. Soak a paper towel in the vinegar and wipe out the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the egg whites to the bowl and fit the stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Beat the whites on medium-high speed, slowly adding the remaining 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continuing to beat until you have stiff, glossy peaks, about 5 minutes. Fold half of the egg white mixture into the chocolate base, followed by the remaining. (A few streaks of egg white is fine to remain, so as to not overmix.) Divide the mixture into the buttered and sugared ramekins, filling about three-quarters of the way. Gently tap the ramekins once on the sheet pan to evenly distribute the filling. Run your thumb around the rims of the ramekins to level and clean the edges. Bake, turning halfway through, until the edges are set but the centers are jiggly, about 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and place each ramekin on a plate. Garnish with a dusting of powdered sugar. Create a pocket in the center of each souffle to pour in the Creme Anglaise, if using. Enjoy warm. In a medium pot, whisk together the heavy cream, milk, sugar, salt, egg yolks and vanilla seeds. Place the pot over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Fill a large bowl with ice. Place a smaller bowl on top of the ice. Strain the anglaise into the smaller bowl and let cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 66928,&quot;Bloody Mary Gelatin Shots 2 cups bloody mary mix One 1/4-ounce packet unflavored gelatin, such as Knox 1 cup vodka 5 stalks celery<br> Instructions: Heat the bloody mary mix in a saucepot until hot, 3 to 5 minutes.

Re-measure and add more milk to make 4 cups. Whisk in simple syrup and the scrapings from vanilla beans. Freeze in the ice cream freezer, according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Put the sugar into a saucepan. Pour the water around the edge of the pan carefully to avoid any splashing up of the water or sugar crystals on the walls of the pan. Draw your finger through the sugar in an X, to let the water cover the sugar completely. Bring the sugar water to a boil and, without stirring, continue to cook until amber colored. Meanwhile, stick toothpicks in the ends of the 16 toasted almonds and put a pound of butter or a piece of styrofoam on a counter or a tall shelf. Test the color of the caramel periodically by placing a drop of the caramel on a white plate. When it is slightly lighter than you want it, stop the cooking by placing the bottom of the pot in a bowl of ice water. Swirl it a bit to evenly distribute the color. Dip the almonds in the caramel and suspend them over your work surface by sticking the toothpick in the butter or styrofoam, and allow the caramel to drip down causing a long strand to form. Once they are cooled, place them in an airtight container.

Add the apple cider vinegar and brown sugar. Bring to a low boil and stir until the sugar dissolves. Let cool completely. Fill a large saucepan with water and bring to a boil. With a ladle, slowly lower the eggs into the water one by one. Reduce the heat to a low boil and cook for 10 minutes; drain. When the eggs are cool enough to handle, remove the shells. Place the eggs in a small bowl or a jar. Pour the cooled beet brine mixture over the eggs. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours. The longer the eggs are in the brine, the deeper the shade of pink they will be. Slice each egg in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks and place them in a food processor. Arrange the whites cut-side up on a serving platter. To the food processor, add the mayo, mustard, salt, pepper and one of the pickled beet slices. Process until well blended and smooth. Taste for seasoning. If you want a deeper pink, add another beet to the mixture and process (reserve the remaining beets for another use). Transfer the mixture to a resealable plastic bag. With scissors, snip off a bottom corner from the bag. Using the bag like a pastry bag, pipe the yolk mixture into the egg whites. Garnish with minced fresh chives. Cover loosely and chill until ready to serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 66949,&quot;Rack of Lamb with Walnut Crust 2 racks of lamb (French boned) 1 tablespoon vegetable oil Salt Ground white pepper 2 tablespoons dried rosemary 1 cup whole walnuts 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1 egg 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 cloves minced garlic Instructions: To prepare the racks of lamb: Heat the vegetable oil in a saute pan over high heat. Season the racks of lamb with salt and pepper (I use fresh ground sea salt and ground white pepper). Sear the racks on all sides until nicely browned. Remove racks to a platter and allow to cool enough to handle. At this point preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. To make the walnut crust: Put dried rosemary into a food processor and pulse several times to grind, If you don&#39;t do this the rosemary pieces will be too large. Add walnuts, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper, and garlic powder. Pulse several times until mixture is the consistency of bread crumbs. Pour mixture onto a large dinner plate or a platter. To make the mustard mixture: In a dish combine the egg, mustard and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Mix well with a fork until egg and mustard are completely incorporated. To coat the racks of lamb: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Once the racks are cool enough to handle, place 1 rack in the mustard mixture and coat all sides. Next place the coated rack into the walnut mixture and coat well. Using your hand press the walnut mixture firmly onto the coated rack. Transfer rack to the baking sheet. Repeat steps for each rack. You can make the recipe to this point and place in refrigerator until ready to cook. To cook: Place the racks of lamb into the oven and roast for 20 minutes for medium rare. I use a temperature probe in one of the racks, and remove meat from oven when it registers between 125 to 130 degrees F. Remove from oven and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 66950,&quot;Smoked Salmon Mousse Lollipops with Wasabi Creme Fraiche and Baked Wonton Flakes 1 (8-ounce) salmon fillet (about 1 large fillet) 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 wonton skins, cut crosswise into triangles 16 ounces Neufchatel cream cheese 1 package powdered gelatin 1 bunch scallions, chopped 8 ounces smoked salmon 3 tablespoons wasabi powder 6 ounces creme fraiche Aluminum foil Wooden skewers Instructions: Preheat the oven 375 degrees F.

Lightly grease an oven-to-table baking dish with some of the butter. Melt the rest of the butter in a saucepan or small skillet and saute the onion until it becomes translucent. Gradually add the flour to make blond roux, then slowly add the milk and allow the mixture to thicken. Season with white pepper and just a dash of salt and remove from heat. (Be careful to avoid overdoing the salt, because there is salt in the cheese.) Layer 1/3 of the potatoes in the baking dish, followed by 1/3 of the milk sauce, and 1/4 cup of the shredded white Cheddar. Repeat the sequence twice for a total of 3 layers. You can top with the breadcrumbs before baking, but omit if making the dish gluten-free. Bake covered for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, removing the cover for the last 10 minutes. (You can speed up the cooking time by pre-microwaving for 10 to 15 minutes before baking, or even par-boiling the potatoes.) The scalloped potatoes are done when the potatoes are tender. Let rest a few minutes before serving. Garnish with sliced scallions and bread crumbs. All kids seem to love this dish (adults too). I keep this dish visually simple using only light colored ingredients, because kids seem to prefer it without green things (like the green parts of scallions), or black stuff (like ground pepper). However, you can jazz up the color if you like. In the episode, we topped this with bread crumbs - which you can do - but I keep the basic recipe gluten free. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 66966,&quot;Rainbow Coleslaw 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon honey<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon whole celery seed<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 large carrots, julienne<br> 2 cups shredded green cabbage 2 cups shredded purple cabbage Instructions: Combine the apple cider vinegar and honey in a large mixing bowl and whisk until combined.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the water and yeast. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, sugar, salt and butter. Mix with the dough hook until thoroughly combined. Cover with a towel and allow it to rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out to a lightly floured surface and start kneading. Cut the dough into 18 pieces. To shape, roll the dough into an oblong shape with both of your hands until smooth, slightly pull the sides outward then downward into the center of the roll, and pinch both ends to seal. Space evenly on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat to allow them to rise larger. Make sure the pinched seam side faces down. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 30 minutes. Put oven racks on the lowest and/or middle positions. In a large saucepan, bring 2 quarts of water to a slow boil over medium heat. Add the baking soda and lower heat to a simmer. Slowly add the buns, in batches, into the poaching liquid, seam side down. Avoid overcrowding. Poach for 30 seconds, then turn the buns over and poach for another 30 seconds. Remove the buns from the liquid and put them back on the sheet pan, seam side down. Lightly beat an egg in a small bowl. With a brush, coat all sides of the buns completely with the beaten egg. Sprinkle each bun with coarse salt. With a knife, slash an \X\ on the top of each roll. Bake the rolls for 15 to 20 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through for even browning on all sides. Cool completely, split and enjoy! \Haute dogs: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a baking dish, add the franks and drizzle with truffle oil. Bake until the franks plump, about 15 minutes. Slice truffle pate into small squares and put a piece inside of each bun. Once the franks are done, put 1frank in each bun alongside the truffle. Put the pretzel buns in a napkin lined basket. Label separate plates according to whether they have beef or chicken franks. Combine the chipotle, chipotle sauce and 1/4 cup of ketchup in a small ramekin. Put the Dijon and stone-ground mustard in separate ramekins. Top each frank with each topping and wasabi caviar to your own taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 66972,&quot;Football Cheeseball with Herbed Crackers 1 pound cream cheese, softened 8 ounces sharp Cheddar, shredded<br> 3/4 teaspoon hot sauce<br> 3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 medium shallot, minced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons minced fresh thyme<br> One 9.1-ounce box whole-wheat crackers, such as Wheat Thins<br> 1 1/4 cups walnuts<br> 1 piece white string cheese<br> Vegetable crudites, for serving Instructions: Combine the cream cheese, Cheddar, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder and shallots in a large bowl.

Stir constantly until melted, then whisk in the corn syrup and coffee without removing the double boiler from the heat. Whisk until smooth and shiny. (The sauce can be made up to 24 hours in advance and refrigerated. To rewarm, stir over low heat or heat in a microwave.) Caramel Sauce: Pour the sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the walls of the pan, trying not to splash any sugar onto the walls. Do not stir; gently draw your finger twice through the center of the sugar, making a cross, to moisten it. Over high heat, bring to a full boil and cook without stirring, swirling the pan occasionally to even out the color, until medium caramel in color, 5 to 10 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat and use a wooden spoon to slowly and carefully stir in the cream (it will bubble up and may splatter). Set aside. If the sauce has cooled, rewarm it over low heat (or in a microwave) until softened. Raspberry Sauce: Puree the berries with the sugar in a blender. Strain out the seeds through a strainer and keep chilled until ready to serve. Using a small ice cream scoop, scoop out balls of ice cream and place them on a sheet pan in the freezer. One at a time, roll 1 flavor in the biscotti crumbs and the other flavor in the chopped almonds then return them to the freezer. Keep them in an airtight container until ready to serve, up to 2 days. Place the sauces in bowls or individual fondue pots if you have them and warm the chocolate fudge and caramel. Serve the sauces with the coated ice cream balls and some forks for dipping.

In a spice mill or clean coffee grinder, grind the toasted spices together, with 1 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and the brown sugar. (A word of advice: make sure you thoroughly wipe out your coffee grinder before you make coffee again - Moroccan spices taste great on chicken but horrible with coffee.) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse the chicken with cool water, inside and out, then pat it dry with paper towels. Massage the chicken skin with the spice rub; make sure you don&#39;t miss a spot. Season the inside of the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Stuff the lemons halves, cilantro, and garlic in the cavity and place the chicken in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Fold the wing tips under the bird and tie the legs together with kitchen string. Drizzle the oil all over the chicken. If you have time, let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to really get the flavors down deep into the meat. Roast the chicken for 1 hour; pop an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; if it reads 160 degrees F, it&#39;s done. Allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes so the juices can settle back into the meat. Remove and discard the skin from the chicken. Pull the chicken from the bone and shred the meat, with your fingers or 2 forks. Put the shredded chicken in a large bowl and squeeze the lemon halves that have cooked inside the bird over the meat to moisten. To prepare the Apricot Couscous: Put the couscous in a medium bowl; pour the water over it, stir with a fork to combine. Cover and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then uncover and fluff with a fork. Put the apricots, almonds, green onions, mint, and cilantro on a cutting board and coarsely chop everything up; add this to the couscous. Add lemon juice, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss gently to combine. To prepare the Green Olive Sauce: In a small skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Saute the shallots and cl over low heat for 8 minutes until caramelized, then scrape into a food processor. Add the olives, parsley, vinegar, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup of oil; puree a good 3 minutes until totally smooth. To put the whole thing together: put the shredded chicken and couscous on the lavosh bread, add a few spoonfuls of the olive sauce, and roll the sandwich up. Wrap in foil and take the sandwich to a picnic, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner, Garnacha]&quot; 66977,&quot;Blueberry Kiwi Quinoa Parfait 3/4 cup quinoa Kosher salt 2 cups plain Greek yogurt (I use 2%, but you can use any kind you like) 1 tablespoon honey 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Finely grated zest of 1/2 lemon 1 pint blueberries 2 kiwi fruit, peeled and diced 1/3 cup slivered almonds Instructions: Place the quinoa in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse well.

Lay down greased parchment paper into two 9-inch cake pans. Combining the dry ingredients: Whisk together the flour mix, psyllium, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Mixing the wet ingredients: Stir together the milk and vanilla. Creaming the butter and sugar: Put the butter into the bowl of stand mixer. Whirl the butter until it has spread out in the bowl. Add the sugar. Mix the butter and sugar together until the sugar has entirely disappeared into the butter and has come creamy. Finishing the batter: With the stand mixer running on low, add 1/3 of the dry ingredients. When there is no flour visible, add 1/2 the milk. Repeat, ending with the last of the dry ingredients. Carefully, scrape the cake batter into a large bowl. Beating the egg whites: Clean out the bowl of the stand mixer and dry it thoroughly. Add the egg whites. Turn on the stand mixer, with the whisk attachment on. Add the cream of tartar to the egg whites. Let the stand mixer run until the egg whites turn white and start to thicken. Pour in the sugar and continue whisking the egg whites until they have reached soft peaks. Folding in the egg whites: Pour 1/3 of the egg whites into the cake batter. Slowly, with sure strokes, use a rubber spatula to fold the egg whites into the cake batter. When there is no visible sign of egg whites left, pour another 1/3 of the egg whites. Continue doing this until the cake batter is fluffy and increased in volume. Stir in the last and stop stirring. Baking the cake: Pour the cake batter equally into the 2 cake pans. Slide them into the oven and bake until the top of the cakes has a little athletic jiggle, and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.<br> Allow the cakes to cool in the pan. Run a butter knife around the edges of the cake pans to loosen the cake. Carefully, turn the cakes onto cooling racks. Pour all the flours into a large container. (Restaurant supply stores sell large plastic containers that fit this purpose well. You could also use a large glass jar.) Shake and shake and shake harder until all the flours have become one color. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66993,&quot;Yellowedge Grouper with Savory Sweet Corn Pudding, Oyster Mushroom Vinaigrette and Petite Greens Oyster Mushroom Vinaigrette: 2 cups oyster mushrooms, stems removed 2 1/2 ounces fine quality extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked 1 clove garlic, finely minced 1 shallot, finely minced 1 ounce fine quality sherry vinegar 1/4 ounce tupelo honey Corn Pudding: 1 cup vegetable stock 3 ears corn, shucked, silk removed and kernels shaved off the cob 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 tablespoon creme fraiche, at room temperature Yellowedge Gulf Grouper: Four 6-ounce fillets Yellowedge gulf grouper, skin and bones removed 2 ounces blended vegetable and olive oil 1 ounce unsalted butter, at room temperature 4 sprigs fresh thyme Petite greens, for serving Instructions: For the vinaigrette: Heat a medium skillet, and then add the mushrooms and saute in the olive oil, sprinkling with salt and black pepper, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the thyme, garlic and shallots and saute for 1 more minute. Reduce the heat and add the sherry vinegar and honey. Stir to combine. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed, and reserve for plating. For the corn pudding: Puree the stock and corn in a high-speed blender. Strain the corn puree through a fine strainer, and then pour into a double boiler over moderate heat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir often; the mixture will begin to thicken from the natural starch in the corn. Cook until desired consistency, and then stir in the butter and creme fraiche. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper, if needed, and keep warm. For the grouper: Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the fillets with salt and pepper. Add the oil to the skillet, and then carefully add the grouper fillets; do not overcrowd the skillet. Sear the fish well, while adding the butter and fresh thyme. Cook until the grouper is well seared and just cooked through, 3 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet. To serve, plate 4 ounces of corn pudding into each of four 12-inch shallow bowls. Place a warm grouper fillet in the center, and garnish with the mushroom vinaigrette and petite greens.

Divide the peanut butter cookie dough into 6 portions (2 tablespoons each), roll into balls and place on a baking sheet; repeat with the chocolate chip cookie dough. Bake until the cookies are slightly crisp around the edges and baked through, 12 to 14 minutes. While the cookies cool, make the ganache by adding the chocolate chips to a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream just until the edges begin to bubble, pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for 1 minute. Stir until smooth, then set aside to cool, about 8 minutes. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment and get everything lined up to assemble: the cookies, ganache and sprinkles. You need to move quickly so the ice cream stays cold. Grab the ice cream cartons and use a serrated or sharp knife to saw through the packaging, cutting each pint of ice cream into thirds, creating 6 ice cream rounds in total. Remove the packaging from the first ice cream round and sandwich it between one of the peanut butter cookies and one of the chocolate chip cookies. Dip the cookie sandwich into the ganache, covering half of it in chocolate. Next, cover the chocolate in sprinkles and place it onto the prepared baking sheet.

Fold the dough back over itself (use a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape dough from surface). Repeat until it&#39;s easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading normally until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in volume, about 3 hours. Press it with your finger to see if it&#39;s done; an indent should remain. Gently remove the dough from the bowl and divide in half. Roll each half into a ball and put on a lightly floured baking sheet. Brush lightly with olive oil, cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rest 15 minutes. Prepare charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash). Add to the grill, creating a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, and leaving the other half with no coals. Stretch and shape each ball of dough into a rough 12-by-10-inch rectangle. Brush one side with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Turn onto the grill, oiled-side down, over direct heat. Brush the top with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until nicely charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip, close the lid and grill another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a baking sheet that will fit on the covered grill. Spread half of the robiola over the top. Return the pizza on the baking sheet to the grill, cover and let warm a few minutes just to melt the cheese. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board. Scatter the shaved asparagus and then the Romano shavings over the top. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter the lemon zest over the top, then the parsley leaves and drizzle with olive oil. Repeat with the remaining dough and topping ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 67008,&quot;Chicken Kebabs with Greek Yogurt Pesto Dipping Sauce 3 ounces cooked white meat chicken, cut into bite-size pieces 8 large black olives, pitted 8 cherry tomatoes 1 mozzarella string cheese stick, cut into 6 pieces 1/4 cup 2-percent Greek yogurt 1 tablespoon prepared pesto sauce Instructions: Divide the chicken, olives, tomatoes and cheese into 4 servings.

Add the garlic and onions and cook until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the ancho powder, allspice, chiles de arbol, cloves, apples and cinnamon sticks and some salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes. Stir in the chipotle puree, then the almonds, tortilla chips and raisins. Add the chicken stock, 1 cup of the apple cider, the tomatoes and cider vinegar. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and reduced, about 15 minutes. Stir in the brown sugar, honey and maple syrup and cook, stirring, another 10 minutes. Stir in the chocolate to melt. Remove the cinnamon sticks and discard. If the mixture seems too thick to blend easily, add a little extra cider. Transfer the mixture to a blender and, starting on very low speed, blend until smooth. Again, if the sauce seems too thick, thin it with a bit more cider. Return the sauce to the pot and cook very gently for another 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Cover to keep warm while you cook the chicken. For the roasted cider-glazed chicken: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until it begins to shimmer. Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan, add the chicken skin-side down and cook until the fat renders and the skin begins to turn golden brown. Turn, cook for a few minutes to start browning the second side, and then transfer to the oven. While the chicken cooks, whisk together the cider, honey and thyme in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and then remove from the heat. After the chicken has cooked for about 10 minutes, brush with the glaze. Continue to cook, brushing with glaze occasionally, until the chicken reaches 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 15 minutes total for the breasts, 20 to 25 minutes for the thighs and drumsticks.

Whisk in the flour mixture until just combined.<br> Reserve 1 cup of the pumpkin batter. Spread the remaining batter in the bottom of the prepared loaf pan. Spoon the cream cheese mixture over the pumpkin batter, then put the reserved pumpkin batter in a line down the center of the pan. Insert the tip of a paring knife into the batter and drag it through and up to swirl 5 to 6 times.<br> Bake until the top is cracked and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then carefully invert onto a platter or cake stand and flip upright. Let cool completely, at least 1 1/2 hours. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67091,&quot;Leftover Pecan Pie Bread Pudding Cooking spray 10 cups 1/2-inch pieces of leftover dinner rolls 1 cup evaporated milk 1 cup milk 1/2 cup sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs Large pinch of freshly grated nutmeg Kosher salt 3 slices of leftover pecan pie, cut into bite-size pieces Vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray. Spread the bread pieces in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until toasted and golden, tossing halfway through, about 15 minutes. Let cool. Whisk together the evaporated milk, milk, sugar, vanilla, eggs, nutmeg and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Add the cooled bread cubes. Toss to combine and set aside until the bread soaks up most of the liquid, about 30 minutes. Stir the pecan pie pieces into the mixture and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake until the bread pudding is set and golden, 30 to 40 minutes. Let rest for a few minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 67092,&quot;Shaker Lemon Pie 2 large lemons 2 cups granulated sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces and frozen 1/2 cup chilled vodka 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 5 tablespoons ice water, plus more if needed 5 large eggs 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar Instructions: For the lemons: Trim the ends of the lemons, then quarter each lemon lengthwise. Using a sharp knife, very thinly slice the lemons; they should be paper-thin. Discard any seeds. Transfer the slices and any juices to a medium bowl and toss with the sugar and vanilla until all the sugar is moistened. Cover and refrigerate, stirring every so often, until the lemons have softened and start to turn translucent and the sugar is mostly dissolved, at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours. For the pie dough: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor to combine. Add the butter and process until the largest pieces of butter are pea-size. Transfer to a large bowl. Combine the vodka, vinegar and 4 tablespoons of ice water in a small bowl. Drizzle the wet ingredients over the dough, then mix with a fork until shaggy pieces form. Knead the dough in the bowl with your hands a couple of times until it comes together (it will be dry, which is fine). Transfer the large clumps of dough to a work surface. Drizzle 1 tablespoon ice water over any remaining smaller bits of dough in the bowl and knead again to bring it together. If the remaining dough is still too dry to come together, add more ice water 1 tablespoon at a time. Add to the dough on the work surface and press together into a single mass, incorporating any dry bits. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick block. Divide the block into 4 pieces with a bench scraper or knife. Stack the pieces on top of one another, tucking any unincorporated dry bits in between the layers. Flatten the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick block. Repeat this process (cutting, stacking and flattening) 3 more times; this creates layers of butter in the dough that produce a wonderfully flaky crust. Divide the dough in half and form into 1-inch-thick disks; wrap each disk tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 3 hours and preferably overnight. Once the lemons have macerated and the pie dough has chilled, place a rimmed baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. For the filling: Take the macerated lemons out of the refrigerator and whisk in 4 of the eggs, the cornstarch and salt until well combined. Set aside while you roll the dough. Roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface or on a piece of parchment into a 12-inch round (about 1/4-inch thick). Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Pour the lemon filling over the crust. Repeat the rolling with the remaining dough, then carefully place it on top of the filling. Trim the edges, leaving a 1-inch overhang, then tuck the overhanging dough under itself; crimp the edges with a fork or your fingers. Whisk the remaining egg with a splash of water in a small bowl, then brush all over the pie dough. Finally, cut 4 small slits in the center of the pie to release steam while baking. Place the pie directly on the preheated baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and continue to bake until the crust is deep golden-brown all over and cooked through and the filling is set, about 1 hour 15 minutes longer. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. For the whipped cream: While the pie is cooling, combine the cream and confectioners\u2019 sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until it is light, fluffy and holds soft peaks, about 2 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut the room temperature pie into wedges and serve with a dollop of whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67093,&quot;Herb and Almond Tapenade 1 1/2 cups fresh herbs (oregano, chives, thyme, tarragon, dill, basil, parsley), coarsely chopped 3/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted and finely chopped 1 1/3 cups prepared olive tapenade 1 jalapeno, minced 1 tablespoon lemon juice Toasted baguette slices Instructions: In the bowl of a food processor, combine herbs, almonds, tapenade, jalapeno, and lemon juice.

Serve scallops topped with bacon piece. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 67095,&quot;Salt Potatoes 4 pounds small potatoes, such as baby Yukon gold 2 1/4 cups kosher salt 1 stick unsalted butter Instructions: Put the potatoes, 8 cups water and the salt in a large pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and shake to remove excess water. Let the skins dry in the colander so that some of the salt crystallizes. Meanwhile, put the butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until melted. Serve the potatoes hot with the butter for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 67096,&quot;Paupiettes de Sole a la Vapeur 1/2 small leek (white and pale green parts only) a 3inch piece carrot a 3inch piece celery rib 3 medium garlic cloves 7 cups cold water 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 fresh thyme sprig 2 bay leaves (not the stronger California variety) 1 1/2 teaspoons white peppercorns 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 4 fish fillets of sole or any other white fleshed fish, 3/8-inch thick, trimmed to about 6 inches in length 4 salmon strips, 1 by 6 inches 3 tablespoons unsalted butter or oil, at room temperature 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley Instructions: Make court bouillon: Cut up leek, carrot, and celery and in a large saucepan bring to a boil with remaining ingredients. Boil mixture 10 minutes and pour through a fine sieve into a bowl. Court bouillon keeps, covered and chilled, 3 days or, frozen, 2 months. Makes about 2 quarts. Rinse fillets under cold water then pat dry. Lay salmon strips on top of sole fillets. Coat lightly with 2 tablespoons of the butter on one side. Sprinkle on the same side with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, then add the parsley. Starting at the narrow tapered end, roll up each fillet loosely and secure the ends with 1 or 2 toothpicks. This may be prepared in advance, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 4 hours. Bring court bouillon to a simmer. Place fish in simmering court bouillon for 5 to 8 minutes, or pour boiling Court Bouillon over fish and let stand 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer fish rolls one at a time with a small metal spatula to plates. Let rest 1 to 2 minutes, then remove the liquid that accumulates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 67097,&quot;Chocolate Flan with Toffee Popcorn 2/3 cup plus 1/2 cup granulated sugar 6 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks<br> 2 pinches kosher salt<br> 2 cups whole milk<br> One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br> 2 vanilla beans, split and seeds scraped<br> 1 cinnamon stick<br> 8 ounces good-quality bittersweet chocolate chips, melted<br> 1/2 cup popcorn kernels<br> 1/3 cup roasted salted peanuts<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/3 cup light brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons dark corn syrup<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> Flaked sea salt, such as Maldon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place six 6-ounce ramekins in a roasting pan and set aside. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, mix 2/3 cup granulated sugar with 1/3 cup water. Bring to a boil, then cook until a medium-amber caramel forms, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour the caramel evenly among the ramekins. Whisk together the eggs and egg yolks, remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and a pinch of salt in a bowl until pale and thickened. Heat the whole milk, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla seeds and pods and cinnamon stick in a saucepan until simmering. Temper the hot liquid into the egg mixture by adding one ladle of the hot liquid into the eggs at a time while whisking constantly. Strain the mixture back into the pot, then whisk in the melted chocolate. Pour evenly into the ramekins. Place the roasting pan in the oven and pour hot water into the pan, allowing it to come halfway up the ramekins. Bake until just set, 20 to 25 minutes. In the meantime, make the toffee popcorn. Pop the popcorn using an air popper and place it in a large mixing bowl. Mix in the peanuts. To a saucepan, add the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup and a remaining pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cook to a temperature of 240 degrees F, not exceeding 260 degrees F. Remove from the heat and whisk in the baking soda and vanilla. Pour over the popcorn and peanuts and mix to combine, coating all of the popcorn. Pour out onto a silicone liner or piece of parchment and spread into an even layer, getting as much separation as you can. Sprinkle with the flaked sea salt. Allow to cool.

Mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Add the diced chicken meat. Stir in enough of the stock, so the mixture is very wet, about 3 to 4 cups. Allow the dressing to sit for 30 minutes. **Add more of the stock if needed. The mixture should still be very wet after it has set. Butter a deep casserole baking dish and pour in the mixture. Bake for about 1 hour, or until bubbly and golden brown. Spoon onto serving plates and garnish with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67102,&quot;Frozen Grand Marnier Souffle 5 whole eggs 1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus extra for dusting dishes Softened butter 1 cup plus 1/2 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons confectioners sugar 1/4 cup Grand Marnier 2 tablespoons orange zest 1/2 cup orange segments Instructions: Combine the eggs and granulated sugar in the top of a stainless steel double boiler and, being careful not to scramble the eggs, whisk over gentle heat until the mixture is golden in color and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon in ribbons. Remove from the heat and set the mixture aside to cool. While the egg mixture is cooling, prepare four 1/2 cup souffle dishes by cutting waxed paper long enough to encircle each souffle dish twice, and stand 3 to 4 inches above its top. Wrap the waxed paper snugly around the outside of the dish and seal the edges with transparent tape. Butter the inside of the dish with softened butter, then sprinkle with granulated sugar, tapping out any excess sugar onto a plate. Using an electric mixer, combine 1 cup of the heavy cream, confectioners sugar, and Grand Marnier, orange zest and whip into firm peaks. With a spatula, gently fold the whipped cream into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture into the buttered souffle dishes, filling them above the rim and into the area enclosed by the waxed paper. Place the souffles into the freezer, for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. When ready to serve, whip the remaining cream until soft peaks form, remove from the frozen souffle from the freezer, and carefully remove the waxed paper collar. Top with a dollop of whipped cream and several orange segments. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 67103,&quot;Double Crust Apple Pie 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for sprinkling 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup grated sharp Cheddar (grated on large holes of grater) 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cold, cut into small pieces<br> 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water<br> 6 tart apples (Pink Ladies ideally), peeled, cored and sliced 3/8-inch thick (about 8 cups) 1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1 large egg Vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: For the double pie crust: In a food processor or quickly using your fingertips, combine the flour, sugar, salt, Cheddar and butter until the chunks of butter are broken down to the size of peas and the flour feels like wet sand. Add the first 1/4 cup of water and mix until the dough comes together easily. It&#39;s too dry if it immediately clumps apart. Add 2 more tablespoons of water at a time; you can always add more water but not more flour, so careful not to add too much! Gather the dough into two balls and plop them on top of 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Loosely wrap up each ball and press down, smooshing the ball into a disc about an inch thick. Pop them in the fridge for at least 30 minutes while you busy yourself with the other stuff. For the apple filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the apples, sugars, flour, cream, lemon, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and cloves in a bowl until everything is lightly coated.<br> Let the dough sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough as well as the surface you&#39;re rolling on. Roll out each disc to a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. As you roll out the dough, use a metal spatula to check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. Add a few sprinkles of flour if necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, like a spool, and place onto a 9-inch pie dish, lining up with the center of the pan. Gently unroll and press down to line the pie dish with the dough. Fill with the apple slices, mounding a bit in the middle, and cover with the other layer of dough. Cut off the excess dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the dish. Pinch the edges to flute together (or press with a fork if that&#39;s easier) and cut three small vents into the pie. For the egg wash: Whisk together the cream and egg in a small bowl. Brush over the top of the pie. Sprinkle with granulated sugar and bake on the center rack until golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes. (If the edges brown too quickly, cover with aluminum foil.) Let the apple pie cool until it&#39;s just warm before cutting. Serve with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz, Barbera]&quot; 67104,&quot;Toasted Ravioli 2 eggs Splash of milk or half-and-half Salt and pepper 1 1/2 cups Italian bread crumbs, eyeball it 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, a couple of handfuls Handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped 12 large fresh spinach and cheese ravioli, about 3/4 pound 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped Pinch red pepper flakes 2 roasted red peppers, drained 1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes Instructions: Beat eggs and a splash of milk seasoned with salt and pepper in a shallow dish.

Toss the broccoli, carrots, vegetable oil and a sprinkle of salt and a few grinds of pepper together on an 18-inch-long piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Bring the two long sides of foil up and together and fold over twice to seal. Bring the other two short sides up and in, crimping to seal; set aside. Lightly oil half of the grill grates. Pat the fish dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put the vegetable pack on the un-oiled side of the grill and cook until the vegetables are crisp tender and the broccoli is bright green and lightly charred, about 10 minutes. Grill the salmon on the oiled side and skin-side up until well-marked, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the salmon over and continue to grill until just cooked through but still a bit rosy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes more. Careful of the steam, open the foil pack and toss well; divide among 4 plates and add a piece of salmon.

Line a muffin pan with 12 regular-size cupcake liners. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or a standard hand held mixer and large mixing bowl), mix the sugar, oil, salt and peaches on medium speed for 30 seconds. Add the eggs and continue mixing on medium speed for 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula and mix again on medium speed for 10 seconds. Next, in a blender or food processor, combine the corn and whipping cream and blend for 20 seconds until smooth. Add this creamed corn mixture to the wet ingredients and mix on medium speed until incorporated. In a medium bowl, sift the flour and baking powder and stir in the cornmeal. Add to the wet ingredient mixture and mix on low speed until incorporated. Now, add the baking soda, followed by the vinegar for an immediate bubbling action. Add 1/4 cup cold water and mix on low speed for 5 seconds. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl one last time to be sure all the ingredients are fully incorporated. Fill the cupcake liners two-thirds full with batter and bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees after 9 minutes of baking. Oven heat and times may vary so bake until the tops are no longer wet and spring back upon touching. Cool the cupcakes completely. Keep the oven on, but increase the temperature to 400 degrees F. For the shortcakes: In the bowl of an electric stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or a standard hand held mixer and medium mixing bowl), add the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Next, use your fingers to break the butter into pea-size pieces and add to the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds until incorporated. Add the milk, cream, tarragon and vanilla and continue mixing on low speed until the flour is fully incorporated. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. With a spoon, drop heaping spoonfuls of batter onto the baking sheet 2 inches apart and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Oven heat and times may vary so bake the shortcakes until they are golden brown. Cool the shortcakes completely. With your fingers, break each shortcake into 3 equal pieces and set aside. For the compote: In a small bowl, combine the blackberries, peaches and strawberries. Add the sugar and gently fold into mixture. Set aside. For the frosting: In the bowl of an electric stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or a standard hand held mixer and medium mixing bowl), whip the heavy cream on medium-high speed for 3 minutes. In a small bowl, sift the powdered sugar. Add the sugar to the whipped cream mixture and mix on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. The frosting should be able to stand on its own. To assemble: Begin assembling the cupcakes by placing a spoonful of peach-berry compote on top of each cupcake. Place the frosting in a piping bag with a round tip or in a gallon-size plastic baggy and snip 1/2-inch off the corner. Next, pipe frosting onto the compote. Place a piece of the tarragon shortcake on top of the frosting. Finally, top with another small spoonful of peach-berry compote. With a tweezer or small tong, delicately place a tarragon leaf on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 67108,&quot;Porterhouse Steak with Hoisin Barbecue Sauce and Rosemary and Garlic Fingerling Potatoes 1 tablespoon peanut oil 1/2 medium red onion, finely diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 6 plum tomatoes, coarsely diced 1/4 cup ketchup 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 6 tablespoons hoisin sauce 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon honey 1 teaspoon cayenne 1 tablespoon ancho cl powder 1 teaspoon pasilla cl powder 1 tablespoon Worcestershire 2 (2 1/2 pound) porterhouse steaks Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste 1/2 pound red potatoes B size, blanched 1/2 pound Yukon gold B size, blanched 1/2 pound purple potatoes B size, blanched 1/2 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons minced garlic Salt and pepper 4 sturdy rosemary branches 1/3 cup lemon juice 1 teaspoon honey Instructions: In a large saucepan, over medium high heat, place the oil, onions and garlic and heat them until browned.

Empty the raw eggs into a bowl and reserve. Wash the egg shells (tops and bottoms) in warm water, then turn them upside down on a towel to dry completely. Over very low heat melt the butter in a saucepan just large enough to hold the eggs. Beat the eggs with a whisk, pour through a sieve into the warm butter, and return to the very low heat. Beat constantly with the whisk, gradually increasing the heat, until the eggs are thick and creamy, not solid. Remove the eggs immediately from the heat and continue whisking while adding the cream, shallots, chives, salt and pepper. Place the dried eggshells in egg cups. Using a teaspoon, carefully fill each shell 3/4 full with the creamed eggs, then finish filling each shell with 1 tablespoon of caviar. The caviar should be slightly domed on top. Place the little top of each shell on the caviar. Serve with toast. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67110,&quot;Fried Toast 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons butter<br> 4 large slices Italian bread<br> 1 cup fruit jam, such as fig<br> 1/4 cup crumbled blue or Gorgonzola cheese<br> Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling Instructions: In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.

Bake the puff pastry on a baking sheet until all puffy and delicious, about 10 minutes. Set aside and increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Drain the crawfish tails and squeeze excess liquid out. (Wet tails can effect the thickness of the finished sauce.) In a pot of salty water, cook the potatoes until they are softened but have a little crunch still left in them, then drain and set aside. Add the turnips to a pot of BOILING salty water. Cook until softened, then drain and run under cold water. Set aside. In a medium saucepan (big enough to hold all the ingredients), melt the butter. When the butter is melted and bubbling, add the flour and blend in with a whisk. Keep whisking on medium heat for 5 minutes (do not brown, you are just cooking some of the floury flavor out). Add the stock and cream, then increase heat to medium-high. DO NOT STOP STIRRING. As it heats up the mixture will get thicker. Add the Worcestershire, porcini powder, hot sauce, and salt, pepper and Creole/Cajun seasoning to taste. Cook until the bechamel mixture is thickened and bubbly, then add the drained crawfish and mix in. Cook, stirring, until the mixture returns to a boil. (If the mixture needs more thickening you can do it with a mixture of flour and butter, a tablespoon at a time, waiting for it to return to a boil each time. This is as thick as it&#39;s gonna get.) Add the peas and carrots, pearl onions, potatoes and turnips. Stir gently, so as not to break up the potatoes and turnips. Spoon the mixture in vessel of your choice and top with the cooked puff pastry. Put the whole thing back into the oven. Have a beverage. Cook until and bubbly and the puff pastry is starting to brown. Garnish with fresh parsley and/or dill. Serve with lemon wedges and hot pepper infused vinegar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67114,&quot;Joe&#39;s Special 24 ounces tri-tip, hand minced Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cloves garlic, deveined and minced<br> 1 small shallot, sliced<br> 2 cups button mushrooms, sliced<br> 2 cups small spinach leaves<br> 2 large egg yolks, optional (or don&#39;t tell Guy!)<br> 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish<br> Instructions: Sprinkle the tri-tip with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once heated, add the tri-tip and saute until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, shallot and mushrooms, then season with salt and pepper and saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach and cook until wilted, about 1 minute. Add the egg yolks, if using, and quickly stir to cook through. Stir in the Parmesan. Taste for seasoning and serve hot garnished with more Parmesan.

Combine the rub ingredients in a small bowl and rub the turkey with the mixture on the inside and outside. Make the marinade: Put all the marinade ingredients in a blender and blend to combine. Fill an injector with the mixture and inject the turkey all over. It will plump with the fluid. Place the turkey, breast side down, in a disposable aluminum pan. Put the pan inside the Caja China box. Place the lid tray in position and build a charcoal fire in the tray (I use a chimney starter to make this easy). Roast the turkey in the box (no peeking!) for 1 1/2 hours, continuously adding charcoal as it burns out. You will use about 8 pounds of charcoal per hour. While the turkey is roasting, make the marmalade: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, whisk the orange juice, vinegar, 2 tablespoons water, and the brown sugar until the sugar dissolves. Add the pineapple, onion, and jalapeno. Bring to a low boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has thickened, about 15 to 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Carefully remove the lid from the Caja China (have a safe place to set it down, as the charcoal is still burning on top). Use the tongs to flip the turkey breast side up. Replace the lid and allow the turkey to roast for another 40 minutes, until the internal temperature of the thigh meat reaches at least 165 degrees. Remove the turkey and tent it with foil for 15 minutes. Slice and serve on buns if desired, with pan juices and pineapple marmalade. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67116,&quot;Italian Deli Style French Bread Pizza One 2-foot-long French bread, cut in half lengthwise 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 cups marinara sauce<br> 8 ounces sopressata, thinly sliced<br> 8 ounces hard salami, thinly sliced<br> 1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan Two 8-ounce balls smoked mozzarella, sliced<br> 2 cups pitted Kalamata olives, chopped<br> 8 pickled cherry peppers, drained and sliced<br> 4 ounces ricotta salata<br> 1 1/2 cups grated Pecorino-Romano 2 teaspoons red cl flakes<br> 2 cups fresh basil leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Butter 3 (9-inch) cake pans with 1 tablespoon of the butter and set aside. In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric mixer. Add the sugar, and beat. In a medium bowl or on a piece of parchment, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt, and mix well. Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the eggs, beating well after the addition of each. Add the vanilla extract and mix. Add the carrots and beat on medium speed until well incorporated, about 2 minutes. Fold in the nuts. Divide between the 3 cake pans and bake until set and a cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in the cake pans for 10 minutes. Invert onto wire racks, remove from the pans, and let cool. For the Frosting: In a large bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugar gradually, beating constantly. Add the vanilla and pecans. When the cake is cool, place 1 cake layer on a cake plate or stand.

Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens and starts to bubble, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer and let cool until lukewarm (105 degrees F to 110 degrees F), stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup lukewarm water (105 degrees F to 110 degrees F) in a small bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add to the cornmeal mixture along with 1 cup flour and the dry milk; mix with a wooden spoon. Cover with a kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place until the dough increases slightly in volume and is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Mix the dough with the dough hook attachment on medium-low speed, then mix in the salt and the remaining 3 to 4 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition, until the dough comes together into a firm, tacky ball. Increase the speed to medium high; knead the dough until it pulls away from the bowl, about 2 minutes. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand until smooth and pliable, adding more flour as needed, about 5 minutes. Brush a large bowl with vegetable oil; add the dough, cover with a kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 hour to 1 hour, 30 minutes. Brush a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil. Punch down the dough and turn out onto a clean surface. Shape into a smooth 4-by-8-inch loaf, then transfer to the pan. Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the loaf rises above the pan by 1/2 inch, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Uncover the pan and transfer to the oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until the bread is golden and sounds hollow when tapped, 35 to 45 minutes. (Cover loosely with foil if it is browning too quickly.) Brush with melted butter and let rest in the pan, 10 minutes. Turn out onto a rack and let cool before slicing or freezing. MAKE IT AHEAD Let the bread cool completely, wrap in plastic wrap and foil, and freeze for up to 2 weeks. To serve, unwrap and thaw at room temperature for 2 hours. Reheat, wrapped in foil, at 300 degrees F until warmed through, 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67122,&quot;Golden Spiced Tiramisu 2 teaspoons ground ginger 2 teaspoons ground turmeric<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg<br> Pinch freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 1/2 cups whole milk<br> 6 large egg yolks<br> 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/4 cups heavy cream<br> 2 tablespoons powdered sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 pound mascarpone cheese<br> 24 ladyfingers<br> Instructions: Combine the ginger, turmeric, cardamom, allspice, nutmeg, black pepper and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl. Toast 1 1/2 tablespoons of the spice mixture in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in about 2 tablespoons of the milk, whisking to combine until smooth. Gradually drizzle in the remaining milk, whisking continuously to avoid any lumps, and bring to a simmer, whisking frequently. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Whisk together the egg yolks, granulated sugar and salt in a large saucepan, then slowly drizzle in 2/3 cup of the milk mixture while whisking continuously. (You don&#39;t want to scramble the eggs!) Turn the heat on medium and cook for a few minutes, whisking continuously, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, then pour the mixture into a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it up against the surface of the custard, and let cool in the fridge for about 1 hour. Beat the heavy cream, powdered sugar, remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and the vanilla to stiff peaks in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk or in a large bowl with an electric mixer, then set aside. Fold the mascarpone into the cooled custard.<br> Working one at a time, quickly soak the ladyfingers in the remaining golden spiced mixture and use them to line the bottom of an 8-inch square pan, breaking them up if necessary. (Soak them for about 2 seconds; don&#39;t soak them too long, otherwise they&#39;ll fall apart.) Add half of the custard, spreading it out evenly with an offset spatula, followed by a layer of the whipped cream. Repeat! Using a sifter or a fine-mesh sieve, dust the top with some of the remaining spice mixture and allow to set for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 67123,&quot;Jerk Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs and Mango-Habanero Hot Sauce 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1 shallot, chopped<br> 2 mangoes, chopped (about 2 heaping cups) 1 habanero, chopped<br> 1 cup white wine vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 Spanish onion, chopped<br> 2 Jerk Chicken Breasts, diced, recipe follows 3 medium sweet potatoes, boiled, peeled and diced<br> 4 scallions, sliced on the diagonal, plus for garnish<br> 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped, plus for garnish<br> 4 eggs 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 3 tablespoons ground coriander 3 tablespoons ground ginger<br> 3 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons garlic powder<br> 2 tablespoons onion powder<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus for sprinkling 1 tablespoon habanero powder<br> 1 tablespoons dried thyme<br> 2 teaspoons cinnamon<br> 2 teaspoons ground cloves<br> 2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper, plus for sprinkling 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, about 6 ounces each<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> Instructions: For the hot sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and shallots and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the mangoes and habaneros and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the vinegar and a tablespoon or so of the honey. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until the mangoes are soft, about 10 minutes. Pour the mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. Add salt, pepper, and more honey to taste. If very thick, thin with a few tablespoons water. Strain through a sieve set over a small bowl. (Makes about 1 cup.) For the hash: Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the jerk chicken, sweet potatoes, scallions and cilantro; toss together. Press the mixture into the pan and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom starts to brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn over parts of the hash, press and crisp again. For the eggs: Line a plate with paper towels. Crack the eggs into little bowls. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat; stir in the vinegar. Slip the eggs into the water, adjusting the heat to maintain a bare simmer. Cook until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny, about 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to paper towels to dry. To assemble: While the eggs are poaching, set a ring mold on a dinner plate and spoon in some of the hash, pressing to crush the potatoes a bit. Remove the mold. Make a little divot in the top of the hash, then spoon on a poached egg and drizzle some hot sauce over the top. (If you don&#39;t have a ring mold, just mound the hash onto plates.) Garnish with scallions and cilantro. Repeat for the remaining servings. Serve immediately. In a small bowl, combine the coriander, ginger, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt, habanero powder, thyme, cinnamon, cloves and black pepper. Mix to blend. (Makes about 1 cup; extra spice mix can be stored in a sealed container in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months.) Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides; rub the top side with a generous amount of the spice mix. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts, rub-side down, and cook until a crust forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until just cooked through, about 4 minutes more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67124,&quot;Tacos Carne Asada 2 pounds flank or skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat 1 recipe Mojo, recipe follows Olive oil, for coating the grill Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 16 (7-inch) corn tortillas Shredded romaine or iceberg lettuce, for serving Chopped white onion, for serving Shredded Jack cheese, for serving 1/2 cup Pico de Gallo, recipe follows 2 limes, cut in wedges for serving 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 jalapeno, minced 1 large handful fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 limes, juiced 1 orange, juiced 2 tablespoons white vinegar 1/2 cup olive oil 4 vine-ripe tomatoes, chopped 1/2 medium red onion, chopped 2 green onions, white and green parts, sliced 1 Serrano cl, minced 1 handful fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 lime, juiced 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Lay the flank steak in a large baking dish and pour the mojo over it. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 8 hours, so the flavors can sink into the meat. Don&#39;t marinate the steak for more than 8 hours though, or the fibers break down too much and the meat gets mushy. Preheat an outdoor grill or a ridged grill pan over medium-high flame (you can also use a broiler). Brush the grates with a little oil to prevent the meat from sticking. Pull the steak out of the mojo marinade and season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill (or broil) the steak for 7 to 10 minutes per side, turning once, until medium-rare. Remove the steak to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the juices to settle. Thinly slice the steak across the grain on a diagonal. Warm the tortillas for 30 seconds on each side in a dry skillet or on the grill, until toasty and pliable. To make the tacos, stack up 2 of the warm tortillas, lay about 4 ounces of beef down the center, and sprinkle with some lettuce, onion, and cheese. Top each taco with a spoonful of the Pico de Gallo salsa and garnish with lime wedges. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. In a mortar and pestle or bowl, mash together the garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, salt, and pepper to make a paste. Put the paste in a glass jar or plastic container.

Toss the butter cubes in the flour mixture, then press the cubes between your fingertips until you have large, thin flour-coated flakes. Mix the ice water and vodka together, then drizzle into the flour mixture; stir with a fork until evenly moistened and clumps start forming. Gather the dough together into a ball, then press and fold a few times until fully combined. Divide the dough between 2 pieces of plastic wrap; flatten into disks and wrap tightly. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Meanwhile, make the filling: Toss the apples, granulated sugar, lemon juice and salt in a large bowl. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the apple mixture and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender, release their juices and begin to shrink, about 12 minutes. Stir together the cherry juice and cornstarch in a small bowl, then stir into the skillet along with the cherries and return to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, until thick and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the filling to a bowl and refrigerate until completely cool, at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 14-inch round. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edges, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Brush off any excess flour and refrigerate. Roll out the other disk of dough into a 13-inch round. Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate along with the crust until very firm, at least 1 hour. Scrape the filling evenly into the chilled pie crust. Cut 10 strips of varying widths from the round of dough (on the parchment) with a fluted pastry cutter. Lay 5 strips of dough across the pie, leaving space between each. Lay 5 more strips across the pie in the opposite direction, weaving them through to make a lattice. Trim the strips, leaving a 1-inch overhang, then fold the overhanging dough (strips and bottom crust) under itself and crimp with your fingers. Refrigerate the pie to firm up the pastry again, 1 hour. Place a foil-lined baking sheet on the middle oven rack; preheat to 375?. Brush the pie crust (lattice and edge) with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake the pie on the hot baking sheet until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer the pie to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67128,&quot;Louisiana Red Beans and Rice 1 pound dried small red beans, picked over and rinsed 2 large smoked ham hocks 1 large yellow onion, chopped 2 celery stalks, chopped 1 large green bell pepper, chopped 1 teaspoon cayenne 1/4 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped 2 sprigs fresh thyme 3 bay leaves 4 garlic cloves, chopped 2 green onions, green part only, chopped, plus more for garnish Red pepper sauce 2 andouille sausages, cut into 3-inch chunks 4 cups cooked white rice Instructions: Place the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator. Drain the beans and put them in a large heavy pot with the ham hocks, adding just enough cold water to cover (about 2 quarts). Add the onion, celery, green pepper, cayenne, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, green onions, and several shakes of red pepper sauce; give everything a good stir to combine. Simmer, uncovered, until the beans are tender and starting to thicken, about 21/2 hours. You want the beans to be almost overcooked, like they are getting ready to burst. Stir the beans occasionally to prevent scorching on the bottom of the pot. Add about 1 cup of water toward the end of cooking if the mixture appears too thick or dry. Mash about 1 cup of the cooked beans against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon, this makes the broth thick and creamy. Toss in the sausages and cook for another 30 minutes to heat them through. Adjust the seasoning, if needed. Serve the red beans in a wide bowl over some steamed white rice and garnished with chopped green onion. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 67129,&quot;Charred Brussels Sprout Crostini 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup Champagne vinegar<br> 1/3 cup dried cranberries<br> 1 pound Brussels sprouts, sliced into thin rounds<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 1 1/4 cups ricotta 1/3 cup pine nuts, toasted<br> 24 crostini (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> Instructions: Preheat the broiler to high.

Leave one side of the grill off for indirect heat. Separate the ground chuck into 4 equal balls (about 6 ounces each). Wrap the beer can with aluminum foil and spray with a bit of cooking spray. Firmly press the bottom of the can into one of the balls, forming a \meat bowl.\ Gently slide out the can, then seal any cracks in the meat and make sure the sides of the bowl are even. Repeat with the remaining balls. Place a slice of Cheddar in each meat bowl, followed by about a tablespoon of barbecue sauce, 1/4 cup of the sauteed mushrooms, some of the crispy crumbled bacon, 2 more slices of cheese and 4 jalapeno slices. Place the burgers on the indirect heat side of the grill, close the lid and grill until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees F and the cheese is bubbly and gooey, 20 to 30 minutes. Place the burgers on the onion rolls, eat and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 67150,&quot;Hot Strawberry Biscuits 1 cup sifted unbleached all purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/8 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 3 tablespoons vegetable shortening, chilled 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup diced strawberries 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons lemon juice 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the rosemary and lemon zest, and mix until combined. Quickly blend in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Make a well in the center and stir in the buttermilk and strawberries until just blended. Do not over mix. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead gently 2 to 3 times. Pat the dough into a circle about 1/2-inch thick. Using a 3 inch round cookie cutter, cut out biscuits and place on a baking sheet. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Transfer biscuits to a rack to cool. In a bowl, combine the melted butter, sugar, and lemon juice and zest. Brush glaze over warm biscuits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 67151,&quot;Bulgur Salad with Green Onion Vinaigrette 3/4 cup medium-grind bulgur 1/2 small red onion, finely diced 2 plum tomatoes, finely diced 1 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh mint leaves 4 green onions, sliced, plus 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 1 tablespoon buckwheat honey 1 serrano cl, chopped 1/2 cup canola oil or olive oil 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place bulgur in a large bowl, pour 3 cups boiling water over, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well, squeezing out as much water as possible, if needed. Return the cooked bulgur to the bowl and mix in the onion, tomatoes, parsley, mint, and 4 sliced green onions. Place the lime juice, honey, serrano, and 1/2 cup chopped green onion in a blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the oil until emulsified. If the mixture appears too thick, blend in a few tablespoons of cold water, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the salad to a platter and drizzle with the green onion vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 67152,&quot;Valentine&#39;s Day Truffles 1/3 cup honey 1/2 cup (4 ounces) semisweet chocolate, cut into small pieces 1/2 cup (4 ounces) bittersweet chocolate, cut into small pieces 1 stick butter, cut into small pieces 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted 2 tablespoons dark rum 1 cup chocolate sprinkles, for rolling 3/4 teaspoon coarse (but somewhat small size) sea salt Instructions: In a small skillet, simmer the honey until it becomes medium brown in color and has a light, caramel scent. Remove from heat and keep warm. In a medium bowl, combine the 2 types of chocolate and butter. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and melt the chocolate, making sure to stir often. Once the chocolate has completely melted remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in the caramelized honey, rum and powdered sugar. Transfer mixture to a cool bowl and allow it to \set\ a little, about 5 minutes. Combine the sprinkles and salt in a bowl. Using your hands roll the chocolate mixture into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Roll them in the chocolate sprinkle/salt mixture until they are generously coated. Place on serving tray or store them in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67153,&quot;Butterscotch-Walnut Cookies 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup butterscotch chips 1/2 cup roughly chopped walnuts Instructions: Beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until fluffy. Add the vanilla and egg and beat to combine. Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until just combined. Stir in the butterscotch chips and walnuts. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop slightly mounded tablespoons of the dough and roll into balls. Arrange the balls about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the cookies until they are set and golden on the bottom, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67154,&quot;Roasted Poblano Quesadillas 2 large poblanos 4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 large flour tortillas 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese Instructions: Heat the broiler to high. Char the poblanos under the broiler to blacken their skins on all sides, 7 to 8 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand 10 minutes. Peel and seed the peppers, then slice. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and add a tortilla, cover the tortilla with 1/2 cup cheese and 1/4 of the peppers. Fold the tortilla in half and cook 2 minutes to crisp and char the tortilla evenly and melt cheese. Remove and cut into wedges; repeat. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 67155,&quot;Pyrotechnic Pineapple 1 ripe pineapple 3 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons granulated sugar 3 ounces orange flavored liqueur or dark rum 1 pint vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt Instructions: Sit the pineapple on its side and slice it in half, starting at the bottom and slicing all the way up through the leafy section. Chisel out the core of each half. Discard. Then cut around the fleshy sections with a knife (as you would a grapefruit). Remove flesh with a spoon and cut into small chunks. Reserve both the flesh and the rinds. Melt butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add pineapple chunks, but none of the juice, and stir occasionally for 5 minutes. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar and stir occasionally for 30 seconds, or until it has dissolved. Repeat the same process, 1 tablespoon at a time, with the remaining sugar. Pour in liqueur, let it heat up for 10 seconds, then ignite. Place a single scoop of ice cream in each of the hollowed-out pineapple shells and pour half the contents of pan overtop each. Serve immediately with 2 spoons per couple. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 67156,&quot;Camping Sandwiches 2 slices Pullman bread 3 tablespoons chili (see the recipe for Smoky Bean Chili, page 40 or use your favorite), room temp 2 tablespoons shredded sharp Cheddar cheese 1 teaspoon diced sweet pickles 1 teaspoon diced sweet onion Nonstick cooking spray 2 slices Pullman bread 2 tablespoons softened cream cheese 2 tablespoons berry preserves (such as blueberry, strawberry, raspberry) Nonstick cooking spray 2 slices Pullman bread 2 tablespoons marinara sauce 1 tablespoon shredded mozzarella 3 thin slices of pepperoni, julienned 1 pinch of dried oregano Nonstick cooking spray 2 slices Pullman bread 3 tablespoons leftover mac-n- cheese 1 tablespoon shredded Fontina or cheddar cheese 1 teaspoon crumbled cooked bacon, optional Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: Conventional cooking method: To make these at home, cook them over a gas burner. Hold the press directly over a medium-high flame and cook for 2 minutes, turning multiple times. The heat is more concentrated, so they cook faster than over a campfire.<br> You&#39;ll need: Campfire, sandwich presses, foil-wrapped bricks<br> Prep-Ahead Tip: Set the sandwich presses over the fire to heat up as you prepare the sandwiches so they&#39;re nice and hot when you&#39;re ready for some toasting action.<br> Camping Sandwich Combos:<br> Make other pressed sandwiches by stuffing a variety of camping leftovers into the sandwich, such as pulled pork with BBQ sauce; shredded smoked chicken and sliced green chiles; steak and peppers from fajitas; or ground turkey with Jack cheese, fire-roasted tomato salsa, and black beans.<br> For a breakfast sandwich, try diced roasted potatoes and crumbled chorizo with shredded Cheddar and scrambled eggs.<br> You can make dessert camping sandwiches as well. Slice them or serve whole: sauteed peaches and sweetened ricotta; peanut butter and strawberries; sliced apples and caramel sauce; roasted pineapple, bananas, and honey; chocolate chunks, marshmallows, and graham cracker crumbs; sliced ripe banana, brown sugar, and Nutella. Camping sandwiches can be prepared ahead of time and made in either square or circular presses-both work fine. Depending on your make and model, adjust the filling amounts so the sandwiches are full but not too full (or they&#39;ll ooze while being toasted). The fillings can vary, and it&#39;s a good way to utilize leftover chili, mac-n- cheese, and other ingredients when camping.<br> For circular sandwiches, punch out the bread into 4-inch circles or the size of your sandwich press.<br> Prepare a campfire with wood and wait until the flames die down and the coals glow red with white ash. Place a grilling rack so that it sits just above the coals. Place the presses on the grill so they heat up.<br> Assemble each sandwich with the desired fillings, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Remove the presses from the hot grill, open, and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place a sandwich in each press (it will sizzle-this preheating helps it form a nice crispy crust) and close tightly. Place on the grill and cook for 1 or 2 minutes per side. You can check the sandwich as it cooks by opening the press and checking the color-it should be golden brown and crispy on both sides when done. (Depending on how hot your coals are, you can also place the press directly on coals to make it cook faster-just keep an eye on it!) Be sure to use room temperature (versus cold) ingredients in the filling-otherwise lower the flame and toast the sandwich for a longer amount of time to sufficiently warm the filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 67157,&quot;Herbed Brown Rice and Chicken 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon butter 1 3/4 cups Swanson? Chicken Stock 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves, crushed 1 1/2 cups uncooked quick-cooking brown rice 1 cup frozen peas 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Season the chicken with the garlic powder and black pepper.

Place over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens to the consistency of a pudding, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter a couple of cubes at a time. Set aside to cool. For the trifle: Beat the heavy cream to stiff peaks in a large bowl with an electric mixer. In another bowl, stir together the mascarpone, confectioners&#39; sugar and liqueur. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the whipped cream. Dollop a quarter of the cream mixture on the bottom of a 3-quart trifle dish. Cover with a layer of ladyfingers, breaking them up if necessary to cover the bottom of the dish entirely. Spread a third of the curd over the cookies. Cover with about 1/2 cup of the raspberries, spreading them evenly. Dollop and spread one-quarter of the cream mixture on top of the raspberries. Repeat the layers of cookies, curd, raspberries and cream mixture 2 more times, ending with the cream mixture (the layers will depend on the size and shape of your dish; you might have more or less layers). Chill the trifle for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. When ready to serve, decorate the top of the trifle with the orange slices and remaining raspberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 67161,&quot;Theatrical Blood 1/2 cup golden corn syrup 2 tablespoons chocolate syrup 1 tablespoon red food coloring Instructions: Whisk together the corn syrup, chocolate syrup and food coloring until well blended. Place a sheet or tablecloth on cardboard so as not to stain the work surface. Use your fingers to drip the blood all over the fabric wearing latex gloves, making it look like blood spatter. Use your hand to make bloody handprints. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec]&quot; 67162,&quot;Mommy Anderson&#39;s Oyster Dressing Turkey or chicken giblets and neck bone 1/4 onion wedge<br> 2 1/2 cups chicken stock 16 ounces shucked oysters in their liquor 4 cups herbed stuffing cubes 4 cups corn bread stuffing cubes 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 4 tablespoons butter 1 cup chopped celery 1 cup chopped onion 12 fresh sage leaves, chopped 12 sprigs fresh thyme, striped and gently chopped 4 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a pot, add the giblets, neck bone, onion and stock. Simmer and cook on low for 20 minutes. Discard the onion and neck bone. Remove the remaining giblets and chop. Place back in the stock and set aside. Strain the oysters over the pot of stock and set aside the oysters. In a large bowl, mix all the stuffing cubes with the parsley and set aside. In a saute pan on medium heat, add 2 tablespoons butter, celery, onions, sage, thyme and garlic. Season with a pinch of salt and a nice grind of pepper. Cook until the onions and celery are tender, but the garlic is not browned. Remove to the bowl of bread cubes. In the same pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the oysters. Saute until the edges begin to curl on the oysters. Remove to the bowl of stuffing cubes and stir to combine with everything. Pour the stock over the mixture and stir. This is a wet dressing, so it will be very moist. Pour into a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Press down to make it compact, and then cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 45 minutes, then raise the temperature to 400 degrees F and bake uncovered until golden brown on top, about 15 minutes more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67163,&quot;Chocolate-Hazelnut Sandwich Cookies 1/3 cup blanched hazelnuts 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg, at room temperature 2 tablespoons milk 1 tablespoon hazelnut liqueur Red coarse sugar, for decorating 1/2 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Spread the hazelnuts on a small baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Let cool. Transfer the hazelnuts to a resealable plastic bag and finely crush with a rolling pin. Whisk the crushed hazelnuts with the flour, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg, then the milk, then the hazelnut liqueur, beating well after each addition. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined (the consistency will be more like a thick batter than a cookie dough). Transfer the dough to a large resealable plastic bag. Cut a 1/2-inch opening at one corner. Pipe 1-inch mounds about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Tap each pan on the counter a few times to flatten the mounds slightly. Sprinkle half of the mounds with coarse sugar (these will be the tops). Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are flattened and the edges are golden, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes on the pans, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Sandwich the chocolate-hazelnut spread between the cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 67164,&quot;Angel Food Cake with Chocolate Hazelnut Frosting 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips<br> 1/2 cup chocolate hazelnut spread, such as Nutella<br> 1 teaspoon instant espresso<br> 1/8 teaspoon salt<br> One store-bought 9-inch angel food cake or pound cake, halved around the equator<br> Edible flowers<br> Instructions: Pour the heavy cream into in to a small saucepan set over medium-high heat. Heat until small bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan. Place the chocolate chips, hazelnut spread, espresso and salt in a medium bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let stand for 1 minute to soften. Starting in the center of the bowl, whisk the chocolate mixture in small circles until smooth and combined. Cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. Using an electric hand mixer on medium speed, beat the chocolate mixture until light, slightly thickened and spreadable, 5 minutes. Place the bottom half of the cake on a cake plate. Spread one-quarter of the frosting on top of the cake, leaving a 1/4-inch edge. Place the top half of the cake on the frosting, smooth-side up and gently press down to seal the cake halves. Use a rubber spatula to spoon the rest of the frosting on top of the cake. Using a small offset spatula, push the extra frosting over the sides and the top. Smooth the sides until completely covered. Smooth the top of the cake or make a decorative pattern. Store the cake in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Bring the cake to room temperature for 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with colorful edible flowers to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 67165,&quot;Serranos en Escabeche 1 1/2 pounds serrano or jalapeno chiles 3/4 cup olive oil 2 medium white onions, cut into 1/2-inch slices 3 medium carrots, cut into 1/2-inch slices 1 head of garlic, separated into cloves but not peeled 2 cups white wine vinegar 1/2 cup water 2 tablespoons salt 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled 3 sprigs fresh marjoram, leaves only, finely chopped 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only, finely chopped Instructions: Wash the chiles, leaving the stems intact.

Set up 3 medium bowls: fill one with the flour mixed with the salt and pepper; fill the second with the eggs; spread the breadcrumbs in the third. Dip the chicken thighs in the flour, coating them evenly. Next, dip in the egg wash, coating so no flour shows underneath. Finally, dip in the breadcrumbs, making sure the thighs are evenly covered. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet to about 350 degrees F. Fry the chicken until golden brown on both sides and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and set aside. For the sauce: Roughly chop the garlic and small-dice the shallot, then throw them into the skillet to saut. As soon as the garlic and shallots start to color, deglaze the pan with the white wine and cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken stock and reduce by half. Over low heat, whisk in the olive oil and butter to thicken the sauce. Add the capers, parsley and the juice of 1 lemon. Transfer the sauce to a container and set aside. Halve the other 2 lemons and sear them in the skillet, cut-side down, until caramelized. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, salt and pepper. Toss with the frisee. Place the crispy chicken on plates, cover with lemon-caper sauce, top with frisee salad and garnish with a burnt lemon half. Sprinkle with chervil, tarragon, parsley and a generous amount of Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 67168,&quot;Paratha 2 cups atta (soft and fine whole wheat flour; see Cook\u2019s Note), plus more for dusting Kosher salt, optional<br> 1/4 cup ghee or avocado oil<br> Instructions: Combine the atta with 1 cup of water in a large steel or glass mixing bowl. Mix well and knead to form a smooth dough. It should not be too soft or too firm. You might need to add a few tablespoons of water if the dough is too firm, but be careful to add a little at a time so you don\u2019t overdo it. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 balls. Keep a bowl of atta and some kosher salt nearby. Flatten one of the balls into a patty and dip the patty lightly in the flour. Roll into a thin round (about 5 inches in diameter). Lightly brush the top with the ghee or oil. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt if desired and very lightly dust with a pinch of flour. Fold over to make a semicircle. Brush the top with ghee and sprinkle with salt and flour again. Fold over to make a triangle. Roll it again to end in a thin triangle (as thin as it was when you first rolled the ball). Don\u2019t worry if some of the oil oozes out or if the shape is not perfect.<br> Heat a seasoned cast-iron skillet or a heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.<br> When the skillet is hot, add the paratha and dry-cook it until light brown spots appear on each side, about a minute per side. Then, add about 1/2 teaspoon ghee and cook each side until the spots darken and the paratha becomes slightly crispy and has a glazed look, about 30 seconds per side. If you like it extra crispy or \u2018karak\u2019 as we say in Hindi, cook it a little longer. Repeat with the other balls. Once you get the hang of it, you can roll the next ball while cooking the previous one.<br> In India, we put the parathas in an insulated chapati box or insulated casserole dish to keep warm as we go.

Place the baby new potatoes with skins on into a large saucepan of cold, salted water, place the saucepan onto a medium heat and bring the potatoes to boil. Boil the potatoes for about 15 minutes, until a knife can easily be inserted, but potatoes are not falling apart. Drain potatoes and place them back into the pan. Using a fork roughly mash up leaving nice big potato chunks. Mix in the grated cheese, heavy cream, butter and black pepper. Take a foil lined baking sheet and place 4 rings (2-inches wide) on top. Fill each ring with potato mixture and place in oven for 20 minutes until the top is nice and golden brown. Using a wide spatula, transfer the ring of potatoes to each plate. Holding the edge of the hot ring with a kitchen towel, cut around the potatoes to loosen them. Remove the ring and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 67171,&quot;Ground Chicken and Blue Cheese Burgers 1/2 cup mayo 1 tablespoon roasted garlic puree 1 tablespoon minced fresh tarragon Salt and ground white pepper 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 1 1/2 pounds ground chicken meat 6 ounces blue cheese 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon ground white pepper 4 brioche buns 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup raw baby spinach leaves 4 tomato slices, thick cut Instructions: For the tarragon aioli: In a bowl, whisk together the mayo, garlic puree and tarragon. Taste and season with salt and white pepper as desired. For the chicken burgers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Over medium-high heat, warm a large ovenproof saute pan with the oil. Form the chicken into 4 equal patties, and then form a pocket in the center of each burger. Fill the center with a quarter of the blue cheese, and then fold the edges to seal the cheese in the burgers. Sprinkle the stuffed burgers with the salt and pepper and sear in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and finish cooking until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.

Cover the bottom of the pan with the pound cake, using any extra pieces to line the sides of the pan if desired. Scoop the chocolate ice cream onto the cake layer. Spread with an offset spatula to make a smooth top. Scoop the strawberry ice cream over the chocolate layer and smooth the top. Scoop the pistachio ice cream over the strawberry layer and smooth the top. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Unmold the cake by running a knife around the edge of it, then unhinge the springform and remove. Invert the cake onto a sheet of plastic wrap and remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment. Place a plate on the bottom and invert once more. Put the heavy cream, chocolate syrup, confectioners&#39; sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl and whip with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. (This makes enough frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake with additional to pipe decorations if desired.) Frost the top and sides of the cake with the whipped cream frosting and sprinkle with the pistachios. If the cake begins to get too soft, put it back into the freezer for a few minutes. Freeze another 1 1/2 to 2 hours or overnight. Before serving, let the cake sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 67174,&quot;Stone Fruit Salsa with Cinnamon Chips 6 cups chopped mixed stone fruit (apricots, cherries, peaches, plums) 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon minced fresh basil 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch kosher salt 1/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 6 (8-inch) flour tortillas 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted Instructions: For the salsa: In a large mixing bowl, combine the mixed stone fruits, honey, basil, lemon juice, cinnamon and salt.

Add the lard and butter and mix with your hands until crumbly. Slowly add the water and mix until the dough comes together, then coat with flour to prevent sticking. Refrigerate the dough for a minimum of 2 hours and preferably overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out the dough into a 1/8-inch-thick square on a lightly floured surface, then cut the into six 7-by-7-inch squares. For the apple filling: Peel and core the apples. Place an apple in the center of each dough square. Put 1 piece of butter into the center of each apple. Push some brown sugar down on top of the butter until packed tight. Put a second piece of butter on top of the sugar. Sprinkle cinnamon liberally across the dough and the filled apples. Fold opposite corners of the dough up around each apple, and then turn over and mold the rest of the dough over the apples, being careful not to leave any parts of the apples exposed. Tear off any excess dough on the bottom of each apple. Place the apples in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.

Finely chop the garlic, using the side of the knife to periodically mash it against the cutting board, until it becomes a smooth paste. (You can also do this in a mortar and pestle.) To make the aioli in a mini food processor, put the garlic paste in a mini food processor, add the lemon juice and egg yolks and pulse to combine. With the machine running, add the neutral oil a few drops at a time, making sure it incorporates into the yolks and the mixture emulsifies. Once all of the neutral oil is added, scrape down the sides of the work bowl and add the olive oil in the same manner. (If the machine seems like it is working too hard or straining while adding the oil, add the tablespoon of water at this point to loosen the mixture a bit; otherwise, add the tablespoon of water once all of the oil has been added.) Mix in the cayenne. The aioli should be thick, shiny and smooth, with a spreadable consistency similar to jarred mayonnaise. If you want a slightly thinner sauce, add 1 to 2 tablespoons additional water slowly, with the machine running, until you reach the desired consistency. Serve chilled or at room temperature. To make the aioli by hand, dampen a kitchen towel and roll up. Form the towel roll into a circle and anchor a bowl in the center. Whisk together the garlic paste, lemon juice and egg yolks in the bowl. Whisk the oils into the mixture as directed above, using one hand to add the oil drop by drop and the other to whisk constantly. Add the oil very slowly at first. Once the mixture has formed a thick emulsification, you can stream the oil in a little faster. If it gets too thick, add the water to loosen it up and continue. Mix in the cayenne. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 67188,&quot;Eggplant and Pepper Tian on Fried Eggplant 4 cups small dice eggplant, lightly salted to release excess water and bitterness 2 cups peeled and brunoised red pepper 2 cups peeled and brunoised yellow pepper 1/2 cup brunoised apple-wood smoked bacon 5 garlic cloves, crushed 2 teaspoons chiffonaded basil 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon freshly picked thyme Salt and freshly ground black pepper Fried Eggplant, recipe follows 1 Japanese eggplant Salt, to purge the eggplant 1 cup buttermilk 1 cup flour, seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Spread a 1/4-inch bed of salt in a baking dish and top with the potatoes. Prick the top of the potatoes. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked throughout. Meanwhile, make the prosciutto bits. Place a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Place prosciutto in heated pan. Drizzle bits with olive oil, and cook, stirring. The prosciutto will give off steam for about 5 minutes while it releases its moisture. When the hiss of steam turns to a sizzle, turn the heat down to medium low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the prosciutto bits are crisp, about 25 to 30 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bits to several thicknesses of paper towel to drain. The bits will crisp even more as they cool. (Use immediately or freeze the bits for up to 6 months and warm in a skillet as needed.) Remove the potatoes from the oven. Cut an x in the top of each potato, and push in the sides to split open.

Then peel off 8 of the outermost, larger green leaves and remove the tough core with a pairing knife. Have a ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and blanch the 8 cabbage leaves until tender but not falling apart, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately shock the leaves in the ice water to stop the cooking. Dry the leaves thoroughly between paper towels and set aside. Lay one very long piece of plastic wrap on the counter. Lay 2 cabbage leaves on the plastic wrap, overlapping just a bit. Dot the cabbage with 1 teaspoon of the truffle butter. Season one breast with salt and set it on one edge of the cabbage leaves and fold the excess cabbage over the breast. If there is excess, cut with kitchen shears. Continue to wrap the pheasant breast tightly with the plastic wrap, so the plastic goes twice around; there should be extra wrap on the ends to tie off into a knot. Repeat with the remaining breasts. Seal the breasts in sous vide bags. Using an immersion circulator to keep a constant temperature, cook the breasts at 144 degrees F for 30 minutes. Melt the butter in a saucepan set over low heat. Add the squash and cook until almost tender, not allowing it to brown at all. Add the water, cover the pan, and simmer until almost no water remains. Use a hand blender to blend until smooth.

About 20 minutes before roasting, remove the pork from the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Put the red onions in a metal roasting pan and set a rack on top. Wrap the pork with the bacon (see below), then set on the rack. Roast until the bacon is crisp and a thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 145 degrees F, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer the pork to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the gravy: Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings from the pan. Place the roasting pan over 2 burners over medium-low heat and whisk in the flour until incorporated. Add the chicken broth and whisk until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Remove the twine and slice the pork. Serve with the onions and gravy. How to wrap pork: Lay the bacon slices over the pork, overlapping them slightly and tucking them under. Tie a piece of kitchen twine around each slice to secure it.

Heat remaining 4 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan over a medium to high heat. When hot, add bay leaves, cardamon pods, cinnamon, fennel seeds, cloves and urad dal. Stir and fry briefly until urad dal turns red, then add curry leaves, if using. Stir once or twice and add onions. Fry onions until they are soft and lightly colored. Now add the spice paste. Continue to stir and fry for about 4 to 6 minutes, adding a little water to prevent sticking. Add the tomato and stir and fry for another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken pieces to the onion and spice mixture. Stir until they are well coated then add 2 1/2 cups water, just enough to cover. Bring to a boil.

Coat the foil with cooking spray. In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk. Cook, stirring, until melted and smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan and spread to even out the surface. Top with spoonfuls of the peanut butter. Using a skewer or butter knife, swirl the peanut butter into the chocolate mixture. Sprinkle over the crushed chips and pretzels. Let the fudge cool for 30 minutes on the counter, then lightly cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Lift the foil out of the pan and peel it from the fudge. Cut into small squares to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 67216,&quot;Chocolate-Covered Strawberry Bars 1 stick unsalted butter 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 large egg 1 1/4 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/2 cup sliced almonds 1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (or 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract) 1 1-ounce package freeze-dried strawberries 2 cups white chocolate chips 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening Instructions: Make the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on all sides. Melt the butter with the cocoa powder, sugar and espresso powder in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk the heavy cream and egg in a small bowl. Whisk in a few tablespoons of the butter-cocoa mixture, then pour into the saucepan. Cook, whisking, until combined and thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the graham cracker crumbs, coconut, almonds and vanilla bean paste. Press the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake until set, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely in the pan. Make the filling: Pulse half of the freeze-dried strawberries (about 1 cup) in a food processor until slightly powdery with a few pieces remaining. Set aside the remaining strawberries for topping. Put the white chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan, then pour over the white chocolate chips. Let sit until softened, 3 to 5 minutes; stir until smooth. (If the chips are not fully melted, microwave in 20-second intervals until smooth.) Stir in the strawberry powder. Spread over the cooled crust. Cover and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Make the topping: Microwave the semisweet chocolate chips with the shortening in a small microwave-safe bowl in 20-second intervals, stirring, until melted and smooth. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Spread evenly over the filling. Gently crush the reserved freeze-dried strawberries and sprinkle over the top. Cover and refrigerate until set. Lift out of the pan using the parchment overhang and cut into bars. Freeze-dried strawberries have a ton of flavor. You just have to make sure you don?t pulverize them into too fine a powder; you want to be able to see the nice red flecks. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 67217,&quot;Chicken Parm Hero 1 10-inch, loaf of French or Italian bread Tomato sauce 1 clove garlic Mozzarella cheese Leftover chicken Parmesan Oregano Instructions: Slice loaf in half, place on baking sheet and toast under broiler. Once toasted, rub with split garlic clove. Warm chicken in microwave oven. Once warm, place on bread. Top with sauce, cheese, and a sprinkle of oregano. Return sandwich to oven and broil until cheese bubbles. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Barbera]&quot; 67218,&quot;Miso Honey Glazed Fish 2 tablespoons light or white miso 2 tablespoons honey 4 (6-ounce) black cod or halibut fillets, 3/4 to 1-inch thick Instructions: Heat the oven to 475 degrees F. Whisk together the miso and honey in a small bowl. Lay the fish fillets in a 6 by 10-inch glass baking dish and brush with the glaze. Put the dish in the oven on the middle rack and bake until the fish reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in the dish for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 67219,&quot;Shrimp and Zucchini Risotto 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 5 small zucchini, cubed 2 tablespoons butter 3 shallots, finely chopped 8 ounces acquello rice 1 1/4 cups dry white wine 4 cups vegetable broth, heated 12 ounces fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 handful fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, optional Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini and cook for about 15 minutes. (I do not cook the zucchini with the risotto, as it would get too soft; by sauteing it on a higher flame I&#39;m able to achieve a different texture, and I like it much better when added to the rice.) Remove the zucchini to a plate and reserve. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a second large skillet over medium-high heat until the butter is melted and foamy. Add the shallots and saute until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring, to toast it. Stir in 1 cup wine, reduce the heat to a medium-low simmer and let the alcohol evaporate for about 3 minutes. Stir the rice constantly; do not get distracted and let it become dry. As the liquid gets absorbed, begin adding the vegetable broth, one ladle at a time.<br> Meanwhile, as your risotto is cooking and while you are stirring, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet. When the butter is melted, add the shrimp and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add about three-quarters of the parsley and remaining 1/4 cup wine. Cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes, and when the shrimp turn bright pink remove from the heat and set aside. Do not discard the juice.<br> Once the risotto has cooked for 20 to 25 minutes, and as your vegetable broth is almost finished, start tasting the rice and feel its consistency. If it needs more time on the stove, you can ladle in some warm water to keep it going a few minutes more. Stir in a couple tablespoons of cheese, if using. (Italians do not like to see cheese and fish together, so I use Parmesan almost as a seasoning while I cook the rice.)<br> If you&#39;ve done everything right, this is the moment to stir in the already browned zucchini and the cooked shrimp; the sauce from the shrimp will help the risotto gain the final 5 minutes of cooking time without the need of any additional water.<br> Ladle the risotto into serving bowls. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and drizzle with olive oil.<br> Wine suggestion for this recipe: Pinot Grigio &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Chianti]&quot; 67220,&quot;Mexican Pizza 1 pound chorizo 1/2 cup medium salsa 4 (8-inch) premade pizza crusts (recommended: Boboli) 1 can black refried beans 1 package 4 cheese Mexican blend Shredded lettuce Finely chopped tomatoes Chopped tortilla chips Ranch dressing Instructions: In a skillet over medium heat, brown chorizo. Add salsa and simmer for 5 minutes. Lay pizza crusts on pizza pan or baking sheet covered in foil. Spread refried black beans over top of pizza crusts. Evenly spread chorizo mixture over beans.

Don&#39;t worry about losing the liquid, as it&#39;s not the coconut milk called for in cooking. Each coconut should break in 3 to 4 pieces. It is also possible to open a coconut by piercing the eyes of the coconut with a screwdriver or ice pick, draining the liquid through the holes and placing the coconut in a 400 degrees F oven for 20 minutes. Wrap the coconut in a towel and hit it with a hammer to loosen the shell and split it into pieces. Pry out the white meat and then pare off the dark skin. Grating Coconut Meat: To grate the white meat, put the meat through the grating disk of a food processor or use a hand grater. You should get about 7 cups of grated coconut from the two coconuts, which will keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. Reserve 4 cups of the grated coconut for the pie crust and filling. Coconut Liquado: To make the coconut milk, combine the remaining 3 to 4 cups of loosely packed grated coconut with the milk (use 3/4 cup of coconut for each 1 cup of milk) in a heavy saucepan. Heat slowly, bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat and cool. Strain the milk, pressing down on the coconut meat to extract all the liquid. Squeeze all the coconut through a towel to get any last drops. Discard the coconut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 67222,&quot;Mojito Slushy 1 cup sugar 1 cup water 1/2 cup fresh lime juice, about 4 to 6 limes 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, firmly packed 2 limes, zested 1/2 cup light rum 8 cups crushed ice Mint sprigs and lime wedges, for garnish Instructions: In a saucepan over medium heat, add the sugar and water. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is clear. Set aside to cool. Put the sugar syrup, lime juice, mint leaves, lime zest, and rum into a blender and blend until smooth. Add the ice and blend until slushy. Spoon into glasses; garnish with a sprig of mint and a lime slice. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67223,&quot;Coffee Granita 1 cup water 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 1/4 cups brewed coffee, cooled 1/4 cup coffee liqueur (recommended: Tia Maria) 1/2 lemon, zested Instructions: In a small saucepan, combine the water with the sugar. Stir to blend. Bring to a simmer over low heat, then transfer to a bowl to cool. Refrigerate. Whisk all of the remaining ingredients in a small bowl, then stir in the syrup. Pour the mixture into a baking sheet and freeze until it hardens, about 3 to 4 hours. When ready to serve, scrape the surface with the tines of a fork to remove the granita in large flakes. Spoon into serving glasses or bowls and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67224,&quot;Cauliflower Fritters 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 to 2 teaspoons coriander seeds 1 splash red wine vinegar 1 small bunch cilantro leaves, snipped with scissors 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed 1 tablespoon turmeric 1 tablespoon ground ginger 1 tablespoon canola oil, plus 6 cups for frying, divided 1 1/2 bottles beer, at room temperature 1 large head cauliflower, stemmed, broken into bite-size pieces, washed and thoroughly dried 1 tablespoon smoked paprika Water, for thinning Instructions: For the sauce: Put all of the ingredients into a bowl and toss to combine. For the fritters: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, turmeric and ground ginger. Add 1 tablespoon of canola oil and whisk in the beer. Set aside in a warm place because, like a bread dough, it will puff up slightly. Put the cauliflower in a medium-size bowl and use a small strainer to sprinkle it with an even layer of the paprika. Toss to coat. In a large pot, over medium heat, add the remaining 6 cups of canola oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Prepare a baking sheet fitted with paper towels or a kitchen towel to drain the florets as they come out of the oil. Stir the batter slightly. To test the consistency of the batter and the temperature of the oil, put a couple of pieces of cauliflower on a slotted spoon or spider (Chef&#39;s Note: Alternatively, use your fingers), and submerge them into the batter. It should coat the pieces lightly. (Chef&#39;s Note: If the batter is too thick, add a little water to thin it out. If the batter is too thin, sift and whisk in a little more flour.) Test 1 piece of cauliflower to check for seasoning. Drain the excess batter and lower the cauliflower bite into the oil. It should bubble slightly and the cauliflower should gradually rise to the surface. Fry until golden brown on all sides and transfer the piece to a kitchen towel. Season with salt and, when cool enough, taste. Season the remaining uncooked cauliflower with salt, if desired, prior to dredging in the batter. Fry the cauliflower in small batches and drain on the prepared baking sheet. Season with salt, if desired, and transfer to a serving bowl. Garnish with the Cilantro-Ginger Sauce and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67225,&quot;Easy Pot Roast Stir-Fry 8 ounces beef sirloin, thinly sliced 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces small red bliss potatoes, sliced into 1/8-inch-thick half-moons 1 cup low-sodium beef broth 1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 4 ounces button mushrooms, sliced 2 medium carrots, sliced into 1/8-inch-thick coins 2 stalks celery, cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices 1 clove garlic, minced 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 2 scallions, sliced, plus more for sprinkling Buttered wide egg noodles or mashed potatoes, for serving Instructions: Toss the beef with 1/2 teaspoon of the cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl.

Drain the potatoes and set aside. Rinse the skillet and wipe dry. Whisk together the broth, soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch in a small bowl until the cornstarch dissolves. Set aside. Put the reserved skillet over medium-high heat and heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the mushrooms in 1 layer, season with salt and pepper and cook without stirring until the mushrooms are nicely browned on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of the oil to the skillet, then add the beef in a single layer. Cook without stirring until browned on one side but not completely cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet, then add the carrots and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute, then add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring continuously, until it turns a shade darker, about 30 seconds. Pour in the beef stock mixture, making sure all of the cornstarch is incorporated. Return the beef, mushrooms and potatoes to the skillet. Simmer until the sauce thickens and the flavors are blended, about 2 minutes. Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, parsley and scallions.

Pour the coconut rum, if using, and the spiced rum into separate bowls. Never pour alcohol into the hot pan straight from the bottle or the whole thing could go up in flames. Be prepared! Have four bowls of ice cream ready to go. Place a medium stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter, brown sugar, a pinch of kosher salt, cinnamon stick, cloves and cardamom pod. Stir until a sauce forms. Place the bananas cut-side down in the sauce and cook until caramelized, about 2 minutes each side. If desired, pull the cinnamon stick, cloves and cardamom pod from the pan now. When the sauce starts to foam, pull the pan off the heat and sprinkle in the coconut rum. Return the pan to the heat and cook for 30 seconds. Once again pull the pan off the heat and pour the spiced rum into the pan. Using a long gas lighter, light the contents of the pan away from the heat; it should immediately light up. Return the pan to the heat, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the flames go out.

In a bowl mix together; green onion, garlic, egg, bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. With a fork stir in ground turkey or chicken and season to taste with salt and pepper. (You can crumble some in a skillet, cook, taste, and then adjust seasoning). Shape mixture into small meatballs. In a large skillet heat olive oil. Add meatballs in a single layer and let them cook for 2 to 3 minutes a side, without disturbing. If they stick, loosen with a slotted spoon. Stir in tomato sauce into the skillet, cover and simmer 10 to 15 minutes (while spaghetti is cooking) to reheat sauce and cook meatballs through. Drain pasta and then return to the pot and toss with remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Dish out a portion of pasta on each plate and spoon some meatballs and sauce in center. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 67234,&quot;Omelet With Fried Sage and Gruyere 1 tablespoon canola oil 8 to 10 small fresh sage leaves, to taste Kosher salt 3 large eggs 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/4 to 1/2 cup grated gruyere cheese Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Fry the sage leaves: Heat a 6-to-8-inch nonstick skillet over high heat and add the oil. Have a tray lined with paper towels and a slotted spoon ready. When the oil begins to look thinner and spreads to the sides of the pan, turn off the heat and add the sage leaves. Stir them to coat with the oil and cook, stirring, until the sage pales slightly in color and gets slightly crisp, 45 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the leaves to the paper towels. Season them immediately with salt and allow them to cool. Reserve the skillet.<br> Blend the eggs: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1 teaspoon water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Whisk only enough to integrate the eggs; you don&#39;t want to whip too much air into them or make them frothy.<br> Cook the omelet: Return the skillet to medium heat, remove the excess oil and add the butter, swirling it as it melts so it coats the pan. When the butter is melted (but not browned), reduce the heat to medium low and pour in the egg mixture. Use a fork to stir the eggs slightly, as if you were scrambling them. Then allow the eggs to cook, undisturbed, until they start setting in the middle. Sprinkle the cheese and sage leaves over them. Cook until the eggs look almost fully cooked and only slightly loose, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Serve the omelet: Lift the handle of the pan, tilting the pan away from you and toward the heat. This tilting should cause the omelet to slide down in the pan a little. Using a heatproof spatula, fold the edge closest to you toward the center. Fold the other edge in toward the center and invert the pan over the center of a plate so the omelet lands seam-side down.

Proofing takes about 15 minutes. Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour in the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to 1 hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and divide into 6 equally sized balls. Cover with towel and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time. While the dough is rising, prepare the \base\ pizza topping. Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat and saute shallots and thyme until the onion begins to turn translucent. (If you are using dried mushrooms, remove them from their soaking liquid, lifting them out so all grit remains at the bottom.) Add the porcini to the pan, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook until tender. Remove from heat, stir in heavy cream, and scoop into a food processor. Pulse to chop and set aside to rest. This is your base topping Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. On a floured surface, stretch the dough into 6 (6 by 8-inch) ovals and shake cornmeal over both sides of the dough. (The crust will be par-baked on both sides on the stovetop before you add the topping to be baked.) In a heavy bottomed 12-inch skillet which has a lid, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat. (Swirl the oil to coat the entire inside of the skillet.) Transfer each dough oval to the skillet, allowing 1 side to lightly cook and stiffen up before flipping it over with tongs. When both sides of each oval are par-baked this way, transfer to a pizza stone. Spoon the base topping into the center of the now toasted crusts, spreading evenly over the surface. For the finishing topping, heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large saute pan and cook the porcini, cremini, shiitake, garlic and thyme until tender. Spread evenly over the base topping and lay fresh mozzarella slices over.

Take off the heat and add the cream, half-and-half, and vanilla bean, then bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t scorch on the bottom. When it reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes.<br> In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the still-hot cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat.<br> Meanwhile, half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Strain the mixture into the smaller bowl to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Whisk in the creme fraiche. Let cool, stirring often, then continue according to the directions of your ice cream maker.<br> Thoroughly clean the inside and outside of the paper milk quart container then cut off the top. Cram the ice cream into the container, packing it well to get rid of all the air pockets. Place in freezer for at least 6 hours. Warm Strawberry Salad: Puree the raspberries and sugar in a blender. Strain out the seeds and taste the puree for sweetness, adding more sugar if necessary. Divide the puree on 4 ovenproof plates and spread to evenly coat the bottom of each plate. Thinly slice the strawberries and carefully fan them out on top of the raspberry puree, starting at the edge of the plate and spiraling in to the center. Use 4 berries per plate. (The dessert can be made up to this point up to 8 hours in advance. Tightly cover each plate with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove the plastic wrap before baking.)<br> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Bake the strawberries 2 minutes, just until warmed. Or place in the microwave for 1 minute. Remove from the oven.<br> Take the ice cream out of the freezer and lay it on its side. With a serrated knife, leaving the ice cream in its container, cut a 1 1/2-inch slice off the end. Remove the container band around the slice and cut it into triangles along the diagonal. Place a wedge of ice cream in the center of each plate (it will start to melt immediately). Cut the honeycomb into 4 pieces and place on top of the ice cream. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67241,&quot;Grilled Fish Tacos 1 1/2 cups canola oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint<br> 1/4 cup chopped scallion tops or chives<br> 1 tablespoon toasted and ground cumin seeds<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika<br> 1/8 teaspoon cayennne pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds mild firm fish fillets, such as mahi mahi or Pacific cod<br> 1 pound tomatillos 3 to 4 jalapenos or 1 to 2 serrano chiles 1 onion, chopped<br> 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Lime juice 1/4 cup sour cream 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon milk, plus more if needed<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt Shredded cabbage<br> Lime juice Corn tortillas<br> Queso fresco, crumbled<br> Serving suggestions: lime wedges, chopped fresh cilantro and pico de gallo Instructions: For the marinade: Combine the oil, cilantro, mint, scallions, cumin, paprika, cayenne and some salt and pepper. Marinate the fish at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight. For the salsa verde: Place the tomatillos, jalapenos and onions in a pan, and cover with water. Boil until tender, then drain. Place the vegetables in a blender and add the cilantro. Blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and a little lime juice if needed. For the crema: Combine the sour cream and lemon juice. Add just enough milk to make the crema pourable, then season with salt and pepper.<br> For the tacos: Preheat a grill. Place the marinated fish on the hot grill, sprinkle lightly with salt and cook for about 2 minutes per side. Moisten the shredded cabbage with a little lime juice and salsa verde, toss to coat. When the fish is almost finished cooking, warm the tortillas on the grill until they are warm and pliable.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed, scraping down the bowl at least once during mixing, until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and 1 egg and beat to combine. Add the dry ingredients and beat on low until incorporated. Scrape down the bowl and continue to beat for 1 minute.<br> Remove half of the dough and set aside. Add the remaining 1/4 cup flour to the dough in the mixer with 5 drops orange food coloring. Mix, scraping down the bowl once halfway, until well combined, about 2 minutes. Remove the orange dough to a piece of plastic wrap and pat into a 1/2-inch-thick disc. Wrap well and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Add the reserved plain cookie dough back to the bowl. Add the cocoa powder and beat to combine. Remove the cocoa dough to a piece of plastic wrap and pat into a 1/2-inch-thick disc. Wrap well and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.<br> Unwrap both dough discs and place on a lightly floured work surface. Cut a 2 1/2-ounce piece of dough (approximately 1 inch by 4 1/2 inches) from the orange dough disc. Cut this piece in half lengthwise to form 2 long pieces (1/2 inch by 4 1/2 inches). Roll each piece into a 11-inch-long snake, dusting with additional flour as needed, and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.<br> Whisk together the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl for an egg wash. Dust the work surface and your hands lightly with flour, then press out the orange dough with your hands (see Cook&#39;s note) into a rectangle approximately 5 1/2 inches by 7 1/2 inches. Repeat with the cocoa dough. Brush the top surface of the orange dough very lightly with the egg wash (don&#39;t use too much or it might ooze out) and place the cocoa dough on top, pressing down gently to adhere. Cut the stacked rectangles in half lengthwise. Lightly brush the top of one of the cocoa dough layers with egg wash and place the second stacked layer on top. Press down gently to adhere. Repeat once more, cutting down the center, brushing, stacking and pressing. Use a piece of parchment to roll the stack into a log, gently squeezing the center to elongate it to 11 inches. Transfer to the parchment-lined baking sheet with the orange dough snakes and refrigerate for 1 hour.<br> Using lightly floured hands, gently pinch the top edge of each snake to form a triangular rope. Keeping the stripes of the dough log oriented horizontally within the log and with the orange side up, brush the top edge lightly with the egg wash. Adhere the 2 snakes along the top edge with about 1/2 inch of space between each to form the tigers&#39; ears. Use your fingers to gently press and seal the edges of the ears to the orange side of the log. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Trim about 1/8 inch from each end of the log to reveal an even and flat tiger face. Cut the remaining log into 24 pieces, each slightly thinner than 1/2 inch. Arrange 12 cookies evenly on each parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake, rotating the pans from front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until the cookies are firm to the touch and the bottoms and tips of the ears are just beginning to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets.<br> For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a bowl with a hand mixer). Slowly add 1 tablespoon of water while beating; continue to beat on high for 1 full minute, scraping down the sides of the bowl. You&#39;re looking for an icing with a pipeable consistency. If the icing is too thick, add more water 1 teaspoon at a time.<br> Transfer half of the icing to a resealable ziptop bag or disposable pastry bag fitted with a number 3 round tip.

Cut the pork belly into uniform cubes about the size of the scallops. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the scallops with salt and pepper and then add to the skillet. Add the butter to the skillet. When the bottom is golden brown, flip the scallop and cook for 1 minute. Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F. Alternatively, in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Deep-fry the pork belly until crispy, but not too hard. Drain the pork belly on a paper-towel-lined plate. In a bowl, toss the arugula, sliced strawberries and pistachios with some of the Vanilla Bean Vinaigrette. Mound the salad on the plate, then arrange the scallops and pork belly around the salad. Top with some Beurre Blanc and drizzle with the Pomegranate Agrodolce to serve. Place the vinegar, honey, mustard and vanilla seeds in the food processor, and pulse until mixed. Slowly drizzle in the oil with machine running until emulsified. In a saucepan set over medium-low heat, bring the vermouth and vinegar to a low simmer. Add the shallots and season with salt and pepper. Simmer to cook until the liquid reduces by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in 4 tablespoons of the butter until fully incorporated.

Stir to combine. Submerge the turkey in the brine and refrigerate for 3 days. The night before you roast the bird, remove it from the brine and pat it dry with paper towels. Make the herb butter: In a small bowl, combine the butter, rosemary, sage and some salt. Using your fingers, carefully work your way under the skin of the turkey to separate it from the breasts and legs. Massage the butter under the skin, then all over the bird. This acts like suntan lotion to create a lovely, crispy brown skin. Tie the turkey legs together with twine to keep the bird nice and compact for even cooking. In your roasting pan, for the gravy, combine the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme bundle and bay leaves. Season with salt. Plunk the turkey on top of the veggies and put it in the fridge overnight uncovered. Yes, that&#39;s right...uncovered. This allows the skin of the turkey to dry out, which will create a gorgeous brown crispy skin. Now a bunch of your prep work is out of the way, so all you have to do tomorrow is toss the turkey in the oven! Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Pour the wine into the roasting pan and put the turkey in the screaming-hot oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until it becomes beautifully browned. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Baste with the pan juices and rotate the pan every 30 minutes for the remainder of the cooking time; think 17 minutes per pound...you do the math. If the turkey starts to get too brown, tent it loosely with foil. Remove the turkey from the oven when an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh. (Be sure the thermometer is not touching a bone.) Transfer it to a rimmed baking sheet, cover with foil and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Make the gravy: Using a mesh strainer, strain the veggies out of the pan juices over a large bowl and allow the fat to rise to the top. Discard the veggies. Skim the fat from the pan juices, add it to a large saucepot and bring it to medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook until it has the consistency of wet sand, 4 to 5 minutes. Whisk the pan juices and stock into the flour mixture. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook until it is thick, 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and season with salt, if needed. Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 67321,&quot;Creamy Broccoli Soup (Frozen Broccoli) 1/2 stick butter 1 large onion, finely diced 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 4 to 6 cups low-sodium chicken stock, water, or combination One 10-ounce package frozen broccoli 1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Melt butter in large, heavy pot over medium-high heat.

Add 1/3 of the cubed butter, and pulse until combined. Add the remaining butter, and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the vinegar, then gradually add 1/4 cup ice water, pulsing until evenly combined. Squeeze the dough between your fingers; if it doesn&#39;t hold its shape, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water. Turn the dough out onto a flour-dusted surface, and press into a ball. Break off 1/3 of the dough and form into a ball; form the remaining piece into a second ball. Wrap both in plastic and flatten into 1-inch-thick squares. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. For the filling: Meanwhile, peel the potatoes, and slice 1/4 inch thick on a mandoline or with a sharp knife. Cook the bacon in a medium pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon, and let drain on a paper towel. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat. Cook the onions in the pot, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom, until softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the flour; when it coats the onions, gradually whisk in the half-and-half. Add the potatoes and salt, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring, until the mixture has thickened and the potatoes are softened just enough to pierce with a fork but offer some resistance, about 10 minutes. (They will continue to cook in the oven.) Remove the pot from the heat, and stir in the sour cream. Season with 1 teaspoon more salt and several grinds of pepper. Set aside to cool while you prepare the crust. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 425 degrees F. Spray an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray. To assemble: Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Roll the larger piece of dough into a 12-inch square about 1/8 inch thick. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking dish, pressing it into the corners as necessary. (Leave any overhang for pressing together with the top crust later.) Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the dough. Top with the potato mixture, and shake the pan to distribute evenly. Sprinkle the crispy bacon on top. Roll the remaining dough to 1/8 inch thick, and place it on top of the pie. Press it together with the overhanging bottom crust with your fingers to seal the edges, and trim to 1 inch around the dish. Roll the dough under, and press it into the top of the dish; crimp the edges with your fingers, or press with a fork. Cut slits into the top of the dough to allow steam to escape. Bake the pie on a rimmed baking sheet on the center rack for 30 minutes, then rotate the pie to allow even browning. Continue to bake until the dough is nicely browned, especially on the bottom and sides, and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife, 30 to 40 minutes more. Let cool for 25 minutes before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 67329,&quot;Bourbon BLT Baguette 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes 3 tablespoons bourbon<br> 3 cloves Roasted Garlic, recipe follows 2 egg yolks<br> Juice of 1 lemon<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 1 teaspoon hot sauce<br> 14 ounces canola oil<br> Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper<br> 1 pound thick-cut bacon (about 10 slices) 1 head romaine lettuce, top squared off, split in half<br> Olive oil<br> 1/2 lemon One 2-foot-long baguette<br> Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper<br> 1 small head garlic 1 teaspoon olive oil<br> Salt and pepper<br> Instructions: For the bourbon-tomato aioli: In a food processor, add the sun-dried tomatoes, bourbon, roasted garlic, egg yolks, lemon juice, tomato paste and hot sauce. Pulse to a paste. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the oil; process until the mixture emulsifies and becomes very thick. Season with salt and pepper. Store in the refrigerator. For the BLT Baguette: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment. Divide the bacon between the baking sheets. Bake until crispy, 50 to 55 minutes, depending on thickness. Meanwhile, heat a grill pan over medium heat. Drizzle the romaine with some olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill on each side for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the romaine to a work surface; squeeze lemon over each half, then cut off the stems and separate the leaves. Cut the ends off the baguette, then slice it down the middle into two foot-long lengths; ideally the bread should be the length of the bacon. Split each baguette half horizontally and spread 1 tablespoon of the aioli on each interior surface (top and bottom). Divide the bacon and romaine between the baguette halves, secure with skewers and slice each sandwich in half. You are ready to enjoy, or you can wrap the sandwiches in plastic wrap and refrigerate. They will still be delicious in a couple hours! Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut the top off of the garlic head, exposing the cloves but leaving the head intact. Set the garlic on a large piece of foil, drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Wrap up the foil to make a pouch and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the garlic is browned and soft, 35 to 45 minutes.

Using paper towels, pat the roast dry to help get a great crust on the meat. Sprinkle the roast generously with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons oil and heat until glossy. Add the roast and brown on all sides. Remove and transfer to a cutting board or a large plate. Add more oil to the pot if needed, along with the carrots, celery and onions. Season with salt and pepper. Add the fresh herb bundle and cook until the vegetables start to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and continue cooking for another minute. Add 3/4 cup of the red wine and reduce by half, scraping up the seared bits and incorporating them into the juice. Then return the roast to the pot and add the beef broth. Bring the liquid to a simmer before covering with a tight-fitting lid and placing the pot in the oven. Allow the roast to cook until fork tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours, turning once halfway through. Remove from the oven and transfer the roast to a large cutting board. Tent with foil while the roast rests. Placing the Dutch oven back on the stovetop over medium-high heat, add the remaining 1/4 cup of red wine to the liquid and reduce by half at a simmer, about 10 minutes. Strain the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Shred the roast into big chunks and toss with the jus. For the herb salad: Toss the watercress and picked parsley with the lemon juice and olive oil to taste. Season with salt and pepper and top with the toasted almonds Serve on top of the Risotto Cakes and top with the fresh herb salad. For the risotto: In a medium saucepan, heat the chicken broth to a simmer. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallots to the butter, cooking until fragrant and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the Arborio rice and lightly toast, stirring to coat in the butter and shallots. Add the white wine, continuing to cook while stirring until the wine is absorbed. You should be able to run your spoon through the risotto and have the indentation stay. Using a ladle, add enough of the warm chicken broth to cover the rice, stirring constantly over medium heat until the broth is completely absorbed. Repeat the process 3 more times, adding the broth in stages while continuing to stir. Once all of the chicken broth has been added and the rice is tender, add the peas, lemon juice and lemon zest and stir to combine. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, mozzarella and season with salt and pepper. Cool the risotto by spreading it evenly over a sheet tray. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. Once the risotto is cooled, form the mixture into burger-size patties, about 1-inch thick. Set up a dredging station with the flour in one dish, beaten eggs in another and panko breadcrumbs in another. Dip the rice patties into the flour, then into the eggs and finally coat them in the panko breadcrumbs. In a large skillet, heat 1/2-inch vegetable oil over medium heat until a pinch of panko sizzles when dropped in the oil. Working in batches of 2 to 3, fry the risotto cakes until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side (use a fish spatula under the cake and the back of a fork on top to help stabilize while flipping). Transfer to a wire rack, which will help them stay crispy. Season with salt and they are ready to serve.

You can make these into different shaped Berry Pie Pops such as hearts or stars. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Roll out the Perfect Pie Dough on a well-floured surface until it is 1/8-inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 16 rounds, for 8 pie pops. Place the rounds onto the prepared baking sheet. If the dough becomes too soft, place the entire baking sheet into the refrigerator to chill.<br> Place about 1 heaping tablespoon of the Berry Pie Filling in the center of 8 rounds, leaving a border about 1/4-inch from the edges. Place the lollypop stick in the middle of the 8 rounds through the filling and almost to the top of the rounds. Take the remaining 8 rounds and slightly stretch them out so they can fit over the filling. Brush the edges of all the rounds with egg wash. Place the 8 rounds on top of the filled rounds, egg wash side down. Press the edges together gently with your finger and then crimp the edges with a fork to make sure the edges are completely sealed. (Use a little flour on your fork to crimp the edges so your fork doesn&#39;t stick to the pie dough.) Brush the tops of each pie pop with egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Use a paring knife to cut small vents in each pop.<br> Bake the pie pops until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Once cooked, let them rest for a few moments before digging in.

On a gently floured piece of parchment paper, roll out the chilled Pie Dough to a circle about 15 to 16 inches in diameter. Trim it to form an even 14-inch circle. Invert a sheet pan so the flat, bottom side is facing up. Lifting the parchment paper to lift the tart dough, transfer it to the sheet pan. Wrap the pan tightly with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days. In a small bowl, combine the softened chevre, egg yolk, heavy cream, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and stir until smooth. Set aside. Cut the carrots, diagonally, into chunks about 2 to 3 inches in length and no wider than 1 inch, and transfer to a large bowl. Slice each onion half into 1/2-inch wide fans and add to the bowl. Toss the vegetables with the olive oil, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and set aside. Remove the tart dough from the refrigerator, and using the back of a spoon or a spatula, spread the cheese mixture onto the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Use your fingers to gently crimp the edges of the dough, creating a pleated freeform crust. Arrange the vegetables in the middle of the tart, making sure they are in one even layer that covers the cheese mixture beneath. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg white with a fork. Brush the tart edges with the beaten egg white and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon sea salt. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the vegetables are deeply caramelized and the crust is a rich golden color, rotating the pan halfway through. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool slightly. Place the chicory leaves in a medium bowl, drizzle with the lemon juice, and toss gently. Sprinkle the herbs over the tart and arrange the chicory leaves on top, leaving a bit of the tart edges peeking through. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and serve. Place the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor, and pulse once or twice to combine. Add the butter and pulse twice more, until the butter is in medium-sized pieces. Steadily pour the ice water into the machine while pulsing it as quickly as you can, until the butter is still visible in large smears and the dough is pushing up the sides of the bowl. It should look like damp bread crumbs. (You may not need to add all the water.) Scrape the dough into a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (The dough will continue to hydrate, but if it still feels powdery and dry, wet your fingertips and flick a little cold water onto the crumbs.) After 1 hour, gently press the dough into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 1 hour more before rolling out. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 67357,&quot;Smoked Mozzarella and Sun-dried Tomato Cigars 6 sheets phyllo dough 4 tablespoon butter, melted 8 ounces smoked mozzarella, sliced 1/4-inch thick 8 ounces sun-dried tomatoes, drained 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup Prosecco 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 6 cups field greens Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lay a sheet of phyllo dough on a clean dry work surface. Use a pastry brush to brush the phyllo sheet with melted butter. Fold the phyllo sheet in half lengthwise, resulting in a 12 by 8-inch rectangle. Brush the top of the phyllo with melted butter. Place a few slices of smoked mozzarella at a narrow end of the phyllo rectangle, leaving 1-inch on each side. Top the cheese with a few pieces of sun-dried tomatoes. Carefully roll up the phyllo dough into a cigar shape starting with the cheese and tomato end. About half way through the rolling, tuck in the 1-inch ends of the phyllo dough, and continue rolling. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet, seam side down, and brush the top with butter. Continue rolling the 5 remaining cigars. Bake until golden, about 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small ball jar or in a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid combine the extra-virgin olive oil, Proseco, cider vinegar, salt, and pepper. Shake well. Toss the Proseco vinaigrette with the field greens. Place the dressed greens on a serving platter or on individual serving plates. Slice the cigars into 2-inch pieces. Place atop the dressed field greens. Serve immediately. The baked cigars are about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. The flavor is great. YUM!! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 67358,&quot;Quiche Lorraine 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into small cubes 1 egg 2 to 3 ounces water Dash salt Butter 1 ounce diced ham 2 ounces Swiss cheese 3 eggs 2 cups half-and-half Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the pastry: Combine the flour and the salt on your work table. Add the butter and work it into the flour until the consistency is coarse. Stir and work in the egg and the water until the dough becomes a ball. Coat the work surface with a little flour and let the dough rest for at least 5 minutes. For the quiche: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch pie dish. Spread the pastry out to cover the bottom and sides with your fingers (use flour to help, push dough from middle to sides of dish). Let the pastry stand a bit higher than the dish edge. Bake the pastry for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven before the pastry shrinks, (adjust sides if needed). Place the ham and cheese in the pan. In the meantime, beat the eggs and half-and-half with a fork in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and bake for 30 minutes, until the center is firm. Serve warm with a salad, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67359,&quot;Best Pecan Pie Cheesecake 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more butter for the pan 9 chocolate graham crackers (about 1 sleeve) 2 tablespoons sugar Pinch fine salt Filling: Four 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups sugar 1 cup sour cream 6 large eggs, at room temperature 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract Topping: 1 cup pecans 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup sugar Instructions: For the crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 325 degrees F. Butter the inside of the springform pan. Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until finely ground. Add the butter, sugar and salt, and pulse until the mixture comes together and holds its shape when squeezed. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, and press it into the bottom to make an even layer. Bake until the crust is just firm, about 10 minutes. Remove and let cool completely. Place the pan on a large piece of foil, and fold the foil up the sides of the pan. (This helps seal the pan, to keep water out while baking.) For the filling: Wipe out the food processor. Pulse the cream cheese, sugar and sour cream until completely smooth, without any lumps, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times. Add the eggs and vanilla, and pulse until incorporated. Pour the filling into the crust, and set the pan inside a roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to go halfway up the sides of the springform pan (but not above the foil). Bake the cheesecake until the edge is set but the center jiggles slightly (when you gently shake the pan, the cheesecake should move in a cohesive wave motion), 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Turn the oven off, and open the door for a few seconds to let out some heat. Close the door, and let the cheesecake sit in the oven until cooked completely through, 1 hour more. Transfer the springform pan to a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edge, and let the cheesecake cool to room temperature. Wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. For the topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the pecans out on a baking sheet, and bake until they turn a few shades darker and are nicely toasted, about 15 minutes. Let cool, then halve each pecan lengthwise. Meanwhile, heat the cream, butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat until just steaming. Reduce the heat to low to keep the cream mixture warm. Cook the sugar in an even layer in a medium skillet over medium heat, without stirring, until it begins to melt. Gently swirl the pan as needed as the sugar continues to melt and begins to caramelize and turn lightly golden in spots. Keep cooking and swirling until the caramel is a uniform deep amber. Remove from the heat, and slowly whisk in the warm cream mixture (watch out for ferocious bubbles). Return the caramel sauce to medium heat, and cook to reduce slightly, about 2 minutes. Let cool. To see if the sauce is ready for topping the cheesecake, dip a spoon into it and let the sauce drop off; it&#39;s ready if it easily and slowly drips off the spoon. (The sauce can be refrigerated up to 2 days; reheat in the microwave.) To assemble: Spoon the sauce into the center of the cheesecake, and let it ooze to the edge. If needed, swirl the sauce with the back of a spoon to help it along. Sprinkle the pecans in a generous layer over the sauce. The cheesecake can now be served or refrigerated for up to 4 hours. To slice the cake, dip a sharp, heavy knife into warm water, wipe the knife dry and slice into the cake. Wipe the knife clean and repeat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67360,&quot;Roasted Jalapeno Poppers 12 large jalapeno peppers 2 ounces feta cheese 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 4 ounces shredded smoked pepper Jack cheese, or other hot pepper cheese, or extra-sharp Cheddar A small handful fresh cilantro, finely chopped 2 tablespoons grated onion Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut 1/3 of each pepper off lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Place on a baking sheet. If peppers do not sit flat on the baking sheet, slice a thin piece off the bottom of the pepper so it will not roll around. Mash the feta, cream cheese, shredded cheese, cilantro, and onion together and stuff the peppers with the mixture. Roast for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is brown at the edges and bubbly. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 67361,&quot;Dark Chocolate Caramel Spice 1 packet Dark Chocolate Flavor Carnation?

Stir in milk, caramel syrup and vanilla extract. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 67362,&quot;Bacon, Bourbon and Hazelnut Cinnamon Buns 3/4 cup whole milk, heated to 110 degrees F 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 6 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons hazelnut oil 2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste or 4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 4 large egg yolks 3 1/3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more as needed 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 cups blanched hazelnuts 7 ounces raw bacon (to get 3/4 cup crispy cooked bacon bits) 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter 1 1/4 cups firmly packed dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon (preferably Saigon) 1/2 cup heavy cream, divided 1 large egg lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon water 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 tablespoons bourbon 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: For the dough: Place the warm milk in a small bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and set aside for 5 minutes. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the oil and vanilla. Beat in the yolks one at a time, beating well between additions. Beat on high speed for 2 to 3 minutes, then lower the speed and mix in the flour and salt. Mix in the milk and yeast mixture. Change to a dough hook attachment and mix until a soft dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and gently knead it by hand for 2 to 3 minutes. The dough should be soft and smooth. Place the dough in a buttered or oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until doubled in size-this may take 2 to 2 1/2 hours at room temperature. (I proof this dough in my garage. My kitchen is too cool and I become impatient. Sometimes I proof it overnight in the refrigerator, allowing it to come to room temperature before filling the buns the next day.) For the filling: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, stirring often, until golden brown and fragrant, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely. Place in a food processor and pulse until they are very finely ground; don&#39;t over-grind them or you&#39;ll end up with an oily paste. I like to add 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar while pulsing. Set aside. Cut the bacon into 1/4-inch pieces. Cook in a heavy skillet over medium heat until very crispy but not burnt. Drain off the fat (reserve it for another use). Finely chop the bacon in a food processor. Alternatively, you can place the raw cut bacon pieces in a food processor and pulse until the bacon looks like chopped ham salad; place the bacon in a large saute pan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until crispy. (Be careful as bacon bits tend to spatter more than bigger pieces-I always use a splatter guard over the skillet.) Let the bacon bits cool on paper towels. Combine the cooled bacon and ground hazelnuts in a bowl and set aside. Cut the butter into equal-sized pieces. Put the butter in a light-colored saucepan (it&#39;s important to see the bottom of the pan to gauge the color of the butter as it cooks) and place it over medium heat. Melt the butter, stirring constantly. The butter will start to bubble and foam up; keep stirring. As the foam subsides, the color of the butter will begin to darken. As soon as it looks like it&#39;s browning, quickly pour the butter into a heatproof cup or bowl to prevent additional browning. To make the schmear, in a heatproof bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. In a small saucepan, heat 1/4 cup of the heavy cream with the brown butter. Bring this to a boil and immediately pour it over the sugar-and-cinnamon mixture and stir to dissolve the sugar. Let cool completely and set aside. In a small bowl, make a glaze by combing the remaining 1/4 cup heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla, bourbon and salt. Whisk until smooth and set aside. Once the dough has doubled in size, grease two 6-cup extra-large muffin or cupcake tins. Dump the dough onto a floured work surface. Roll it out to an 18x20-inch rectangle that&#39;s 1 inch thick. Spread the brown butter schmear over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges to help seal the buns. Brush the beaten egg over the border. Set aside about 3/4 cup of the bacon-hazelnut mixture for the top of the buns. Sprinkle the rest over the schmear and pat down so it sticks. Begin rolling the dough up from the edge closest to you, keeping the roll tight. When you reach the egg wash part, pinch the dough together to seal the roll. Cut the log into 12 pieces, each about 1 3/4 inches wide. Reshape each bun so it&#39;s round (cutting tends to flatten one side). Gently place the buns into the greased muffin tins. Lightly brush the tops with beaten egg and sprinkle with the remaining bacon-hazelnut mixture (about 1 tablespoon per bun). Cover the buns with plastic wrap and set aside to proof again until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. I place the muffin tins on baking sheets to prevent any filling from dripping onto the oven floor. Bake the buns for 12 minutes. Rotate the pans and bake until the buns are golden brown and cooked through (a digital thermometer inserted into the center of a bun will read 185 degrees F when they are fully baked), about 12 minutes longer. Remove the pans from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes before removing the buns and letting them cool on a wire rack. Drizzle the glaze generously over the buns. Enjoy the buns the same day you bake them, or make bread pudding with them.

Schmear the steaks with this deliciousness and let them hang out in the fridge overnight or up to 2 hours in the fridge. Preheat the grill. Season the steaks with salt. When the grill is hot, brush and oil the grill. When the flames have dissipated place the steaks on a hot spot on the grill. Brush with the excess marinade and move the steaks out of the flame if there is a flare up. Grill the steak for 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium rare. Remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing. Serve immediately after slicing.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed for 3 to 5 minutes, until light yellow and fluffy. Crack the eggs into a small bowl. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl once during mixing. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and mix well. The mixture might look curdled; don&#39;t be concerned. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the dry ingredients and the milk to the batter in 3 parts, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Fold in the 4 ounces of coconut with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter evenly into the 2 pans and smooth the top with a knife. Bake in the center of the oven for 45 to 55 minutes, until the tops are browned and a cake tester comes out clean. Cool on a baking rack for 30 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto a baking rack to finish cooling.

Slice the garlic horizontally, drizzle with olive oil and wrap in tin foil. Place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove, cool and mash the cloves into a paste. While the garlic is cooking, get a small saute pan hot over medium-low heat and toast the cumin seeds for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Then either grind up the toasted cumin in a spice grinder or chop with a knife until fine. Mix the sour cream with the toasted cumin, parsley and the roasted garlic. Reserve. For the latkes: Fill a pot three-quarters of the way up with water and add the potatoes. Bring the water to a boil, and then turn down the heat to a low boil. Boil until the potatoes are completely cooked (a knife slides in very easily), 20 to 30 minutes. While the potatoes are boiling, heat up a pan over medium heat with 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Saute the leeks with the garlic until soft with no color. Season well with salt and pepper, lower the heat to medium-low and cook for another 3 minutes. Then take off the heat. Once the potatoes are ready, place in a large bowl and mix in the sauteed leek mixture, nutmeg, the remaining 5 tablespoons butter and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper, and reserve. Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl or dish and set aside. Add the breadcrumbs and the flour to two separate plates. Season the flour well with salt and pepper. Roll a ball with the potato mixture that easily fits in the palms of your hands, about 2 tablespoons, and flatten slightly to make a patty. You don&#39;t want them too thick or too big. Dredge the potato patty with the flour, shaking off the excess. Dunk in the eggs and then coat with the breadcrumbs. Get a large pan hot over medium-high heat, add an inch of canola oil and fry when the temperature reaches 350 degrees F. Remove from oil when the latkes are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the basil leaves and red pepper flakes, and stir well. If using plum tomatoes, cut them lengthwise in half. Toss the tomatoes with the sugar and salt. Place the tomatoes cut side down in a roasting pan that will hold them in a single layer. (If you don&#39;t have a pan large enough, use an additional roasting pan and more olive oil.) Spoon the onion mixture over the potatoes. Add enough olive oil to come halfway up the tomatoes, about 1/2 cup. Roast until the tomatoes are tender and falling apart, about 3 hours (about 1 hour for cherry tomatoes). Stir once, gently, during the roasting. Let cool; then refrigerate, covered, in their oil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 67406,&quot;Churros con Chocolate 1 cup milk 1/2 stick unsalted butter Pinch kosher salt 1 cup flour 4 eggs 3 cups peanut or veggie oil, for frying 9 ounces Mexican chocolate 1/2 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon Pinch salt Instructions: For the dough: In a small saucepan, combine the milk, butter and salt and bring to a medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour and whisk to combine. Switch over to a wooden spoon and cook the dough until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and it has a slightly sweaty sheen on it, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl and let cool for 2 to 3 minutes. Using an electric mixer beat in the eggs 1 at a time. Do not add the next egg until the last one is completely combined. Place the batter in a pastry bag outfitted with a large star tip. Reserve. To make the chocolate sauce: Place 1-inch of water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.

Spray two 13 by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dishes with cooking spray. Line each dish with a 15-inch-square piece of parchment paper, allowing the excess to overhang the sides. Spray the parchment with cooking spray. For the brownie layer: In a large bowl, blend together the brownie mix, vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water, espresso powder and eggs. Using a hand mixer, beat for 1 minute on medium speed. Pour the batter into one of the prepared pans. Sprinkle with the coconut and bake until a toothpick inserted about 1 inch from the edge of the baking dish comes out clean, 25 to 27 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for 1 hour. Using the excess parchment paper as handles, lift the brownie layer from the pan. Run a thin spatula underneath to loosen it from the parchment paper. Keep the oven on. For the cookie layer: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars in a large bowl until fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and egg. Add the flour mixture and beat until a dough forms. Stir in the chocolate chips. Using your fingers, press the dough evenly into the bottom of the other prepared baking dish, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Bake until light golden, 14 to 16 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes. Sprinkle the walnuts over the crust. For the caramel: In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the caramel candies, 2 tablespoons water and vanilla over medium-low heat.

Strain the chickpeas and discard the soaking liquid. Rinse the chickpeas and return them to the pot. Add the remaining teaspoon baking soda and water to cover by about 3 inches over the chickpeas. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, skimming off and discarding any foam that rises to the surface. Cook the chickpeas until tender but still hold their shape, about 30 minutes. Remove 1 cup of chickpeas from the pot with a slotted spoon. Drain well and reserve on a paper towel-lined plate to dry. Continue cooking the remaining chickpeas until they are mostly intact and soft and creamy (not crumbly) when pressed between a thumb and forefinger, about 10 minutes more. If the liquid boils off too much while cooking, add more water to cover and continue to cook. Meanwhile, make the parsley oil. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the parsley leaves and cook 10 seconds, then drain. Immediately run the parsley under very cold water to cool it completely, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Squeeze out the excess liquid and then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to dry. When the chickpeas are done cooking, strain them and discard the liquid. Let the chickpeas sit in the strainer to drain and dry out for 5 minutes. Put the chickpeas in the bowl of a food processor along with the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1 3/4 teaspoons salt and process until the mixture is a paste, scraping down the bowl as necessary. With the motor running, slowly pour in 1/4 cup of the ice water and continue to process, adding more water by the tablespoon as necessary, until the mixture is smooth and light, about 5 minutes. The hummus should be slightly loose because it will firm up as it sits. Transfer the hummus to a shallow bowl and cover by lightly pressing plastic wrap directly onto the surface; set aside until ready to serve. (The hummus can also be made a day ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.) Put the cooked parsley leaves in a blender along with 1/2 cup olive oil and puree until the parsley is fine and the oil green, about 5 minutes. Transfer the parsley oil to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface. Parsley oil can be used right away, or held at room temperature up to 6 hours Just before serving, fry the chickpeas. Heat the remaining 1/2 cup oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. Pat the reserved chickpeas dry with a clean towel and carefully add them to the skillet. (The oil will bubble up for a few seconds.) Fry, shaking the pan occasionally, until browned and crisp, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer the chickpeas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Immediately sprinkle with the lemon zest, cayenne, cumin and some salt; toss to coat. Remove the plastic wrap from the reserved hummus. Make a shallow circular indentation with the back of a spoon in the center of the hummus. Mound the fried chickpeas in the center of the hummus. Drizzle with the parsley oil, spooning most of it around the edges of the hummus. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 67455,&quot;Cuervo Especial Pomegranate Margarita Martini 1.5 oz.

Add soup and simmer uncovered, until liquid thickens slightly and beef is tender, about 15 minutes. Divide stew equally among 4 oven-proof mugs. On a floured surface, cut puff pastry into 4 (4-inch) rounds. Moisten rims of mugs with water. Gently adhere puff pastry to each mug. Transfer to baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 67460,&quot;Broiled Prawns 1/4 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon salt and pepper 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 1 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic 1 pound wild Prawns (16 to 20 or 21 to 25 count works best), peeled and deveined Instructions: Mix all the ingredients together (except prawns) in a large bowl. Add the prawns and cover. Allow to marinate about 1/2 hour in the refrigerator. Preheat grill to high and put about 5 to 6 prawns on each skewer. Place the prawn skewers on the grill (using metal tongs works well for this). Let cook about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Carefully remove the prawns from the skewers and serve as an appetizer or with side dishes for an entree. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 67461,&quot;Zucchini Fritters 6 small zucchini, grated Salt 1/2 pound white Turkish cheese or feta, crumbled 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh dill 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 4 green onions, finely chopped 3 eggs, beaten 1/2 cup flour Freshly ground black pepper Oil for frying Tomato Relish, recipe follows 4 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and finely chopped 1 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon dried mint 1 teaspoon paprika Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place grated zucchini in a colander, sprinkle with salt and let stand at least 20 minutes, or until it loses its juice. Squeeze dry and place in a large bowl. Add the cheese, dill, parsley, onions, eggs, flour, and pepper and mix well. Adjust the seasonings. If batter is too runny, add a little more flour. Heat oil in a heavy saucepan. Drop batter by tablespoons into oil and fry until golden brown on all sides but still moist inside, about 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve warm with Tomato Relish. Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Taste for seasoning. Set aside at room temperature for a few hours, or cover and chill for several days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 67462,&quot;Sauteed Escarole with Shallots and Hot Chili Oil 2 teaspoons hot chili oil 2 shallots, chopped 6 cups chopped escarole, about 1 large bunch 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar Salt and ground black pepper Instructions: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and saute, about 1 minute. Add escarole, vinegar and sugar, cover and steam 1 minute, until escarole wilts. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 67463,&quot;La Fraise 1/2 pint fresh strawberries, preferably wild, or fraises des bois 2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped<br> 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1 750-ml bottle rose champagne, cold Instructions: Combine the strawberries and sugar in a bowl and let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Mash using a potato masher or a fork into a chunky puree. Add the vanilla bean pod and seeds and the lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. Discard the vanilla bean before serving. Put 4 champagne flutes in the freezer at least 15 minutes before serving. Remove the flutes from the freezer and put a tablespoon or two of the strawberry puree and the liquid into each flute. Fill the glasses to the top with champagne. &quot;,&quot;[Bubbly wines such as Prosecco, Cava, or Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 67464,&quot;Pork Belly Pastrami on Biscuits with Strawberry-Bourbon Preserves 1 1/2 cups Morton&#39;s kosher salt 1 cup bourbon, such as Old Forester 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup dark brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup honey<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) Prague Powder Number 1 or Instacure Number 1 curing salt 2 tablespoons Woodford Reserve Sassafras and Sorghum Bitters<br> 1 tablespoon pickling spice 5 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 5 pounds pork belly 2 tablespoons toasted coriander seeds, crushed 2 tablespoons black peppercorns, crushed<br> 1 tablespoon bourbon-smoked paprika<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper<br> 6 cups quartered, hulled strawberries 1 cup dark brown sugar<br> 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon bourbon, such as Old Forester 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 2 teaspoons salt<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes<br> 2 cups buttermilk<br> Instructions: For the pork and brine: In a large stockpot, combine 1 gallon of water with the kosher salt, bourbon, granulated sugar, brown sugar, honey, curing salt, bitters, pickling spice and garlic. Bring to a boil and then refrigerate overnight. The next day, add the pork belly to the brine and refrigerate for 48 to 72 hours. Remove the pork from the brine (discard the brine) and rinse the pork with cold water. Pat the pork dry, then put it on a baking sheet and refrigerate it overnight, uncovered, to dry out. The next day, prepare a smoker with applewood chips. For the spice mixture: Combine the coriander, black peppercorns, paprika and red pepper in a small bowl. Rub the pork with the spice mixture. Smoke the pork at 180 degrees F until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the pork reads 155 degrees F, about 3 hours. For the strawberry-bourbon preserves: Combine the strawberries, brown sugar and 1 cup of the bourbon in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring often, and cook until the jam is reduced and thick, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Finish with the remaining 1 tablespoon bourbon. Let cool. For the biscuits: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Mix the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a food processor. Add the cold butter cubes and pulse until the butter is in little specks. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, pour in the buttermilk and mix by hand. Scrape the biscuit dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat it down with your hand until it is 1/2 inch thick. Cut the dough into about twenty-four 2-inch circles with a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass and place the circles on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. To assemble the sandwiches: Thinly slice the smoked pork belly pastrami and saute it briefly in a skillet over medium heat. Slice the biscuits and spread both sides with the preserves. Fill the biscuits with the sliced pork belly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 67465,&quot;Swordfish Kabobs with Balsamic Glaze 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 2 pounds swordfish, cut into 1-inch pieces<br> 1 medium head fennel, cut into 1-inch pieces<br> 1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes<br> Instructions: If using wooden skewers, soak them in water in a casserole dish or baking sheet for 30 minutes prior to grilling. Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat; oil the grill grates with olive oil. Mix the balsamic, lemon juice and mustard in a small bowl. Add the olive oil in a slow stream while whisking. Season with salt and pepper. Thread the fish, fennel and tomatoes onto 8 skewers, alternating between fish and vegetables. There should be roughly 3 pieces of fish per skewer. Season all sides of each skewer with salt and pepper. Brush the balsamic mixture over all the skewers. Add the skewers to the grill and cook until there are clear grill marks on the flame side, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the skewers and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Continue to rotate the skewers and cook on each side until all sides are cooked and have a slight char. Serve hot! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 67466,&quot;Blue Cheese Stuffed Tomatoes 1 pint grape tomatoes Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup blue cheese 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives 4 slices crispy cooked bacon, finely chopped 1 tablespoon hot honey (or 1 tablespoon honey mixed with a dash of hot sauce) Instructions: Slice the top third (stem side) off each tomato. Cut a small slice off each bottom so that the tomatoes are flat and able to stand up. Using a melon baller or small spoon, remove the inside of each tomato to hollow out the center. Place the tomatoes on a plate or platter. Sprinkle the tomatoes with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Mash the cream cheese in a bowl with a rubber spatula until it is soft and malleable. Gently fold in the blue cheese, being careful not to overmix and break the blue clumps. Season with pepper. Use two small spoons to fill the tomatoes with the blue cheese mixture. (How much will depend on the size of the tomato; small tomatoes should get about 1 teaspoon of the mixture. You can also transfer the mixture to a pastry bag or resealable plastic bag with the corner cut off and pipe the cheese mixture into each tomato.) Toss the chives and bacon together in a small bowl. Top each tomato with the mixture. Drizzle hot honey over the entire plate. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67467,&quot;Poison Apple Punch 4 thick slices peeled fresh ginger 6 cups apple cider Zest of 1 orange, removed with a vegetable peeler Zest of 1 lemon, removed with a vegetable peeler</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/large egg yolk.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/large%20collard%20green%20leaves.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>large collard green leaves</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/lasagna%20sheets.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>lasagna sheets</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
