15 basil leaves<br> 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 3/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper<br> Red wine vinegar to taste<br> 1/4 cup canola oil<br> 4 yellow bell peppers, cut lengthwise into 1?4-inch-thick strips<br> 4 red bell peppers, cut lengthwise into 1?4-inch-thick strips<br> 3 large yellow onions, cut into slivers<br> 6 tablespoons tomato paste<br> 1 cup white wine vinegar<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 3 cups peeled garlic cloves 1 fresh bay leaf or 2 dried<br> 8 to 10 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns<br> 1 cup canola oil<br> 1 cup extra virgin olive oil<br> 1 cup store-bought tzatziki 3 tablespoons pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce<br> Kosher salt<br> Fresh ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Combine the chicken, oil, sliced garlic, and Spicy Red Rub in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking up the chicken with a spoon and distributing the spices evenly throughout. Add half the pepperoncini. Stir in 2 cups water, the Sweet and Sour Peppers and Onions, and vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and stir in the Garlic Confit Puree. Simmer until the mixture has thickened and the liquid has evaporated almost entirely. Divide chicken mixture among the tortillas and serve warm with the Chipotle Yogurt Sauce. Garnish with remaining pepperoncini if desired. Combine all of the ingredients in a jar with a tight fitting lid. Stir with a spoon to thoroughly mix. The rub will keep, tightly covered, for up to 3 months. In a large pot, heat the olive oil and crushed garlic over medium-high heat until the garlic is softened. Add the tomatoes and 6 cups water, give a stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce clings to a wooden spoon, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the basil and crush the tomatoes with the back of the spoon. Season with 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Taste and add enough red wine vinegar to achieved your desired acidity. I like a tangier sauce, so I&#39;m a bit heavy-handed with the vinegar. To make the sauce smooth at this point, puree in a blender. Measure out 2 cups of the tomato sauce and set aside. Reserve the remaining tomato sauce for another use. In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, combine the canola oil and peppers and saute until just softened and fragrant and the peppers begin to release a little liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the onions and chopped garlic and saute just until the onions are soft; do not let them take on any color. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine. Add the white wine vinegar and white wine and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. (The larger the pan, the faster the liquid in the mixture will reduce.) Add 6 cups water, the reserved 2 cups tomato sauce, the honey and remaining 2 tablespoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid thickens to the consistency of a salsa. The peppers and onions will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for 1 week, or for up to 3 months in the freezer. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Place garlic cloves, bay leaf, thyme, salt, and peppercorns in a heavy-bottomed, oven-proof pot. Pour the canola and olive oils over to cover. Cover, transfer to the oven, and bake until the garlic cloves are pale gold and tender (you should be able to smash them with the back of a spoon), about 50 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic cloves only to the bowl of a food processor (a mini-processor is ideal) and process until smooth. Alternatively, mash the cloves with the side of a knife. Store in a clean resealable jar. Combine the tzatziki and pureed peppers in a small bowl and stir until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper. The sauce will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Stir well before each use. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Barbera, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 17443,&quot;European Soldier Beans with Gorgonzola and Fresh Sage 9 ounces dried European soldier beans 6 ounces mild Gorgonzola cheese 1/2 cup minced fresh sage (you may substitute fresh rosemary, but not dried sage) 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Cook beans according to basic instructions. When the beans are done, drain them and put them in a mixing bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and stir well so that the cheese melts in and the sage is well-dispersed. Season well with salt and pepper. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 17444,&quot;Reduced Fat Mac &amp; Cheese 2 cups small dry elbow macaroni<br> Cooking spray 3 tablespoons King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 cups low-fat 1% milk 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (optional) 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Pinch of ground red pepper (cayenne) Dash of Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 ounces 1/3-less-fat cream cheese<br> 8 ounces Cabot 50% Reduced Fat Cheddar, grated &amp; divided (about 2 cups)<br> 1/3 cup Italian-flavored or plain dry breadcrumbs Instructions: Cook macaroni according to package directions; drain well. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 2 1/2-quart baking dish with cooking spray and set aside. Place flour in a large saucepan over medium heat, gradually whisking in milk. Add mustard, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, red pepper and Worcestershire. Continue cooking until sauce thickens, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low. Stir in cream cheese until well blended; add 2/3 of shredded cheese and stir until melted. Add macaroni, stirring until well coated. Pour into prepared baking dish. Toss remaining shredded cheese with breadcrumbs and sprinkle over top of macaroni; spray with cooking spray. Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden on top and bubbling throughout. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 17445,&quot;Marinated Anchovies 21 ounces salted anchovies, rinsed and dried 1 onion, sliced 1 cup white wine herbal vinegar 2 cloves garlic 1 bay leaf 10 black peppercorns 2 cloves Instructions: Place anchovies and onion in alternating layers in a bowl. Cook vinegar, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns and cloves for 5 minutes on low heat. Pour hot marinade over anchovies and onions. Marinate for 2 days in refrigerator. Serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o]&quot; 17446,&quot;Baked Penne with Roasted Vegetables 2 red peppers, cored and cut into 1-inch wide strips 2 zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1-inch cubes 2 summer squash, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1-inch cubes 4 cremini mushrooms, halved 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced into 1-inch strips 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon salt, divided 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided 1 tablespoon dried Italian herb mix or herbs de Provence 1 pound penne pasta 3 cups marinara sauce (store bought or homemade) 1 cup grated fontina cheese 1/2 cup grated smoked mozzarella 1 1/2 cups frozen peas, thawed 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus 1/3 cup for topping 2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. On a baking sheet, toss the peppers, zucchini, squash, mushrooms, and onions with olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and dried herbs. Roast until tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook for about 6 minutes. Since you will be cooking the pasta a second time in the oven, you want to make sure the inside is still hard. Drain in a colander. In a large bowl, toss the drained pasta with the roasted vegetables, marinara sauce, cheeses, peas, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Using a wooden spoon, gently mix, until all the pasta is coated with the sauce and the ingredients are combined. Pour the pasta into a greased 9 by 13-inch pan. Top with the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan and butter pieces. Bake until top is golden and cheese melts, about 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 17447,&quot;Bloody Punch 3 cups red fruit punch, chilled 1 (1-liter) bottle strawberry daiquiri mix, chilled 1 (2-liter) bottle Dr Pepper Cherry, chilled 1 (46-ounce) bottle concord grape-raspberry juice, chilled 1 (1-liter) bottle ginger ale, chilled Instructions: Fill a powder-free latex glove with punch; tie closed.

Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, work the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle on 3 to 4 tablespoons of the eggy water, and mix it in with your fingers until the dough comes together into a ball. Working on a lightly floured surface, take egg-sized pieces of the dough and smear them away from you with the heel of your hand into 6-inch streaks. Scrape up all the streaks of dough and pile them on top of one another to form a disc. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter a 9 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into an 11 1/2-inch circle. Fit the dough into the prepared pan. Trim the excess dough to a 1-inch overhang and double the dough over itself to reinforce the sides (save the trimmings for any emergency patchwork). Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Line the tart shell with aluminum foil and weight down with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 5 minutes longer or until lightly browned. Patch any visible holes in the shell with the reserved dough scraps. Brush the shell with Egg Wash and return to the oven for 5 more minutes, until the wash is shiny and no longer runny. Transfer to a rack to cool and lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Spread the cashews in the partially baked shell and cover with the Cashew Filling, making sure the nuts are covered. Bake for 30 minutes or until little bubbles appear around the edges of the tart and the center looks barely set. Transfer to a rack to cool. With a fork, mix together the water, flour, and egg yolk in a small bowl to make an egg wash. Cover and refrigerate. In a large bowl, lightly beat the sugar and eggs together. Add the corn syrup, rum, and vanilla and beat just to a blend. Mix in the melted butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17498,&quot;Chunky Guacamole: Guacamole Picado 1/2 small onion, very finely chopped 2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalapenos, stemmed, seeded and very finely chopped 1 ripe, medium-large tomato, cored and very finely chopped, optional 1 clove garlic, peeled and very finely chopped, optional 10 sprigs fresh cilantro, chopped, optional 3 ripe, medium-size avocados Salt, about 1/2 teaspoon 1/2 lime, juiced, optional Additional chopped onion, fresh cilantro, radish slices or roses, and/or a little crumbled Mexican queso fresco or other fresh cheese like feta or farmer&#39;s cheese, for garnish Instructions: In a medium-size bowl, mix the finely chopped onion and chiles with the optional tomato, garlic, and cilantro. Close to the time you are going to serve, halve the avocados lengthwise by cutting from the stem to flower ends, around the pits. Twist the avocado halves in opposite directions to loosen the meat from pits, then scoop out the pits, and reserve. Scrape the avocado pulp from the skins and add it to the bowl. Using your hand or a spoon, roughly mash the avocado while mixing in the other ingredients, making a course, thick mass. Flavor with salt, then enough lime juice to add a little zing, if you wish. Return the pits to the guacamole and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the mixture. Set aside for a few minutes to let the flavors blend. The guacamole is very attractive in a pottery bowl or Mexican mortar, sprinkle with chopped onion, cilantro, radish slices and/or queso fresco (cheese); radish roses really dress it up. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17499,&quot;Cornish Game Hens with Cornbread Stuffing 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 1 small leek, white part with 1 inch of green, finely chopped and rinsed 1 small apple (about 4 ounces), peeled, cored, and diced 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh sage, plus sprigs for garnish 1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf parsley, plus sprigs for garnish 2 cups cubed day old cornbread 3/4 to 1 cup chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 Cornish hens, giblets discarded, patted dry Instructions: In a medium skillet, heat the 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat.

Submerge the radicchio, cut-side down, in the marinade for 1 hour prior to grilling.<br> Crumble the sausage into a medium saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until fully rendered and slightly browned, 8 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked sausage to a tray lined with paper towels.<br> Remove the radicchio from the marinade, reserving the marinade itself for dressing the finished radicchio. Grill the radicchio over an open flame starting with the cut-side down, and rotating until slightly charred on the outside (we suggest a charcoal grill, but if not using an outdoor grill, a griddle or grill pan would suffice). Once cooked, remove to a tray to cool. When the radicchio is cool, chop into 1-inch squares and toss with the reserved marinade.<br> Roll out the pizza dough into three 12-inch circles, 1/4-inch thick.<br> Start by grilling 1 pizza over medium-high heat on the grill. Once the bottom has a slight char, flip the pizza and top with some of the grilled radicchio, cooked sausage, chopped rosemary and taleggio slices (about 3 per pizza). Cover with the grill lid to melt the cheese and crisp the bottom, just a few minutes. Remove the pizza from the grill with a wide spatula to a cutting board.

Cut into small chunks after chilling. While the chocolate is chilling, make the cannoli cream. With an electric mixer on high, whip heavy cream just until frothy, and then add sugar substitute and almond and vanilla extracts. Continue to whip on high until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip, or cream will break. Gently fold in the ricotta cheese and almost all of the chilled chocolate chunks, saving a few chips for garnish. Spoon cannoli cream into parfait glasses, top with remaining chocolate chips, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 17514,&quot;Maple Cream Pie 1 1/2 ounces walnuts (about 1/3 cup) 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces<br> 2 to 4 tablespoons iced water<br> 1 1/4 cups pure maple syrup 6 large egg yolks<br> 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> 2 cups whole milk<br> 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 cup cold heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks Instructions: Prepare the pastry in a food processor, combine the walnuts and sugar and pulse until the nuts are finely ground. Add the flour and salt and pulse to incorporate. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture is the texture of coarse meal with pea size pieces. Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and pulse until the dough is evenly moistened. The dough should hold together when squeezed, but not be too wet. Add up to 2 more tablespoons of ice water, if necessary. Tip out the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and using the plastic to gather the dough together, form it into a disk. Chill for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. (Alternatively, you can freeze the dough for up to 1 week). Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 12-inch-diameter round (about 1/8 inch thick). Transfer the dough to a 9-inch standard pie plate. Trim the excess dough and fold it to make a decorative edge. Wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for at least 15 minutes. Line the frozen shell with parchment paper or foil and fill with pie weights. Bake the crust until the edges are lightly golden and the crust beneath the parchment is dry, about 25 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and continue to bake the crust until it is golden brown about 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Set a fine mesh sieve next to the crust for later. Prepare the filling: In a small saucepan, bring the maple syrup to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Continue to cook the syrup until it has reduced by about half, about 12 minutes. (You can occasionally pour the syrup into a glass measuring cup to check the volume.) In a medium saucepan (away from the stovetop), whisk the egg yolks with the cornstarch until smooth. In a slow stream, while whisking, add the milk and cream. Add the salt, butter, and reduced maple syrup. Don&#39;t worry if the syrup seizes. It will smooth out in the next step when you heat the custard. Cook the milk mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it has thickened and come to a low boil, about 7 minutes.

Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until smooth. Add the vanilla, increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until thick, about 2 more minutes. Add the milk a little at a time and beat until the frosting is spreadable but not runny.<br> Assemble the cake: Put 1 cake layer on a platter; spread 1 cup frosting on top. Top with the second cake layer, then cover the whole cake with the remaining frosting. Decorate with sprinkles.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Mix 1/2 cup water with the cream in a liquid measuring cup or bowl. Beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the cream mixture, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and the centers spring back when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment.

Add the rhubarb, reduce the heat to low and cook until softened but not falling apart, about 3 minutes. Strain the rhubarb over a bowl, reserving the liquid (keep the rhubarb in the strainer to drain completely while assembling the strudel). Make the strudels: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Pulse the cream cheese, confectioners&#39; sugar, flour and vanilla seeds in a food processor until just combined. Lay out 1 phyllo sheet on a clean dry surface (keep the remaining phyllo covered with a slightly damp kitchen towel). Brush lightly with clarified butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon chopped tarragon and 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar. Layer another sheet of phyllo on top and top with more butter, tarragon and granulated sugar. Repeat the layering with the remaining phyllo; do not top the final sheet. Cut the stack of phyllo in half crosswise. Reserve the remaining clarified butter (about 1 tablespoon). Put each phyllo stack on a piece of parchment paper that&#39;s slightly larger than the stack. Position the stacks with the long sides facing you. Divide the cream cheese mixture between the stacks, spreading it in a 2-inch-wide strip along the edge closest to you; leave a 1-inch border at the bottom and sides. Spoon the rhubarb pieces over the cream cheese filling. Starting from the side closest to you, use the parchment to lift the phyllo and roll tightly around the filling to make 2 logs; arrange seam-side down. Transfer the strudels (on the parchment) to a baking sheet. Brush the strudels with the reserved clarified butter and sprinkle generously with granulated sugar. Bake until golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the reserved rhubarb liquid to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until syrupy, about 15 minutes. Let the strudels cool 10 minutes on the baking sheet. Slide the strudels (on the parchment) onto a rack; let cool 45 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar and drizzle with the rhubarb syrup. How to clarify butter: Strudel recipes often call for clarified butter, which helps prevent the dough from getting soggy. To make it, melt the butter over medium-low heat until the milk solids separate and rise to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool, then skim off the white foam and discard. Spoon the remaining clarified (clear) butter into a bowl; discard the solids left at the bottom of the pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17520,&quot;Cantaloupe Soup 1 cantaloupe, peeled, seeded, and cubed 1/4 cup dark rum 1/4 cup cream 1 lemon, zested 2 tablespoon orange juice concentrate 4 mint leaves, julienned Instructions: Place everything but the mint leaves in a blender and puree.

Remove from the processor and turn into a mixing bowl. Stir the buttermilk into the oats and cover with plastic wrap. Let the oatmeal steep in the buttermilk for 12 hours. In a mixing bowl, sift the other ingredients together. Stir in the steeped oatmeal and mix well. If the mixture is too wet add a little more flour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with the butter. Lightly dust the work surface with some flour. Turn the dough out onto the surface and knead the dough a couple of times to form a soft ball like shape. Press the dough into a round about 2 inches thick. Using a sharp knife, make a criss-cross cut into the bread. Place the bread in the prepared pan. Bake until golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Serve the bread warm with butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17522,&quot;Meal Prep Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder One 6- to 7-pound bone-in pork shoulder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put a large ovenproof Dutch oven, without the lid, into the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Meanwhile, rub the pork all over with 2 tablespoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Once the oven is preheated, carefully remove the Dutch oven and add the pork to it fat-side down. Roast until golden all over, 45 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and flip the pork so it is fat-side up. Continue to roast until the internal temperature is about 175 degrees F, about 3 hours. Cover the pot with the lid and continue to cook until the internal temperature is 195 to 200 degrees F, about another 30 minutes. Remove the pot from the oven, uncover and let rest until the meat is cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes.<br> Transfer the pork to a cutting board. Skim off the fat from the liquid at the bottom of the pot with a spoon or ladle and discard it. Reserve the liquid for re-warming the meat.<br> Pull the meat from the bone and discard it. The part of the meat that was in the bottom of the pot and cooks in the liquid is perfect for shredding with two forks. The top part that roasts for most of the cooking time should be sliced in to 1/2-inch pieces for browning in other recipes Refrigerate in airtight containers for up to 5 days.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 17523,&quot;Cheesy BBQ&#39;d Corn-on-the-Cob 6 ears corn 1 stick butter, softened 1 teaspoon chili powder 1/2 packet creamy cheese sauce mix (or powdered cheese packet from boxed macaroni and cheese) Instructions: Preheat outdoor grill or preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Using a spoon, scoop out the seeds and flesh surrounding them, leaving the exterior intact in a bowl shape. In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, vinegar, anchovies and garlic. Doing this will help disperse the anchovies evenly with the rest of the mixture. In a separate bowl, combine the tuna, cucumbers, parsley, olives, tomatoes, capers, onions and shallots. Season with salt and pepper and dress in the anchovy mixture. Add more olive oil as needed to moisten the mixture, but it should not be wet. Divide the filling among the tomatoes and top with some Toasted Garlic and Herb Breadcrumbs and shaved ricotta salata. Cut the crusts from the bread and tear it into small pieces. Place in a food processor and pulse until a coarse-crumb consistency is reached. In a large skillet, heat the butter and olive oil together over medium-high heat. Add the breadcrumbs and toss to coat and continue to cook, stirring constantly. When the breadcrumbs begin to brown, stir in the parsley and garlic, and toast until golden brown, an additional minute.

Set aside until ready to use. Using a rolling pin, roll each slice of bread to flatten and make more pliable. Trim the crust off each slice. For the banana-strawberry: Arrange a few slices of banana along the bottom edge of a slice of bread making a 1-inch strip of banana all the way across. Top with a line of chopped strawberries (about 1 tablespoon), being careful not to put too many down or you might not be able to roll it up. Starting with the side of the bread with the fruit, carefully roll into a tight log so that the fruit is snugly wrapped in bread. Continue with remaining bread and fruit. For the blueberry and cream cheese: Spread 1 teaspoon cream cheese in a 3/4-inch strip along the bottom of a slice of bread. Top with 2 rows of blueberries (about 2 to 3 tablespoons) being careful not to put too many down or you might not be able to roll it up. Starting with the side of the bread with the fruit, carefully roll into a tight log so that the fruit is snugly wrapped in bread. Continue with the remaining bread and fillings. For the apple-peanut butter: Spread 1 teaspoon peanut butter in a 3/4-inch strip along the bottom of a slice of bread. Top with some apple, being careful not to put too much down or you might not be able to roll it up.

For cooking: Dip each roll-up in the reserved egg mixture and turn to coat all sides, making sure that the egg seals up the exposed edge so that the roll-up doesn&#39;t unravel. Repeat with the remaining roll-ups. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook half of the roll-ups, gently pressing down on each roll-up to make a flat edge against the pan, until all 4 sides are golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining tablespoon butter and remaining 6 roll-ups. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve with maple syrup on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 17550,&quot;Panettone French Toast Casserole Unsalted butter, for greasing the dish 1 large panettone (about 2 pounds) 1 1/2 cups cherry jam 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 3 1/2 cups half-and-half 6 large eggs 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup blanched sliced almonds Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Grease a 2 1/2- to 3-quart casserole dish with butter; set aside. Cut the panettone into 1-inch-thick slices (you should get about 5 or 6); if you have an odd number of slices, cut one in half. Spread the jam on half the slices. Spread the cream cheese on the other half. Press 1 slice of each together to form sandwiches. Cut the sandwiches into 1-inch squares, and arrange haphazardly in the prepared dish. (Don&#39;t worry; this can be a little messy. If the sandwich pieces come apart, just spread them out to fill in the spaces evenly. There&#39;s no need to re-form the pieces into sandwich squares.) Whisk together the half-and-half, eggs, granulated sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl until combined. Pour evenly over the panettone in the dish. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap from the dish, and push down on the casserole. Sprinkle the almonds on top. Bake until puffed and golden brown and the custard is set (the center of the casserole will feel firm when touched), about 1 hour 10 minutes.

This soup is a meal unto itself and tastes even better leftover. 2 stalks celery with leaves, inner pieces from the bunch peeled of outer skin, cut into 1/2-inch pieces Soup: Season the chicken with salt, to taste, and push the 2 cloves into 1 of the chicken thighs. Add it to a large stock pot, cover with about 4 quarts water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, season the beef bones with salt and brown them in a cast iron pan with the canola oil, searing them over medium heat. Add them to the pot with the chicken. To the pan that the bones were seared in, over medium heat, add the carrots, celery and onion and toss until they are coated in oil. Add the thyme and bay leaves to the stock pot along with the sauteed vegetables. Bring the soup to a gentle simmer and skim the surface with a ladle. Discard any oil or \scum\ that accumulates. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt, not too much, and lower the heat to finish cooking the chicken slowly. Meatballs: Put the ground veal into a medium bowl. Add the salt, garlic, Parmesan, basil, egg and bread crumbs. Use your hands to mix to blend the ingredients. Roll a small meatball and cook a \tester\ ladled into the soup, if desired. Taste and reseason the meat mixture, if needed. Roll the rest of the veal into small meatballs. They should be about the size of a small cherry tomato. (Chef&#39;s Note: Imperfectly rolled meatballs actually make this soup more homey and real.) Arrange the meatballs in a single layer on a baking sheet and refrigerate. After about 45 minutes at a gentle simmer, taste the chicken soup and adjust the seasoning, if needed. Use a large spoon and a pair of tongs to remove the chicken to a baking sheet or other flat surface and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Remove the beef bones and scoop out the marrow. Add it to the soup, if desired. Remove and discard the fresh thyme and bay leaves. Take the breast and thigh meat off the chicken, taking care to discard the bones and skin. Break the chicken into bite-size pieces, but not too small, and add them to the soup. Bring the soup to a gentle simmer and add the meatballs. Allow it to continue simmering for a couple of minutes so the meatballs have a chance to cook. Drizzle in the eggs and continue to mix as they cook. They should look like little threads in the soup. Stir in the spinach and taste for seasoning. Transfer the soup to serving bowls and serve sprinkled with the Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 17573,&quot;Dough Knots with Sour Cream-and-Jam and Pesto Alfredo Dips 8 ounces cream cheese, cold 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream, cold<br> 8 ounces sour cream<br> 1/2 cup grape jam or fig jam<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 2 cups heavy cream<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon white pepper<br> 1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan 4 tablespoons pesto<br> 12 pizza dough knots, warmed 12 garlic knots, warmed Instructions: For the sour cream-and-jam dip: Combine the cream cheese and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed to combine.

Place the goat necks in the pan and fill with cold water to cover by 1 inch. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 8 hours and up to 16 hours. Prepare a smoker with oak or hickory wood and heat it to 225 degrees F. Remove the goat necks from the marinade, place in the smoker, and smoke until golden brown and bark has formed on the outside of the meat, 6 to 7 hours. Reserve the marinade in the pan. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Return the goat necks to the marinade in the pan, cover tightly with foil and braise in the oven until just fork tender, 4 to 5 hours. For the rice: Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Combine the rice, chicken stock and coconut milk in a saucepan, cover, and simmer 8 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and continue to simmer, covered, until the rice has absorbed the liquid fully. Transfer the rice to a large mixing bowl and carefully fold in the ghee without crushing the rice. Keep warm. Melt the butter in a cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Remove the goat necks from the marinade, add them to the pan and baste with the butter. As soon as the butter begins to brown, add the dried cherries and wine and bring to a boil. Add 2 1/2 cups of the marinade from the braising pan and reduce to a sauce nappe that is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Scoop the rice on serving platters. Top with the goat necks and cherries.

To make the pate a choux: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the water, butter, sugar, and salt to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, stirring to melt the butter completely. Add all the flour and baking powder at once and continue to stir until all the flour is incorporated and the dough becomes a mass that pulls away from the sides of the pot. Remove from the heat and scrape the dough into a mixing bowl. Using a standing or hand-held mixer, beat the dough on medium speed to cool it off a bit. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl periodically. When all eggs have been incorporated, the dough should be a thick, smooth, and glossy paste. Form 24 golf ball-size mounds on the lined baking sheet about 2-inches apart allowing room for them to spread; keep the mounds as high and round as possible. You can use a pastry bag fitted with a star tip or a large spoon, your choice. Place the pans in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. and continue to cook for 25 minutes. Do not open the oven door or remove the pans from the oven until the puffs are firm to the touch. The profiteroles should be golden brown and well-risen. Allow the shells to cool before filling. Using a serrated knife, slice the pastry puffs almost in half. Place 3 profiteroles on each dessert plate and fill with a scoop of ice cream. Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the top; garnish with confectioners&#39; sugar and fresh mint, if desired. Combine the cream and butter in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Heat the mixture until bubbles appear around the sides of the pot, but do not allow the cream to boil. Mix in the chocolate and vanilla; remove from the heat and stir until the chocolate melts and the sauce is smooth. May be served warm or chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 17590,&quot;Key Lime Vanilla Birthday Cake 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans 2 1/2 cups cake flour, plus more for the pans<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 2 large eggs plus 2 large egg whites<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 cup buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup pastel sprinkles<br> 3 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 4 cups (one 1-pound box) confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 tablespoon key lime zest, 2 to 3 tablespoons key lime juice and key lime half-moon slices, for garnish Pastel sprinkles, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the vanilla cake: Butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans; line the bottoms with parchment rounds. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Set aside. Cream the butter and granulated sugar together in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then the egg whites. Beat until smooth, about 30 seconds. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to medium and add the flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the buttermilk and beginning and ending with the flour, making sure to scrape the sides of the bowl several times. Beat on high to smooth the batter, 10 to 15 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold the sprinkles in by hand. Divide the batter between the 2 pans and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake until a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes on a rack for about 15 minutes, then remove from the pans, peel off the parchment and cool completely. For the key lime buttercream: Cream the butter and cream cheese in a clean mixer bowl in the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt and beat on the lowest speed until combined. Add the vanilla, lime zest and 2 tablespoons of the juice, then slowly increase the speed to high and beat until very light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes, adding the last tablespoon of lime juice if the buttercream seems too stiff to spread easily. Set one cake layer on a serving platter or cake turntable if you have one. Spread the top with about 1 1/2 cups buttercream almost to the edges. Top with the other cake layer, flat-side up. Spread the top of the cake with a heaping cup of buttercream and smooth with a large offset spatula. Spread the remaining buttercream on the sides of the cake. Hold the offset spatula at a 45-degree angle to the cake and rotate the cake (or turntable) to smooth the edges, leaving a thin layer of buttercream with the layers slightly showing through. Sprinkle the top of the cake with sprinkles and decorate the edge with the lime slices. Chill the cake to set the layers for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 17591,&quot;Baby Bok Choy with Bacon, Onion and Butter Beans 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces (about 4 ounces) 1 pound baby bok choy (about 4 heads) 1/2 onion, thinly sliced One 15-ounce can butter beans, drained and rinsed 1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar Kosher salt Instructions: Add the bacon to a large skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, about 6 minutes.

The next morning, drain, rinse, and soak again until ready to cook. In a large heavy stock pot, heat the oil over medium low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 3 minutes more, until the aroma is released. Tie the bay leaves, parsley, and thyme together to make a bouquet garni, and add it to the pan, along with the dried soaked meats, fresh meats, and the water. Bring slowly to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat and skim the fats and scum from the top. Cook for 1 hour, then add the beans, return to a simmer, and again skim any scum from the top. Simmer for another hour. As each piece of meat becomes fork tender, remove it, starting with the beef chuck and finishing with the salted meats. Place the cooked meats on a platter, cover with aluminum foil, and keep warm in a low oven. Remove all the meat and skin from the pigs trotter and dice it. Discard the bone and add the meat to the beans. Cut the carne seca into 1/2 inch dice and also return it to the beans. Continue cooking the beans for 20 minutes more, or until tender. Remove any fat or gristle from the remaining cuts of meat, then cube or slice it into bitesized pieces. Arrange the sliced chorizo, pork shoulder, bacon, fresh pork, and beef on one side of a large heated platter and place the beans on the other side (if using the smoked tongue, traditionally it should be placed in the center of the platter).

Add enough salt to the water to make it taste like the ocean. Add the potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-high. Simmer until you can slide a knife right through one of the potato pieces without any force, 10 to 15 minutes. Ricing the potatoes: Pour the potatoes into a large colander and shake to make sure all the water is out. Let the colander sit in the sink for 3 to 4 minutes to steam the potatoes dry. If you own a potato ricer or food mill, push the potatoes through. Or, you can push the potatoes through a fine-mesh sieve with the back of a ramekin or ladle. Finishing the potatoes: Put the potatoes back into the pot you cooked them in. Stir the softened butter into the potatoes. Add the cream, egg, and olive oil and stir with a rubber spatula until the potato puree is silky smooth. Browning the meat: Set a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the oil, and then add the ground lamb. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the lamb is thoroughly browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. Sauteing the vegetables: Add the onions to the pan in which you cooked the lamb, along with the garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the pepper, mushrooms, and carrots and cook until the carrots are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the lavender and rosemary and cook until they release their fragrance, about 1 minute. Add the meat back to the vegetable mixture and remove from heat. Making the sauce: Pour in the red wine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the wine has reduced by half its volume. Add the chicken stock and bring it to a boil. Combine the cornstarch and water and stir until you have a thick slurry. After the chicken stock has simmered for a moment, pour in the slurry and stir the mixture thoroughly. This will thicken the liquid into gravy. Finishing the shepherd&#39;s pie: Turn on the oven to broil. Transfer the meat and vegetable mixture to a large pie pan. Top with the potato puree. Cook under the broiler until the potatoes have turned a dark golden-brown, about 10 minutes.

Stir a few times before the sugar begins to boil to combine the ingredients. Attach a candy thermometer to the inside of the pan and bring the syrup to a boil. Cook until the syrup begins to turn an amber color, then swirl the syrup to even out the color. Continue to cook until the syrup is a deep amber and the thermometer reads between 375 and 380 degrees F, then remove from the heat. Carefully pour in the cream and gently whisk to combine. Stir in the butter, vanilla and a pinch of salt until smooth. Keep off the heat but keep the thermometer attached to the pan. Pierce the apples through the stem ends about halfway through with candy apple sticks. Line a baking sheet with parchment and lightly spray with nonstick cooking spray.<br> When the temperature of the caramel reads around 190 degrees F, dip an apple, using the stick as a handle and swirling to coat completely. Allow excess caramel to drip off the bottom and use a spatula to help remove any large amount of caramel, as it will pool around the apple when you set it down to cool on the lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining apples, gently heating the caramel on the stovetop over low heat, stirring, if it gets too thick for dipping. Allow the caramel to set and cool completely before serving or wrapping apples, about 1 hour.

Place the steak in an 8 by 12-inch casserole pan and generously coat with the marinade. Allow to marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour under refrigeration.<br> For cooking, preheat a grill or chargrill over high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, straining any excess marinade. Removal of the excess marinade will prevent flaming or charring of the steak during cooking. Place the steak on the grill and cook over high heat, 8 to 9 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Remove from the grill and allow the steak to rest before slicing. Slice the steak on the bias, top to bottom, against the grain, 1/4 inches thick.

Allow the sugar to melt, about 15 minutes. Gradually add a tablespoon of sugar at a time, slowly swirling it and allowing it to melt in before adding the next tablespoon. This is a long process, which needs constant attention to avoid burning. When all the sugar is completely melted, it will become a rich, dark caramel color, about 40 to 45 minutes. Carefully pour the caramel into a 9-inch cake pan, coating the bottom of the pan. Allow to cool completely, about 20 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Prepare a water bath: Place a large roasting pan on the middle rack of the oven. Bring about 2 quarts of water to a boil, then carefully pour it into the roasting pan in the oven.<br> When the caramel is cool, slowly whisk together the egg yolks in a medium bowl, then add the evaporated milk, condensed milk, vanilla extract and lemon zest (if using). Whisk gently to avoid adding air into the custard. Air will cause bubbles, taking away from the smooth and dense texture.<br> Pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into the cake pan. Lightly tap the pan on the counter to release any air bubbles.<br> Once the oven is at 350 degrees F, carefully place the cake pan in the water bath.<br> Bake until the center of the custard is set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

On a sheet tray, gently toss pretzels, butter and 2 tablespoons sugar. Bake until sugar melts and crystallizes on the pretzels, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, whisk together the cocoa, 1/2 cup sugar and cornstarch. Form a well in the center and slowly whisk in milk over medium heat. This helps prevent the cornstarch from clumping. Bring mixture to a boil to thicken. Remove from heat. In a small bowl, whisk a little of the milk mixture into the egg to temper. Add egg mixture to the pot of milk. Heat over low until mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency, about 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in chips until melted and combined well. Pour pudding into ramekins.

In a small bowl, combine the pecans and flour. In a small saucepan, combine the butter, sugar, and corn syrup. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir the dry ingredients into a pan. Transfer the batter to a bowl and stir occasionally until it thickens into a dough and is cool enough to handle, about 25 minutes. With moistened hands, roll the dough into various size balls, depending on whether you&#39;re making cookies, cups or coronets (see below). Place on ungreased baking sheets, 3 to 7 inches apart, depending on size-they spread quite a bit. Bake about 12 minutes, or until the active bubbling subsides. Place the baking sheet on rack and let cool until the cookies are firm enough to lift with a flexible metal spatula but are still malleable, 3 to 5 minutes. Working quickly, mold each into shape and set on a wire rack to cool completely. If the cookies get too cool and brittle to mold, put the try back in the oven for a minute to soften. To make 9 dessert bowls: With moistened hands, mold each ball using a rounded tablespoon of dough. Place only 2 balls on the ungreased baking sheet. Have 2 small soup bowls measuring 4 1/2 to 5-inches across the top ready by the oven. Follow the baking instruction above. When set but still malleable, lift the cookies, one at a time, and place each in a bowl, nutty, bumpy side up. Gently press the bottom to flatten. The sides will ruffle prettily. Wipe the excess butter off the baking sheet and continue with the remaining dough. If you have more than 1 baking sheet, stagger the baking so that you can mold 1 tray while the other is in the oven. Fill with butterscotch ice cream, pumpkin mousse, bananas and cream, or anything that strikes your fancy and goes well with pecans. To make 9 ice cream cones: Follow the baking instructions above for dessert bowls, but when you lift a cookie off the baking sheet, roll it into a cone with the nutty, bumpy side facing out, and hold it for a few seconds to set. Lay it on the cooling rack, seam side down, and place a cylindrical object, such as a pill bottle, in the opening to set until you roll the next cookie. Fill with scoops of any flavor ice cream or sorbet that complements pecans. To make 18 coronets: With moistened hands, mold rounded teaspoons of the dough into balls. Place about 9 balls on an ungreased baking sheet. Follow the baking instructions for ice-cream cones; you&#39;re making a smaller version of the same. Repeat with a second tray. Fill with mousse, ice cream, or berries and cream. Place a little dab of cream on the plate to anchor the coronets, and place 1 or 2 coronets on each plate with fruit sauce or hot fudge spilling out of the opening. To make 24 cookies: With moistened hands, mold level teaspoons of dough into balls. Place about 12 balls on an ungreased baking sheet. Follow the instructions above. When the cookies are set but still flexible, transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with a second tray. To make 24 cigarettes: Follow the baking instructions for cookies, but when you lift a cookie off the baking sheet, roll it around a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon. Lay it on the cooling rack, seam side down. If the cookies get too brittle to mold, put the baking sheet back in the oven for a minute to soften them. To dip the ends in melted chocolate, immerse 1 end of a cookie, then the other, shake off the excess chocolate, and dip the end into a small bowl of grated chocolate. Lay it on a sheet pan lined with parchment or waxed paper. When all the cookies are dipped, place the tray in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes, just until the chocolate sets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 17625,&quot;Fillet of Beef in Puff Pastry with Sauce Madeira 6 tournedos, 6 ounces each (fillet steaks, 1 1/2 inches thick) 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 shallots, minced 1 pound mushrooms, finely chopped 4 tablespoons heavy cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds puff pastry 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water, lightly beaten, for egg wash Sauce Madeira, recipe follows Watercress, for garnish 1 cup Madeira 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1 teaspoon minced thyme leaves 1 cup veal stock 2 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper Instructions: In a large skillet, over high heat, saute tournedos in 3 tablespoons butter for 30 seconds on each side. Set aside to cool completely. In the same skillet, with the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter, cook shallots and mushrooms until all liquid evaporates. Add cream, salt and pepper. Reduce over moderate heat to a thick puree. Cool. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Divide pastry into 6 equal portions. On a lightly floured board, roll out each portion to a rectangle approximately 6 by 12 inches and 1/4 inch thick. Place each tournedo on one side of a pastry rectangle, leaving enough room to fold over. Top each tournedos with mushroom puree. Brush edges of the pastry with egg wash and then fold it over and shape it to the contours of the meat. Cut away excess pastry and decorate as desired. Glaze the tops of the pastry with egg wash. Bake the tournedos 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Arrange each tournedo on a heated plate and garnish with watercress. Nap the sauce Madeira around the tournedos. In a saucepan, bring Madeira, shallots, and thyme to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until only 1/3 cup remains. Add the stock; continue to reduce, over medium heat, until slightly thickened.

Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, salt and water. Using a fork beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water and salt. Using the fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture; be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, dont worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately do not refrigerate. Roll and cut the pasta into desired shape.

Pound chicken breasts lightly on each side flipping twice. Place the bread crumbs in a shallow baking dish. Bread each breast by pushing down into bread crumbs and then flipping so both sides are breaded. Place the breasts in the hot pan and saute until lightly browned on each side. Drain the oil from the pan. The next 2 steps must be done quickly while pan is on the burner. Add the minced garlic to the hot pan, NOT on the chicken breasts. Add mushrooms, tomatoes, basil and marsala wine. Flip chicken breasts over placing them on top of the ingredients so they cook and the breasts do not burn. Let the alcohol burn off and let the wine soak in for a minute. Stir in the half-and-half, marinara sauce, and chicken broth and cook over high heat. Add pepper and continue cooking on high heat until liquid reduces into a thick, golden brown sauce, 3 to 5 minutes. If serving right away. Remove the chicken breasts from the pan and transfer to a serving platter. Pour the sauce directly from the pan onto the chicken breasts and serve. If making ahead of time and/or for a more tender and juicy Chicken Marsala. Do NOT remove the breasts; instead pour the entire contents of the saute pan into a baking dish and put in a preheated 175 degrees F oven for 1 hour. Carefully remove chicken breasts and transfer to a serving platter. Pour the sauce from the pan over the chicken breasts and serve &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 17677,&quot;Clam Chowder 5 pounds littleneck clams, scrubbed in cold water until no grit remains on the shells 8 ounces pre-sliced bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces Dried Aleppo pepper (or any other smoky dried pepper), for dusting 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 stalks green celery, washed, trimmed and sliced into 1/2-inch rounds Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 2 leeks (white and light green part only), cleaned and diced 1 small yellow onion, peeled and diced 1 cup dry vermouth 2 cups heavy cream 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 4 Yukon gold potatoes, washed and cut into 3/4-inch dice 2 bay leaves Hot sauce, for flavor Worcestershire sauce, for flavor 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon dry marsala Baked Bread, for dipping, recipe follows Eight 3/4- to 1-inch-thick slices sourdough bread 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 cloves garlic, peeled, halved lengthwise and cut into thin slices Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper 2 teaspoons paprika 1 teaspoon dill seeds Instructions: Place a large pot or rondeau on the stove and add 3 cups water. Bring the water to a boil and add the clams. Cook until the clams pop open. Though it is important to stir the clams as they cook, take care because the shells are fragile and break easily. Put the clams in a colander and reserve the cooking liquid. Shell the clams; discard the shells and reserve the clam meat and the liquid separately. Add the bacon to another large pot and cook over medium heat until crispy. Drain the bacon with a slotted spoon onto a paper towel, dust with Aleppo pepper and set aside. Add the butter to the bacon fat in the pot and quickly cook the celery, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Remove the celery with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the garlic, leeks and onions to the pot and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Cook until the vegetables become tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the vermouth. Continue to cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, in another large pot, combine the cream, thyme, potatoes and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Add a splash of hot sauce and Worcestershire. Stir to blend. Taste for seasoning. There is a good chance there will be grit in the clam cooking liquid. Strain it and add it to the onion/leek mixture. Stir to blend. Taste for seasoning. Combine with the potato mixture. Add the clam meat, reserved celery, tarragon and dill. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Add the marsala. Taste for seasoning. Add more cream and water if needed.

Pat the spice rub onto the meat, making sure to heavily season the entire surface area. Cover or wrap the pork and let it sit at room temperature while getting the smoker or charcoal grill fired up. Do not leave at room temperature for longer than 1 hour. The grill is ready when the charcoal has burned to a white ash. If using a grill instead of a smoker, arrange the coals on 1 side of the grill, leaving an area large enough for the pork to cook indirectly with no coals directly underneath the meat. When the grill has reached 200 to 225 degrees F, scatter 1/4 of the wood chips over the coals, close the grate, put the pork on the grill and close the lid. Maintain a 200 to 225 degree F cooking temperature inside the grill, adding coals every 2 hours or as necessary. Add wood chips and spray the pork with apple juice every time you add new coals. Try not to lift the lid of the cooker at any other time. When the pork reaches an internal temperature of 165 to 170 degrees F on an instant read meat thermometer (after about 4 to 5 hours), remove it from the grill and double wrap in aluminum foil to keep the juices from leaking out. Return pork to the grill (or smoker) The pork is finished cooking when it pulls apart easily and reaches an internal temperature of 190 to 195 degrees F, about another 1 to 2 hours. Let rest for 1 hour, then unwrap the pork butt and pull the bone out. \Pull\ the pork by hand, shredding it and discarding any large pieces of fat.

Spray a 9-inch heart-shaped cake pan with cooking spray and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Prepare the cake batter according to the package directions and pour into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Invert the cake pan onto a plate to remove the cake from the pan, then invert back onto the rack to let cool completely. For the sugar glass: Line a baking sheet with parchment. Stir together the sugar, corn syrup and cream of tartar in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave in 2-minute intervals, stirring in between each, until the sugar starts to dissolve and the mixture turns a very light golden, about 4 minutes. Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and smooth with an offset spatula into a thin rectangle about 9 inches by 7 inches. Refrigerate until hardened completely, about 15 minutes. Use a meat mallet to break the sugar so that it resembles broken glass. For the frosting: Melt the chocolates and heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. For the whipped cream: Whip the heavy cream and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Assemble the cake: Once the cake has cooled, use a serrated knife to shave off the top to make it flat (it domes as it bakes). Cut the cake in half horizontally to make 2 even layers, then, keeping the layers stacked, use a paring knife to cut jagged edges in a zigzag formation down the middle of the cake so that you have 2 halves of a broken heart. Place the 2 bottom halves on a cake stand or plate so they are separated a little. Spread the whipped cream evenly over the bottom halves. Top with the 2 top halves and drizzle the melted frosting over the top so that it covers the top and drips down the sides of the cake. Decorate with the broken sugar glass and refrigerate until the chocolate has hardened, about 15 minutes.

Remove the meat from the marinade. Pour the marinade into a small saucepan; add shallot and set aside. Brush a ridged grill pan (see Tip) or heavy skillet with oil; heat over medium-high heat. Add the meat and cook for 10 to 12 minutes per side for medium-rare, depending on thickness, or until it reaches desired doneness. (It may appear that the meat is burning but don&#39;t worry, it will form a pleasant crust.) Transfer the meat to a cutting board; let rest for 5 minutes. While the meat is cooking, bring the marinade to a boil; cook over medium-high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, or until it is reduced to about 1/2 cup. Remove from the heat; add butter and whisk until melted. Slice the meat thinly against the grain. Add any juices on the cutting board to the sauce. Serve the meat with the sauce.

(As you may imagine, I like this.) Then press down again, so that the chicken is flattened slightly. Now cut off the ankle joint below the drumstick (but keep them); I find kitchen scissors up to the task. Put the oil in a large, flame-safe cooking pot (with a lid) in which the chicken can fit snugly: mine is about 11 inches wide by 4 inches deep. Heat the oil over medium heat and add the chicken, breast side down. Brown the chicken for a few minutes, then raise the heat and turn the chicken over, tossing in the ankle joints as you do so. Add the wine or vermouth and let it bubble down a little before adding the leeks, carrots, and celery. Pour in enough cold water to cover the chicken, though the very top of it may poke out. Add the bouquet garni or your herbs of choice, and the parsley stalks or sprigs along with the salt and red peppercorns or a good grinding of regular pepper. The chicken should be almost completely submerged by now and if not, do add some more cold water. You want it just about covered. Bring to a bubble, clamp on the lid, turn the heat to very low, and let cook for 1 1/2 hours, or 1 hour 40 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let stand, covered, for 20 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle the chicken with parsley leaves. Serve the chicken and accompanying vegetables with brown basmati rice, adding a ladleful or 2 of liquid over each shallow bowl, as you go, and putting fresh dill and mustard on the table for the eaters to add as they wish.

Butter a 12-cup Bundt pan and flour the buttered surface, shaking out the excess. Place hazelnuts in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pulse continuously until finely ground. Bring a small pan of water to a boil and remove from heat. Place chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set over the pan of water, stirring occasionally, until melted. Remove bowl from pan and set aside. In a large mixer bowl beat the butter and 1/2 cup of the sugar until soft and light. Beat in the chocolate and scrape bowl and beater(s). Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time. Scrape bowl and beater(s). Stir in the ground hazelnuts and the flour by hand. In a clean, dry mixer bowl, whip the egg whites with the salt on medium speed, until they are frothy. Continue whipping the egg whites until they are white and opaque, and beginning to hold their shape when the beater(s) are lifted. Increase the speed and gradually whip in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, continuing to whip the egg whites until they hold a soft, glossy peak. Stir a quarter of the egg whites into the batter to lighten it, then fold in the remaining egg whites with a rubber spatula, continuing to fold until no streaks of egg white remain. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake the cake about 35 to 45 minutes, until it is well risen and a toothpick or skewer inserted between the edge of the pan and the central tube emerges clean. Place a rack on the pan and invert cake and pan to rack to cool. Remove pan after 5 minutes and allow cake to cool. For glaze, combine water, corn syrup and sugar in a saucepan and stir well to mix. Place over low heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat and add chocolate. Swirl pan so that chocolate is submerged in hot syrup, then allow to stand 2 minutes. Whisk glaze smooth. Before glazing cake, cut a disk that will fit under the cake from stiff corrugated cardboard. Cut a hole in the canter corresponding to the central tube in the cake pan. Slide the cardboard under the cake and place it on a rack over a jelly roll pan. Pour glaze from pan onto highest point of cake, all around, allowing glaze to drip down outside and center of cake. Let glaze dry before moving cake. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 17752,&quot;Chicken-Ham Croquettes 1/2 cup finely diced country ham 1 1/2 cups whole milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup finely chopped shallots 1/4 cup finely chopped celery 1 clove garlic, minced 1 sprig thyme Large pinch of cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Vegetable oil, for brushing and frying 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs 3 large eggs Honey mustard, for dipping Instructions: Put the ham and 1/2 cup milk in a small bowl; refrigerate 1 hour.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper and add as many pieces skin side down to the pan as fit without touching. Cook, turning as necessary, until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove the pieces as they are done and set aside. Adjust the heat under the pan, especially after you start removing chicken, so the chicken browns without the oil darkening. When all the chicken is removed from the pan, add the Sofrito and alcaparrado. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Raise the heat to high and boil until most of the water is evaporated from the Sofrito. Add the cumin and cloves. Stir in the rice until coated with oil. Return the chicken to the pan, pour in enough broth to cover the rice by the width of 2 fingers (about 1-inch), and bring to a boil. Cook over high heat until the level of liquid reaches the rice. Stir gently and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and cook until the liquid is absorbed, the chicken is cooked through, and the rice is tender but firm, about 20 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork. The arroz con pollo can be brought to the table right in the pan or transferred to a large serving platter. Either way, garnish with the red pepper before serving. Heat the oil and annatto seeds in a small skillet over medium heat just until the seeds give off a lively, steady sizzle. Don&#39;t overheat the mixture or the seeds will turn black and the oil will turn a nasty green. Once they&#39;re sizzling, remove the pan from the heat and let stand until the sizzling stops. Strain and reserve in a jar with a tight-fitting lid at room temperature for up to 4 days. Chop the onion and Cubanelle or Italian peppers in the work bowl of a food processor until coarsely chopped. With the motor running, add the remaining ingredients 1 at a time and process until smooth. The sofrito will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Remove the innards of the duck and reserve them for another use, or discard. Remove any loose pockets of fat surrounding the cavity. Season the inside of the duck with salt. In a pot large enough to hold the duck, combine the water, 3/4 cup of the soy sauce and 1/3 cup of honey. Bring the mixture to a simmer over low heat. Add in the brine from the green peppercorns, lower the heat and submerge the duck, breast side down, into the pot. Let it simmer 30 seconds, basting the top side with the liquid. Remove the duck and arrange it, breast side down, in a roasting pan fitted with a rack that elevates it off the bottom of the pan. The rack will allow hot air to circulate around it as it cooks. (Cook&#39;s note: Ideally, the duck should sit overnight to allow the flavors to meld with the meat and for the skin to dry out. This will mean a crispier skin, once the duck is cooked.) Put the roasting pan into the oven and turn the temperature down to 400 degrees F. Allow about 15 minutes roasting time for each pound of duck. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, remove the pan from the oven, then flip the duck. Using a turkey baster, remove the excess fat from the bottom of the roasting pan and transfer it to a heatproof liquid measuring cup. Return the duck to the oven and cook for another 45 minutes to1 hour, depending upon the size of your duck. Meanwhile, in a medium pot, combine the champagne vinegar with the remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup honey, Marsala and the reserved green peppercorns. Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and simmer gently, allowing the glaze to reduce and the flavors to blend. Taste for seasoning. Allow it to cook until all the flavors meld together. Remove the duck from the oven and baste it with the drippings in the bottom of the pan. The duck should register about 150 F when an instant-read thermometer is inserted into the thigh meat. Transfer it to a platter and pour half of the glaze over the breast and thigh meat. Reserve the remaining glaze for plating. Allow the bird to \rest\ for about 15 minutes. Carve the duck and arrange on a serving platter. Season the flesh, with salt, if desired, and top with remaining glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 17781,&quot;Crunch Salad 2 handfuls alfalfa and broccoli sprouts 2 handfuls mung bean sprouts 2 handfuls sunflower salad shoots Mixed edible flowers 1 bunch fresh mint, leaves picked 2 baby courgettes (zucchini), sliced thinly lengthways 2 red chicory, cut in 1/2 then finely shredded 1 bunch baby carrots, sliced thinly lengthways 1/2 fennel bulb, halved and sliced finely 1 bunch French breakfast radishes, sliced lengthways 1 head celery, outer stalks and ends removed, halved and finely sliced lengthways 2 tablespoons French mustard 4 tablespoons creme fraiche 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 to 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Mix all the vegetables together in a bowl.

Put the eggs, water, salt, basil, and oil in the well. Slowly incorporate flour to well until you have a sticky ball of dough. Add more flour if necessary. Start your kneading process by using the balls of your hands-working the dough until all ingredients are mixed well and dough is dry to the touch. Divide the pasta in 4 pieces, flatten each piece about 3 by 2 inches, or a thumb nail thickness. Set the pasta machine on the highest setting and put the dough through the machine 3 times a setting until you get to the second to lowest setting at which you will have 4 sheets of pasta. Trim the pasta sheets to make each sheet square. Cut the pasta sheets into smaller squares about 3 inches long. Place a kiss in the middle of the square laying another square on top. Dip a fork into water and press the ravioli together on all 4 sides (the water acts as the glue). Put the ravioli in boiling water for 3 minutes. To make the sauce, add the strawberries, sugar and remaining 3 tablespoons water and blend until smooth. Put a spoonful of the puree on the plate and place the ravioli on top of the sauce. Add some fresh mint, extra chocolate candy kisses, and sliced strawberries for garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 17784,&quot;Harissa-Baked Eggs with Feta, Mint, and Black Olives 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 4 large eggs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1/2 cup black olives, pitted and roughly chopped 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, roughly sliced 2 tablespoons harissa 2 cups canned chopped tomatoes with their juices 2 cups chicken stock 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese 1 cup Bush&#39;s Best garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained 1/2 teaspoon cumin seed Instructions:</p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.</li><li>Rub four ramekins with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the olive oil.

Whisk the egg whites until firm and fold into the batter. Cut each courgette in 1/2 lengthways, but not cutting all the way through, so you still have the flower intact on the end. Heat oil for deep frying to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Dip each courgette with its flower into the batter, and fry in the oil until crispy and golden brown. Drain them on kitchen paper, then place them on a serving plate, sprinkle with salt, chiles and mint, and drizzle with vinegar. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o]&quot; 17800,&quot;Beef Tenderloin with Quick Red Wine Pan Sauce One 3- to 5-pound beef tenderloin, trimmed 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 3 cloves garlic, crushed<br> 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 medium shallot, minced<br> 1 cup red wine<br> 2 cups beef stock<br> 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> Instructions: Remove the tenderloin from the refrigerator 1 hour prior to cooking. On the tail end of the tenderloin, about a third of the way from where it begins to taper, make an incision almost all the way through the beef. Fold the tail onto the larger portion to make an even cylinder throughout. Use ten to twelve 8-inch pieces of butcher&#39;s twine to tie the tenderloin crosswise every 3/4 to 1 inch. This will help it to keep its shape and cook evenly. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Pat the tenderloin dry. Brush with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season heavily with salt and pepper all around. Put the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the beef and sear on all sides until a nice crust is formed, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Add the thyme, garlic and 3 tablespoons of the butter to the pan. Once the butter is melted, use a spoon to baste the beef with the herb and garlic infused butter for 30 seconds. Transfer the beef to a rack on a baking sheet, spoon over 2 tablespoons of the herb and garlic butter mixture from the cast-iron pan (reserve the pan) and roast until the internal temperature of the thickest part reaches 120 degrees F (for medium rare), 1 to 2 hours, depending on the size of the tenderloin. Cover the beef with foil and rest for 15 minutes. Add the shallots to the remaining herb and garlic butter mixture in the cast-iron pan and sweat over medium heat until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Deglaze with the red wine and reduce until almost dry, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the beef stock, bring to a simmer and reduce by half, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, thoroughly mix the remaining 2 tablespoons butter with the flour in a small bowl. Reduce the heat to low and slowly whisk in the butter and flour mixture bit by bit, until the sauce reaches the desired consistency. Serve with the perfectly roasted beef. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Barolo]&quot; 17801,&quot;Pork Medallions 2 pork tenderloins (about 1 pound each) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3/4 cup teriyaki sauce 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1/4 cup ginger sauce<br> 1/4 cup orange juice 2 cloves garlic, minced 4 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 medium red onion, coarsely chopped<br> 1/4 cup honey<br> 1/4 cup orange marmalade<br> 1/4 cup tomato-vegetable juice, such as V8<br> 2 oranges<br> Instructions: Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper. In a baking dish, mix 1/2 cup of the teriyaki sauce together with the cider vinegar, ginger sauce, orange juice and garlic. Add the pork and coat well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 24 hours. The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet. Remove the tenderloins from the marinade and put them in the hot oil. Sear on all sides, then return the pork to the baking dish with the marinade. Add the chopped red onion to the skillet, saute until translucent, then add it to the baking dish. Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake for 20 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce along with the honey, marmalade, and tomato-vegetable juice. When 20 minutes are up, remove the pork from the oven, remove the foil, and with a very sharp knife cut deep slits into the meat. Pour the honey sauce into these slits and over the meat. Slice the unpeeled oranges into 1/4-inch crosswise pieces and arrange the slices on the top and sides of tenderloins. Return the meat to the oven and bake, uncovered, until the orange slices begin to curl, about 15 additional minutes. Remove the meat from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing into medallions.

Keep in mind that when you add the solid ingredients the water level will rise, so don&#39;t fill the pot up more than 1/2 way. Squeeze the lemon juice into the water, tossing in the halves too. Add the bay leaves, salt, seasoning, onions, and garlic; bring the broth to a boil over medium-high heat and simmer for 10 minutes. You want a very aromatic broth with plenty of salt and spices; taste it, don&#39;t be afraid to make it strong so some of that flavor can penetrate and get absorbed by the potatoes and stuff. Add the potatoes to the pot to give them a head start and simmer for 10 minutes. Now add the corn and sausage; cook another 10 minutes, making sure everything stays covered with the liquid. Toss in the crawfish and shut off the heat. Cover the pot and let the crawfish steep in the flavor for 15 minutes. Drain and spread the crawfish, sausage, corn, potatoes, and onions out on a table that&#39;s covered with newspaper.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla and egg until incorporated. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Transfer 1 tablespoon dough to a small bowl and add 1 drop orange food coloring. Use a small spoon to mix until an even vibrant orange; set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon yellow food coloring to the dough left in the bowl and mix on low until an even vibrant yellow. Refrigerate both doughs on a baking sheet, uncovered, until just firm, about 20 minutes.<br> Roll the yellow dough into an 8-inch cylinder, about 1 1/2 inches wide. Flatten the top of the log slightly to form an oval or egg-shaped log. Roll the orange dough into an 8-inch rope. Press into a triangular shape by flattening the sides (a ruler is helpful for this). Freeze both doughs on a baking sheet, uncovered, until hard, about 20 minutes. Slice lengthwise through the yellow log, cutting off the top third and making 2 half-moon logs, one larger and one smaller. Make a small slit, about 1/8 inch deep, down the length of the larger log on the center flat side. Gently insert one of the pointed sides of the orange dough into the slit, being careful not to flatten out the triangle. Place the smaller log on top and press together to seal and re-form into an egg-shaped log, making sure the edges are smooth. Freeze until solid, about 1 hour. Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.<br> Cut 1/4 inch off each end of the log with a very sharp knife. Slice the cylinder into 24 cookies, each about 1/3 inch thick. Arrange the slices about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until crisp and just starting to turn brown on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.<br> Make the icing: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons water and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft glossy peaks form, adding up to 1 more tablespoon water if necessary. Cover the bowl with a damp paper towel and plastic wrap until ready to use to prevent the icing from drying out. (Makes about 2 1/4 cups.) When ready to ice the cookies, transfer about 1/2 cup of the icing to a resealable plastic bag and snip a small opening in one corner. Use this icing to pipe a thin border around the bottom half of each cookie and make an outline of a cracked eggshell about halfway up. Let set for a few minutes.<br> Thin the remaining icing with a few drops of water until it&#39;s the consistency of syrup. Transfer about 1 cup of the thinned icing to a resealable plastic bag. Divide the remaining thinned icing among 3 small bowls and tint each with a different color of pastel food coloring; transfer each color to a separate resealable plastic bag.<br> Snip a corner of the white icing bag and pipe a generous amount inside the icing border of each cookie. Using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon, spread the icing to cover the cookie inside the border. Use the white icing to attach 2 mini chips for the eyes. Snip a corner of each pastel-tinted icing bag and use them to decorate the eggshells. Decorate with sprinkles or decorating sugar as desired. Let the icing dry completely before serving, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17811,&quot;Pirate Ship Pork Loin 1 (2 to 3-pound) pork loin 12 ounces Creole garlic marinade (recommended: Cajun Injector Garlic Creole Butter) 1/2 cup Barbecue Rub, recipe follows 12 ounces apple juice 1 cup prepared barbecue sauce<br> 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon garlic power 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat.

In each egg, make 6 - 8 shallow slashes lengthways to allow the flavors of the stew to enter. Smack the ginger and spring onion gently with the flat side of a Chinese cleaver or a rolling pin to loosen their fibers. Put the pork in a pan, cover with cold water, bring to the boil over a high flame and boil for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse it under the cold tap. When cool enough to handle, cut the meat through the skin into 1 - 1 1/2-in (2-3cm) cubes (if your piece of belly is thick, you may want to cut each piece in half so they end up more cube-like). Heat the oil in a seasoned wok over a high flame. Add the ginger, spring onion, star anise and cassia and stir-fry briefly until they smell wonderful. Add the pork and fry for another 1 - 2 minutes until the meat is faintly golden and some of the oil is running out of the fat. Splash the Shaoxing wine around the edges of the pan. Add the hard-boiled eggs and stock or hot water, along with the light soy sauce, 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce and the sugar. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour into a pot or a bowl, allow to cool, then chill overnight. In the morning, remove the layer of pale fat that has settled on the surface. Tip the meat and jellied liquid back into a wok, reheat gently, then boil over a high flame to reduce the sauce, stirring constantly. Remove and discard the ginger, spring onion and whole spices. After 10 - 15 minutes, when the liquid has reduced by about half, stir in the remaining dark soy sauce. Shortly before you wish to serve, bring to the boil over a high flame and reduce the sauce to about an inch of dark, sleek gravy. Turn out into a serving dish. Then go and welcome your son back from his imperial civil service examinations! If you have any leftovers - unlikely, in my experience - you can reheat them with a little water and some dried bamboo shoot, winter melon, tofu knots, deep-fried tofu puffs or radishes. In fact, you might wish, like some of my Chinese friends, to red-braise odd scraps of fatty pork just to cook vegetables, because it makes them so delicious. Shanghai red-braised pork Omit the eggs and increase the amount of pork to 1kg. Use only 1 1/2 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 1/2 tbsp plus 1 tsp dark soy sauce, 2 1/2 tbsp sugar and 2 cups (500ml) hot water. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Tempranillo]&quot; 17833,&quot;Caramelized Ginger Chicken 12 meaty chicken thighs, boned and trimmed with skins still on 7 oz fresh ginger, peeled and finely shredded 3 1/2 fl oz sunflower oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 tablespoons fish sauce 2 fl oz caramel (see Note) 4 large watercress sprigs, for garnish Instructions: Cut each chicken thigh into three equal pieces. Place in a large bowl with the ginger, two-thirds of the oil, and salt and pepper. Cover and marinate for about 6 hours in the refrigerator.

Heat a 7 1/2-by-5 1/2-inch tamagoyaki pan (or an 8-inch nonstick skillet) over medium heat. Fold a piece of paper towel, dip it into vegetable oil and use it to grease the pan.<br> Pour in enough of the egg mixture to lightly coat the bottom of the pan, tilting the pan as needed. Cook until the egg is just set on the bottom but a little underdone on the top, about 1 minute. Using chopsticks or a spatula (see Cook\u2019s Note), roll up the egg from the far end of the pan toward you. If you are having trouble getting the egg to fold over itself, use your fingers or a fork to help it along. When the egg is rolled up, push it to the far end of the pan.<br> Grease the exposed part of the pan with the piece of paper towel. Pour in enough of the egg mixture to lightly coat the bottom of the pan, tilting the pan as needed. Cook until the egg is just set on the bottom but a little underdone on the top, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Start with the already rolled egg at the far end of the pan and, using chopsticks or a spatula, roll the omelet toward you. Repeat the process until all of the egg mixture is cooked. (For 2 eggs in a 7 1/2-by-5 1/2-inch tamagoyaki pan, you\u2019ll generally form about 4 layers.)<br> Carefully turn the rolled omelet out onto a cutting board (see Cook\u2019s Note) and slice crosswise into 3/4-inch pieces.

Using your hands, thoroughly mix all the ingredients together until the meat is sticky, just a few minutes. Allow the meat to rest about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the cherries and the cashews in a small bowl. When meat has rested, divide into 16 equal portions. Roll each one into 2-inch sausage shapes. Make a long indentation in each sausage and stuff with 1/2 teaspoon of the dried cherry stuffing and pinch the meat together over the stuffing. Roll the kebab between your hands to thoroughly seal it. Repeat with the remaining kebabs.<br> Warm the oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet until shimmering. Place the kebabs in the pan in a circular formation, making sure none of the kebabs touch. By the time you&#39;ve placed your last kebab in the pan it will probably be time to start turning the first ones you set down.

Add to a small bowl along with the yogurt, olive oil, lemon zest and some salt and pepper, stirring until well combined. Place the lamb in a large resealable bag and pour in the yogurt marinade. Mix it around so the lamb is completely coated all over. Squeeze out any air, reseal the bag and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. When the lamb is marinated, remove it from the bag and wipe off any excess with paper towels. Unfold the lamb, drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle well with salt and pepper on both sides; this will help form a nice crust. Grill for about 15 minutes, then flip once and cook for another 12 minutes on the second side until cooked through and you have some color on the lamb. When done, remove from the grill, tent with foil and let rest for 10 to 12 minutes before carving across the grain into thin slices. Take the baguette and split horizontally lengthwise so you have long halves. Place on the grill to warm the bread through and get slightly crisp, about 2 minutes per side. To assemble the sandwiches, smear the bread with Harissa Mayo, stack with slices of lamb and Quick Pickled Sweet Cucumbers. Place the top of the baguette on and slice the sandwich into quarters. Mix the mayonnaise, sour cream, harissa, vinegar and cumin together in a large bowl and stir with a whisk to combine. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper as desired. Refrigerate and serve smeared on lamb sandwiches. Add the cucumber slices and cl slices to a medium bowl and toss to combine. In a medium saucepan, add the vinegar, sugar, 1/2 water and salt. Heat gently, stirring, just until the sugar and salt dissolve. Pour over the cucumbers and chiles in the bowl. Set aside to marinate at least 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 17856,&quot;Aggie&#39;s Orange Coconut Scones 3 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons self-rising white flour Pinch fine sea salt 1 3/4 tablespoons organic sugar, plus 1/4 cup for topping 2 teaspoons baking powder 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus more for serving 2 eggs 1 cup cold milk, plus 1 tablespoon for glaze 1 large orange, zested 1 egg yolk 1/4 cup fresh coconut, grated Honey, for serving Instructions: Line a large baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone mat and set aside. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Sift the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder into a large bowl. Cut the butter into small cubes and rub it into the flour with your hands. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs, and then add the milk. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and mix it until just blended. Add 3 teaspoons of orange zest and lightly knead the dough. It is important to keep the kneading to a minimum, or the scones will be hard and as tough as nails. Put the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll it to about a 1-inch thickness. Cut the scones with a 2-inch round fluted cutter, as closely as possible to avoid wasting dough. Put them on the prepared baking sheet, about 1-inch apart. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg yolk and the remaining milk and brush this over the scone tops. In another bowl, mix the remaining sugar, coconut, and orange zest and sprinkle this evenly over the top of each scone. Bake the scones in the center of the oven until they have risen and are lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool the scones on a wire rack and then split them.

Add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, parsley, salt, red pepper flakes and egg. Use your hands to lightly mix all of the ingredients together, being careful not to overmix. Roll the mixture into balls (2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter). You should get about 10 meatballs. Place the meatballs on a sheet pan in the fridge to rest for about 30 minutes. Cook the meatballs: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil. Working in batches if necessary, cook the meatballs in a single layer, spreading them apart so as to not overcrowd the skillet. Cook, rotating the meatballs every couple of minutes to brown all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to remove them to a clean sheet pan or plate. Set aside. For the sauce: While the meatballs are cooking, heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the oil and let it start to smoke slightly. Add the pork bones and sear until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from the pot and place on a plate or sheet pan. Add the sausage to the pot and brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pot and add to the pork bones. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the onions, dried parsley or Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and let cook until the garlic almost liquifies in the pot, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. Add the pured tomatoes. Add 1 1/2 cups water to the tomato cans and swirl them around to rinse off the residual tomato that clings to the sides. Add the tomato water to the pot along with the sugar and half the basil. Season with a large pinch of salt and some pepper. Give the pot a good stir, then add the seared pork bones, sausage and meatballs. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down to low. Place a lid on top of the pot, but don\u2019t cover it completely; leave a small opening to allow some steam to escape. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened a bit and the meat is tender, 3 to 4 hours. Taste the sauce for seasoning and add more salt if needed. Add the remaining fresh basil and stir gently. Serve the sauce and meat over your favorite pasta with grated cheese on the side and with a loaf of crusty Italian bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Garnacha]&quot; 17869,&quot;Potted Beef with Pears and Cipollini Onions and Horseradish Cream Kosher salt 2 pounds cipollini onions (about 2 sacks) or 1 1/2 pounds red or yellow pearl onions 3 pounds stew beef or beef chuck, cut into 2- to 2 1/2-inch pieces<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil<br> 3 tablespoons butter<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme<br> 1 teaspoon ground allspice<br> Pinch ground cloves<br> Freshly grated nutmeg<br> 2 teaspoons honey<br> 1/2 cup dry sherry<br> 1 1/2 to 2 cups beef stock<br> 4 large underripe brown-skin pears, peeled and cut into 4 to 6 wedges each<br> 1 cup sour cream or creme fraiche<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped chives 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 3 tablespoons prepared horseradish, such as Gold&#39;s<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Pernil 2 cups orange juice, divided 2 teaspoons white vinegar 3 tablespoons olive oil 10 garlic cloves, minced 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ancho chili powder 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided 1 (8 to 9-pound) picnic-cut, bone-in pork shoulder Water, as needed Instructions: In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the orange juice with the vinegar, olive oil, garlic, cayenne pepper, oregano, cumin, ancho chili powder, black pepper and 1 teaspoon of the salt to form a paste. Set aside. Wash the pork shoulder and pat the meat dry with a paper towel. Put the shoulder, fat side up, on a cutting board. Leaving the fat in a single piece and attached at 1 end, use a knife to remove the layer of fat from the shoulder, opening it like a book to reveal the meat. Then, use the knife to poke 1-inch deep holes into the meat on all sides. Rub the spice paste around the shoulder, working it into the punctures. Return the fat back to its original position. Score the fat with diagonal cuts and sprinkle the remaining salt over both sides of fat. Wrap the shoulder tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 8 hours or overnight. Remove the pork from the refrigerator 1 hour before you start cooking. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pour the remaining orange juice into a roasting pan. Unwrap the pork from the plastic and put it in the pan, fat side up. Roast, uncovered, for 30 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Roast for 3 hours and 45 minutes longer. If the orange juice dries up during the cooking process, add in more juice or water. Serve when the internal temperature of the pork reaches 185 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. The meat should pull away with the prick of a fork and the skin is crispy. Remove the meat from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for 20 minutes, under a tent of aluminum foil, before serving. Slice the meat, arrange it on a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 17900,&quot;Pappa al Pomodoro 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/2 medium onion, diced 2 leeks, medium-sized, sliced 1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic 1/2 tablespoon crushed red pepper Salt 3 cups dry, crustless, Italian bread 2 cups chicken stock 2 cups best quality Italian chopped tomatoes Instructions: Heat olive oil in a saucepan over low heat.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to brown. Add the quinces and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned in spots, about 3 minutes. Add the cranberries, granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is syrupy, the quinces are tender and the cranberries start to burst (or you can pop them), 4 to 5 minutes more. Stir in the salt. Transfer the mixture to a metal bowl and refrigerate until cool, about 15 minutes. Dice the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into bits and fold it into the fruit. Cut the pie crusts into twelve 4-inch rounds. (You&#39;ll have to reroll the scraps from each crust to get enough.) Fill a small bowl with water. Brush the edge of one of the pastry rounds with water. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon (about 1 1/4 ounces) filling into the center. Fold the dough over the filling, seal by pressing the edges with a fork and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling, leaving a few inches between the pies. Brush the tops with a little water and sprinkle with some of the raw sugar. Use a paring knife to cut two little vents in the tops of the pies. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 24 minutes, rotating the pan after 12 minutes. Place the pan on a rack and let the pies cool for 5 minutes before serving. They can also be served at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 17919,&quot;Lemon Cake with Lemon Meringue Buttercream 3 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature 2 cups sugar 5 extra-large eggs, room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pans 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup milk 1 1/4 cups sugar 5 large egg yolks 3 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch fine salt 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces 1 (1/2 pint) raspberries Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 (9-inch) round cake pans. Line bottoms with buttered parchment paper and dust with flour. In the bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter and sugar for 3 to 5 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Add the lemon juice and zest and mix well. In another large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Alternately beat in the dry ingredients and the milk to the batter in 3 parts, with dry ingredients at the beginning and the end. Mix until just combined. Pour the batter equally into the 2 pans. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until the tops are browned and a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a baking rack for 30 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto a rack to cool completely. Buttercream: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold an electric mixer bowl above the water. Whisk the sugar, the yolks, lemon juice, cream of tartar, and salt in the bowl by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the bowl to a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat the yolks at medium-high speed until light in texture and cool, about 10 minutes. Beat in the butter, a little at a time, until the icing is smooth and spreadable. To assemble: place 1 layer on a cake plate, browned side down, and spread with approximately 1/4 of the frosting. Top with the second layer, browned side up, and frost the top and sides. Decorate with raspberries.

Lavishly grease a cookie sheet or (preferably) cover it with parchment paper. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan. Add the optional onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until it&#39;s translucent. Add the rice and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, or until the rice had absorbed all the broth. Cook to lukewarm, then season to taste with pepper and stir in the optional parsley. Meanwhile, melt the rest of the butter in a small saucepan. Put 1 filo sheet in front of you and brush it lavishly with melted butter. Repeat this brushing process, using plenty of butter, stacking the sheets, until all the sheets have been used. Carefully spread the cooled rice over the filo sheets, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Top the rice with the turkey and the turkey with the cheeses. Slide your hand under a short end of the filo stack and lift up approximately 3 inches of it. Fold this over once, as if you were making the first fold in a business letter. Fold the long sides over to seal the filling. Continue folding until the strudel is all rolled up. Place the strudel on the cookie sheet seam side down. With a sharp knife, make several slashes in the top to let out the steam. Bale for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the strudel is well browned and crisp-looking. (Some of the filling may leak out onto the pan, but don&#39;t worry about that.) Let the strudel stand for 5 minutes before you slice it with a sharp knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17921,&quot;Sorbet Shots 1 pint sorbet Mellon baller 3/4 cup favored liqueur Instructions: Place small scoops of sorbet, using a melon baller, into shot glasses (only 1 flavor per glass).

Arrange the tomatoes on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil the tomatoes, turning occasionally, until blackened all over. Set aside to cool slightly. Core and roughly chop the tomatoes with their skins. Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, chipotles, cinnamon, allspice, and clove and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the vinegar and brown sugar and cook, stirring, until the liquid is slightly syrupy. Add the chopped tomatoes and salt and season with pepper, to taste. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Pass the ketchup through a food mill, discard the seeds and skins. Return the ketchup to the saucepan and place over medium heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until very thick, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator at least 3 hours or overnight for the flavors to come together. To make the potato skins: Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Pierce the potatoes all over with a fork. Bake the potatoes on the rack until tender, about 55 minutes. Set the potatoes aside to cool, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, put the garlic cloves and olive oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Cook until the garlic sizzles, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat and cook until the garlic is tender, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Remove the garlic and reserve. Raise the oven to 500 degrees F. Halve the potatoes lengthwise and gently scoop out the flesh, leaving about 1/4 inch of the flesh intact. Reserve the potato flesh for other recipes (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Cut the potato halves in half lengthwise and transfer them to a baking sheet. Pour the garlic oil over the potato skins and turn them until completely coated. Arrange the potato skins skin-side down and bake until crispy, turning once, about 15 minutes. Season skins with salt, to taste. Transfer the skins to a serving platter and serve with the ketchup. For an extra garlicky punch, chop up the reserved garlic and sprinkle it over the skins. Cook&#39;s Note: Don&#39;t throw away that leftover potato flesh! Use it as thickener for soups or stews, make crispy potato cakes, or whip up a batch of impromptu croquettes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 17985,&quot;Once a Year Cherry Pie 2 cups all-purpose bleached flour 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces 2 large eggs Sweet Dough for a 2-crust pie, recipe follows 3 pints fresh sour cherries, stemmed, rinsed and picked over 3/4 cup sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch 3 tablespoons water 1 teaspoon almond extract 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 egg well beaten with a pinch of salt 1 teaspoon sugar for finishing the top of the pie, optional One 9-inch Pyrex pie pan Instructions: In a food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Add butter to work bowl and pulse about 15 times until mixture is fine and powdery and resembles coarse ground cornmeal and no large pieces remain. Add the eggs and pulse ten times or so, until the dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. Press the dough into 2 equal disks. Sandwich the disks of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press into a 6-inch circle. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour. To make the filling, pit the cherries over a bowl. Slash the side of each one with a stainless steel paring knife and squeeze gently to extract the pits. Put the cherries in the bowl as they are pitted. When all the cherries have been pitted drain the juices from the bowl into a non-reactive saucepan and add 1 cup of the cherries and the sugar. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is very liquid--about 5 minutes. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and whisk the cherry and sugar mixture into it. Return to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over low heat, until it comes to a boil thickens and becomes clear. If it does not become clear, continue to cook over low heat an additional few minutes until it does. Pour into a large bowl and stir in the remaining filling ingredients, except the cherries then add the remaining cherries. Set racks at the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in pan. Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Prepare a diagonal lattice top crust. Flute the edge of the pie and carefully brush it with egg wash. If you wish, sprinkle the top the pie with sugar. Place the pie in the oven an and lower the temperature to 375 degrees. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is baked through and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently bubbling. If the top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30 minutes, move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10 minutes. Cool the pie on a rack. Serve wedges of pie alone or with ice cream. Keep the pie at room temperature on the day it is baked. For longer storage, refrigerate the pie well wrapped in plastic. To reheat remove the plastic and bake the pie at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 17986,&quot;Orecchiette with Toasted Breadcrumbs 1 pound dried orecchiette or other small shaped pasta 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2/3 cup Italian seasoned dried bread crumbs Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1 cup finely chopped prosciutto 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water.

Bake until golden, 12 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven. Use the handle of a wooden spoon to shape the edge of the curved cookie. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheets. Put the curved cookie on a clean parchment-lined baking sheet. Cut the ice cream out of the carton; slide onto the cookie. Use plastic wrap to gently press the ice cream so that it goes almost to the edge. Sprinkle the side of the ice cream with the cereal, pressing to adhere. Transfer to the freezer. To make \lettuce,\ combine the coconut with 3 drops green food coloring, 1 drop yellow food coloring and a small splash of water in a resealable plastic bag; shake and massage until the coconut is light green. Slice the Circus Peanuts into thin strips to look like shredded cheese; chop the cherries for the tomatoes. Sprinkle the coconut, Circus Peanuts and cherries over the cereal. Place the other cookie on top of the ice cream so the two cookie edges line up. Freeze until firm, at least 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 17997,&quot;Blini 26 ounces flour 3 1/2 ounces sugar 1 1/2 ounces salt 16 ounces warm milk 1 1/2 ounces yeast 5 eggs, separated 7 ounces salad oil 1 cup ground coffee Vegetable oil Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. In another bowl combine the warm milk and yeast, and completely dissolve. Whisk egg yolks in a small bowl. While whisking, add oil in a slow, steady stream to create an emulsion. Whisk until all of the oil is added and mayonnaise is made. Add the flour mixture to the mayonnaise, and gently mix until all ingredients are incorporated. Cover the mixture and let rest for 45 minutes. Whip the egg whites to a soft peak, and fold in ground coffee and yeast mixture. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add a drop of vegetable oil, and add a spoonful of the blini mixture. Cook as you would a pancake. Repeat process until all of the mixture is used up. Serve with butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 17998,&quot;Roasted Turkey Breast One 5- to 6-pound whole bone-in turkey breast 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Make-Ahead Gravy, recipe follows Red wine vinegar, to taste 2 medium yellow onions, cut into 6 wedges each 2 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch rounds 1 large head garlic, end removed, turned on its side and split through the middle to expose each clove 2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 turkey wings (about 8 to 10 ounces each) or 2 turkey legs (about 11 to 13 ounces each) 1/2 cup dry sherry 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 bay leaves, optional 4 to 5 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Fit a roasting pan with a rack and set aside. Get ready: Brush both sides of the turkey breast with the melted butter. Season the turkey breast with salt and pepper. Arrange the turkey breast on the rack and place the pan in the center of the oven to cook. Roast: Roast the turkey until the pan juices are clear (meaning free of any traces of blood) or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast registers 160 to 165 degrees F. I usually calculate 12 to 15 minutes per pound of meat. If your turkey breast is 5 pounds, start to check for doneness after 1 hour. Remove from the oven when done. Finish the gravy: Transfer the turkey breast to a cutting board, inverted with the skin side down, and let it rest for about 20 minutes. If serving with Make-Ahead Gravy, put the roasting pan on the burner and add all of the Make-Ahead Gravy to the pan. Simmer gently over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring to trap all the drippings from the turkey breast and enrich the gravy. Stir in a dash or two of red wine vinegar, or to taste. Serve: Turn the breast skin side up. Cut the breast off of the bone and sprinkle with salt. Cut the breast into thick slices and transfer to a platter. Pour any juices from the cutting board into the gravy for added flavor and stir to combine. If serving with gravy, you can keep the gravy on the side or spoon it around the meat. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Get ready: In the bottom of a roasting pan, arrange the onions, carrots, garlic and celery. Give them a drizzle of oil and season with salt and pepper. Place a rack on top of the vegetables in the roasting pan and brush it with oil to help prevent the wings/legs from sticking. Arrange the turkey wings or legs on the rack above the vegetables and season generously with salt and pepper. Place the pan in the center of the oven. Cook: Roast the turkey parts until the juices run clear (meaning free of any traces of blood) or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the wings/legs registers 160 to 165 degrees F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and place the pan directly on 2 burners of the stove. Build the gravy: Remove the rack from the pan and move the wings to the roasting pan. Move the garlic halves to a plate. Add the sherry to the pan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the liquid until only a thin layer remains, then whisk in the mustard. Add the bay leaves, if using, and 4 cups of the stock. Simmer gently over medium-low heat until the liquid reduces by about half, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the vinegar. Remove the turkey wings or legs and pick the meat off the bones and reserve. Discard the bay leaves, if used. Finish: Transfer about half of the liquid to a blender. Hold the garlic halves like lemon halves over the blender and \u201csqueeze\u201d the flesh from the peels, allowing the garlic \u201cmeat\u201d to fall into the blender. Blend on low speed until smooth. Add the cooked onions, celery and carrots and blend again until smooth. Transfer to a medium pot. If too thick, simmer with some additional stock. Taste for seasoning. Add the picked turkey meat to the gravy to give it texture and added meaty flavor. Let it cool to room temp, then transfer to a resealable container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. To reheat, add the gravy to a medium pot or a roasting pan a turkey was cooked in and place over medium heat. Whisk and thin to desired consistency with stock and/or pan drippings from a roasted turkey. Bring to a simmer, taste and adjust seasoning if needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 17999,&quot;Roasted Pork Shoulder (Pernil Al Horno) 1 boneless pork shoulder (about 4 pounds), skin on 4 garlic cloves, smashed 1 handful fresh oregano 4 tablespoons Kosher salt (1 tablespoon for every pound of meat) 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar Instructions: Place the pork, fat-side up, in a roasting pan fitted with a rack insert, and using a sharp knife, score the surface of the meat with small slits. Mash the garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper into a paste on a cutting board with the flat side of a knife; place the adobo in a bowl and stir in the oil and vinegar. Rub the garlic paste all over the pork, being sure to get into the incisions so the salt can penetrate the meat and pull out the moisture - this will help form a crust on the outside when cooked. Cover the pork with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or up to overnight. Allow the meat to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roast the pork for 3 hours, uncovered, until the skin is crispy-brown. Let the meat rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo]&quot; 18000,&quot;Fried Okra with Tomatoes 1 cup buttermilk 1 (16-ounce) bag frozen okra, thawed 2 cups peanut oil 1 (8.5-ounce) box corn muffin mix (recommended: Jiffy) 1 (10-ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (recommended: Ro&#39;tel) 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 tablespoon Creole or Cajun seasoning 2 tablespoons heavy cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large bowl combine buttermilk and okra and let sit for 5 minutes In a large cast iron skillet, heat peanut oil over high heat to 375 degrees F.

In a wok or deep, heavy saucepan, heat about 3 inches of peanut oil. (The oil must be very hot, about 375 degrees F.) Make the sauce: In a large skillet or saute pan, heat the 2 tablespoons of peanut oil. Over medium-high heat, saute the garlic just until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the sugar and continue to saute until the garlic begins to caramelize, 1 or 2 minutes longer. Deglaze the pan with the rice wine, rice wine vinegar, and soy sauce. Add the carrots, haricots verts, and 2 ounces of the green onion, reserving 1 ounce as garnish. Stir in the chili sauce and continue to cook until the sauce is reduced by half. Meanwhile, add salt to the boiling water and cook the noodles until they are al dente. Drain the noodles well and stir them into the sauce until they are well coated. Season the shrimp or calamari with salt and pepper and toss with the flour to coat lightly. Deep-fry the shrimp or calamari in small batches until golden, 1 or 2 minutes. (The easiest way to do this is to use a fine-mesh basket or strainer. Place the shrimp or calamari in the basket and gently ease the basket into the oil.) Drain on clean paper towels. To serve, divide the noodles and vegetables among 4 large warm plates. Arrange the shrimp or calamari over and around each portion and garnish with the remaining green onions. Drizzle a little sesame oil over the noodles and serve immediately. Prepare an ice bath. Separate the garlic into cloves and remove the ends of each clove. Fill a small saucepan with water. Salt lightly and bring to a boil. Carefully drop the whole cloves into the water and blanch for 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking process. Repeat the process. Drain the garlic and dry it well. The peels should slip off easily. Cut the garlic into slices and use as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 18027,&quot;Potato Chip Chicken Fingers and Baked Potatoes a la Mode 1 whole boneless, skinless chicken breast 5 to 6 ounces potato chips, plain, barbecue, or sour cream 1 egg 2 tablespoons milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Spread them out on a plate or cutting board and season both sides with salt and pepper. Preheat a griddle or grill pan to medium-high. Cut the bread into 6-inch segments and then cut each segment horizontally almost completely through so you can open it like a book. Open the sandwich halves and press them flat against the work surface with your hands until the bread doesn&#39;t spring back. Put cheese on the bottom half of each sandwich. Working in batches, melt 1 tablespoon butter on the griddle. Cook the zucchini until slightly browned and soft, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until pliable and nearly transparent, another 2 minutes. As zucchini is cooked, put it on top of the cheese, dividing equally among the sandwiches. Divide the olives among the sandwiches and close them, pressing to flatten. Working in batches, reduce the heat to medium-low and melt 1 tablespoon butter (for a small griddle) or 2 tablespoons butter (for a large griddle). Put the sandwiches on the griddle. Place a baking sheet on top of the sandwiches and weigh it down with something heavy, like canned goods or a cast-iron skillet. The idea is to make the sandwiches as flat as possible.

Simmer the clam cooking liquid over medium heat until reduced by two-thirds, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the heavy cream. Return the heat to medium, bring to a simmer and cook until thickened and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, 2 to 4 minutes. Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes; discard the oregano sprigs. Remove the clams from their shells and roughly chop. Working on a floured or cornmeal-dusted piece of parchment, gently stretch and press the dough into a 12- to 13-inch round. Sprinkle all over with the Parmesan, then top with the clam sauce (the sauce will spread as it bakes). Top with the clams, broccoli rabe and Calabrian chiles.<br> Transfer the pizza (on the parchment) to the hot stone and bake until the crust is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Slide the pizza onto a cutting board and let cool slightly. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges. Sprinkle the yeast over the hot water in a small bowl. Let stand until dissolved and slightly foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the bread flour, all-purpose flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the yeast mixture into the well and add the olive oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, dust the dough with flour and knead, dusting with more flour as needed, until very smooth and elastic but still slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough into two 1-pound balls. (If making sheet-pan pizza, let the dough rise, covered, on an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet coated with 3 tablespoons olive oil instead of in a bowl; do not divide into two balls.) If not using the dough right away, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 18044,&quot;Chicken Street Corn Skillet 3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken (from 1 large) 2 cups frozen, roasted corn with peppers and onions 4 ounces cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup mayonnaise One 4-ounce can chopped green chiles, not drained 2 cloves garlic, pressed 2 green onions, sliced 2 tablespoons salted butter, melted 1 mounded tablespoon chili powder, plus more for sprinkling 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream 1/2 cup crumbled Cotija 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro 3 limes One 8.8-ounce bag instant microwaveable Spanish rice, cooked according to package instructions 2/3 cup shredded pepper jack cheese Warmed tortillas and tortilla chips, for serving Tomato Avocado Salad, recipe follows 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes 1 avocado, diced 2 green onions, sliced thin 2 limes, juiced 2 tablespoons olive oil Pinch kosher salt Pinch freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

While the potatoes are cooking, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Cut each chicken thigh into 3 strips and place in a bowl. Rub the meat all over with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper, then toss. Heat a large frying pan, big enough to hold all the chicken pieces snugly in 1 layer, and put the chicken into the pan, skin side down. If you don&#39;t have a pan that&#39;s big enough, feel free to cook the chicken in 2 batches. Toss and fry over a high heat for 10 minutes or so, until almost cooked, then remove with a slotted spoon to an ovenproof pan or dish. Prick the tomatoes with a sharp knife. Place them in a bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for a minute or so. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, pinch off their skins. You don&#39;t have to, but by doing this they will become lovely and sweet when cooked, and their intense flavor will infuse the potatoes. By now the potatoes will be cooked. Drain them in a colander and lightly crush them by pushing down on them with your thumb. Bash up most of the oregano leaves with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar, or a Flavor Shaker if you have one. Add 4 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, a good splash of red wine vinegar and some pepper and give everything another bash. Add to the chicken with the potatoes, the tomatoes and the rest of the oregano leaves. Toss everything together carefully. Spread out in a single layer in an appropriately sized roasting pan, and bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until golden. Lovely served with an arugula salad dressed with some lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil, and a nice glass of white wine. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Transfer alligator to a colander and rinse all the buttermilk off the meat. Let it completely drain or pat dry with a paper towel. Saute the alligator and ground pork together with the vegetable oil in a large stockpot on medium heat until the meats start to brown and release liquid, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the cooked meat to a bowl to separate it from the liquid fat. Keeping the fat on medium heat, add the onions, celery, bell pepper and garlic, followed by the chipotles, jalapenos and serranos. Sweat this mixture down until onions turn clear. Add diced tomatoes. At this point, you will have a bit of liquid from all the fats and vegetables. Stir in 1/2 cup flour (or more, if desired) to thicken up the liquid and absorb the fats. Stir in the chicken stock, followed by the tomato sauce. Add the drained ranch beans, although this step is optional, depending on whether you want beans in your chili (hint: we always do). Cook, stirring regularly, until the pot hits a low boil. Add the alligator and pork mixture, along with half the beer. Stir in the cayenne, chili powder, cumin, turmeric, paprika, black pepper and salt. Reduce the heat to very low, then cover pot and simmer, stirring every 10 minutes or so to keep the chili from sticking to the bottom, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Though you could actually serve this dish now, as it will taste great, we truly feel that refrigerating and reheating it again adds to \the leftover effect\ which allows the flavors to really marinate and come out to a noticeable degree. Remove pot from heat and set to the side until chili hits room temperature. Refrigerate overnight. When ready to serve, just reheat slowly (up to a low boil), stirring in the remaining beer to loosen up the dish. Garnish with green onions, Cheddar, sour cream and hot sauce. We always garnish the chili with our signature Dixie Fried Blue Crab and Corn Hush Puppies. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 18063,&quot;Crab-Stuffed Flounder Rolls with Shrimp and Cockles 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 small bulb fennel, cored and finely chopped, plus 2 tablespoons chopped fronds 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 2/3 cup dry white wine 2 28-ounce cans diced tomatoes 1 8-ounce bottle clam juice 1 pound jumbo lump crab meat, picked over<br> 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest Kosher salt<br> 4 large flounder fillets (about 10 ounces each), halved lengthwise, or 8 small flounder fillets (4 to 5 ounces each) Freshly ground pepper 2 pounds cockles, scrubbed 1 pound rock shrimp Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.

Rub with garlic, pepper, and salt. Drizzle the brisket with the olive oil and rub into the meat. Place the brisket over hot coals of charcoal or wood fire and sear well on both sides. Fat side up will flame up quickly and must be well tended. To smoke the brisket, make a cold side and a hot side in the barbecue. Move all the coals to the right side, and put the brisket on the left side. Next, place some wood chips on a tin pan over the coals, and shut the barbecue lid. The coals need to be very close to the pan so the wood chips just begin to smolder. If they catch fire sprinkle them with water. After about 1 hour the wood will stop smoking and the brisket is ready to give to the \Wife.<br> Wife: Make a bed of the onions, carrots, and celery in a roasting pan or electric roaster, saving a small amount to put on top. Place the brisket with fat side up on the bed of vegetables, and arrange the bay leaves on and around the brisket. Top the meat with the remaining vegetables. Pour enough stock or water in the pan to cover the bottom 1 to 1 1/2 inches. Sprinkle with more salt and pepper. Cover and roast for 4 1/2 hours in a 350 degree F conventional oven, or for 4 hours at 350 degrees F in an electric roaster.
