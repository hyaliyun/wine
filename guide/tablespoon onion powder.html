large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, bell pepper, salt, and cayenne. Cook, stirring, until soft for about 6 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl and let cool slightly. Add the garlic, green onions, 2 of the eggs, and 1 cup of the bread crumbs. Stir to mix well. Divide into 8 equal portions and form into patties. Put the flour in a shallow bowl and season with 1 teaspoon of the Creole seasoning. Put the remaining 1 cup bread crumbs in another shallow bowl and season with the remaining 1 teaspoon Creole seasoning. Put the beaten egg in yet another shallow bowl, add the water, and beat lightly. Heat the vegetable oil in 2 large skillets over medium heat. Dredge each patty first in the flour, then in the egg mixture, then in the bread crumbs, turning to coat completely and shaking off any excess. Cook 4 patties at a time in each skillet, until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels. To serve, spread both sides of each toasted bun with some of the tartar sauce, place a patty on the bottom half of the bun, dress with lettuce and tomatoes, and top with the other bun half. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 14935,&quot;Gin-Grapefruit Sour 1 1/2 ounces gin 3/4 ounce grapefruit juice 1/2 ounce lemon juice 1/4 ounce simple syrup Ice Grapefruit seltzer Grapefruit wedge, for garnish Instructions: Stir the gin, grapefruit juice, lemon juice and simple syrup in a shaker with ice. Strain into an ice-filled glass; top with grapefruit seltzer. Garnish with a grapefruit wedge. &quot;,&quot;[Gin, Grapefruit Juice]&quot; 14936,&quot;Sweet Potato Gratin with Smoked Chiles 2 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 tablespoon chipotle puree 3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced thin Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine the heavy cream and chipotle puree in a small bowl. In an 8 by 8-inch baking dish, arrange a fourth of the sweet potatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and pour a fourth of the cream over it. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and cream, forming 4 layers. Bake for 1 hour or until the cream has been absorbed and the potatoes are browned. Remove from the oven and let sit 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 14937,&quot;Fruit Punch 8 ounces peach nectar 2 cups orange juice 2 cups cranberry juice Instructions: Combine drink ingredients in a large punch bowl or pitcher. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 14938,&quot;Strawberry Snowball Cookies 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup powdered sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Two 1-ounce packages freeze-dried strawberries 1 cup powdered sugar Instructions: For the cookies: Beat the butter and powdered sugar with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy. Beat in the vanilla. Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl, then add to the butter mixture and beat until combined. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Scoop the dough into 1-inch balls using a cookie scoop and place 2 inches apart on parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Bake the cookies until golden brown on the bottoms, 13 to 15 minutes. For the strawberry sugar dust: Meanwhile, pulse the strawberries in a food processor until it forms a powder. Add the powdered sugar and pulse until combined. Roll the warm cookies in the strawberry powdered sugar and transfer to wire racks to cool. Roll in the strawberry powdered sugar again, if necessary, after cooled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 14939,&quot;Ate 2 pounds sweet potatoes 3/4 cup cold water 2 pounds granulated sugar 4 pounds fresh pineapple 2 packets gelatin 2 ounces raisins 2 ounces rum or tequila Camembert cheese 2 ounces toasted almonds Instructions: Peel the sweet potatoes and cook in boiling water until soft. Drain, dry, and mash. Pour the cold water into a saucepan on moderate heat and stir in the sugar. Cook until sugar is dissolved and the liquid is clear, about 8 minutes. Cut the top and bottom of the pineapple, trim off the outer skin and slice flesh into 4 and remove the center core. Place flesh into a blender and puree at high speed. Sieve this mixture into a bowl. Dissolve the gelatin in water. Soak the raisins in rum. Chill the terrine or a square mold. In a bowl, mix the pineapple with the mashed sweet potatoes. Place the clear syrup in a large pan on high heat and add the pineapple and potato mixture. Reduce the heat to low and let cook down to a very thick custard texture. (Whenever you use fresh pineapple you must heat it to the boil in order to kill the Bromeline content. Bromeline is a great digestive, but it stops gelatin from setting.) Pour mixture into a chilled terrine or mold and place in the refrigerator to set. When firm and chilled, remove Ate from the refrigerator, unmold and slice. Serve with Camembert cheese surrounded with raisins soaked in rum, and toasted almonds. Can also be served spooned out of the mold like a jam. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 14940,&quot;Chicken Lettuce Wraps 6 large dried Chinese mushrooms Drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 large onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 pounds lean ground chicken 3 tablespoons mirin or white wine 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 tablespoon oyster sauce 1 tablespoon light soy sauce One 8-ounce can water chestnuts, chopped 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed 6 spring onions (scallions), chopped 2 to 3 tablespoons plum sauce 2 to 3 heads radicchio, leaves separated Instructions: Soak the Chinese mushrooms in hot water until soft, about 5 minutes. Then finely chop.<br> Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick pan and cook the onion for a few minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the ground chicken and cook for 4 to 6 minutes, mixing the meat with the other ingredients as it cooks, so it breaks up into little pieces. Add the mirin or wine followed by the sesame oil, sesame seeds, oyster sauce, soy sauce, water chestnuts and garlic. Cook for a few minutes and let the mixture caramelize. Add the spring onions and remove from the heat. Spread a bit of plum sauce on the inside of each radicchio leaf. Then top with a spoonful of the chicken mixture.

(For neat edges, use a 6-inch cake pan or a small plate on top of the loaf as a guide to cut around.) Cut the bread horizontally into 4 layers, using a sawing motion. Place the bottom bread layer on a serving plate or cake stand and cover with half of the mayonnaise. Layer on one container of the Black Forest ham. Place the second bread layer on top, cover with half of the mustard and top with the smoked turkey. Place the third bread layer on top, cover with the remaining mayonnaise and top with the remaining ham. Spread the cut side of the fourth bread layer with the remaining mustard and close the sandwich. Press down to adhere the layers together.<br> Frost the loaf with the cream cheese using an offset spatula. Press the scallions along the bottom edge of the loaf. Sprinkle the chives on the outer top edge of the loaf. Sprinkle the spring mix greens in the center of the cake. Arrange the cherry tomatoes cut-side down at regular intervals around the top of the cake. Serve immediately or chill until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14942,&quot;Spaghetti with Shrimp, Mussels and Baby Tomatoes 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 pound medium head-on, shell-on shrimp, deveined Kosher salt<br> 1 pound spaghetti 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 1 pint small tomatoes, such as pear, grape or currant, cut in half 1/2 pound PEI mussels, scrubbed<br> About 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley 10 leaves fresh basil, sliced<br> Instructions: In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the shrimp. Sear on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Set the shrimp aside on a plate (they will be cooked more later) and reserve the pan. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until just shy of al dente according to the package directions. Before draining, reserve about 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Meanwhile, add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil to the saute pan over medium heat. Add the crushed red pepper and garlic and cook until the garlic edges are just slightly brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and lightly smash them with the back of a spoon to release their juices. Cook, stirring often, until thickened slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the mussels, cover and cook until they open and release their juices, 4 to 5 minutes.<br> Raise the heat to medium high and add the shrimp back to the pan.

Wrap a brick in aluminum foil and place into the oven to heat. Place the game hen breast side down on a cutting board. Using scissors or poultry shears, cut from the neck to the tailbone to remove the backbone. Once you remove the backbone you will be able to see the inside of the bird. Make a small slit in the cartilage at the base of the breastbone to reveal the keel bone. Grab the bird with both hands on the ribs and open up like a book, facing down towards the cutting board. Remove the keel bone. Cut small slits in the skin of the bird behind the legs and tuck the drumsticks into them in order to hold them in place. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Fry the bacon in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once crisp, remove the bacon from the skillet and reserve. Drain all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan. Immediately add the two birds to the pan, skin side down. Add the onions to the pan around the edges. Top the birds with the brick and allow to remain on the heat for 5 minutes. Place the pan into the oven and cook 10 to 15 minutes or until the thigh meat reaches 170 degrees F.

Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil over high heat and salt it generously. Add the spaghetti and boil, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large Dutch oven or deep stove-top casserole dish over medium heat. Scatter the flour over the butter and mix with a wooden spoon into a paste. Continue stirring in a figure \8, making sure to get into the corners of the pan, until the paste puffs slightly and lightens in color, about 1 minute. Off the heat gradually whisk the milk into the paste. Return to medium-high heat and whisk until thickened, then simmer, stirring occasionally until the sauce has the consistency of heavy cream, about 8 to 10 minutes. Whisk in the cream cheese, Worcestershire sauce, and nutmeg. Season with salt, pepper. Reduce heat to low and whisk 1 cup Monterey Jack. Stir in the broccoli, peas, pepperoni and spaghetti, and heat until warmed through. Top casserole with the remaining 1 cup cheese; transfer to the broiler, and cook casserole until brown and bubbly.

For the compote: Toast the pine nuts in the olive oil in a skillet over high heat, swirling the pan, until the nuts are golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a dish with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the oil behind in the pan. Add the onion, fennel, garlic, lemon peel, 1 1?4 teaspoons salt, fennel seeds, saffron, and black pepper to taste and cook until the onion and fennel are slightly wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the raisins and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture browns and softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1?4 cup water, pine nuts, and parsley. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid reduces and compote thickens, about 1 minute more. Set aside. For the fish: Brush fish with oil and sprinkle with the cayenne and salt to taste. Lay the fish on the grill and leave it until you can see distinct grill marks and can lift the fish without its sticking, about 2 minutes. (Test by gently lifting a corner; if it sticks, cook a bit longer.) When it lifts cleanly, rotate about 45 degrees from the original position (don&#39;t turn it over). Cook about another 2 minutes, until grill marks appear. Flip the fish and repeat this process for marking the fish on the other side, another 3 to 4 minutes. Cut the tomato into thick slices, season with salt and black pepper to taste, and divide among 4 plates. Place the fish on top of the tomato slices, spoon some compote over, and finish with a wedge of lemon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 14969,&quot;Chardonnay Sabayon with Fresh Strawberries 6 egg yolks 1/2 cup sugar 2 teaspoons gelatin 1 cup Chardonnay 3/4 cup cream, whipped Instructions: Place egg yolks, sugar and gelatin in a double boiler over heat.

Line a baking sheet with foil, enough to fold over the ribs, approximately twice the size of the baking sheet. In a small mixing bowl, combine the sugar, paprika, salt, cl powder, cumin, garlic powder and cinnamon. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the rub and set aside. Place the ribs on the prepared baking sheet. Generously sprinkle the ribs on both sides with the spice mixture. Really rub it in! Place the ribs meat-side down and fold the foil tightly around the ribs to make a sealed packet. Bake the ribs until they become pliable but not falling apart, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. You know the ribs are done when the meat pulls away from the bone. Once the ribs are tender, carefully pour off 1/2 cup of the accumulated juices into a bowl and reserve. Keep the ribs wrapped in the foil to keep warm. For the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the tomato puree, molasses, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, reserved rub and the garlic. Add 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking juices and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Preheat a grill pan over high heat. Just before serving, slather the ribs with the tangy BBQ sauce and char them on the grill pan, basting them with the sauce and turning as they char up. (If you don&#39;t have a grill pan, you can slather them with sauce and stick them under the broiler to char.) Serve the ribs with extra BBQ sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 14972,&quot;Gingerbread Cookies 6 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon allspice<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1 1/2 cups packed dark brown sugar<br> 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened<br> 1 cup dark molasses<br> 2 eggs<br> 1 tablespoon maple extract<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg, and whisk together.

Wash and scrub the beets, trim the ends, and toss into a large piece of foil with a little oil, balsamic vinegar, and seasoning. Wrap and roast until tender. Cooking time depends on size. Mix the rosemary salt and pepper on a board. Roll and press the fillet of beef over this, making sure all sticks to the meat. In a very hot, ridged pan, or on a barbecue, sear the meat until brown and slightly crisp on all sides, around 5 minutes. Remove from the pan. Allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then slice it all up as thinly as you can. Lay the slices on a large plate. After preparing the beef, sprinkle the roasted beetroots randomly (whole, halved or quartered, depending on size) over the sliced meat. Now mix the horseradish and creme fraiche together. It has to be seasoned well, usually needing a little white wine vinegar or lemon juice. Dribble this over the beetroots. Dress some watercress with olive oil and lemon juice.

Whisk together the milk, water and egg in the bowl of a stand mixer until well combined. Add the dry ingredients. Fit the mixer with a dough hook and mix on low speed until a soft and sticky dough has formed, about 2 minutes. Add the shortening and mix on medium speed until the dough is smooth and starts to climb up the hook, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, gently shape into a ball and place seam-side down in the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours, depending on the temperature of the room.<br> For the raspberry syrup: Meanwhile, combine the raspberries, sugar, lemon juice and 3/4 cup water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a mesh strainer, pressing down on the berries with a rubber spatula to extract all the juice. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and simmer over medium heat until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature before using. When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Flour your hands and gently press the dough into a rectangle. Lightly flour the surface of the dough and a rolling pin, then roll the dough into an 8-by-10-inch rectangle.

Butter just the sides of a 9-inch round cake pan. For the caramel topping: Microwave the butter, brown sugar and lemon juice in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted. Spread the mixture over the bottom of the prepared pan. Arrange the carrot ribbons on top. For the cake: Spread the pecans out on a baking sheet, and bake until nicely toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool, then pulse in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl and whisk together with the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt and allspice; set aside. Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in the lemon zest. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as needed (it&#39;s okay if the batter looks slightly separated and broken). Reduce the mixer speed to low, and add 1/2 the flour mixture, then the sour cream, then the remaining flour. Pour the batter over the carrots in the cake pan, spread it into an even layer and give the pan a few taps on the counter. Bake the cake until it&#39;s golden brown and pulls away from the edge and a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the center, 45 to 50 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to separate it from the pan. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until just cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes. Invert a serving platter over the cake pan and, while holding them together, quickly flip them over so the cake unmolds, carrot-side up. Let cool completely.

Put the rhubarb into a saucepan with the 1/3 cup of sugar. Put a lid on the pan and simmer gently for about 10 minutes, until the rhubarb is soft. Put aside and leave to cool completely. Get yourself 6 ramekin dishes and rub their insides with the butter. Put the gingersnap cookies into a sandwich bag, tie a knot in the top and smash the cookies with a rolling pin or the bottom of a pan to make quite fine crumbs. Dust the insides of the buttered ramekins with the smashed cookies, then shake out any excess crumbs and keep them for later. (You can put the dishes into the refrigerator at this point until you&#39;re ready to put your souffles together.) Blob a tablespoon of the cooled stewed rhubarb into each ramekin dish. Mix the rest of the rhubarb with the custard, the egg yolk and the flour. In a large, clean bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until you have soft peaks. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and whisk on a high speed until the whites are very stiff - this should take about 3 minutes. Working gently, fold 2 spoonfuls of the stiff egg whites into the rhubarb mixture. Tip this into the bowl containing the remaining egg whites and fold together very carefully. Divide the mixture between the ramekins and level the tops. Wipe the rims of the dishes clean. Remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and place the ramekins on it. Put back into the preheated oven and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the souffles are a lovely golden color and have risen nicely. Serve immediately, sprinkled with your leftover gingersnap crumbs. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Use a 3-inch-round cookie cutter or glass to trace 12 circles on the parchment, leaving space between each. Flip the parchment over and lightly coat with cooking spray. Fit a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch round tip or snip a 1/2-inch hole in one corner of a large resealable plastic bag. Sift the flour, baking powder, nutmeg and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until well combined, about 2 minutes. Beat in the whole egg and yolk until incorporated and the mixture turns pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Beat in the milk and vanilla until smooth, scraping down the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low; gradually beat in the flour mixture until just incorporated (do not overmix). Transfer the batter to the prepared pastry bag. Using the circles as a guide, pipe the batter into 3-inch rings. (To make doughnut holes with the remaining batter, pipe 1-inch rounds onto the parchment.) Refrigerate while you heat the shortening, or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Heat about 6 cups shortening in a large pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 340 degrees F. (You want to have about 2 inches of liquid once the shortening melts.) Use scissors to cut the parchment around each doughnut, leaving a 1-inch border. Carefully invert 2 doughnuts into the shortening and peel off the parchment with tongs. Fry until golden brown, 1 minute 30 seconds per side. (Fry the doughnut holes 30 seconds per side.) Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Bring the shortening back to 340 degrees F and repeat with the remaining doughnuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15007,&quot;Sea Bream in Sea Salt with Salsa Verde 7 egg whites 1 (3-pound) box sea salt or coarse salt 2 (1 1/2-pound) sea breams or branzino (striped sea bass or other white fish) gutted but not scaled 1 handful fennel fronds (about 1/2 cup plucked from stalks of fennel bulb) 8 sprigs parsley 2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 2 cloves garlic, smashed 4 slices fresh lemon 1 fresh lemon 1/4 cup finely diced celery 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 tablespoon finely diced red onion 1 tablespoon finely chopped cornishon (French pickled gherkin) 1 tablespoon capers, drained 1 tablespoon chopped green olives, optional 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly whip the egg whites and fold into the salt, mixing well until combined. The texture should be grainy but cohesive; add a little water if necessary. Press a 1/4-inch thick layer of the salt mixture onto a large baking sheet or casserole which will accommodate the fish. Stuff the cavity of each whole fish with fennel fronds, parsley, thyme, rosemary, garlic, and 2 lemon slices. Lay fish on top of salt and pack the remaining salt over fish to enclose completely. Roast until internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F, about 20 minutes. (There will be some carry over cooking even after you remove fish from oven.) While fish is cooking, prepare the salsa verde. Cut peel from lemon and divide segments into 4 pieces. In a bowl, combine lemon segment with celery, parsley, onion, cornishon, capers, green olives, if using, and olive oil. Let fish rest for 5 minutes after removing from oven. Crack open salt crust, and lift and discard layers of salt.

Heat the cream, butter, hot sauce, cayenne and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat until the mixture begins to steam. Pour the cream mixture over the chocolate, and let sit until the chocolate is completely melted, about 10 minutes. Stir until smooth with a rubber spatula or a whisk. (If the chocolate isn&#39;t melted, microwave on high in 20-second increments, stirring in between, until just melted.) Stir in the vanilla. Continue stirring until the chocolate mixture is very smooth and shiny. Transfer it to a shallow dish, like a pie plate, cover and chill until firm, at least 3 hours and up to overnight. Put the sprinkles on a small plate. Scoop tablespoons of the firm ganache, roll into balls, roll in and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

With an immersion blender, blend in cubed butter one piece at a time until the sauce is smooth and emulsified. Season with salt and a dash of cayenne if you like it a little spicy, but not enough to scare your Mom-Mom. For the cabbage: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Slice off the bottom of the cabbage head and insert the knife around the core to make a square of insertions into the core of the cabbage. (Do not completely core the cabbage.) When the pot is boiling gently, drop the cabbage head in and boil it until outer leaves are softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the cabbage head and wait a minute for it to cool, then begin to gently peel the outer leaves away. When the leaves are no longer soft and they become hard to peel, place the cabbage head back into the boiling water for another 4 to 5 minutes. Repeat removing the leaves and then boiling the cabbage until you get down to the core or the leaves become too small. (It&#39;s a good idea to boil extra cabbage leaves so you have the extras just in case the leaves rip.) Saute onions with a dash of canola oil in a saute pan over medium-low heat until onions are translucent. Combine sauteed onions with cooked white rice and allow to cool. Combine ground beef, pork, veal, eggs, onion and rice mixture and salt and pepper in a large stainless steel bowl. Mix until well combined, then set aside. (We&#39;ll call this the filling from here out.) Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place 1/4 cup filling into the bottom of a cabbage leaf. Tuck the sides of the leaf in and roll the leaf up and over and make a small package. Place the finished roll seam-side down in a 12-by-10-inch baking pan that&#39;s at least 2 1/2 inches deep. Continue with the remaining leaves and filling and tuck them tightly into the baking pan. Pour 1 inch vegetable stock into the bottom of the baking pan. Cover the cabbage rolls with a sheet of parchment paper, then cover in foil. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove cabbage rolls from the oven and turn it down to 325 degrees F. Take off (but reserve) foil and parchment paper. Pour off the vegetable stock (no need to save it; it&#39;ll taste like cabbage water...yum). Top the drained cabbage leaves with just enough tomato sauce to coat the top of the cabbage and make a small pool under the rolls. Replace the parchment paper and foil and bake the cabbage rolls 45 minutes more. Serve the finished golabki by topping them with a ladle of the reserved sauce, a little fresh dill, and a dollop of sour cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 15021,&quot;Malta-Braised Short Ribs with Pickled Sweet Peppers and Yucca Mash 1 yellow onion, chopped 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 1 bunch cilantro, leaves and stems roughly chopped, plus more for garnish 8 garlic cloves, peeled 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more if needed 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 1/2 teaspoons sazon seasoning with culantro and achiote, such as Goya 8 English-cut beef short ribs (about 5 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 1 teaspoon dried oregano 2 dried bay leaves 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar One 12-ounce bottle malta Yucca Mash, recipe follows, for serving Pickled Sweet Peppers, recipe follows, for serving 1 pound frozen yucca, thawed Kosher salt 1/2 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons salted butter, cut into pieces 1/2 cup thinly sliced multi-colored small sweet peppers (use a mandoline) 2 cloves garlic, halved 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar 1 teaspoon honey Pinch of kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. To make the green paste, add the onion, green pepper, cilantro leaves and stems, garlic and olive oil to a blender and process until a paste forms. If necessary, add a little extra olive oil to help move the paste along. Set a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add the canola oil and sazon. While the oil heats up, dry the short ribs with a paper towel and cover them in a generous amount of salt and pepper. Working in batches, sear the short ribs on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the ribs to a plate. Add 1/2 cup of the chicken stock to the skillet, stir to deglaze and then set aside. Place a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the green paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in the chicken stock from the skillet, then add the oregano, bay leaves, tomato paste, vinegar, malta and remaining 1 cup chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and add the seared ribs to the Dutch oven. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven and cook until the ribs are very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. To serve, spoon the Yucca Mash into a shallow bowl, top with the ribs and spoon over the sauce. Garnish with Pickled Sweet Peppers and cilantro leaves.<br> Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add the yucca to the boiling water and enough salt so the water tastes like the sea. Cook until the yucca is fork-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and set aside. Add the cream and butter to a medium pan set over medium heat. As soon as it starts to simmer, add the yucca and mash with a fork or potato masher until just incorporated. Do not overmix as it will make the yucca gluey. Add salt to taste. Put the peppers and garlic in a 12- to 16-ounce mason jar. In a small pot, bring the vinegar, honey, salt and 1/4 cup water to a boil. Add the pickling liquid to the mason jar almost to the tippy top. Let it cool, then put on the lid.

To make the crust: Sift the flour, sugar, salt, and cinnamon into a medium-size mixing bowl. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until coarse crumbs form. Mixing with a fork, add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, just until the dough holds together. Press the dough into a ball and divide in 1/2. Flatten each piece into a disk, wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate for 1 hour. To make the filling: Put the raisins in a medium-size bowl and pierce them with a fork so they will soak up the rum. Pour rum over raisins and let stand at least 1 hour. Strain, return raisins to the bowl and stir in pie filling. Set aside. On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 piece of dough and fit it into a 9-inch pie plate. Pour in the filling and sprinkle the gelatin over the top. Roll out the remaining dough, fit it over the top of the pie, pinching the edges together to seal. Trim and crimp the edges. Pierce the top of the pie in a few places with a fork to make steam vents. Bake for 10 minutes and then reduce oven to 325 degrees F. and bake until crust is browned, about 45 minutes. Place on a rack to cool.

Using an immersion blender, mix to combine until no lumps are floating on the surface, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes. (You want all the air bubbles created during blending to escape before forming the spheres.) Meanwhile, in a blender, combine the passionfruit puree with the calcium lactate until fully incorporated. Place in a squeeze bottle. Set aside two small mixing bowls filled with water for rinsing the spheres. Take a small 1- to 2-ounce ladle and just barely fill the bottom of it with 1 teaspoon of the sodium alginate mixture to make it \nonstick. Squeeze about 1/2 ounce passionfruit mixture into the ladle and slowly submerge into the sodium alginate mixture. Once submerged, swirl the passionfruit \yolk\ in a circular motion to float it off of the ladle. Keep it in the solution for 3 minutes. (You can do multiple spheres at the same time, but make sure they don&#39;t touch each other while in the solution because they will stick together.) Carefully remove the spheres using a slotted spoon and place them in the mixing bowl filled with water to rinse the excess sodium alginate. Serve immediately, or store in mango juice for up to 2 days. For the salmon poke: Place the salmon in a large bowl. Cut the serrano in half and remove the seeds, stem and membrane.

Add the onion, carrot, garlic, turmeric, and cumin. Saute over high heat until the onions are glassy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, make a bouquet garni by tying together the celery, parsley, and thyme, and add to pan. Stir in the lentils and the chicken stock, season lightly with salt, pepper, and chili flakes, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Skim as necessary. Meanwhile, prepare the meatballs: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, soak bread crumbs in milk. In a mixing bowl, combine the lamb, almonds, soaked bread crumbs, onion, raisins, egg, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and chili pepper flakes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil on the platter you will place the meatballs on and rub oil into the palm of both hands. Form meat mixture into 40 golf ball-size meatballs, each approximately 1-inch in diameter. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet or saute pan. Arrange the meatballs in 1 layer in the pan, quickly sear meatballs over high heat, and then place in the oven. Cook until the meatballs are well browned and firm to the touch, turning to brown all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Prepare the garnish: In a small bowl, combine all ingredients. Refrigerate until serving time. Return to the soup: Remove the celery bouquet. With an immersion blender, lightly blend soup (you want it to still be a little chunky). Correct seasoning, to taste. Alternatively, transfer 2/3 of the soup to a blender*. Blend until smooth and return to the saucepan. Ladle soup into 8 or 10 soup bowls. Divide the meatballs evenly among the soup bowls and drizzle the yogurt mixture over. Serve immediately. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. Place the chicken bones in a 6-quart pot, pour water over to cover, and bring to a rolling boil. Skim off the scum that collects on the top. Add the remaining ingredients, lower the flame, and simmer about 2 hours, skimming as necessary. Strain into a clean bowl and cool. Refrigerate in a covered container for up to 3 days, discarding hardened layer of fat before using or freezing.

If you are short on time, you can cook the pork at temperatures up to 350 degrees F; however, slower and lower cooking results in more tender and juicy meat. To prepare the pork for cooking, set the pork on a baking sheet and score the skin into a criss-cross pattern. Be sure to only score the fat and not deep enough to cut into the meat. Scoring exposes more fat to the heat, which results in more fat being rendered during cooking. Bring the vinegar, sugar and 5 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; then add the baking soda and bring back up to a boil. Carefully pour the boiling liquid over the skin of the roast. Pat the skin dry and discard the liquid. Next, rub the grapeseed and olive oils all over the pork; then rub the pork with the rosemary and thyme. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the pork in a roasting pan and transfer to the oven. Cook, uncovered, until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F, about 1 1/2 hours. When done, remove the pork from the pan and transfer it to a rack set over a baking sheet. Cover with vented foil and let rest for at least 15 minutes (the internal temp will increase by at least 5 or 10 degrees). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 15072,&quot;Cherry Pistachio Fudge Pops 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 teaspoon pistachio flavoring or extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/8 teaspoon (4 drops) green food coloring 2 1/2 cups white chocolate chips<br> 1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening<br> 1/2 cup chopped pistachios 1/2 cup chopped dried cherries<br> Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth.

Grease two 9-inch round cake pans. (If silicon: place on a metal baking sheet. If metal: line with waxed paper.) As the oven preheats, begin to make the cake batter. Dissolve the cocoa into the espresso. Stir the buttermilk into the cocoa mixture and set aside to cool. Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer at medium speed for about 6 minutes, while gradually adding the sugar. (Use the paddle attachment for a stand mixer.) The butter mixture should be light and fluffy. Slowly add the eggs and vanilla to the butter, while continuing to beat. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go, so all the ingredients get incorporated. Fold the flour and cocoa mixtures into the butter mixture with a rubber spatula, alternating from flour to cocoa in the following order: 1/3 flour mixture; 1/2 cocoa mixture; 1/3 flour mixture; 1/2 cocoa mixture; 1/3 flour mixture. Do not overmix! Pour half of the finished batter into each of the cake pans and level the tops with the spatula. Bake for 40 minutes in the center of the oven, rotating halfway through. Check with a wooden toothpick for doneness. Cool for at least 15 minutes before inverting onto a baking rack to cool completely. Make the buttercream: With an electric mixer beat the peanut butter and butter in a large bowl until creamy. Add the powdered sugar and beat until spreadable. With a serrated knife halve the two layers making 4. Place 1 cake layer top down on the rack and spread 1/3 of the buttercream to the edges of the layer. Top the first cake layer with another and repeat with the buttercream. Continue layering with the remaining layers and buttercream, ending with cake. Refrigerate covered in plastic wrap for at least 3 hours and up to overnight. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and carefully transfer to a wire rack over a sheet pan. (Line the space under the rack with some old newspaper, for easy cleanup.) To make the ganache, chop the butter and scatter it into the chocolate pieces in a large bowl. Heat the cream and corn syrup in a saucepan over moderate heat. As soon as the cream mixture begins to boil, pour it over the chocolate mixture and begin stirring vigorously. When the chocolate has melted and is combined thoroughly with the cream, stir in the vanilla. Quickly begin pouring the ganache over the top of the cake, allowing it to flow down and cover the sides. (You may use a metal frosting spatula to smooth the top and sides.) Pack the chopped peanuts onto the ganache to cover the sides of the cake, leaving the chocolate on top exposed. Store in the refrigerator. Serving suggestions: I like to reserve a little of the buttercream and a handful of whole honey roasted peanuts to decorate the top of the cake. Try using a star tip to pipe points of buttercream in a circle, bordering the top of the cake. Then, set peanuts into the buttercream border to form an interesting design. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 15108,&quot;Broiled, Butterflied Chicken 1 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns 4 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 lemon, zested Extra virgin olive oil Onions, carrots and celery cut into 3 to 4-inch pieces 3 to 4-pound broiler/fryer chicken 1 cup red wine 8 ounces chicken stock 2 to 3 sprigs thyme Canola oil Instructions: Position the oven rack 8 inches from the flame/coil and turn broiler to high. Crack peppercorns with a mortar and pestle until coarsely ground. Add garlic and salt and work well. Add lemon zest and work just until you can smell lemon. Add just enough oil to form a paste. Check out your refrigerator for onions, carrots and celery that are a little past their prime. Cut vegetables into pieces and place in a deep roasting pan. Place chicken on a plastic cutting board breast-side down. Using kitchen shears, cut ribs down one side of back bone and then the other and remove. Open chicken like a book and remove the keel bone separating the breast halves by slicing through the thin membrane covering it, then by placing two fingers underneath the bone and levering it out. Turn chicken breast-side up and spread out like a butterfly by pressing down on the breast and pulling the legs towards you. Loosen the skin at the neck and the edges of the thighs. Evenly distribute the garlic mixture under the skin, saving 2 teaspoons for the jus. Drizzle the skin with oil and rub in, being sure to cover the bird evenly. Drizzle oil on bone side of chicken as well. Arrange bird in roasting pan, breast up, atop vegetables. Place pan in oven being sure to leave the oven door ajar. Check bird in 10 minutes. If the skin is a dark mahogany, hold the drumstick ends with paper towels and flip bone-side up. Cook 12 to 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. Juices must run clear. Remove and place chicken into a deep bowl and cover loosely with foil. Tilt pan so that any fat will pool at corner. Siphon this off with a bulb baster. (This fat is great in vinaigrettes). Set pan over 2 burners set on high. Deglaze pan with a few shots of red wine and scrape brown bits from bottom using a carrot chunk held with tongs. Add chicken stock, thyme, the remaining garlic paste and reduce briefly to make a jus. Strain out vegetables and discard. Slice chicken onto plates or serve in quarters. Sauce lightly with jus and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 15109,&quot;Olive Oil Oven Fries 2 large russet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds) 2 tablespoons olive oil 8 medium garlic cloves, smashed 2 teaspoons kosher salt Instructions: Heat oven to 475 degrees F and arrange rack in top. Peel potatoes and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide planks. Cut planks lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide strips then cut strips in half crosswise. Cover potatoes in hot tap water and let soak for 10 minutes before proceeding. Meanwhile, combine oil and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. As soon as the mixture is aromatic and the garlic makes a sizzling noise, remove it from the heat and set aside to cool. When potatoes are done soaking, drain, and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Place potatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle with garlic oil, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the salt, and turn to coat well. Spread fries out evenly across baking sheet and roast until fries are just beginning to color, about 25 minutes. Using a spatula, scrape sheet to turn fries and continue to roast until crisp on outside, potatoes give way when pierced with a knife, and are golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Remove fries from oven, season with remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 15110,&quot;Zucchini-Oat Meatloaf 1 1/2 pounds ground meatloaf mix (equal parts ground beef, pork and veal or turkey) 1 cup rolled oats 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 clove garlic, minced 1 medium onion, grated 1 medium zucchini, shredded and squeezed dry 1/2 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons light brown sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Prepare oven-dried tomatoes: Skin the tomatoes by placing them in boiling water for 30 seconds and then plunging them right away in ice water. This will help you remove the skin without cooking the tomatoes. Using a paring knife, peel the skin off the tomatoes and then cut them in 1/2 lengthwise. Place the tomatoes in a bowl, sprinkle with alt and add the thyme and 2 ounces of olive oil. Arrange the tomatoes with the thyme sprigs on a non-reactive baking pan. Leave enough space around the tomato halves so they don&#39;t touch, allowing air to circulate and dry them out. Put them in a 300 degree F oven to dry for 2 hours. Prepare the garlic: Place the garlic cloves in a small pot and cover with 2 cups of olive oil. Simmer very slowly for 40 minutes, until the garlic is soft. Remove them from the oil and set aside at room temperature. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare the eggplant: Slice the eggplant into 1-inch rounds. Put them in a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt. Drizzle olive oil over them and toss. Arrange the rounds on a baking pan, leaving enough space between each slice so that they cook evenly. Bake until they are soft and slightly brown, about 30 minutes. Prepare the pasta: In a large pot, bring to a boil 4 quarts of salted water. Add the rigatoni and cook until \al dente\ or even slightly undercooked, about 6 to 8 minutes. Since the pasta will be cooked in the oven, it&#39;s important not to overcook the pasta in the boiling water. Drain the pasta in a colander and toss with a little olive oil to prevent them from sticking. Set aside. Assemble and bake dish: Raise oven temperature to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the pasta, eggplant, tomato, garlic, scallion and basil and mix well. Add the ricotta and toss gently so that the ingredients are distributed among the pasta but that the ricotta is not completely mixed through. The idea here is to have distinct and differing flavors, so it is important that the ricotta be spread in roughly tablespoon size pieces. Season, if necessary, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to a large greased earthenware or glass baking dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan and bake in the oven until the pasta is brown and crisp on top, about 10 to 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Dolcetto, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 15142,&quot;Hushpuppies 2 eggs, slightly beaten 1 medium onion, chopped fine 3/4 cup milk 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 2 cups plain yellow cornmeal 1/4 cup all purpose flour Vegetable oil, for deep frying Instructions: Combine eggs, onion, and milk together in a mixing bowl.

For the fish: Combine the olive oil, Key lime juice and garlic in a large, shallow glass baking dish, stirring with a whisk. Add the fish to the juice mixture and turn to coat. Cover and let stand 15 minutes. Coat the grates of a grill with nonstick grill spray and prepare the grill for medium-high heat. Remove the fish from the marinade and discard the marinade. Sprinkle the fish evenly with the salt and black pepper. Grill to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side. Serve the fish with the salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15177,&quot;Grilled Mahi-Mahi with Black Bean Salsa 1/2 cup soy sauce 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon honey 2 tablespoons lime juice (from about 1 lime) 1 garlic clove, finely minced 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh basil leaves 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh oregano leaves Freshly ground black pepper 4 (7 to 8-ounce) mahi-mahi steaks, about 1-inch thick Canola or vegetable oil, for greasing the grill grates 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved 2 scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced 1 (14-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 jalapeno, finely chopped (seeded and ribbed for less heat) 2 tablespoons lime juice (from about 1 lime) Salt Instructions: Place the soy sauce, orange juice, ketchup, honey, lime juice, garlic, basil, oregano, and pepper in a small bowl and whisk until the honey is completely dissolved. Pour the marinade into a re-sealable plastic bag with the fish fillets and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes. Toss the tomatoes, scallions, black beans, cilantro, jalapeno, and the lime juice in a medium bowl. Add some salt to taste and set aside to let the flavors develop. Oil your grill grates with canola oil to help prevent sticking. If using a gas grill, preheat the grill to high. Grill the fish for 5 to 6 minutes on a side, turning carefully using a turner large enough to support the entire piece of fish, until browned, firm and flaky. Serve with the black bean salsa and lime wedges. Indoor Variation: To cook on a grill pan on the stovetop, heat the grill pan over high heat. Remove the fish from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Brush both sides of the fish with oil and place on the hot grill pan. Oiling the fish instead of the pan will limit the amount of smoke. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes on each side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 15178,&quot;Soy Molasses Salmon 1/3 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup molasses<br> 1 tablespoon sesame or olive oil 2 teaspoons minced garlic<br> 1 teaspoon ginger powder<br> 1 teaspoon fish sauce<br> 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon honey<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> Four 6-ounce skin-on salmon fillets<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Black and white sesame seeds, for serving<br> Instructions: Combine the soy sauce, molasses, sesame oil, garlic, ginger powder, fish sauce, rice wine vinegar and honey in a saucepan on medium-high heat.

F. Butter a metal 8-inch square cake pan. Line the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper; lightly butter the parchment. Combine the cocoa and espresso powders in a medium bowl. Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the milk is steaming and the butter melts. Whisk into the cocoa mixture; let cool to room temperature. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with a mixer on medium-high speed until very pale, thick and pillowy, 5 to 8 minutes. Beat 30 to 45 more seconds to stabilize the egg foam. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the cocoa mixture in 2 additions, alternating with the flour mixture in 2 additions. Beat just until the batter is smooth and no dry flour remains. Pour the batter into the cake pan and gently tap against the counter to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out the cake onto a rack. Peel off the parchment but let it rest gently on top of the cake while it cools completely. Wipe the cake pan clean and reserve. Make the ganache: Combine 1/2 cup heavy cream, 4 ounces chocolate and 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan. Gently cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until melted and smooth. Let cool. Make the mousse: Combine the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and 4 ounces chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until melted and smooth. Whisk in the cocoa powder until smooth. Let cool. Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup heavy cream and the gelatin powder in a small microwave- safe bowl. Let stand until the gelatin absorbs the liquid, about 5 minutes, then microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds, whisking. Let cool, stirring occasionally. Combine the remaining 1 1/4 cups heavy cream, the sugar and espresso powder in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium speed to dissolve the sugar, about 1 minute. Stream in the cooled gelatin mixture, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until the mixture is thick and stiff peaks form. Fold in the cooled chocolate mixture in 2 or 3 batches until the mousse is well blended. Assemble the cake: Line the reserved cake pan with 2 crisscrossed strips of parchment paper (this will help you lift out the finished cake). Carefully slice the cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Lay the best layer cut-side up in the bottom of the pan and brush with some of the chocolate liqueur, if using. (Use a plate or small cutting board to move the layers; if your top cake layer is domed, use it for the middle of the cake.) Evenly spread half of the mousse on top with an offset spatula, all the way to the edges. Top with a second cake layer. Brush again with chocolate liqueur, then spread half of the ganache evenly on top. Add the final cake layer, cut-side up, and brush with the remaining liqueur. Top with the remaining mousse and ganache. (The assembled cake should fill the pan.) Refrigerate the cake until the top is set, about 30 minutes, then wrap the whole cake pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight to set completely.<br> Lift the cake out of the pan using the parchment pieces and transfer to a cutting board.

Add clams, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Uncover, quickly stir clams well with a wooden spoon, and recover. Allow clams to cook 5 to 10 minutes longer (this will depend on the type and size of clams you are using), or until most of the clams are opened. Transfer clams to a large bowl or baking dish and strain broth through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. (You should have about 6 cups of clam broth. If not, add enough water to bring the volume up to 6 cups.) When clams are cool enough to handle, remove them from their shells and chop into 1/2-inch pieces. Set clams and broth aside. In a large heavy pot add bacon and render until golden and crispy. Pour off all fat except 4 tablespoons. Add onions, celery, bell pepper and carrots and cook for 10 minutes, until vegetables are softened. Do not allow to color. Add garlic, bay leaves, oregano, thyme and crushed red pepper and cook an additional 2 minutes. Increase heat to high and add potatoes, reserved clam broth, and chicken stock and bring to a boil, covered. Cook for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender and the broth has thickened somewhat. Add tomatoes and continue to cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and add reserved clams and parsley and season with pepper and salt, if necessary. Allow chowder to sit for up to 1 hour to allow flavors to meld, then reheat slowly over low fire if necessary.

Line two 2 dozen mini-cupcake pans with cupcake metallic or paper liners and spray with oil spray. For the crust: In a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add the cherries, sugar, cookies and butter. Then pulse until it&#39;s a paste that sticks when pinched with your fingers. Press 1 tablespoon of the crust into the prepared pans. For the cupcakes: Sift the granulated sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt into the bowl of an upright mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil blend, extracts and eggs with a whisk until fully combined. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry until fully combined. With the mixer still on low, slowly add the espresso and stir just to incorporate, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula. Using small ice cream scoop, fill the prepared pans three-quarters of the way full with batter. Drop 1 cherry drained of its juice into the center of each cupcake. Bake and cool the cupcakes completely; the metallic liners bake for 11 minutes and the paper liners bake for 9 minutes. For the frosting: To melt the chocolate, place it in a double boiler over simmering water on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally until completely smooth and no pieces of chocolate remain. Remove from the heat and let cool until lukewarm, 5 to 15 minutes. In a large bowl, beat the butter until creamy with an electric hand mixer on medium speed, about 3 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla and confectioners&#39; sugar, and beat until smooth. Add the melted cooled chocolate and beat until creamy and of a desired consistency. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip and reserve for assembly. For the chocolate pieces: Melt the chocolate in a double boiler as above. Line mold(s) on a sheet tray. Using a spoon, fill the mold(s) to the brim with chocolate. Place in the freezer and leave for 3 minutes. When you take them out, turn your mold gently over a sheet tray. The chocolates should come out without too much trouble, but if you find them getting stuck, tap the mold firmly against the counter or flex the mold a little, and that should free them. Transfer edible ink that reads \priceless\ by pressing the words lightly on the chocolate to adhere. Finish by painting a thin layer of gold dust on the edges of the priceless tag. To assemble: Generously frost the top of each cupcake with the chocolate sour cream frosting. Adorn with priceless tags and sprinkle with chocolate metallic pearls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 15236,&quot;Pasta with Greens and Roasted Garlic 12 ounces dry orecchiette 1 1/2 pounds (2 bunches) broccoli rabe 4 to 6 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/2 cup chicken broth 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 2 cups cooked drained cannellini beans Salt Slab of Fresh Parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Press the bananas into the sugar Cake: Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt into a large bowl; then whisk to combine evenly. In another bowl, slowly beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until just blended. Raise the speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, about 10 minutes. Beat in the egg and then the yolk, allowing each to be fully incorporated before adding the next. While mixing slowly, add the flour mixture to the butter in 3 parts, alternating with the milk in 2 parts, beginning and ending with the flour. Mix briefly at medium speed to make a smooth batter. Pour the batter over the bananas and smooth with a spatula to even it out. Lay a doubled length of paper towel from end to end over the top of the slow cooker, to line the lid and create a tighter seal. (See note.) Cover the cake tightly with the lid and continue to cook on HIGH, until the cake begins to brown slightly on the sides and springs back when touched in the middle, about 3 1/2 hours. Turn off the slow cooker and let the cake set, about 20 minutes more. Using the foil, lift the cake from the slow cooker; set on the counter to cool, about 30 minutes more. Fold back the foil, and carefully invert cake onto a platter so you can see the caramelized bananas.

Line part of the direct-heat side with foil. Combine the granulated garlic, mustard and 3 teaspoons salt in a small bowl, and rub all over the tenderloin. Generously oil the uncovered grill grates, and grill the tenderloin over direct heat (not on the foil), turning occasionally, until well marked, about 12 minutes. Move the tenderloin to the indirect heat, cover with the lid and cook, turning occasionally, until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 145 degrees F, about 14 minutes more. Transfer to a cutting board, let rest a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch chunks. Meanwhile, toss the broccoli and tomatoes with the oil, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Grill on the foil, turning occasionally, until the tomatoes are charred and starting to burst, 6 to 10 minutes, and the broccoli is charred and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half. Bring the half-and-half and macaroni to a boil in a large pot over medium heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until the macaroni is tender and the half-and-half has thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, and stir in the Cheddar, butter and 1 tablespoon salt. Stir until smooth, thick and creamy. Add the grilled pork and vegetables, stirring to incorporate. The mixture will thicken as it sits; adjust the consistency as needed with hot water before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 15247,&quot;Roasted Leg of Lamb with Red Onions and Sour Cherries 1 (6-pound) leg of lamb, fat trimmed, boned out, rolled and tied by your butcher 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed 1/2 cup freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed 1 cup chopped fresh basil leaves Kosher salt 4 medium red onions 1/2 cup red wine 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 cup beef stock 1 cup dried sour cherries, reconstituted in hot water; then drained 1 tablespoon butter Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub the lamb leg all over with olive oil, and then the pepper and basil. Let the lamb sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes. Season the lamb all over with salt, set fat-side up on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and roast for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F. and continue to cook for about 1 hour.

(You can ask a butcher to do this, reserving the carcass for stock making and skin for rendering.) Cut breasts in half, then into about 3 pieces across the width. Chop legs and thighs into about 4 pieces each. (Remember: You want to start with generous pieces of meat, since they will shrink when cooked. Don&#39;t worry about cleaning the tendons, since they will soften with long cooking.) Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper. Heat rendered fat in a large, heavy bottomed Dutch oven over high heat. Brown duck on all sides, then transfer meat to a platter. Reduce heat to medium low and cook shallots until well browned, about 15 minutes. Add garlic and ginger, increase heat to medium high and cook about a minute, then add curry paste. Cook, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes.

In a second shallow casserole dish, combine the flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Place the chicken cutlets into the flour mixture, coating evenly on each side and shaking off the excess. Then place the chicken into the egg wash, coating the pieces on both sides. Dredge the chicken a second time in flour and egg. (If you like, you can dredge a third time; the breading will be thicker with every coating.) Heat the shortening in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Fry the breaded chicken until golden brown, about 2 minutes; flip and continue cooking until golden brown and cooked through, another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. For the gravy: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth. Cook until the mixture begins to turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in the milk and cook until thick and smooth, another 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. For the hot sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the melted butter, cayenne, paprika, brown sugar, salt, pepper and garlic powder. To serve: Brush the chicken with the warm hot sauce. Place chicken pieces onto the bottom halves of the biscuits and top with white gravy and pickle slices. Cover with the biscuit tops and serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and 3 tablespoons of the sugar. In a small bowl, combine the warm water with the yeast and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar; stir until the yeast is dissolved. Let stand until bubbles appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Using your hands, mix the 1 cup cold butter into the flour, breaking the butter into small pebbles, until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Make a well in the center and add the buttermilk and the yeast mixture. Gently fold the flour into the wet ingredients. Keep mixing until a ball starts to form, then gently knead, 12 to 15 times, to create a smooth dough. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for approximately 1 hour. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and press out to 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick. Fold the dough in half, press again to 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick, and then fold again. Cut the dough using a 2- to 3-inch round biscuit cutter, depending personal preference. Brush the bottom of a cast-iron skillet with some of the melted butter. Place the biscuits in the skillet; brush the tops with melted butter. Bake until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes, depending on size. Brush again with melted butter and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 15253,&quot;Toby&#39;s Mussel Chowder 1 cup white wine 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 tablespoon dried basil, plus 1 tablespoon 2 to 3 pounds mussels, scrubbed and debearded 1/4 pound bacon, chopped 2 cups chopped onions 2 cups chopped celery 4 cups (1/2-inch dice) potatoes 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 2 cups clam juice or fish stock 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon pepper 1 to 2 cups milk (depends on how thick you want chowder) Instructions: Place wine, butter, garlic, and 1 tablespoon basil in a stockpot and brings to a simmer. Add mussels and steam, covered, over high heat, for 8 to 12 minutes. Check to see when shells begin to open, be careful not to overcook. When mussels open, remove them from the heat, and drain, reserving liquid. Set mussels aside to cool, discarding any unopened mussels. When cool, remove meat from shells, chop coarsely, and refrigerate until needed. In a stockpot, over medium-high heat, saute bacon until fat is rendered and bacon begins to brown. Add onions, celery and cook until onions turn translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add potatoes and thyme and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add stock or clam juice, reserved mussel liquid, remaining 1 tablespoon basil, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, or until potatoes are soft and begin to thicken chowder. Add milk, chopped mussels and bring back to simmer.

Add the salt and pepper, lime juice, and reserved shrimp shells and stir. Add the water, bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the stock through a strainer into a bowl or another pot. Discard the vegetables and shells and reheat the stock. Add the shrimp and simmer until just cooked, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, strain and refrigerate the stock, and the shrimp separately until chilled, about 1 hour. In a bowl, combine chilled shrimp, pico de gallo, shrimp stock, cocktail sauce and avocado; mix gently. For each serving, place a lettuce leaf in a pretty bowl or a martini glass. Spoon in the shrimp mixture, allowing about 9 or 10 shrimp per serving.

Chops will be about 10 inches wide each. Season chops with salt and pepper. Set up an assembly line: a dish of flour, a shallow dish with beaten egg, a plate with bread crumbs combined with cheese and nutmeg. Add a thin layer of oil to a very large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add the first 2 pieces of veal. Cook 3 minutes on each side until evenly golden. Transfer to a serving platter and repeat with remaining veal. This dish is fine served at room temperature. Do not put cooked veal in a warm oven or you will dry it out. Also, do not cover the platter with foil it will trap steam and make the cutlets soggy. The reason this dish is perfect for small dinner parties is because it is very tasty eaten at room temperature and because the sauce is raw and cold. You never have to rush your guests to their seats. Combine tomatoes, onions, and basil and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Season the raw sauce with coarse salt, to taste. Transfer to a small bowl and set on platter with veal. Garnish platter with lemon wedges. Top veal with a little squeeze of lemon juice and raw sauce and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]</p><p>&quot; 15256,&quot;Egusi Stew 4 cloves garlic 2 small red bell peppers, chopped 2 plum tomatoes, chopped 1 small onion, chopped 1 habanero pepper, optional 1/2 cup dried herring (also called bonga fish or bony fish) 1/2 cup red palm oil (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons ground dried crayfish or ground dried shrimp 1 teaspoon iru (locust beans), rinsed 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder, such as Knorr\u2019s Kosher salt 1 cup ground egusi 1 cup chicken broth or water 1 pound cooked meat or fish, such as stewing hen, cut into pieces (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 cup finely chopped collard greens 1/2 cup dried uziza leaves, rinsed (see Cook&#39;s Note) Pounded yam, fufu or steamed white rice and sweet plantains, for serving Instructions: Process the garlic, bell peppers, tomatoes, onion and habanero, if using, in a blender or food processor for 30 seconds. Split the dried fish into quarters, remove or peel out the bones (using tweezers if necessary) and discard. Break into bite-size pieces. Set aside. Heat the palm oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the bell pepper mixture and stir to combine. Cover and let simmer until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the reserved dried fish, ground crayfish, iru, bouillon powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir to combine. Cover and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced slightly, about 10 minutes. Mix the egusi with 1/3 cup water in a small bowl. Stir to combine until a thick white paste forms. Add the chicken broth to the stew and stir. Use a tablespoon to scoop the egusi paste and place dollops of it over the stew. Do not stir. Cover and let the egusi cook until it forms clumps, about 10 minutes. Stir the clumps of egusi and mix them thoroughly into the stew; the stew will have a lumpy white appearance. Add the meat to the stew and stir to combine. Allow the stew to simmer until the liquid reduces slightly and the stew starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Stir in the collard greens and uziza leaves; cover partially with the lid. Simmer over medium-low heat until the collard greens and uziza leaves are tender, about 15 minutes.

Guide the dough with your hand as it emerges from the rollers to prevent it from puncturing or stretching. Dust the sheets with extra flour whenever the dough gets sticky. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again 2 or 3 times. Continue reducing the setting and rolling until the machine is at its narrowest setting; the dough should be about 1/8-inch thick. Roll out the other half. Cut the pasta sheets into 3-foot long lengths. Assemble the lasagne: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay a 6-inch section of each long pasta sheet in a row on a sheet pan, letting the remaining pasta sheet hang over the edge of the pan. Spread 2 heaping tablespoons of garden puree on top and scatter over some of the reserved vegetables; break apart 1 or 2 potatoes by hand and place them over the vegetables along with some basil leaves. Fold the pasta sheet over to cover the filling letting the remaining length hang over the other side of the pan. Continue to layer on more puree, vegetables and pasta until you have 4 layers. Top with puree, vegetables, and basil leaves, then grate on some Parmesan and drizzle over some olive oil. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes and serve immediately. To make the pasta dough: In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix. Pour in 1 tablespoon olive oil and continue to mix until a smooth dough is formed. If the dough is too dry drizzle in a bit of water, if it is too wet sprinkle in some more flour. Dust some flour on a work surface, knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. To make the dough by hand: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface, shape into a mound, and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall and mix it with the beaten eggs. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a smooth dough. Dust some flour on the work surface; knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again 2 or 3 times. Continue reducing the setting and rolling until the machine is at its narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick for ravioli.

Heat the butter and olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken breast pieces and pan-fry them on both sides until they&#39;re done. Get as much golden brown color on the chicken as you can. When done, remove the chicken from the skillet and pour off any excess fat or oil (but don&#39;t clean the pan). Return the chicken to the skillet and pour over the hot sauce. Turn the chicken to coat it on both sides and let it sit in the sauce while you prepare the other ingredients. (The heat should not be on under the skillet.) Toss the salad greens in a large bowl with just enough Fast Blue Cheese Dressing to lightly coat (thin the dressing with a little milk if it&#39;s too gloopy). Heap some tossed salad into two individual bowls. Sprinkle blue cheese crumbles over the top. Slice the chicken into thin slices (on the bias) and arrange them over the top of each salad. (Dip the slices back into the sauce if necessary to really coat them.) Top the whole thing with more blue cheese crumbles, and serve with celery hearts.

Stir to combine. Pour in 4 cups warm water from the tap and stir until the brown sugar dissolves. Put chicken in a 1-gallon resealable freezer bag and pour in the brine. The chicken should be completely submerged. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. Pour off the brine and place the chicken on a cooling rack. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper before dredging. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the breading: You will need three medium bowls for the breading. In one bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. In a second bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg and mustard. In a third bowl, combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and 3/4 teaspoon baking powder, along with the cornmeal, garlic powder, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper. Follow a basic three step breading process: Dip each chicken breast in the flour (dusting off any excess), then in the buttermilk mixture, and finally in the cornmeal mixture. Dust off any excess before laying each chicken breast on a cooling rack. Allow the chicken to sit out uncovered for 30 minutes. This will make for a crunchier crust. Set a cooling rack in a rimmed baking sheet. In a 14-inch cast-iron skillet, combine the canola and coconut oils and heat over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 345 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, place the chicken in the skillet bone-side up. The oil should only come halfway up the side of the chicken. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, 5 to 7 minutes more. If needed, cook on the thicker side of the chicken breast for another minute to crisp the crust. Transfer to the rack as done. Wipe up any oil drips from the baking sheet so they don&#39;t smoke up your kitchen. Transfer the chicken on the rack and baking sheet to the oven and bake until cooked through and the center registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 10 to 20 minutes.

Return the chicken breasts to the pan and adjust the heat so that the cream gently simmers. Cover and cook until the chicken is firm and just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. To check for doneness, cut into the thickest part of a breast with a paring knife ? there should be no sign of pink or translucence.</li><li>Finishing. Transfer the chicken breasts to a warmed serving platter or individual dinner plates. The sauce should be thick enough to lightly coat a spoon. If it is too thin, continue to simmer it for about 1 minute and it will thicken. Stir in the remaining tarragon and the lemon juice, then taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve right away with buttered egg noodles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15305,&quot;Homemade Raspberry Marshmallows 1/2 cup freeze-dried raspberry powder 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> Cooking spray 3/4 cup water, divided<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br> Two .25-ounce packets unflavored gelatin powder<br> 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup light corn syrup<br> 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the raspberry powder, confectioners&#39; sugar and cornstarch. Coat an 8-inch square or 9-inch square baking dish with cooking spray and dust the bottom and sides with half of the confectioners&#39; sugar mixture. Pour any excess mixture back into the bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine 1/2 cup water, the vanilla extract and almond extract. Sprinkle the gelatin over the liquid. In a small saucepan, stir together the granulated sugar, corn syrup, salt and the remaining 1/4 cup of water. Clip on a candy thermometer. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat until it reaches 240 degrees F and then immediately remove from the heat and transfer to the mixer. Turn the mixer on low and drizzle the sugar mixture in a slow and steady stream down the side of the bowl. Once the entire mixture is in, gradually increase the speed to high and mix until lukewarm and fluffy, 7 to 10 minutes. While the mixer is running, grease a rubber spatula and have that standing by the mixer, as well as the prepared pan. Using your greased spatula, immediately scrape the mixture into your pan and spread it out evenly as best you can with the spatula. Dust the top with about half of the remaining confectioners&#39; sugar mixture and then, if needed, you can use your hands to further flatten and even out the mixture. Let sit for 1 hour. Cut into squares and then dust the edges of the squares with the remaining confectioners&#39; sugar mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 15306,&quot;Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes with Bacon and Chives 2 pounds Idaho or Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups sour cream 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1/2 cup finely chopped cooked bacon 1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh chives Instructions: Put the potatoes in a medium pot, cover with cold water and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Make the rum syrup. In a small saucepan heat the water, rum, coconut extract and sugar until the sugar dissolves completely. Simmer for 5 minutes then remove from heat. Sift together dry ingredients: cake flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. Line and grease two 9-inch cake pans with butter then dust lightly with flour. In a bench-top mixer (with the paddle attachment), cream butter and sugar until pale in color and light and fluffy - about 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula then with the mixer on low add eggs 1 at a time. Mix for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the milk, coconut and vanilla extract and mix on low until combined. Gradually add the flour mixture, scraping down the sides, if necessary. Once flour is fully incorporated stop the mixer. Divide batter evenly amongst the 2 cake pans and bake in the center of the oven for 40 to 50 minutes until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. When done, transfer cakes to wire racks and allow to cool completely. Remove paper lining then carefully cut each cake in half horizontally using a bread knife. Remove the domed top off 1 of the halves so you have 3 flat disks and 1 domed disk (this will be the top layer). Assemble the cake directly on your platter by layering 1 of the disks on the plate as a base. Using a pastry brush, wet the layer evenly with the rum syrup then spread with a 1/2-inch of coconut cream. Repeat this process of wetting and spreading until you reach the 4th top layer which will be the domed disk. Place on top and lightly wet the entire cake with remaining rum mixture. Cover the rest of the cake with the frosting and sprinkle all over with coconut flakes. Set in the refrigerator for 1 hour before serving. In a stand mixer fitted with whip attachment, whip the butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugar, 1 cup at a time, until fully incorporated. Add the coconut and vanilla extracts and pinch salt and blend just until incorporated.

Meanwhile, add the ghee to a small saute pan over medium heat and allow to melt. Add the almonds, cashews and pistachios and stir to coat in the ghee. Allow to toast, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add the paneer, toasted nuts, condensed milk and granulated sugar to the pot with the milk mixture and stir to combine. Pour the mixture onto sheet trays to cool quickly, then refrigerate to cool completely. For the assembly: Remove the cake from the pan and split into two layers horizontally. Put 1 cake layer back into the springform pan to help with filling the cake. Put 1 cup of the whipped cream into a pastry bag and line the rim of the cake with whipped cream. Fill the middle of the cake with the halwa. Top with the remaining cake layer, then frost the entire cake with the remaining whipped cream.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray an 11- by 8-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the baking sheet allowing the excess to fall over the sides. Spray the parchment paper with the cooking spray. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Beat in the eggs, one at a time until smooth. Add the mascarpone cheese, orange juice and zest. Mix until well combined. Gradually add the flour mixture until combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking sheet, spreading the batter to the edges. Bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Using the excess parchment to lift, carefully remove the cake from the baking sheet and cool completely on a wire rack for about 30 minutes. For the frosting: While the cake is cooling, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, vanilla extract and butter in a medium bowl. Using an electric hand mixer, combine the ingredients until smooth, adding more milk if needed (the frosting should be stiff). Gradually add the orange food coloring until desired color. Cut the cooled cake in half. Using a serrated knife, trim the top layer of cake halves to make a flat surface. Spread the frosting over one half of the cake. Top with the other cake half. Refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour until the frosting has set. For the chocolate: Combine the chocolate and safflower oil in a small bowl and place over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Cut the cake into 1 1/4-inch squares. Insert a popsicle stick into the end of each cake square. Dip the cake squares into the melted chocolate, shaking off any excess chocolate. Decorate with sprinkles and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the rest of the cake squares. Refrigerate the pops until the chocolate has set, 1 to 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 15372,&quot;Stuffed Turkey Burgers 1 1/4 pounds lean ground turkey breast 1/2 cup chopped roasted red peppers 1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese 1/4 teaspoons salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Divide turkey into 4 equal sized rounds.

Measure 2 cups of flour into a bowl, add the salt and grated cheese and mix lightly with a fork. Pour the milk into a measuring cup to come up to 1-cup mark and then crack in the egg and add the oil. Beat to combine, then pour into the dry ingredients, forking to mix as you go. You may, at the end, feel the dough&#39;s either too dry or too damp: add either more milk or more flour and fork together again until you&#39;ve got a soft dough that&#39;s not too sticky to be rolled out. Break the dough into 2 pieces and roll 1 piece on a lightly floured surface. Scone dough is a dream to work with; in fact, I find it deeply pleasurable. Just roll as clumsily and heavy handedly as you like: no harm will come to it. You want a thin, but not exaggeratedly so, rectangle. A square wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world either, so don&#39;t start getting out the geometry set: this is the roughest of instructions. Cut the dough into approximately 1 3/4-inch strips, and then cut each strip at approximately 2 1/2-inch intervals so that you end up with a collection of small, raggedy oblongs (I just cut each strip as I go, but it&#39;s probably more efficient to do the whole batch of dough at 1 time). Take a cocktail sausage and put it at 1 end of an oblong at a slight diagonal and then roll up, pressing on the infinitely compliant dough to squeeze it shut, and then place on a nonstick baking sheet, or 1 lined with parchment. Carry on until you&#39;ve finished all your strips and then get to work with the remaining dough. Three baking sheets should do it. Now, dip a pastry brush into the beaten egg mixture and paint on the pastry for a golden glaze. Put in the oven and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, by which time they should be puffy and burnished.

Saute the onions slowly, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes. They should be very soft, slightly golden, but not brown. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a 10inch round baking dish or pie plate. Arrange a circular layer of overlapping potatoes in the pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange a thin layer of onions on top and sprinkle with some of the rosemary. Continue layering until you have used up all the ingredients, finishing with the rosemary. Pour the cream mixture into the dish around the edges so that you don=t disturb the rosemary, drizzling just a little over the top. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for 10 minutes more, until the top is golden and the potatoes are tender. Let cool for 5 minutes then slice into loose wedges and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 15391,&quot;No-Peek Tomato Chicken Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking dish 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice<br> 1 teaspoon dried basil<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Two 14.5-ounce cans diced tomatoes (not drained)<br> 1 1/2 cups creamy tomato soup (canned or boxed)<br> 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 6 ounces each)<br> One 1-ounce package onion soup mix<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Sprinkle the onion soup mixture over the top of the entire dish, concentrating a little more heavily on the chicken (the onions will brown more evenly there and flavor the chicken).<br> Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the chicken and rice are cooked through, about 1 hour and 25 minutes. Let sit, still covered, for 15 minutes to allow the rice to absorb any remaining liquid.

Sprinkle the patties on both sides with the salt and pepper. (We suggest aggressively, as most will sweat off the patties during cooking.) Cook the patties for 5 minutes, then flip. Place Pork Belly on grill. Brush the butter on the brioche buns and place on grill. Toast until it reaches the desired color (we like it a little darker for more of a char taste). Flip pork belly after 2 minutes, then place Cheddar on the patties to melt. Remove brioche buns from grill and spread Whiskey Aioli on all inside bun areas. Place patties on bun bottoms, then top with tomatoes and the bun tops. Let rest for 4 minutes, then devour. Preheat a smoker to 240 degrees F. Mix chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, brown sugar, garlic powder and pepper in a bowl until well combined, then reserve. Score the pork belly on the fat side with a sharp knife 1/2-inch apart, being careful to not cut into the meat. Turn the meat 90 degrees and repeat, forming a crosshatch pattern. Cut belly into five 3- to 4-inch-wide pieces. Rub all sides of the pork belly with the reserved rub. Place in smoker and cook for 3 hours. Remove from smoker and place in a pan to collect fat. Starting from cold, reduce whiskey by half in a saute pan over medium heat. (Be very careful, as it can catch fire. Do not attempt to blow out if this occurs. Remove from heat and cover with a metal lid to extinguish the fire.) Pour reduction in a bowl and place in refrigerator to cool, 10 minutes. Place mayonnaise, lime juice, Worcestershire, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Add whiskey reduction to bowl and mix.

Pour the olive oil into a small saucepan. Remove wide strips of zest from the lemon using a vegetable peeler, taking care not to get the white pith. Add the zest to the olive oil and heat over medium heat until the zest is sizzling, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Put the Brussels sprouts on a rimmed baking sheet; drizzle the olive oil over the sprouts, leaving the zest in the pan. Toss the Brussels sprouts and spread in a single layer (it&#39;s OK if some of the leaves fall off). Season with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Broil, stirring often, until the Brussels sprouts are tender and charred in spots, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, thinly slice the reserved lemon zest; add to the Brussels sprouts along with the garlic during the last 2 minutes of broiling. Transfer to a bowl, add the chives and toss.

Stir in the yeast and 1 tablespoon of sugar; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast mixture, butter, vanilla, zest, egg, egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup sugar to the flour mixture. Mix with a spoon until the dough just comes together, about 1 minute. (It&#39;s OK if a little of the flour remains loose at the bottom of the bowl, it will all come together while kneading.) Knead the dough on medium speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a smooth ball, about 1 minute. Lightly spray the mixing bowl with nonstick cooking spray and return the dough to the bowl; cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.<br> Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently roll out into a 1/2-inch-thick round. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter or drinking glass, cut the rounds out as closely together as possible. Place the rounds about 2 inches apart on a baking sheet lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.<br> Lightly spray the tops with the cooking spray. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise again until puffed, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. The dough rounds may not increase in size during this proofing, which is fine. The point is to let the dough rest before frying, resulting in pillowy doughnuts.<br> To fry the doughnuts: Line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels for draining. Put 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl for coating the fried doughnuts.<br> Fill a large, heavy bottomed pot with 3 inches vegetable oil (about 8 cups) and insert a deep-fry thermometer. Place over medium-high heat and bring the oil temperature to 345 to 350 degrees F. Do not let the oil get any hotter than 350 degrees or the outside of the doughnuts will burn before the insides are cooked through.<br> Working in batches of 3 to 4, carefully slip the dough rounds into the hot oil, being careful not to let the oil splash up. Fry the doughnuts until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to gently flip the doughnuts over and fry until deep golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the doughnuts the paper towel-lined baking sheet. Return the oil to temperature between batches.<br> Roll the warm doughnuts in the sugar to coat, then transfer them back to the baking sheet. Using a chopstick or skewer, poke a hole in the top of the donut, wiggling the stick back and forth to form a little pocket. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip with the jam of your choice and gently squeeze about 2 tablespoons into the side of each doughnut until the jam just peaks out from the hole on top. Dust the filled doughnuts with confectioners&#39; sugar, if using, and serve hot.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15402,&quot;Lebanese Stuffed Grape Leaves 40 garlic cloves 1 pound ground beef 3/4 cup uncooked white rice 1 teaspoon garlic powder 2 teaspoons allspice 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 jar grape leaves, or about 50 fresh grape leaves 1/4 cup olive oil 1 pound pork or lamb chops 1 tomato, sliced 1/2 cup lemon juice Instructions: In a large mixing bowl, mix together the ground beef, rice, garlic powder, allspice, salt, pepper, and cinnamon, and set aside. Rinse grape leaves several times. If the leaves are small, leave them intact, but cut out the large center vein. If the leaves are large, cut them in half vertically, cutting out the large vein in the process. Place a small amount of the ground meat mixture at the end of each leaf. Roll up egg-roll style. Pour the oil into the bottom of a large Dutch oven. Lay the chops over the oil. Lay the tomato slices over the chops. Place the stuffed grape leaves seam-side down on top of the chops. Pack the leaves tightly and begin a second layer when necessary. Place whole garlic cloves randomly between the rolled leaves; plenty of garlic on each layer. When you are done stacking, pour the lemon juice over the leaves, and add water to the pot to about 2-inches above the rolled leaves. To prevent the leaves from unrolling during cooking, place a plate on top of the stack of leaves and place a heavy object on top of the plate. Simmer the leaves over low heat for about 2 hours. Invert the entire Dutch oven into a large platter with high sides (i.e. a 12-inch round cake pan). Or, remove the leaves from the pot with tongs.

Season with salt and pepper. Brush both sides of the cutlets with the herb oil. Heat a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add the cutlets and cook just until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the skillet from the heat.<br> Spoon the marinara sauce over and around the cutlets. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the mozzarella over each cutlet, then sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the Parmesan over each. Sprinkle the butter pieces atop the cutlets. Bake until the cheese melts and the chicken is cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes.; In a large casserole pot, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves and simmer covered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove the bay leaves and check for seasoning. If the sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors. Add half the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with the remaining tomato sauce.<br> If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda and cayenne. Using a pastry cutter or your hands, cut in the chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir together the sweet potato and buttermilk in a separate bowl until smooth. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the sweet potato mixture. Add the raisins and combine until it just comes together. Be very careful to not over mix. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until it comes together. If the dough is too sticky, work in up to 1/4 cup additional flour. Shape into a disk and pat to an even 1- to 1 1/2-inch thickness. With a floured 3-inch round biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits. Gather together scraps, and repeat to cut out more biscuits. Butter a baking sheet and place each biscuit 1/2 inch apart. Brush with melted butter and bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. For the peppered pork loin: In a small bowl, stir together the sorghum, salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper and oil. Trim the pork loin of any excess fat, and transfer to a shallow roasting pan (or my favorite, a cast-iron skillet). Rub the pork loin with sorghum and spice mixture, coating evenly. Roast until the internal temperature is 140 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. For the apple mustard butter: Place the apple chunks in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over low heat. Cook, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon and allspice. Continue cooking over low heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the mustard. (Or if using applesauce, place in a heavy bottomed pot with the sugar and spices and cook until it is thick, 30 minutes or so.) For the salad: Toss the arugula, tomatoes and sunflowers seeds in a large bowl. Drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Top with the shaved cheese. To serve: Split the sweet potato biscuits and spread the apple mustard butter on both sides. Thinly slice the pork loin and place on each of the bottom biscuits. Top with the other biscuit halves and serve with salad on the side.

To make bread crumbs: Tear the bread into pieces. Spread bread out on a microwave-safe plate, and microwave on HIGH for 1 minute to dry out the bread. (Alternately, spread the bread out on a baking sheet and dry in a 350 degree F oven for 12 minutes.) Let cool and pulse the dried bread in a food processor with the Parmesan, parsley, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Put the flour, eggs, and bread crumb mixture in 3 separate shallow dishes. With the flat side of a cooks&#39; knife or the smooth side of a meat-pounder, pound each breast to equal thickness between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Cut into 1 1/2-inch strips pat the chicken dry and season both sides with salt and pepper. Dip each strip into the flour, then shake off the excess. Next, run the strips through the egg to coat it lightly and hold the chicken over the liquid to let any excess fall back into the bowl. Finally, lay the strips in the bread crumbs, turn it over and press it into the breading to evenly coat. Lay on a piece of waxedpaper. Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot and shimmering. Lay 2 or 3 chicken strips at a time in the pan. Cook the chicken without turning until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn the chicken and cook until equally brown on the other side and the chicken is cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining 2 breasts. Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

In a large stockpot, cover buffalo meat with water, add onion, garlic, chiles and cumin. Cover and bring to a simmer. Slowly braise for about 2 hours or until the meat is fork tender. Reserve cooking liquid for the sauce. For the corn husks: Place the corn husks in a large bowl and cover with tepid water. You may have to weigh them down with another bowl of water. Allow to soak as needed to hydrate, while the buffalo is braising. For the masa de maez: Melt 2/3 cup of the shortening in a saucepan and set aside. With an electric mixer, beat the other 1 1/3 cups of the shortening until fluffy and gradually and alternately begin adding the harina and beef stock, mixing well after each addition. Then gradually add the melted shortening mixing completely after each addition. Cover the bowl of dough with a damp kitchen towel and set aside. Transfer the buffalo meat to a utility platter and shred with 2 forks. Reserve 2 cups of the cooking liquid for the sauce. (If there is not enough, don&#39;t worry, you will supplement it with beef stock for the sauce.) Leave enough of the cooking juices to keep the meat just moist and return the shredded beef to this liquid, and cover to keep warm. Lay out the corn husks and spread about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of the masa dough into each followed by 1 to 2 tablespoons of the shredded buffalo. Fold each tamale so that the masa encases the meat, and use a thin strip of corn husk to tie the tamale. Place in a steamer basket, on end if possible, so that each tamale supports the one next to it. Place over a pot filled with a couple of inches of simmering water for steaming, cover and let steam until firm, about 1 hour. (The corn husk will fall away easily when it is done. While the tamales are steaming, make the tamale sauce. Heat the grapeseed oil over medium to medium high heat in a medium saucepot. When the oil begins to shimmer add the shallots and garlic and saute until the onion becomes translucent. Add 2 cups of the buffalo cooking liquid and/or beef stock to the shallots and garlic and increase heat to bring to a rapid boil. Add the chili powder, salt and pepper, to taste, and let reduce by half. Add the cornstarch to a separate small bowl and gradually whisk in 1 tablespoon of the liquid to create a slurry. Gradually whisk this into the saucepot to thicken the mixture. Let tamales rest briefly before serving, and serve with small bowls of tamale sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15540,&quot;Sofrito Mashed Potatoes 2 tablespoons salt 2 pounds potatoes (recommended: Yukon gold) 3 tablespoons canola oil 1/4 cup chopped red onions 1 red bell pepper, chopped 1/2 green pepper, chopped 3 tablespoons chopped garlic 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1/4 cup white wine 3 ounces tomato sauce 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons salt Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves Instructions: Fill a large pot with water, salt and potatoes and bring to boil. Cook until fork tender. Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium sauce pot over medium heat. When oil is hot add onions and peppers and saute for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until it begins to brown. Lower the heat and add tomato paste and stir for 3 to 5 minutes. Deglaze with white wine and reduce by half. Add tomato sauce and bring to simmer for 5 minutes. Then stir in butter and cream and set aside, covered to keep warm. When potatoes are fork tender, drain water and mash slowly adding the sofrito mixture. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 15541,&quot;Beverly Hills Chopped Salad 2 vine-ripe tomatoes, seeds removed and chopped 1 head iceberg lettuce, chopped 1 romaine heart, chopped One 15-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 5 ounces dry salami, julienned 1 cup grated fresh mozzarella 1/3 cup olive oil 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/3 cup white wine vinegar 1 teaspoon dry mustard Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Add the tomatoes, iceberg, romaine, chickpeas, salami and mozzarella to a large salad bowl.

If using a grill, set a wire rack directly on the grill grate. Brush the asparagus and scallions all over with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place over the direct heat of the grill. Cook, turning a few times, until limber and partially charred, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to a cutting board. Make the toast: In a small bowl mix the jam and sambal. Spread on the cut side of the rolls. Divide and pile the cheese on top of the jam on each roll and place over the indirect heat of the grill (directly on the grates or on a baking sheet). Cook, covered, until the cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Build the soup. Transfer the grilled veggies to a cutting board and roughly chop. Add to the jar of a blender. Add the stock, yogurt and parsley and blend until smooth. Put the soup, lemon zest, garlic and salt to taste in a medium pot over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Cook for a few minutes to warm through. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed. To finish the soup: In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice and honey. Pour the soup into bowls. Spoon 3 drops of the yogurt mixture into each bowl and run a skewer in a circle through the yogurt mixture to make a decorative pattern. Serve the toast alongside the soup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 15543,&quot;Desert Cooler 2 cups orange juice 2 cups pineapple juice 2 cups sparkling apple cider (recommended: Martinelli&#39;s) Ice Pineapple spears, for garnish Fresh mint sprigs, for garnish Instructions: Combine juices and apple cider in a pitcher. Pour into glasses filled with ice and garnish with pineapple spears and fresh mint sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15544,&quot;Profiteroles 3/4 cup/170 g butter 4 teaspoons sugar Pinch salt 1 1/2 cups/185 g all-purpose flour 6 eggs, lightly beaten 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Milk, for glaze 1 cup/250 ml heavy cream 8 ounces/225 g bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 12 scoops vanilla ice cream Instructions: For the choux balls: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C. Put 1 1/2 cups/375 ml water, the butter, sugar and salt in a roomy saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the flour all at once, beating until it forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Return the pan to the heat for a minute or two and beat to dry it out a little. (Removing moisture will allow the paste to absorb more egg, which will ultimately make the puffs lighter.) Remove the pan from the heat. Beat in the eggs, the equivalent of one at a time, until fully incorporated. (Do not try to add them at once because they can&#39;t be incorporated quickly enough, it makes a total mess, and furthermore you may not need all of them.) After the third addition of egg, add only enough to make dough that will fall, glossy and heavy, from the spoon. Beat in the vanilla. Spoon the dough into a piping bag. Mix a bit of milk into any remaining egg (if no egg left, use only milk). Have at the ready with a pastry brush for glazing. Pipe the dough into evenly-sized (about 1 inch/2.5 cm) balls on a nonstick baking sheet, leaving a good 2 inches/5 cm between them so they have room to expand. Brush the tops with the glaze and press the snouts down with a fingertip. Bake until puffed up, light, dry and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, so they can breathe all around and will keep their shape and not go soggy. For the chocolate sauce: Heat the cream in a saucepan just to the boiling point. Turn off the heat, and add the chocolate. Let sit a minute to melt, and stir until smooth, adding more cream to thin, if needed. For assembling: Slice 12 choux balls in half (reserve the remainder for another use). Put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the bottom half of each, then replace the tops. Arrange 3 on each serving plate, and drizzle over chocolate sauce to each person&#39;s liking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 15545,&quot;Fudgy Avocado Pops 2 ripe avocados 7 ounces coconut milk<br> 7 ounces sweetened condensed milk<br> 2 tablespoons maple syrup<br> 4 teaspoons cocoa powder<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Instructions: Combine the avocado, coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, maple syrup, cocoa powder and vanilla extract in a blender and blend until smooth. Pour into 8 push-up pop molds, then cover and freeze until firm, at least 3 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinotage, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 15546,&quot;Sugar-Roasted Plums and Apricots 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6 plums*, cut in half and pitted 6 apricots*, cut in half and pitted 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 cup fresh orange juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and cinnamon. In another bowl, toss the plums, apricots, vanilla extract, and orange juice together. In a roasting pan or oven-proof baking dish, arrange the fruit cut-side up pouring any extra juice in the baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes or until the fruit is fork tender. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 15547,&quot;Indian Doughnuts 1 1/2 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk 2/3 cup yellow cornmeal 1 cup flour, plus more, as needed 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup (5 1/3 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 1 egg, beaten Vegetable oil, for deep-frying Confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat just until it comes to a boil then immediately turn off the heat. Place the cornmeal in a large bowl. Add the hot milk and mix lightly. Sift together 1 cup of flour, the sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Stir the melted butter and the egg into the cornmeal mixture. Stir the flour mixture into the cornmeal mixture and mix well. If the dough doesn&#39;t hold together, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time. The dough should be firm enough to handle, but keep it soft by using as little flour as possible. Place the dough in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate 30 minutes. Flour your hands and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Using your hands, roll into logs 1-inch in diameter. Using a knife, cut into 1 1/2-inch lengths. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a deep fryer (or at least 2 inches of oil in a deep, heavy pot) to 350 degrees F. (Do not overheat, or the doughnuts will not cook through.) Working in batches to avoid crowding the pot, fry the dough nuts, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle lightly with confectioners&#39; sugar, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 15548,&quot;Roasted Sweet Potatoes (Wedges) 2 small or one large sweet potatoes Olive oil Fresh thyme Salt and pepper Instructions: Cut potatoes into wedges.

Set aside at room temperature. Put 1 of the buns in a food processor and pulse to make coarse crumbs. Put the mayonnaise, mustard and egg whites in a large bowl and use a fork to combine. Add the tuna and 1/2 cup of the breadcrumbs (save the rest for another use) and season with salt and pepper. Toss well to combine without breaking up the tuna too much. Divide into 4 patties, each about 1/2 inch thick and 4 inches across. Put on a wax-paper- or plastic-wrap-lined plate and chill for 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the patties to the skillet and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Spread 1 teaspoon sun-dried tomato tapenade on each bottom bun and top with a tuna burger.

Mix together the milk, eggs and hot sauce in a shallow dish, such as a pie pan. Set aside.<br> Stir together the flour, baking powder, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne, 2 teaspoons salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper in a separate shallow dish. Pat the turkey legs dry and sprinkle with some salt and pepper. Place 1 turkey leg in the flour mixture and turn to coat. Transfer the turkey to the egg mixture and turn to coat. Return the turkey to the flour mixture and turn to coat. Shake off any excess coating and place the coated turkey on a clean plate. Continue the coating process with the remaining turkey legs.<br> Heat about 3/4 inch oil in an extra-large skillet over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 325 degrees F (do not allow the oil to go above 325 degrees F). Fry the turkey legs in batches until golden brown on each side and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat (not touching bone) registers 165 degrees F, 10 to 12 minutes per side. Transfer the finished turkey legs to the rack on the baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you fry the rest.<br> For the gravy: After all the turkey is fried, pour the oil into a heatproof bowl and reserve; do not clean the skillet. Return the skillet to the stove over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup of the reserved oil to the skillet and, once hot, sprinkle the flour over the top. Whisk until combined and continue to cook, whisking constantly, until the flour mixture turns a deep golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly pour in 3 cups milk, whisking constantly, and add the garlic powder, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, whisking occasionally, until the gravy is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Add more milk if the gravy becomes too thick. Season with salt, pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce, if using.<br> Spoon the gravy on a large serving platter and place the warm turkey legs on top. Sprinkle with sliced scallions and serve with additional gravy alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 15551,&quot;Cake Eyeballs One (18.25-ounce) box red velvet or yellow cake mix (plus required ingredients) One (12-ounce) can frosting (any kind) 12 ounces white chocolate melting disks Assorted gel icing, for decorating Instructions: Prepare the cake mix according to the package directions for a 9-by-13-inch cake or two 9-inch cakes. Allow to cool slightly in the pan, then remove to a rack, cover with a dish towel and let cool completely. Break off sections of the cake and crumble in a large bowl. When finished, you should have a bunch of very fine cake crumbs. Using a rubber spatula, work the frosting into the cake until it is no longer visible. (Even if you use white frosting with red velvet cake, the white will eventually blend in entirely.) Next, roll the mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls (a small ice cream scoop helps with this) and set on a parchment-lined baking sheet. This is important: Pop &#39;em in the freezer, uncovered, for at least an hour. The cake balls need to be very firm before coating them. When the cake balls are nice and firm, place the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. (Don&#39;t let the bowl touch the water.) Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove the bowl from the pan. Add the cake balls one at a time to the melted white chocolate and gently roll to coat. Using a fork, lift out the cake balls, then tap the fork against the side of the bowl to remove the excess chocolate. With a toothpick, push the ball off of the fork and back onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. Let set at room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes. Decorate with gel icing to look like eyeballs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 15552,&quot;Pot Au Feu 16 cups cold water 2 pound soup bones, well rinsed 3 pounds marrow bones, trimmed of fat and meat 4 ounces ice water 3 pounds stewing beef, cut into 2 by 1 by 1-inch strips Bouquet Garni (1 bay leaf, 4 stalks parsley, 1 (3-inch) piece celery) 1 turnip, blanched, roughly sliced 4 carrots, roughly sliced 8 ounces leeks, roughly sliced 1 pound potatoes, roughly sliced 2 medium onions 2 cloves 1 clove garlic 2 tablespoons freshly ground salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 small cabbage head, sliced into wedges 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander Instructions: Bring water to boil in large pot.

Brush 12 baba molds, a popover pan, or a muffin tin with melted butter and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together the water, yeast, sugar, and egg. Using the paddle attachment, stir in the flour until incorporated. Mix on medium speed for 6 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl once. Add butter and mix on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 to 3 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm spot for about 15 to 20 minutes, it just needs to rise a bit not double in volume. Drain the cranberries (reserve the soaking liquid) and mix into the dough with a spatula or wooden spoon. Fill the baba molds (or popover pan or muffin tin) half full with batter. Let rise in a warm spot until the dough fills the molds, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the babas for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are a deep golden brown. Remove from molds, put babas onto a rack set over a sheet pan, and allow them to cool completely. Bring 2 cups sugar and 4 cups water to a boil. Boil for 1 minute and remove from the heat; stir in the reserved soaking liquid and the orange flower water. Using tongs or a spoon, place the babas, 1 at a time, into the sugar syrup. Hold them under until the air bubbles stop coming out of the cakes, about 5 to 10 seconds. Drain on the rack; you can recycle the syrup that accumulates in the sheet pan. Warm the marmalade and brush it onto the tops of the babas.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cooled chocolate and vanilla and beat for 3 minutes to incorporate. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat for another 3 minutes. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients in three batches, alternating with the cold water. Beat for 1 minute after each addition to incorporate the ingredients. Mix until the batter is smooth.<br> Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. Cut 2 circles of parchment paper to fit the pan bottoms and place them inside the pans; then spray the paper for added non-stick insurance. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with a spatula; the pans should be two-thirds full. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. The cake is cooked when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when touched. Leave to cool for 40 minutes.<br> Turn the cakes out of the pans and remove the paper. Drizzle them with a few tablespoons of raspberry liqueur. With a metal spatula, spread 1/2 cup Chocolate Chip Buttercream on top of one of the layers. Start in the center and work your way out. Carefully place the second layer on top. Smooth the sides with buttercream, and then spread the rest over the top so that the cake is completely covered. Refrigerate for 5 minutes before decorating or cutting.<br> With a large knife, scrape some shavings from a block of dark chocolate. Scatter the shavings over the cake. In the bowl of an electric mixer, dissolve the powdered sugar and water at low speed. Beat in the dark chocolate and vanilla. Add the butter gradually in small bits. Mix until everything is completely incorporated. Using a spatula, fold in the chopped chocolate and give a final quick spin. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 15566,&quot;The Eggbert&#39;s Sunriser 8 cups frozen diced or shredded hash browns (one 32-ounce package) 20 whole frozen mini potato wedges or steak fries Canola oil, for frying Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 medium onion, diced 1 green bell pepper, diced 1/2 red bell pepper, diced 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced (optional) 1 1/2 cups diced ham 1 1/2 cups grated sharp Cheddar cheese 8 large eggs Salsa or pico de gallo, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.
