Pound them between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Season with salt and pepper. Dredge the flattened chicken medallions in flour. Saute the chicken scaloppine on high heat in clarified butter or olive oil, 2 minutes on each side, remove and keep warm. Discard oil or butter. Place pan on medium heat, add white wine and reduce. Add chicken broth, lemon juice, capers and sun-dried tomatoes. Reduce by 1/2 and thicken sauce with the cold butter. Adjust seasoning, plate the chicken scaloppine, garnish with the sauce and chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 43717,&quot;Easter Bread with Citrus Spoon Sweet from Corfu 1 cup milk 1 1/2 (1/4-ounce) envelopes active dry yeast 4 to 5 cups all-purpose flour, as needed 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoons sugar 2 small eggs, separated 1/2 cup well-drained, chopped orange or bergamot spoon sweet 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/8 cup kumquat or orange liqueur 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted 1/4 cup caraway seeds Instructions: Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it is just warm. Pour it into a very large glass or ceramic bowl and stir in the yeast, 1/2 cup of the flour, and 6 tablespoons of the sugar. Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free place, lightly covered with a cloth, and allow to stand until the yeast starts to bubble up, about 30 minutes. With an electric mixer in a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks with 6 tablespoons of the remaining sugar until pale and creamy. Pour this mixture into the yeast mixture. Stir in the drained orange or bergamot spoon sweet, vanilla, kumquat or orange liqueur, and melted butter. Slowly add flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing it in with a wooden spoon, until a mass begins to form. Turn this out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead, adding more flour if necessary to form a very smooth, large ball of dough. Cover, place in a warm, draft-free place, and allow to stand until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch the dough down and knead again for about 7 to 8 minutes. Shape into 1 round loaf and place on a buttered baking sheet. Make 2 sharp slashes like an X on the surface of the dough, cover with a cloth, and let rise again until doubled for about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl until they are frothy without forming peaks. Brush the surface of each loaf with the mixture, sprinkle with caraway seeds, and bake until the fogatsa has swelled and browned, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, let cool on a wire rack, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 43718,&quot;Mexican Bananas Foster 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 3/4 cup Kahlua or other coffee flavored liquor 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons 6 ripe bananas, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch thick rounds Ground cinnamon, to taste Vanilla ice cream Instructions: Build a charcoal fire in an outdoor grill and let burn until the coals are covered with white ash. Let the fire burn down to medium-hot (you should be able to hold your hand at grate level for 3 seconds). In a gas grill, preheat to Medium. Tear off six 12-inch squares of aluminum foil. Fold one foil square in half. On the bottom half, place 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons Kahlua, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1 banana. Sprinkle with a pinch of cinnamon. Fold the foil over to form a packet, crimping the open edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. The packets can be prepared up to 1 hour ahead and kept at room temperature. Grill the packets until the sugar, Kahlua, and butter are boiling, 5 to 7 minutes. Open the packets, pour over bowls of ice cream and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Merlot, Malbec, Port]&quot; 43719,&quot;Frozen Mocha Mousse 7 ounces bittersweet chocolate, divided, plus extra for decorating 3 tablespoons coffee liqueur 3 tablespoons water 2 teaspoons instant espresso granules 6 extra-large eggs, at room temperature, separated 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup cocoa powder 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch of kosher salt 2 cups cold heavy cream 1 cup cold heavy cream 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Break 3 ounces of the chocolate into pieces and place the pieces in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk in the coffee liqueur, water and espresso granules and heat the mixture until the chocolate just melts. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Place the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for 3 minutes, until the mixture is the texture of mayonnaise. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla, and slowly pour in the cooled chocolate mixture. Put the egg whites and salt in the clean bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on high speed until the whites form soft (not dry!) peaks. Fold them carefully into the chocolate mixture. In the same bowl (no need to clean it) beat the heavy cream until it forms soft peaks and fold it carefully into the chocolate mixture. Grate the remaining 4 ounces of chocolate and fold it into the mixture. Pour the mixture into a 10-cup souffle dish, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for several hours or overnight. For the whipped cream, place the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and whip on medium and then high speed until it reach stiff peaks. Spoon the whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe the edge of the mousse with the whipped cream, and sprinkle extra chocolate shavings over the center of the mousse for decoration. Serve frozen. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43720,&quot;Chiacchiere (Christmas Fries) 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 4 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 large egg plus 4 yolks<br> Finely grated zest of 1 lemon (about 2 teaspoons) plus juice of 1/2 lemon<br> 1 shot glass (1 1/2 ounces) whiskey, rum, anise-flavored liqueur or white wine (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Neutral oil, such as peanut or vegetable, for frying<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar, for serving<br> Instructions: Add the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer. Combine the whole egg and yolks, lemon zest and juice, whiskey and vanilla in a separate bowl. Make a well in the flour mixture and add the wet ingredients. Mix together with the paddle attachment until smooth. Cut off one-quarter of the dough (cover the remaining dough with plastic wrap so it doesn&#39;t dry out) and roll it out with a pasta machine or rolling pin into a 1/8-inch-thick sheet, dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking. With a pastry cutter (fluted if you have it), cut the dough into strips approximately 1 inch wide and 6 inches long. Cut a 2-inch lengthwise slit in the center of each strip. Pick up a strip, insert one end through the slit and pull it through. Repeat with the remaining dough.<br> Put 4 inches of oil in a heavy 6-quart pot and place over medium-high heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 375 degrees F. (Or preheat an electric deep fryer.)<br> Working in small batches, place a few pieces of dough in the oil at one time. They will puff immediately.

Cool completely, and keep up to 4 days in an airtight container.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43721,&quot;Tie-Dye Cake Roll Nonstick cooking spray 6 large eggs, separated, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup whole milk 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook\u2019s Note) 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple gel food coloring (see Cook\u2019s Note) 1 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch kosher salt 2 very clean large egg whites, at room temperature (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 cup rainbow sprinkles, plus more for sprinkling Instructions: For the tie-dye cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Spray the bottom and sides of a 17 1/2-by-12 1/2-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray, line the bottom with parchment paper and spray the parchment. Beat the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until light and foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the confectioners\u2019 sugar, increase the speed to medium high and continue to beat until shiny stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the milk, oil, vanilla and egg yolks in a medium bowl. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and remaining 1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar into a large bowl. Whisk the egg yolk mixture into the flour mixture until smooth and thick. Divide the batter between 6 small bowls. Tint each bowl a separate color with 1 to 2 drops of gel food coloring: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. Stir each batter until no streaks remain. Divide the whipped egg white mixture between the 6 bowls (about 1/2 cup each), then gently fold until the batters are fluffy and no streaks remain. Drop large spoonfuls of the batter on the prepared baking sheet, alternating between the colors and making sure the batter reaches the edges of the baking sheet. Drag a toothpick or wooden skewer through the colors to create a marble-like tie-dye effect; do not overmix or the colors will become muddy. Bake until the cake springs back when gently pressed, about 12 minutes. Immediately sift confectioners&#39; sugar generously over the top of the warm cake and loosen the edges with a knife. Lay a clean non-terry cloth kitchen towel over the cake. Place a second baking sheet on top of the towel. Holding the baking sheets together, flip the cake to invert it onto the towel. Remove the top baking sheet and parchment. Starting at a short end, roll up the cake and towel together into a spiral. Transfer seam-side down to a wire rack and let cool completely, about 45 minutes. For the vanilla frosting: Fill a medium saucepan about one-third full with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Whisk the sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, cream of tartar, salt, egg whites and 3 tablespoons water in a large glass or metal bowl heatproof (see Cook&#39;s Note). Set the bowl over the saucepan, but not touching the water. Beat the mixture with a handheld electric mixer on low speed until the sugar dissolves and the mixture starts to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high and continue to beat until the mixture is glossy and holds firm peaks, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and continue to beat until the mixture cools slightly, about 30 seconds more. While the frosting is still slightly warm, start to assemble the cake. Spoon about 3/4 cup of the frosting into a pastry bag fitted with an open-star pastry tip. Set aside. Gently unroll the cake, then spread on the remaining frosting (about 1 1/2 cups) with an offset spatula, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edges. Top with the rainbow sprinkles. Starting at a short end, roll up the cake into a spiral and transfer it seam-side down to a cutting board. Use a dry pastry brush to brush away any confectioner\u2019s sugar on the cake roll as needed. Trim the ends with a serrated knife, then transfer to a platter. Pipe small rosettes and stars of frosting on top of the cake roll, then top with more sprinkles. Set aside at room temperature until the frosting is set and completely cool, about 30 minutes. The cake roll can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43722,&quot;Lentil and Goats Cheese Crostini 1 head garlic Vincotto (grape must) or good quality aged balsamic vinegar, to serve 2 cups beluga (black) lentils 1 (4-ounce/125 g) piece bacon 1 onion, quartered 1 carrot, quartered 1 celery stalk, quartered 2 cups red wine 2 cups veal stock 1/4 cup brown sugar Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper (recommended: Maldon sea salt) 4 thick slices of country bread 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup goat cheese 12 cherry tomatoes 1 cup olive oil, for poaching 8 slices pancetta 1 teaspoon butter, plus more for sauteing 4 large pieces Swiss chard, blanched Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice off the top of the garlic head and wrap it in aluminum foil. Bake until soft, about 30 minutes. Squeeze out garlic and put aside. To assemble: Spread the roasted garlic and a generous dollop of goat cheese on each slice of bread and then place in the oven for a few minutes so that the cheese melts just slightly and the bread is warm. To prevent the bread from sliding, place a touch of goat cheese in the center of each plate. Place the warm bread on top, then top the bread with a couple of slices pancetta. Next, top with the Swiss chard-lentil mixture and a spoon of the red wine sauce. Add a drizzle of Vincotto and the poached tomatoes. For the lentils: Cook the lentils in about 2 cups salted boiling water with the bacon, onion, carrot, and celery. Reduce the heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until the lentils are tender. Drain the lentils; discard the vegetables and bacon and keep the lentils aside. For the wine sauce: Meanwhile, in another pot, bring the red wine, veal stock, and brown sugar to a boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer for 30 minutes, until reduced by half and thick, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and keep aside. For the crostini: Meanwhile, in a hot pan, add 1/4 cup olive oil and grill the bread in in the hot oil on both sides for about 30 seconds. Finish in the oven for 5 minutes to crisp them. Put aside. For the poached tomatoes: Pour about 1 cup olive oil in a small stockpot. Heat the oil on medium and when hot, toss in the tomatoes. Remove when the tomato skin begins to crack, about 3 minutes. Remove the tomatoes, keeping the oil for another use. For the pancetta: Place the slices on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and cover with another baking sheet to ensure they stay flat. Cook the pancetta in the oven for 15 minutes, or until crispy. For the Swiss chard: Add the butter to a hot pan. Add the Swiss chard and saute to heat through. Add the cooked lentils and heat gently on medium-low heat to warm through, then season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 43723,&quot;Crunchy Chopped Green Bean Salad 12 ounces green beans, sliced into 1-inch bite-size pieces and blanched until bright green 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese 1/2 cup olives, pitted and chopped 4 radishes, sliced paper-thin on a mandoline 1 English cucumber, diced 1 shallot, sliced paper-thin on a mandoline One 4-ounce jar hearts of palm, drained and chopped<br> Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Add the green beans, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, olives, radishes, cucumber, shallots and hearts of palm to a large bowl.

Line an 8 by-8-inch square baking pan with foil so it hangs over the edges by about 1 inch. For the crust: Lightly butter the foil with some of the melted butter. Stir the rest of the butter together with the crumbs, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Press the crumb mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the brownie. Put the butter and chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt in the microwave on 75 percent power for 2 minutes. Stir, and microwave again until completely melted, about 2 minutes more. Alternatively, put the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 1 inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl on the pan without touching the water. Stir occasionally until melted. Stir the light brown and white sugars, vanilla and salt into the melted chocolate. Add the eggs and beat vigorously to make a thick and glossy batter. Add the flour and stir until just incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the top is crispy and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out mostly clean, with a few crumbs, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully position a rack about 6 inches from the broiler and preheat on low. Layer marshmallows across the top and toast under the broiler until golden, (keep an eye on it, it can go quick), about 2 minutes. Cool on a rack, gently removing the brownies from the pan using the aluminum flaps. Carefully separate any marshmallow from the foil and fold away.

In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the butter, orange zest and confectioners&#39; sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and salt and mix. Add the sifted flour and mix until smooth. Refrigerate 30 minutes. On ungreased cookie sheets, working in batches if necessary, drop level teaspoons of the chilled dough 2 1/2 inches apart. One by one, pick up the dough balls, roll into a smooth ball, and replace on the cookie sheet. Spread about 3 tablespoons of confectioners&#39; sugar on a plate. Dip the bottom of a drinking glass into the sugar and use it to press the dough balls flat, into 1 1/4-inch circles. Repeatedly dip the glass into the sugar as needed to keep the bottom dry and coated. Bake until golden brown around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on the cookie sheets for 2 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool completely. To assemble the cookies, liberally spread half of the orange cookies with cocoa filling, keeping the filling a little bit away from the edges. Cover with a plain cookie and press together gently to create a sandwich. Store in an airtight container. Filling: In a small bowl, mix the cocoa and sugar. In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the cocoa mixture and the cream and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 3 minutes.

Once at a boil, add the garlic, agave syrup, red cl flakes, peppercorns, and salt and turn off the heat. Once slightly cooled, add the mixture to a large container and add 6 cups ice to yield about 10 cups liquid. Add the pork and submerge. Place into the refrigerator for about 2 to 3 hours. Remove and rinse under cool water; pat dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a steady cutting board (place a couple of damp paper towels under it to keep it from moving around), stand the roast up with the bones up and the loin down. With a sharp, thin knife, slice carefully along the bones, separating the eye of the loin from the bones, but leaving the loin still attached on the bottom. Continue butterflying and slowly roll out, creating a large flat surface for the pesto to easily spread on. For the pesto filling: In a small bowl, combine the pesto, cl flakes, garlic, salt and pepper. Mix well and spread this mixture evenly on the inside of the rolled out loin. Carefully roll back up. Cut a 2 to 3-inch slit in between the bones. Truss the roast with kitchen string in between the bones and around the roast. This will help the roast cook evenly. For the roasting vegetables base: In a heavy, large roasting pan, add the onions, carrots, parsnips, Brussels sprouts, and smashed garlic and toss to combine. Place the tied pork roast on a v-rack over the vegetables, tent with heavy duty aluminum foil, and roast in the oven until the internal temperature reads 145 to 150 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. About 3/4 of the way through the cooking process remove the foil, this will help the pork brown up a bit. Remove from the oven, tent with foil, and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes to rest and carry over cooking for another 5 to 10 degrees F. Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat and add 1 1/2 to 2 cups chicken stock and bring to a boil. Allow to boil and reduce for 5 minutes. To finish: Strain the vegetables and place onto a serving platter. Finish the sauce with about 2 tablespoons butter and remove from the heat. Remove the kitchen string and slice the pork into 1 1/2-inch thick pieces. Serve immediately with the vegetables and pan sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 43749,&quot;Avocado Frenchman&#39;s Cove 2 large avocados, halved, and drizzled with juice of 2 limes to prevent discoloration 2 pounds red snapper fillets, cut into bite-size pieces 1 ounce clarified butter Freshly ground white pepper 2 teaspoons brown sugar 8 ounces tiny frozen shrimp, thawed and rinsed 5 ounces pimento, diced 1 clove garlic, smashed 1-ounce rum 2 teaspoons fresh dill, minced 1/4 salted butter 1 ounce finely grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat broiler.

Draw the butler design on a piece of paper. Take the original to a copy shop and have it enlarged to the size you would like to make. This will be as a template for the butler base and the butler&#39;s body. My butler was 10-inches wide and 26-inches tall. You may wish to transfer the design onto foam board. Cut around the silhouette of the butler. Make the butler base and the butler body: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a large sheet of acetate or several pieces of parchment paper. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to trace around the silhouette. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate or paper. Repeat this using white chocolate. Tip: Making the base and body thicker than 1/4-inch will make it easier to handle and less likely to break. Pour tempered dark chocolate onto the dark chocolate butler. Place the white chocolate butler on top of this piece. Press gently. Use an X-acto knife to cut the template into the pieces. My template was cut into 6 pieces: a head, the hand, a bowtie, the body with arm, a shirt and the lapels. These pieces are used to \dress\ the butler and to give him the chocolate accents. Make the coat and lapels: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a large sheet of acetate or several pieces of parchment paper. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to trace around the coat and the lapels. The side of the chocolate that touches the acetate will be the finished side so, remember to use the reverse side of the template. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate or paper. Make the bowtie and shirt: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate onto a piece of acetate. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to trace around the bowtie and the shirt. The side of the chocolate that touches the acetate will be the finished side so, remember to use the reverse side of the template. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate or paper. Use a paintbrush to apply red dots onto the bowtie. Make the buttons: Use a cornet filled with tempered milk chocolate and pipe rounds of chocolate onto a piece of acetate. Let the chocolate set. My butler had 1 large button and 3 smaller buttons. Use the tip of a sharp knife to mark the holes in each button. Use tempered chocolate to glue the buttons into place. Make the lips and mustache: Use modeling chocolate to form the lips and mustache. Add a drop of red food coloring to a small piece of white molding chocolate and work in the color until it is pink. Form the lips. Use dark modeling chocolate to form the mustache. Make the base: Use flexible aluminum strips or very large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 13 inches in diameter. Place it on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered chocolate inside the ring to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. Make a support pole: Roll a piece of acetate into a tube that is 11 1/2 inches long and 3 inches in diameter and tape it closed. Set the tube on end and fill with dark chocolate. When it is full, invert the tube over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Let set. When the chocolate has set, repeat this step a few more times. You want the tube to be sturdy because the butler will rest against it. Allow the chocolate tube to set until hard. Remove the acetate. Use a hot knife to trim the base of the tube so it is flat. Then use the knife to scar the bottom. You want to make it somewhat textured so it will form a better seal to the base. Use tempered chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it. Make the tray: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate over a sheet of parchment paper. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to trace around an 8-inch cake circle. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Finishing the details: Paint the eyes, eyebrows, chin and nose outline onto the face of the butler. You can also add some lines on his hand to give it a sense of action. Fill a cornet with milk chocolate and use it to paint hair on the butler&#39;s head. Use tempered chocolate to glue all of the pieces into place. Start with the coat. Place some tempered chocolate directly onto the butler under the coat piece. Add the shirt. Then add the lapels. Use tempered chocolate to glue the bow tie into place. Add the lips and mustache into place. Use a pastry brush to gloss the butler&#39;s coat with some vegetable oil. This will make his coat shiny. Stand the butler on end and adhere him to the base with tempered chocolate by resting the butler against the support pole. Use a hot knife to make a 90-degree indentation in the butler&#39;s hand and on the tray. Use these notches as a guide and adhere the tray into place with more tempered chocolate. Place hors d&#39;oeuvres on the tray and the butler is ready to serve you!

Line a half sheet pan with a silicone baking mat. Take the pistachios and 35 grams (2 1/2 tablespoons) of the sugar for a spin around your food processor, until the mixture appears damp and thick and begins to clump up, 1 to 2 minutes. (You&#39;ll need to stop two to three times to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber or silicone spatula.) Add the cornflakes and pulse until crushed and the mixture is fairly uniform, 5 to 10 pulses. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Combine the water, corn syrup and vanilla in a small (2-quart) saucepan. Place on the stovetop, then pour the remaining 225 grams sugar into the center of the pot so that it forms a mound. Turn the heat to medium until the mixture reaches a rolling boil. Swirl the pot occasionally to help the sugar dissolve completely. Continue boiling the syrup, without stirring, until the mixture registers 275 degrees F, 8 to 12 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking until syrup reaches 285 degrees F, another 30 to 60 seconds. Immediately remove from the heat and carefully pour out in a rectangle in the center of the prepared sheet pan. Tilt the sheet pan, working the syrup into a rectangle measuring roughly 12-by 9-inches. Turn the sheet pan so that the short side is facing you, then evenly spread the pistachio mixture over the bottom two-thirds of the candy. Using the mat, fold the candy as you would a business letter, folding the empty third over the middle, then folding that over the bottom third creating three layers of candy and two of pistachio filling. (If the mixture sticks to the mat, let sit for 2 to 3 minutes longer to continue to cool; it will release when it&#39;s ready. You can also use a plastic dough scraper to help.) Fold the packet in half widthwise to form a 5- by 4 1/2-inch rectangle, then move to the oven for 5 minutes. Remove the mat, with the candy still on it, from the sheet pan and on to the counter. Use a rolling pin to roll it back out to a 12- by 9-inch rectangle. It will take some force and patience and it won\u2019t necessarily be pretty but, again, you should not hear the candy cracking. (You may see some of the pistachio mixture coming through the sugar mixture, but that is okay; continue with the recipe.) If you do hear cracking, return the candy, on the mat, to the sheet pan and place in the oven to heat up for another few minutes. Once the candy is rolled out, repeat the folding process from step 5. Return the mat and candy to the sheet pan, and then back in the oven for another 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat step 6 once more, then return the candy to the oven to soften one last time. Now use the rolling pin to roll the candy about 1/4-inch-thick. Transfer the candy (not the mat) to a piece of parchment paper and place on cutting board. Trim the edges, if desired, then use a chef&#39;s knife to slice into 24 to 32 fun-sized candies. Wipe off the silicone baking mat and return it to the sheet pan. Place next to the board with the candies. Place a folded kitchen towel right next to the stovetop. Place a second folded kitchen towel in the bottom of a high-sided saute pan or large skillet and add about 1-inch of water. Turn the heat under the saute pan on to medium-high and let the water come to a bare simmer, then reduce the heat as low as it will go. Place the chocolate in a metal bowl that will fit in the saute pan and set in the hot water. Stir constantly for 5 seconds. Remove from the heat, set on the towel, and stir vigorously for 30 seconds. Return to the hot water and stir for another 5 seconds, then back to the dry towel for 30 seconds. Repeat until the chocolate is half melted, then reduce the time the bowl is on the heat from 5 to 3 seconds. Keep the off-heat stir time at 30 seconds. The goal is to melt all of the chocolate while keeping the temperature below 88 degrees F. This process can take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the chocolate pieces. If the chocolate begins to creep up above 88 degrees F, leave the bowl on the counter and stir like crazy until the temperature drops back down. Continue with the melting process. Once the chocolate is a smooth liquid, stir vigorously for another minute before dipping. Place a piece of candy into the bowl of chocolate and, using a fork, flip it over to coat both sides. Pull the candy from the chocolate, then tap the fork on the side of the bowl to remove as much excess chocolate as possible. Transfer to the silicone mat and repeat with the remaining candies. (If the chocolate becomes too thick or hard to work with, return it to the hot water for a few seconds, stirring constantly. Again, do not let the temperature rise above 88 degrees F.) Rest the candies at room temperature until the chocolate hardens, up to 1 hour. Devour or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43776,&quot;Cheesy Loaded Potato Bites 1 1/2 pounds marble or baby potatoes 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3/4 cup milk<br> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> One 8-ounce bag shredded processed cheese (or 8 ounces processed cheese, cut into small cubes) 6 slices crisp-cooked bacon, crumbled<br> 2 tablespoons sliced chives<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, oil and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet and roast until tender and easily pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.

Make the frittata base by mixing together the heavy cream, creme fraiche, Parmesan, salt, white pepper and eggs. Set aside in the fridge. At Craftsman and Wolves, we like to use fresh seasonal vegetables in our frittata. However, the wonderful thing about this dish is you can use whatever is in your fridge. Start by either sauteing or roasting your vegetables. If you are sauteing, you can use the same pan to cook the frittata. If you have leftover vegetables, make sure to thoroughly warm them in your frittata pan before adding the egg mixture. This will keep the vegetables from sticking to the bottom of the pan when you serve the frittata. Once your vegetables are cooked, set a 9-inch pan over medium-high heat. Evenly coat the canola oil around the sides and bottom of your pan. When the oil starts to smoke a little, turn down the heat to medium and add your vegetables so that they form a even layer on the bottom of your pan. After 1 minute, add your frittata mixture. It should sizzle up the side of the pan. Turn your heat down to medium-low and let the frittata cook. Once the edges of the frittata are set, transfer to the oven and cook just until the center is set, 16 to 20 minutes. Allow the frittata to cool for 5 minutes, and then run a butter knife around the side to loosen it from the pan. Invert onto a cutting board and cool 10 minutes. Re-flip the frittata onto a plate, cut into 4 to 6 slices and serve! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43794,&quot;Manti with Yogurt Sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 1 pound ground lean lamb 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Salt and pepper to taste 2 cups all-purpose flour plus additional for rolling 1 teaspoon salt 1 large egg 1/2 cup water plus a little more if necessary 2 cups plain whole-milk yogurt (preferably made from sheep&#39;s milk) 4 garlic cloves, mashed to a paste with 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter 3/4 teaspoon fine quality sweet paprika Coarse salt to taste 4 dashes hot red pepper sauce, or more to taste Shredded fresh mint leaves for garnish Instructions: To make the filling: Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Stir in the onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the lamb and the parsley, and cook, stirring and breaking up any lumps, until the lamb changes color. Remove from heat and generously season with salt and pepper. Set aside. To make the pasta: Sift the 2 cups of flour and salt together into a bowl. Make a well in the center and place the egg and 1/2 cup water in the well. Work the dough with your hands or a wooden spoon into a smooth dough. (You might find that you will need more water if you are rolling the pasta by hand and less if you are using a hand-turned pasta machine.) Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a towel and let rest for 1 hour. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll out each piece to 1/16-inch thick with a rolling pin or a pasta machine, and cut into 3-inch squares, discarding the uneven edges. Place 1 to 2 teaspoons filling into the center of each square. Moisten the entire outer edge with water, bring the 4 corners together in the center and pinch tightly to seal, then pinch together the 4 straight edges to seal completely (take care with this step, sealing the dumplings thoroughly will ensure that they will not become unsealed in the water and lose the filling). Repeat with remaining pasta and filling. Place the manti on a lightly floured baking sheet in a single layer. To make the yogurt sauce: Drain the yogurt at room temperature through a very fine mesh strainer over a bowl for 30 minutes and discard the whey. Stir together the yogurt and garlic in a bowl and let stand at warm room temperature until ready to use. To make the butter sauce: In a small skillet over moderate heat cook the butter until it is a very light brown, remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the paprika, coarse salt to taste, and the hot red pepper sauce. In a large kettle of boiling salted water cook the manti, in batches, stirring to keep them from sticking together, about 7 minutes, or until the pressed together edges are al dente (they will the the longest to cook). Remove them when done with a long-handled sieve or a large slotted spoon and keep warm with a little of the warm cooking liquid. Serve the manti very hot in individual bowls, spoon some of the yogurt sauce, then drizzle some butter sauce and garnish with mint leaves. Pass the remaining yogurt sauce at the table.

Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, combine the Cheddar, butter cubes, sugar, ground mustard and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente, a minute or so less than the recommended cooking time on the package. Drain well. While still hot, dump the macaroni into the Cheddar-butter mixture and toss to mix well. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring the milk to a bare simmer over medium heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg briefly to break it up. Temper the egg by drizzling 1/2 cup of the warm milk in while whisking until incorporated. (This will prevent the egg from scrambling.) Mix the tempered egg and the remaining warm milk into the macaroni and stir well until everything is evenly coated. Pour the contents of the bowl into the prepared baking pan, spreading the macaroni and sauce evenly. In a medium bowl, toss together the pancetta, Parmesan, panko and parsley, and sprinkle over the top of the macaroni. (This will create a yummy crust.)

Put the flour in a large bowl and add the salt and yeast, then add the olive oil plus enough warm water to make a soft but not sticky dough. The dough should feel quite loose and not tight and difficult to knead. If the whole amount is added it may appear that the dough is beyond repair, but gently kneading by way of scooping up the dough, scraping any sticky bits on the surface and slapping it back down again for a few minutes, will see the dough begin to become \pillowy\ and more manageable. The more water that can be added (the full 1 cup/9fl oz/250ml is great), then the lighter the bread will be. But it can take some perseverance. Also resist the temptation to add more flour, as it will make the dough too heavy. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes by hand on a lightly floured work surface or for 5 minutes if using an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. The dough will feel stretchy when pulled. To test if it is ready, make a ball with the dough then, using a well-floured finger, prod a shallow indent in the side (no more than 1/4in/3/4cm). If the indent disappears by way of the dough springing back, then it is ready to shape. If the indent stays, knead for a few minutes longer. Shape the dough into an oval and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten it out to about 12in (30cm) long and 8in (20cm) wide. Cover the dough loosely with oiled plastic wrap, making sure it is airtight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Leave the dough in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has almost doubled in size. With a floured index finger press holes in the dough at regular intervals, about 1 1/2in (4cm) apart in rows across the dough, pressing right down to the bottom. Take 1 1/4in (3cm) long sprigs of the rosemary and push them into the holes. Sprinkle some sea salt over the dough and place in the top third of the oven. Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the bread is well risen, light golden brown and feels hollow when tapped underneath. Remove from the oven, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and let cool on the baking sheet. This is totally awesome when served warm as a starter or indeed as a meal in itself with fresh tomatoes, artichokes, and cold meats, or with a steaming hot bowl of soup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 43805,&quot;Creamed Chipped Beef 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more if needed Two 8-ounce top sirloin steaks Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups sliced cremini mushrooms<br> 1/2 cup diced yellow onion<br> 3 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon English mustard, such as Coleman&#39;s 1 cup milk<br> 2/3 cup chicken broth<br> 1/2 cup stout beer or Madeira wine 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish 4 slices thick-cut country bread<br> Instructions: Heat the butter in a medium skillet set over medium-high heat.

After the grill has been brushed, run an oiled towel over the grill to pick up any loosened crud. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes and onions together with the rosemary, garlic, crushed red pepper, salt, to taste, and a little olive oil. Try to keep the onions together in rounds, they will fall apart while grilling but try and keep them together as long as possible; it just makes things easier. Arrange the potatoes and onions on the preheated grill. Once the potatoes have developed lovely grill marks, rotate them a quarter turn to create a lovely crosshatch pattern, (dont worry about the onions, they fall apart and you wont see the marks). Turn the potatoes over and repeat the process, turn the onions over to cook the other side as well. Cook the potatoes and onions until they are soft all the way through, about 8 to 10 minutes on each side. Remove from the grill and serve hot or at room temperature. Who knew you could grill a potato! &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 43808,&quot;Mushroom-Lamb Kofta 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the grill 6 ounces oyster mushrooms, trimmed and very finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound ground lamb (or use beef) 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 1/2 small onion, grated and squeezed dry 1 clove garlic, finely grated 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground sumac 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano Hummus, baba ghanoush, warmed pita, tabbouleh and/or plain yogurt, for serving Instructions: Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.

Place a medium pot of water on the stove to boil. While the grill heats and the water comes to a boil, prepare the Orange Vinaigrette, and set aside until needed. Trim the bottoms of the asparagus and cook for 30 seconds in the boiling water. Remove from the pot to a plate. Place the salmon fillets on a large plate and coat with 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Put the salmon fillets on the hottest part of the grill, starting with the skinless side down. Grill for about 5 to 10 minutes on each side, or until desired doneness. While the salmon is grilling, combine the salad greens, olives, oranges, onions, and half of the vinaigrette in a large bowl. Toss to combine. Divide the salad mixture evenly among 4 plates. When the salmon is nearly done, coat the asparagus with the remaining olive oil, salt, and pepper. Put the asparagus on the grill. Grill lightly, moving the spears around the heat frequently with tongs, for about 3 minutes. Remove the salmon and asparagus from the grill and distribute them evenly among the 4 plates on top of the greens mixture. Drizzle the remaining dressing over the salmon and serve. Zest the oranges with a zester or the fine side of a box grater. Finely chop the zest with a knife, then squeeze the juice out of the oranges into a small stainless steel bowl. Add the zest, shallots, brown sugar, and rice vinegar to the orange juice and whisk together. Slowly, in a steady stream, add the canola oil and extra-virgin olive oil while constantly whisking, until combined. Add the salt, pepper, and orange oil; the orange oil is strong, so just a very small amount is needed. Set the dressing aside while preparing the rest of the salad. *Boyajian Orange Oil is available at specialty food stores. Yield: 1 1/2 cups &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 43811,&quot;Flour Tortillas 1/3 cup lard 1/2 cup cool water 9 ounces all-purpose flour, plus 1/4 cup for kneading and rolling 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Combine 9 ounces flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 2 to 3 times. Add the lard to the flour mixture in 4 to 5 chunks and pulse 10 to 15 times until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. With the processor running, add the water in a steady stream just until a ball of dough begins to form, approximately 30 seconds. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of flour on a clean surface. Remove the dough from the bowl of the processor and knead until well incorporated and less sticky. Wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour. Evenly divide the dough into 8 pieces and form them into round balls. Roll each ball into 7-inch rounds with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Keep all of the dough balls covered with a tea towel. Heat an electric nonstick griddle to 375 degrees F. Put the tortillas, 2 to 3 at a time, onto the griddle and cook until light golden, about 4 minutes per side. Can be held for up to 2 hours, at room temperature, wrapped in a barely damp tea towel. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Microwave for 1 minute in the damp tea towel to reheat. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 43812,&quot;The Chef&#39;s Favorite Lemon Tart 1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 8 tablespoon cold unsalted butter 1 large egg yolk, beaten with 1 tablespoon milk 1 egg white, lightly beaten, reserved for baking 4 eggs 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/2 cup orange juice 1/2 cup lemon juice Zest of 1 lemon, grated Zest of 1 orange, grated 1/4 cup heavy cream Fresh berries Whipped cream Instructions: Preparation for the tart shell: In a food processor, pulse together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the egg yolk mixture and pulse just until the dough can be gathered into a ball. Flatten into a 6-inch disc, wrap in plastic, and chill several hours or overnight. Let the dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch round. Fit the dough into a 10 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Trim the dough flush with the rim and freeze the tart shell until firm. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the shell with foil or parchment and fill with pie weights, rice, or dried beans. Bake for 20 minutes until set. Remove the foil and weights and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes until lightly golden. Remove the shell from the oven and immediately brush the hot pastry with the egg white. Hint: When rolling tart pastry, always save all the dough scraps in case you need them to repair a crack in a partially baked shell. If the pastry \bubbles up\ during the baking process, gently prick the pastry with a fork to release air bubbles. Check several times and repeat if necessary. The egg white serves to seal the pastry, which is especially helpful with a liquid filling such as this. It is essential that there be no cracks or holes visible in the partially baked shell. Make any necessary repairs prior to filling. Preparation for the tart: When the pastry is almost done baking, assemble the filling. Whisk together the eggs, sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, lemon zest and orange zest and cream till smooth. Transfer the tart shell to the oven. Place the filling in a pitcher and slowly pour into the shell as high as possible without overfilling. There might be a bit of filling left over. Bake the tart for approximately 25 minutes, until the filling is barely set. Check the tart after 20 minutes and keep checking it every few minutes after that. It is crucial not to overbake this filling! Cool to room temperature before serving with berries and whipped cream.

Rinse the turkey inside and out and pat dry. Season the cavity with salt and pepper and set the bird on a rack in a roasting pan large enough to let air circulate all around. Rub the softened butter over the breast and legs and season with salt and pepper. Roast the turkey in the top third of the oven for about 30 minutes, or until beginning to brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees, cover the turkey loosely with foil and continue roasting, basting often, for about 1 1/2 hours, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 175 degrees. Transfer the turkey to a serving platter, cover again with foil, and let stand for at least 20 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, cut the turkey neck and gizzard in half. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan and add the neck, gizzard, heart and wing tips. Cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 7 minutes. Stir in the onion and celery and cook until golden. Add the wine and boil until reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Stir in the tomatoes, parsley, thyme and bay leaf and cook over very low heat until reduced to 3 1/2 cups, about 1 hour. Strain the turkey stock into a bowl; reserve 1 1/2 cups for the stuffing. 3. In a small bowl, mix the water with the flour until smooth. Remove the rack from the roasting pan and spoon off the fat. Set the pan over 2 burners on high heat. Add the remaining 2 cups of turkey stock and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the roasting pan.

Cook this roux, stirring frequently, until it is golden brown. Slowly whisk in the strained stock being careful to work out any lumps. Cook until the gravy has thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes. <em>Cook&#39;s note: Also add the backbone and neck from the turkey you are grilling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43848,&quot;Lemon Bars 1/2 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 cups flour 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 6 extra-large eggs at room temperature 3 cups granulated sugar 2 tablespoons grated lemon zest (4 to 6 lemons) 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 cup flour Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the crust, cream the butter and sugar until light in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Combine the flour and salt and, with the mixer on low, add to the butter until just mixed. Dump the dough onto a well-floured board and gather into a ball. Flatten the dough with floured hands and press it into a 9 by 13 by 2-inch baking sheet, building up a 1/2-inch edge on all sides. Chill. Bake the crust for 15 to 20 minutes, until very lightly browned. Let cool on a wire rack. Leave the oven on. For the filling, whisk together the eggs, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and flour.

Place them in a colander or kitchen towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Combine the potatoes in a bowl with the egg, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix well. Melt 2 tablespoons of clarified butter in a skillet. Drop a heaping tablespoon of the potato mixture into the sizzling butter. Flatten with a spatula and cook for 2 minutes. Turn, flatten again, and cook for another 2 minutes, until crisp on the outside and golden brown. Serve the pancakes hot from the skillet with a dollop of creme fraiche and a teaspoon of caviar. Note: To make 6 tablespoons of clarified butter, slowly melt 8 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan. Set it aside until the milk solids settle. Spoon off any solids that rise to the top and then carefully pour off the golden liquid, leaving the milky part in the bottom of the pan. Clarified butter has a higher burning temperature than melted butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43851,&quot;Sgroppino 1 cup lime sorbet 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1/2 cup vodka 1 bottle Champagne (or Prosecco) Lime slices, for garnish Instructions: In a blender add sorbet, cream, vodka and Champagne.

Melt the fat in a large saucepan over medium heat. Arrange the wings in a large deep baking dish and pour the fat on top, leaving about an inch of space in the baking dish (the fat will bubble). Cover with parchment paper, then tightly cover with foil. Transfer to the oven and bake 1 1/2 hours. (Carefully check on the wings after 30 minutes; they should be slightly bubbling. If they are vigorously bubbling, reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees F. If they are not bubbling at all, increase the oven temperature to 300 degrees F.) Remove from the oven and let the wings cool to room temperature in the fat; remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Refrigerate until cold, 30 minutes. Combine the three hot sauces, sambal oelek, mayonnaise and paprika in a large bowl. Fill a large pot with 3 inches of vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 385 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the wings until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.

In a mixing bowl, toss the potatoes with half of the melted butter. Divide potato mixture into 18 equal portions, making a small mound with each. Add the remaining melted butter to the skillet and heat. Carefully drop the mounds into the heated butter, and fry for about 5 minutes on each side, or until crispy. (Keep in mind that slow cooking is better than fast; hot rapid cooking may burn the potato cakes rather than crisp them). Remove potato cakes onto paper towels to drain. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the sauce, heat cider vinegar and shallots in a saucepan over medium heat. Reduce the vinegar by 2/3; the finished reduction should be as thick as syrup. Add the apple cider and reduce by half. Add the cream, turn the heat down to low, and simmer for 15 minutes. While cream is simmering, assemble potato cakes as follows: In an ovenproof dish, make 6 stacks, each 3 cakes-high, by starting each stack with a potato cake, topping it with a slice of goat cheese, placing a dollop of applesauce on the cheese, and continuing to layer the cakes, cheese, and applesauce until all the stacks are completed. Then place the dish in the oven for about 8 minutes to reheat. Just before serving, stir the mustard and 3 tablespoons chives into the sauce, and spoon a little onto each serving plate. Place a potato cake stack on top of the sauce, and finish each stack with another dollop of applesauce.

Put a half sheet pan in the oven to heat for 15 minutes. Trim the woody ends and halve the squash crosswise. Scoop out the squash seeds, leaving a 1/2-inch shell. Reserve the flesh. Brush the cut sides of the squash with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Arrange the squash, cut side down, onto the preheated pan and roast until the squash is tender and the flesh side is browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer the squash to a serving platter and set aside. Meanwhile, finely chop the reserved squash flesh. Heat a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat and add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. When the oil shimmers add the chopped squash, shallot, garlic, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the corn, limas, pecans, and thyme. Cook until heated through, approximately 1 minute.

Cut the catfish into fingers. Set aside. Finely grind the pecans into crumbs in a food processor. Cook&#39;s Note: Do not over process the nuts or they will become too oily, like a nut butter, and unsuitable to use as a breading. Add the pecan crumbs to a casserole dish. Measure the buttermilk in a 1-cup liquid measure. Add the egg and beat well together. Pour into an 8 by 8-inch casserole dish. Add the panko, garlic powder, cayenne, salt and pepper, to taste, to the pecan crumbs in the casserole dish. Whisk together to combine. Set up an assembly line. Dredge catfish through the buttermilk mixture, then through the pecan mixture. You may need to press the pecans into the catfish to adhere. Add the catfish fingers to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove to a paper towel lined sheet tray to drain.

Cut off the top 1/3 of the lemon and reserve to cap the cups. Carefully hollow out each lemon with a teaspoon, turning and digging into the pith so the entire inside of the fruit comes out, take care to leave the lemon shell intact. Chop and mash the lemon pulp and strain into a blender. (You should have about 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, reserve it for the filling.) Freeze the lemon cups in egg cartons, with their lids, at least 1 hour or up to overnight. The frozen shell will prevent the lemon ice from melting too quickly when you serve it. To make the ginger syrup: Combine the sugar, water, and ginger in a pot over medium heat. Gently simmer and stir for 2 minutes until the sugar is dissolved and the ginger fragrant - do not allow the syrup to boil or get dark. Remove from heat, cover, and steep until cool. Fill a blender with crushed ice, pour in the reserved cup of fresh lemon juice, add the ginger syrup (remove the big pieces of ginger), and process until slushy. Add the lemon zest and blend again. Freeze for 1 hour to firm it up a bit. Scoop the lemon ginger ice into the prepared lemon cups, garnish with mint leaves, top with the lemon cap, and serve. Serve in egg cups for a great presentation. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 43866,&quot;Custardy Apple Squares 3 medium juicy, sweet apples, such as Gala orFuji, peeled 1/2 cup (68 grams) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1/3 cup (67 grams) sugar Pinch of fine sea salt 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 6 tablespoons whole milk at room temperature 2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 28 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting (optional) Instructions: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan.<br> Slice the apples from top to bottom using a mandoline, Benriner or a sharp knife, turning the fruit as you reach the core. The slices should be about 1/16 inch thick-elegantly thin, but not so thin that they&#39;re transparent and fragile. Discard the cores.<br> Whisk the flour and baking powder together in a small bowl.<br> Working in a large bowl with a whisk, beat the eggs, sugar and salt together for about 2 minutes, until the sugar just about dissolves and, more important, the eggs are pale. Whisk in the vanilla, followed by the milk and melted butter. Turn the flour into the bowl and stir with the whisk until the batter is smooth. Add the apples to the bowl, switch to a flexible spatula and gently fold the apples into the batter, turning everything around until each thin slice is coated in batter. Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth the top as evenly as you can-it will be bumpy; that&#39;s its nature.<br> Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden brown, uniformly puffed- make sure the middle of the cake has risen-and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.

To a food processor, add the coconut milk, curry paste, ginger, brown sugar, garlic, habanero, egg and brioche. Process until smooth. Mix the bread-egg mixture into the ground chicken until combined and then form into large meatballs. Add the meatballs and vegetable oil to a pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Turn the meatballs over and place the top on the pressure cooker. Cook under pressure for 5 minutes. For the yellow curry sauce: In a large saute pan over high heat, simmer the coconut milk with the peppers, curry paste, brown sugar, ginger, garlic and 1 cup hot water until thickened and the peppers are tender. When the desired consistency is reached, add the basil and cilantro but do not stir through. For the pickled corn: Cut the kernels off the corn cobs and combine them in a bowl with the calamansi vinegar, brown sugar and 1/2 cup hot water. Allow to marinate for 20 minutes. For the crunchy spaghetti squash: Drop the spaghetti squash cubes into a pot of boiling water and bring to a simmer. Cook for 3 minutes, until the squash is just barely soft. Drain and shock with cold water to slow down carryover cooking. Drain again. Scrape the squash flesh from the peel using your fingers; it should feel crunchy. Salt the flesh and let sit for 2 minutes before squeezing out the water (so the squash is even more crunchy). For the toasted coconut: Fry some flaked coconut in a skillet with oil until golden brown, about 90 seconds. Drain on paper towels. To plate: Spoon spaghetti squash in the center of a shallow entre-size bowl. Top with a meatball, then ladle curry sauce over the meatball and scatter pickled corn and fried coconut over the plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 43868,&quot;Sweet Vegetable Saute 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 medium onions, sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 large zucchini, sliced in half lengthwise, then thinly sliced into half circles 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence (or just basil, oregano, and marjoram) Instructions: In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions, season with salt and cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring to avoid any burning. Add the zucchini, herbes de Provence, and salt, and pepper, to taste and cook an additional 5 minutes, using a wooden spoon or spatula to keep the vegetables from overbrowning. Reduce the heat to low, add a little more oil if needed and let cook for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Allow the butter to cool to room temperature. It should appear milky and should be pourable and warm to the touch. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the cold water. Place the flour, salt, sugar, milk, and melted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Set the mixer on medium speed and mix just until the ingredients are dispersed, about 5 seconds. Add the dissolved yeast and beat on medium-high speed until the dough is well combined and no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute.<br> If the dough is too soft, add more flour, one tablespoon at a time until it is firmer. (The dough is too soft when it cannot hold its shape.) If the dough is too hard, add cold water one tablespoon at a time until it has softened. (The dough is too hard when it is difficult to mix in the mixer.)<br> Remove the dough from the mixing bowl. If the dough is slightly sticky and ropy, knead it with your hands for about 30 seconds, until it is smooth. Pat it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and let it proof at room temperature for about 30 minutes. (This will start the fermentation process).<br> Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll it out to an 8 by 15-inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Wrap the rectangle in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. The cold retards the rising process, which allows for a slow fermentation. A slow fermentation helps develop the flavor of the dough.<br> Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap the rectangle, and place it with a long side facing you on a lightly floured work surface. Spread the softened butter evenly over the right two thirds of the dough. I like to use a large offset spatula to do this. Incorporate the butter by folding the (butterless) left third of the dough over the center, then fold the right third of the dough to the left. Now it should resemble a folded letter.<br> Roll this out into another 10 by 30-inch rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Give the dough a book fold, or double fold, by folding each short end to the middle so they meet but do not overlap. Then fold one half over the other half and, if necessary, rotate the dough so that the seam is on your right. (This process is called a book fold because the folded dough resembles a book and a double fold because the dough is folded onto itself two times.)<br> Wrap the folded dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours. (At this stage I usually let the dough rest overnight and finish it in the morning.)<br> The following procedure is the final step before you form the croissants or pain au chocolat. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap it, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll it into a 10 x 30-inch rectangle and turn it so a long side faces you. Give the dough a single fold by folding the left third of the dough over the center. Then fold the right third of the dough to the left. Now the dough should resemble a folded letter.<br> Wrap in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough into a 10 by 36-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Keep the thickness even and the edges straight. This will make it easier to cut the croissants or pain au chocolat.<br> These puff pastry items are best eaten the day they are made. Follow instructions for basic dough, above.<br> With a sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut the dough into 3 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch rectangles. Lay each rectangle on a lightly floured work surface, with a long side facing you, and place about 1/2 tablespoon of the chopped chocolate in the upper third of each one. Fold that third of the dough over the chocolate.<br> Place about another 1/2 tablespoon of the chocolate along one seam of the folded dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough over the chocolate. (At this stage, they can be frozen for up to one week if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Thaw on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet overnight in the refrigerator before proceeding.)<br> Turn over the pain au chocolat so the seams face down. This will keep them from opening as they bake. Place them on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet; they will get bigger as they proof and bake, so space them about 2 inches apart. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and allow the pain au chocolat to proof at room temperature until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air, 1 1/2 to 3 hours depending on the temperature of the room and of the dough.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Make an egg wash by whisking together the egg yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small bowl until well combined. With a pastry brush, very gently coat the croissants or pain au chocolat completely with egg wash. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. I love to eat both of them fresh out of the oven. If you have any leftovers, they can be stored in the freezer if well wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 2 weeks. Thaw at room temperature and warm in the oven before serving. Follow instructions for basic dough, above.<br> Use a sharp chef&#39;s knife to cut out triangles with a 2 1/2-inch base and 10-inch sides. Lay each triangle on a lightly floured work surface with the tip facing you. Gently pull the tip toward you; this light stretch adds layers to the finished croissant without adding density. Use the palms of your hands to roll each triangle up from the base to the tip. (At this stage, they can be frozen for up to one week if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Thaw on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet overnight in the refrigerator before proceeding.)<br> Place the rolled croissants on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. The croissants will get bigger as they proof and bake, so space them about 2 inches apart. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap. This keeps the croissants from developing a skin while proofing and traps the heat released during fermentation, which helps them to rise. Allow the croissants to proof at room temperature until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air; this can take anywhere from 1 1/2 to 3 hours depending on the temperature of the room and of the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 43870,&quot;Roasted Breast of Duck with Foie Gras and Leek Stuffing 1 whole duck 1 pinch ground black pepper 2 ounces duck liver foie gras, cleaned 1 ounce leeks, chopped 1 tablespoon butter 1/4 teaspoon rosemary 1/4 teaspoon thyme leaves 1/4 teaspoon sage 1 ounce apple brandy 2 ounces heavy cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To bone, place duck breast up and remove the flap of skin covering the wishbone. Scrape along the wishbone with the back of a paring knife to expose the bone. Reach in with index finger and thumb to remove the wishbone by pulling it out, being careful not to tear the meat. Make incision along the breastbone and from breastbone down to rib cage. Follow rib cage to thigh and wing joints and carefully cut through thigh and wing joints leaving wing attached to breast. Separate the breast from the thigh and leg. Remove the wing at the middle joint and cut the end of the attached wing bone square. Push the meat on the wing down toward the breast, cleaning the bone with a paring knife. Push the meat on the bones of the thigh and leg, leaving the leg bone attached to the meat at the drum end. Square off the end of the drumstick with a French knife. Remove the thigh and the thighbone. Repeat for other half of duck. (Note: you may use boneless duck breasts if limited on time.) Lay breasts skin side down, clean the excess skin, and shape into teardrops with a boning knife. From the thick end, pierce the breast directly beneath the skin, straight in to the tip of the breast, making a pocket. Be careful not to poke through the flesh while making pocket. Pocket should extend the length of the breast. In a saucepan, saute the leeks in the butter until tender. Add the herbs and carefully deglaze the pan with apple brandy. Add 1 ounce of cream, reduce until thickened, and cool. In a meat grinder, grind the thigh meat and liver through the fine die. Using a food processor, process until smooth. Add remaining cream, and mix well. Add leek mixture, and season, to taste. Using a pastry bag, pipe approximately 2 tablespoons of forcemeat into each duck breast pocket. Plug the end of the pocket with the tender. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brown duck breast in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, skin-side down, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn duck breast over, place in the oven, and cook until desired temperature is reached. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 43871,&quot;Nicaraguan-Style Churrasco 6 cloves garlic 3 bay leaves 2 jalapeno chiles, with seeds, coarsely chopped 1 1/2 tablespoons salt 1/2 cup finely minced fresh curly parsley 1/2 cup finely minced fresh flat-leaf parsley 1/4 cup finely minced fresh oregano 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 (5-pound) whole beef tenderloin Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To make the chimichurri, combine the garlic, bay leaves, jalapenos, and salt in a mortar and mash with a pestle until a smooth paste is formed (or you can puree with a small amount of vinegar in a blender). Transfer to a mixing bowl and add the parsleys and oregano. Whisk in the vinegar and olive oil until well combined. Set aside. Prepare a medium-hot fire in the grill. Trim the meat and remove any silverskin. Cut into 2 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Take the boning knife and cut in a circular motion so each round becomes one flat, long strip. Then, with a butcher&#39;s mallet, pound the meat lightly. Season each strip generously with salt and pepper on each side. Lightly oil the grate and place meat on the grate. Grill for 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Transfer the meat to a serving plate. Serve with the chimichurri on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 43872,&quot;Fusilli with Pea Pesto and Smoked Mozzarella Kosher salt 1 pound fusilli pasta 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 large shallot, chopped 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio 2 1/2 cups frozen peas, thawed 4 ounces smoked mozzarella, rind removed, grated (1 cup) 1 packed cup baby spinach leaves 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, from 1/2 a large lemon Zest of 1 large lemon 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted, coarsely chopped Instructions: For the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

Lay it skin side down in a single layer in a large dish and sprinkle with salt and lemon juice. Set aside for 15 minutes. Line a fine mesh sieve with a double layer of cheesecloth or a coffee filter, set over a bowl, and pour in the yogurt. Let it drain for 15 minutes or longer. Scrape the yogurt into a small bowl. Add the grated garlic, ginger, black pepper, ground coriander, ground cumin, garam masala, saffron (if using), dried fenugreek leaves, and butter. Mix well. In a clean coffee or spice grinder, powder the almonds, cashews, coconut, pistachios, and fennel seeds. Mix into the spiced yogurt. Drain the liquid accumulated at the bottom of the fillets, then smear the spiced yogurt marinade all over the fleshy side of the fish. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Just before grilling, sprinkle the breadcrumbs all over the fish and pat gently to hold in place. When ready to grill, place the fish skin side down in a covered barbecue over medium heat. Grill until the bottom is well cooked, about 10 minutes. Flip carefully and cook for another 10 minutes or until it is cooked through. Remove to a platter and sprinkle with lemon juice. Split the fillet down the center and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 43878,&quot;Parmesan, Black Pepper and Rosemary Cheese Straws 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 cup finely shredded gruyere cheese 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian parsley 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper 1 large egg 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounce package), thawed Flour, for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> In a small bowl, toss together the cheeses, herbs and cracked black pepper. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture.<br> In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg with 2 teaspoons water to make an egg wash.<br> Roll the puff pastry out on a floured surface to a rectangle about 12-by-10 1/2 inches. Brush the entire surface with egg wash. Cut the pastry in half crosswise forming 2 rectangles. Sprinkle the herb cheese mixture over one rectangle and top with the other. Using the rolling pin, roll the pastry just to help the 2 rectangles adhere. Using a pizza wheel or a sharp knife, cut the layered pastry into 1/2-inch-wide strips; you&#39;ll get about 24. Twist each strip and transfer it to a prepared baking sheet, pinching each of the ends tightly, spacing the strips about 2 inches apart from one another.

Season generously with salt. Heat the olive oil, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic and spring onions in a large saute pan and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the white wine and allow it to reduce, about 1 minute. Add the cream, then let come to a simmer and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to thicken. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook to al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Fresno to the sauce and simmer for another minute. Turn off the heat, then stir the crab and lemon juice into the sauce. Strain the pasta directly into the sauce and gently stir to marry the sauce with the pasta. (Save a little pasta water just in case, to thin the sauce if needed.) Add the butter, dill, parsley, tarragon and salt to taste; the sauce should begin to glaze the pasta. Once thickened, remove the pan from the heat and season with salt and pepper. If the pasta is too thick, add a splash of reserved pasta water. Sprinkle with Parmesan and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Combine the flour and salt in a bowl and mix. Place the flour in a mound on a clean work surface. Make a well in the center of the flour. Crack the eggs into the well. Using a fork, whisk the eggs and add the oil. Slowly and carefully mix the flour into the eggs with the fork, making sure not to break through the walls of the flour mound. Once the eggs are incorporated into the flour and a dough starts to form, you can use your hands to incorporate the remaining flour and knead it into a dough. Once the dough is formed, knead for about 5 minutes. (You can also make the dough in a stand mixer.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 45 minutes to an hour. On a floured work surface, roll the dough with a rolling pin into a rectangle that is about 1/8-inch thick. Lightly flour the top, then gently roll up the dough into a log. Slice into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Unravel and lay out the fettucine on a lightly floured sheet pan. (You can also run the dough through a pasta machine per the manufacturer&#39;s instructions.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 43880,&quot;Holiday Sausage Strata 1 pound breakfast or Italian sausage, removed from casing 4 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature 14 to 16 slices (1/2-inch thick) French/Italian bread, left out overnight or toasted<br> 12 ounces Gruyere, shredded<br> 2 cups half-and-half<br> 12 large eggs<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> Cracked black pepper<br> 3 cups broccoli florets with about 1 1/2 inches of stalk remaining<br> 1 cup grated Parmesan<br> Instructions: In a skillet, cook the sausage over medium-high heat, crumbling it with a spoon, until mostly brown but still a little pink, about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel; reserve the sausage fat separately. Butter both sides of the bread with the butter. Arrange half of the bread in 1 layer in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Top with half the sausage, followed by half the Gruyere. Repeat with another layer of the remaining bread, sausage and cheese. In a bowl, whisk together the half-and-half, eggs, 2 teaspoons of the salt and some pepper. Pour the mixture over the layers of bread, sausage and cheese. Cover in plastic wrap and weigh down the strata with a couple sacks of rice/beans in a zipper top bag to compress it. Refrigerate overnight. The morning of baking, remove the plastic wrap and weights. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Toss the broccoli with the reserved sausage fat, remaining 1 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Dot the top of the strata with the broccoli florets so the broccoli tops are still visible (to look like trees) but the stalks are submerged in the custard. Bake until the edges pull away from the dish and the center is puffed, about 45 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes. Right before serving, sprinkle with the Parmesan to mimic snow on trees. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43881,&quot;Spiced Aioli 1 cup mayonnaise 3 tablespoons roasted garlic 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley 1 tablespoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco 1 teaspoon white balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground white pepper Instructions: Puree the mayonnaise, roasted garlic, chives, parsley, hot sauce, vinegar, salt and pepper in a food processor. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43882,&quot;Spiced Pumpkin and Sweet Potato Bisque 2 cups canned pumpkins 3 cooked sweet potatoes 1 cup heavy cream 2 cups vegetable base 1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cardamon 1 pinch Cayenne 1/4 cup Roasted Chestnuts 2 oz. chives 2 teaspoon honey Instructions: Peel sweet potatoes and puree in machine; strain and add cooked pumpkin and 1 cup heavy cream and bring to a boil in a medium saucepan.

Put the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the granulated sugar and whisk to combine. Add the butter and shortening to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to work the fats into the flour mixture until pea-size lumps form. Sprinkle the ice water onto the mixture 1 tablespoon at a time, using your hands to pull the dough together, until the dough becomes just sticky enough to form a ball; you may not need all the ice water. Press the dough into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough to chill for a minimum of 1 hour. This step can be done several days in advance. When ready to bake the pie, pull the dough out of the refrigerator and rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Sprinkle the counter and rolling pin with additional flour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the filling: Set a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and heat until melted. Cook until the bubbles subside and the butter is light brown and smells like toasted nuts, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and sprinkle the brown sugar over the butter. Add the cinnamon and salt and stir to combine. Cook until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes more. Pour in the spiced rum and honey and stir until incorporated. Add the peaches to the sauce and sprinkle with the cornstarch. Carefully stir the peaches to coat in the brown butter sauce. Let cool for 5 minutes. While the filling is cooling, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle that is about 1/8 inch thick. Gently lay the pie dough circle over the peaches, working carefully as the skillet will still be warm. If the dough is hanging over the edge, trim it with kitchen shears. Moving around the rim of the dough circle, tuck the edge of the dough into the skillet. Using a paring knife, vent the top of the pie by cutting a few small slits in the dough. For the topping: Gently brush the dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle evenly with the demerara sugar. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is hot and bubbly, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43884,&quot;Baked Brie Bites All-purpose flour, for dusting 2 frozen puff pastry sheets (from a 17.3-ounce box), thawed<br> 12 ounces brie cheese, cut into twenty-four 1-inch squares 1/2 cup candied pecans, chopped<br> 12 small red grapes, halved<br> Freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg, beaten Instructions: Lightly flour a work surface and roll out both puff pastry sheets into 12-inch squares. Lay half of 1 sheet over a 12-compartment ice cube tray (the other half of the sheet will hang off the tray) and gently use the back of your fingers (or the handle of a wooden spoon) to press the pastry down into each compartment of the tray. Repeat with the remaining pastry sheet and a second ice cube tray. Fill each ice cube compartment with 1 piece of brie, 1 teaspoon pecans, 1 red grape half and a pinch of black pepper. Brush the top of the pastry that is hanging off the ice cube tray with egg and fold it over the compartments to cover the fillings. Trim the excess pastry around the edges of the tray, then press the dough together with your fingers to seal. Freeze the ice cube trays for 15 minutes. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F.<br> Use your fingers to gently loosen the puff pastry from the ice cube trays then flip out onto a cutting board. Cut in between each brie bite to separate. Use a fork to crimp the edges of each bite.<br> Line a large baking sheet with parchment. Put the bites on the baking sheet, brush the egg on the tops and sprinkle with pepper. Bake, rotating the baking sheet about halfway through, until the brie bites are puffed and golden brown, about 25 minutes.

Saute onions and bacon until the bacon is crispy and the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add brown sugar and stir. When that is well blended into a lumpy sticky mess, add the beer. Let this reduce for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes thick and syrupy. Add a pinch of salt and several turns of fresh cracked pepper. Add balsamic vinegar and combine well. Combine the spinach, cucumber, bell pepper, and Gorgonzola in a bowl. Pour hot dressing over the salad, toss, and serve immediately. Measure out all grains using a scale. Run the grain through a mill to crack the husk and release the starch; a supplier can do this. In a 6 to 10 gallon boiling pot, with screen in bottom, also known as a false bottom, add the gypsum to 2 1/2 gallons of water preheated to 168 degrees F. Pour crushed grains and wheat into the water and stir until mixed thoroughly. Cover the pot and let stand for about one hour periodically checking the to be sure it stays between 146 to 152 degrees F.

Bring to a gentle boil and cook until the berries begin to burst, about 5 minutes. Stir together the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl, then whisk into the berries. Bring to a boil to thicken the sauce, mashing with a wooden spoon or whisk. Pour into a container and let cool, then refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 hours. For the crumble topping: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the flour, oats, pecans, granulated sugar, brown sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Scatter in the butter pieces and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the heavy cream and egg yolks and pulse a few times just to combine.

Add desired mix-ins and blend again to incorporate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 43891,&quot;Pear Chocolate Upside-Down Cake 1 cup water 1/2 cup brandy 2 to 3 fresh pears, ripe but still firm Canola oil 1/4 cup cake flour 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder 3 eggs, at room temperature 5 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons melted butter 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: For the pears: In a skillet, bring 1 cup of water and the brandy to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Peel the pears with a vegetable peeler, cut in half lengthwise and remove the core, the stem and the fibers that run down the center. Slice lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices and add to the simmering brandy mixture. (Add enough hot water to cover the pears, if necessary.) Poach for about 10 minutes, remove from heat and let cool to room temperature while you are preparing the batter. For the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Oil the bottom of a 9 by 2-inch deep round pan and lay parchment paper over the bottom. Then brush a thin layer of canola oil on top of the parchment paper. Sift cake flour and cocoa powder together several times to aerate. In a separate heatproof bowl combine the eggs and sugar. Nest the bowl with the sugar and eggs in another larger bowl filled with about 2-inches hot water. Whisk together the eggs and sugar, being very careful not to splash any water into it. The idea here is to raise the temperature of the egg and sugar mixture to between 100 and 120 degrees F. Use a candy thermometer to test the temperature. Once the mixture is warmed, remove the bowl from the water bowl and use an electric beater to beat it until it is about triple in volume and is the consistency of soft whipped cream. Sift the 1/3 of the flour and cocoa powder into the bowl of beaten eggs and sugar, and fold together. Repeat for each remaining 1/3 of the flour mixture, folding together after each addition. Then, gently fold in the melted butter and vanilla. Drain the pear slices and arrange them in the bottom of the cake pan. Overlap them in a pattern of concentric circles. Pour batter over layer of pears, spreading evenly, but don&#39;t fill pan any more than within 1/2-inch of the top edge of the pan. Bang pan on countertop - 1 or 2 times only - to make sure the batter sinks down between the pears, but don&#39;t overdo it or you will undo all your hard work in aerating the batter! Bake in oven until the surface springs back when touched and a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cake cool in pan 10 minute to allow set up, then using oven mitts, press a serving plate firmly on the top edges of the pan, and invert the cake onto the plate. Replace any pear slices that become dislodged. This cake can be served warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 43892,&quot;Grilled Tuscan Porterhouse with White Bean-Grilled Shiitake Mushroom Salad 1/4 cup extra virgin olive 1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped rosemary 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic 1 (3 pound) porterhouse steak Kosher salt 4 shiitake mushroom caps Olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 cups warm white beans, cooked or canned rinsed and drained and heated 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 3 tablespoons chopped chives 3 plum tomatoes, finely diced 4 tablespoons lemon juice 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Combine all the ingredients in a medium baking dish. Add the steak and toss to coat. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours or up to 2 days. Bring steak to room temperature before grilling. Preheat grill. Remove steak from marinade and wipe off any excess and season with salt to taste. Sear the steak for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Close the grill and continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes for medium-rare. Let rest for 10 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Preheat grill. Brush mushrooms with some of the oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side, remove and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Place the warm beans in a large bowl, add mushrooms, herbs and tomatoes. Whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil and garlic and pour over the beans. Add the cheese and season with salt and pepper to taste. Yield: 8 servings &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 43893,&quot;Chicken Under a Brick One 3- to 4-pound chicken Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 6 cloves garlic, crushed with skin on 4 to 5 sprigs fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme and sage 4 to 5 sprigs fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme and sage<br> 1 lemon, quartered Instructions: Spatchcock the chicken: Use kitchen shears to cut out the backbone from the chicken. Lay the chicken breast-side down on a cutting board and use a large knife to cut through the breastbone. Push the chicken down to flatten it out. Cut the wings off at the third joint (at the wing tip). Now locate the thigh bone. Use a small and sharp knife to cut the flesh off away from the bone, working all the way down to the joint. Once you&#39;re at the joint, bend the thigh bone back until you hear it pop and use your knife again to help remove the thigh bone completely. Repeat with the remaining thigh bone. Turn the chicken over, blot it dry and refrigerate on a large plate or baking sheet, uncovered, overnight to dry out the skin (this will help make it extra crispy). If you have to skip this step, then dry the chicken as best you can with paper towels and refrigerate, uncovered, for as long as you can. Sprinkle the chicken generously on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large 12-inch cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Lay the chicken, skin-side down, in the skillet. Add the garlic and herbs to the skillet. Now use either 2 bricks wrapped in foil or another heavy, slightly smaller skillet filled with large cans (tomato cans work nicely) directly on top of the chicken. Cook, leaving the chicken mostly undisturbed, checking every once in a while to make sure the skin is browning evenly and not getting too dark too quickly, and adjusting the heat as needed, until almost all of the meat is white (except for the very top of the breast) and the skin is a deep golden brown and crispy, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the bricks or weighted skillet and turn the chicken over using tongs and/or a spatula, being careful not to rip the skin. Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 165 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes more. Remove the chicken and let rest for a few minutes before carving. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 43894,&quot;Escabeche of Trout 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided 4 6 to 8 ounce small whole trout, head-on, scaled, gutted and rinsed 1/3 cup olive oil 1 medium red onion, julienned 3 cloves garlic, sliced 6 sprigs fresh thyme 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 1 1/2 cups dry white wine 1/2 cup white wine vinegar 3 strips lemon zest, approximately 3 by 1-inch Instructions: Combine the flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper in a gallon zip-top bag. Pat the trout dry and toss to coat in the bag with the seasoned flour. Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch saute pan set over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Carefully add the trout to the pan. Cook on each side for 1 minute. Using tongs or a fish spatula, transfer the trout to a 13 by 9-inch glass baking dish. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion, and cook until translucent, approximately 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute. Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, thyme, coriander, paprika, white wine, vinegar, and lemon zest. Decrease the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour the marinade over the trout. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve cool or at room temperature with the sauce and onions. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 12 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 43895,&quot;Pound Cake Cut-Out Sandwiches with Strawberry Whipped Cream 1 store-bought loaf pound cake 1 cup heavy whipping cream<br> 3 tablespoons powdered sugar<br> 1/2 cup diced strawberries<br> 2 tablespoons mini chocolate chips<br> Instructions: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Slice the pound cake into 1/2-inch slices, and use the cookie cutters to cut out a shape in each slice.

Pour the beans into a 9-by-14-inch glass baking dish. Bake until bubbly and slightly brown around the edges, about 25 minutes. Top the beans with an even layer of Pig Candy, then an even layer of the crispy wontons, then an even layer of Pickled Red Onion. Finally, garnish with scallion greens and sesame seeds. Serve as a side dish or as a main course with steamed rice! Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Fit a baking sheet with a wire rack and spray with vegetable oil spray. Put the brown sugar in a pie dish. Gently press each slice of bacon into the sugar until coated (there can be patches of uncoated bacon; it does not need to be 100 percent coated). Work quickly, as the brown sugar can compromise the moisture of the bacon and impede caramelization. Put the coated bacon on the wire rack. Bake, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until super crispy and golden, 50 to 60 minutes depending on the oven and thickness of the bacon. Remove from the sheet to prevent sticking and let cool on a new surface. Bring the vinegar, sugar, salt and 1/2 cup water to a simmer in a saucepan. Add the onions and take off the heat immediately. Let cool in the pickling liquid.

Scoop out the seeds and cut into bite-size (1-inch) pieces. In a wok, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and whole spices and stir-fry for a few seconds. Add the squash and stir-fry for a minute. Season with both soy sauces and stir-fry for another minute. Add the water and stir to combine. Cover with a wok lid and cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. (Add more water if necessary to keep the squash from sticking to the sides of the wok.) Once the squash is tender, remove the lid and season with the brown sugar and Chinese five-spice. Toss the squash with the seasonings and allow the sauce to thicken a bit, about another minute. Remove from the heat, toss in the cilantro and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 43932,&quot;Reverse-Seared Instant Pot Prime Rib and Gravy One 4-pound boneless prime rib roast 3 large cloves garlic, quartered lengthwise<br> 1 sprig rosemary<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/4 cups low-sodium beef broth, plus more as needed for thinning the gravy<br> 1/2 cup dry red wine<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 2 tablespoons chopped soft herbs, such as chives, parsley or chervil Instructions: Make 4 evenly spaced small slits about 1/2 inch deep on the top of the roast with a small paring knife. Put a few rosemary leaves on top of each slit and push them in using a piece of garlic. Repeat on the other side of the roast. Make two slits on the ends of the roast and stuff with the remaining rosemary and garlic. Combine 5 teaspoons salt and 1 tablespoon pepper in a small bowl and stir to combine. Sprinkle all over the roast, firmly pressing the mixture onto the exterior and stuffing some into the slits.<br> Place the trivet in the bottom of the insert of a 6-quart Instant Pot?. Pour in the beef broth and 1/4 cup of the wine. Place the roast on the trivet, fat-side up, then set it to pressure cook on low for 10 minutes with the keep warm feature turned on (see Cook&#39;s Note). Once the pressure cook cycle ends let the pot stand, closed, for 45 minutes. Open the lid and transfer the roast to a plate. Remove the trivet and pour the broth into a heatproof container. Rinse the insert and return it to the machine.<br> Set the machine to saut and add the butter. Once the butter is melted and foamy add the roast and sear until dark brown on all sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers 120 degrees F for medium rare, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the roast to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes before slicing.<br> Meanwhile, immediately add the remaining 1/4 cup wine to the insert, scraping up the browned bits that are stuck to the bottom. Continue to cook until almost all the wine has evaporated then sprinkle in the flour. Stir until a uniform paste forms then whisk in the reserved broth. Bring to a boil and simmer until the flavor of the flour has cooked out, about 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning, if needed, and whisk in a bit more beef broth if the gravy becomes too thick. Strain through a mesh strainer into a gravy boat and stir in the herbs right before serving.

Place the salmon skin-side down on a piece of nonstick aluminum foil on a baking sheet or a cedar plank that was soaked in water for 1 to 2 hours. In a zigzag motion, drizzle the liquid smoke over the flesh of the salmon and brush it in; let rest 5 minutes. Season the salmon with salt. For the rub: In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cl flakes, salt and pepper. Gently pour the seasoning blend over the entire top of the salmon, patting it into the flesh evenly. Let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. Preheat the oven or a grill to 300 degrees F. Drizzle the olive oil over the salmon. Place the salmon on the foil directly onto the grill or in the oven (or the salmon on the plank). Cook until medium rare, 20 to 25 minutes, depending on the size. For the easy salad: In a large bowl, toss the lettuce, onion and lemon juice. Sprinkle lightly with salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Rest for a few minutes, then drizzle over the olive oil and toss again. Remove the salmon from the skin and flake over the salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 43936,&quot;Vegetable Coleslaw 1 pound white cabbage (1/2 small head) 3/4 pound red cabbage (1/2 small head) 5 carrots 2 cups good mayonnaise 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 teaspoons celery seeds 1 teaspoon celery salt 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Fit a food processor with the thickest slicing blade. Cut the cabbages into small wedges and place horizontally into the feed tube. Process in batches. Next, fit the food processor with the grating blade. Cut the carrots in half and place in the feed tube so they are lying on their sides. Process in batches and mix in a bowl with the grated cabbages. In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, sugar, vinegar, celery seeds, celery salt, salt, and pepper. Pour enough of the dressing over the grated vegetables to moisten them. Serve cold or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43937,&quot;Har Gow 1 tablespoon baking soda 1 pound peeled and deveined small shrimp (51/60), tails removed 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons tapioca starch Kosher salt 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 2 tablespoons lard or neutral oil 1 1/4 cups wheat starch, plus more for dusting Instructions: Fill a large bowl with 6 cups of cold water and whisk in the baking soda until dissolved. Add the shrimp to the bowl, lightly massage it in the baking soda water and let soak for 30 minutes. Drain the shrimp, rinse under cold running water, drain again and pat dry with paper towels. Finely chop 1/4 cup of the shrimp to a paste and add to a large bowl. Coarsely chop the remaining shrimp into 1/2-inch pieces and transfer to the same bowl. Add the sugar, chicken bouillon powder, white pepper, 2 teaspoons of the tapioca starch and 1/2 teaspoon salt and mix in one direction until streaks form on the side of the bowl, about 1 minute. Mix in the toasted sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of the lard until incorporated. Refrigerate until needed. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Bring 1 cup cold water to a boil in a small pot. Meanwhile, sift the wheat starch and remaining 1/3 cup tapioca starch with a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl. Stir 1/2 teaspoon salt into the boiling water until dissolved, then slowly pour over the wheat starch mixture and mix with a wooden spoon or chopsticks. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon of lard and knead until incorporated. Lightly dust a work surface with wheat starch and turn out the dough onto it. Knead the dough until smooth. Divide in half and roll each piece into a 15-inch log. Cut each log into 1-inch pieces and cover the dough pieces with a damp paper towel or lint-free kitchen towel. Working with one piece of dough at a time, dust the dough with some wheat starch, press into a 2-inch circle and then roll out into a thin 3- to 3 1/2-inch circle, keeping the edges thinner than the center. Put the dough circle in front of you and place a scant tablespoon of the shrimp filling in the center of it. Starting at the right edge of the circle at the \u201c3-o&#39;clock\u201d position, make small pleats counterclockwise along the edge until you reach the \9-o &#39;clock\u201d position (the goal is around 8 pleats for good luck). Fold up the dough edge closest to you and attach it to the inside edge of the pleats to close up the opening. Pinch to seal and press lightly to thin out the edge. Place the har gow on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Fill a 12-inch skillet or wok with about 2 inches of water and place a 10-inch bamboo or metal steamer basket in the skillet. Make sure the water doesn\u2019t touch the bottom of the insert. If it does, remove some of it. Bring the water to a rolling boil, line the steamer basket with a perforated parchment circle and place 10 har gow into the steamer basket, leaving about an inch between each. Cover and steam until the filling is bright orange and the wrappers are translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool for a minute to set the skin, then enjoy while warm. Continue with the remaining har gow. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 43938,&quot;Keftedes (Meatballs) 2 1/2 pounds 80-percent ground beef 1 medium onion, grated or finely chopped<br> 2 slices bread, crusts removed, dipped in water and water squeezed out 2 slices bread, crusts removed, dipped in water and water squeezed out<br> 2 large eggs, beaten<br> 2 tablespoons dried mint 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> All-purpose flour, for dusting<br> Swirl of Greek extra-virgin olive oil, for frying<br> Instructions: Put the ground beef in a large bowl and add the grated onion and bread.

For the vegetables: Preheat a gas grill or stovetop grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush all the vegetables with the glaze and grill, turning frequently and brushing with more glaze as they cook until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the grill and let stand for a few minutes before chopping into bite-size pieces. For the couscous: Put the couscous in a large bowl. Pour the hot broth over and stir to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile whisk together the light soy, olive oil, sesame oil and lemon juice in a small bowl until combined. Uncover the couscous, pour in about 2 tablespoons of the soy mixture and fluff with a fork. Add half of the cilantro and toss gently. Spoon the couscous onto a serving platter and arrange the chopped vegetables over and around it. Drizzle more of the soy mixture over the vegetables, if desired, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper.

F. Trace a 9-inch circle on a sheet of parchment paper, then flip it over and use it to line a baking sheet (you should be able to see the circle through the paper). Combine the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, 2 to 4 minutes. With the mixer still on, gradually sprinkle in the sugar (about 1 tablespoon at a time), beating 20 to 30 seconds between additions to be sure the sugar dissolves completely. After the sugar is incorporated, continue to beat on medium speed until the meringue is very thick, shiny, stiff and totally smooth, 5 to 10 more minutes (check occasionally by rubbing a bit between your fingers to feel for any sugar granules). Add the cornstarch, vanilla and vinegar and beat to just combine, 20 to 30 more seconds. Mound the meringue in the middle of the traced circle on the baking sheet and spread into a 9-inch round. Make a slight indentation in the center for the toppings, then use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to make swoops in the meringue. Place in the oven on the middle rack, then immediately reduce the temperature to 225? F. Bake until crisp and dry, about 2 1/2 hours (do not open the oven during baking); the meringue should still be white or a very pale cream color. Turn off the oven and let the meringue cool completely in the oven, 2 to 3 hours. Make the toppings: Toss the strawberries and pineapple in separate small bowls with 1 teaspoon sugar each; let stand 15 to 20 minutes until juicy. In a medium bowl, whisk the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Carefully peel the meringue off the parchment and place on a platter. Top with small scoops of ice cream, nestling the banana slices between the scoops. Top with the whipped cream, strawberries, pineapple, hot fudge, cherries and peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 43941,&quot;Seared Tuna with the Best Potato Salad 2 pounds (900 grams) new potatoes, boiled until tender 1 tablespoon capers 1 lemon, juiced Olive oil 1/2 red onion, finely chopped 1 celery heart, sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (8 to10 ounce/225 to 285 gram) tuna steaks, about 1- inch (2 centimeters) thick 1 good handful basil leaves, picked and finely chopped Instructions: For the potato salad: Cook the potatoes, and while still warm, add the capers and a good squeeze of the lemon. Add the oil, and toss in the red onion and celery heart and season carefully with salt and pepper. Lay out your tuna steaks on a tray and season with salt and pepper. I prefer to cook it on one of those ridged grill pans or in a frying pan. Rub your pan, which should be very, very hot, with a little bit of olive oil on a piece of kitchen paper, then put in the tuna. What you want to do is sear the tuna so that it toasts, fries, and browns, about 45 to 60 seconds on each side. Once cooked, I like to rip the steaks in half and place them on top of the potato salad. Smash or pound up the basil in a mortar and pestle. Add a good glug of olive oil with a squeeze of lemon, and spoon this over each tuna steak. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 43942,&quot;Green River Floats 2 pints vanilla ice cream One 1-liter bottle Green River or other lemon-lime soda Whipped cream, for topping Green sprinkles, for topping Instructions: Place 2 scoops ice cream in each of 4 glasses.

Generously brush a large skillet with butter, then rub with the garlic. Combine the mozzarella, asiago and raclette in a bowl. Heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the potatoes, spreading them out. Sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon salt, half of the cut-up butter, half of the shredded cheese blend, and pepper to taste. Arrange the remaining potatoes on top. Sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Pour the cream over the potatoes, then add the nutmeg and bay leaves; simmer 3 minutes. Dot the potatoes with the remaining cut-up butter. Generously brush a shallow baking dish with butter; slide the potatoes into the dish; arrange with a fork, if desired. (If your skillet is ovenproof, you can skip this step and bake the potatoes in the skillet.) Sprinkle the potatoes with the parmesan and the remaining shredded cheese blend. Bake until golden, about 25 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before serving. Discard the bay leaves.

Spray an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Stand each apple upright (with what would have been the stem-side up) on a cutting board. Working with 1 apple at a time, slice the apples vertically 1/4 inch thick, squeezing together the slices to keep the shape of the whole apple as intact as possible. Immediately place it into the prepared loaf pan, keeping the shape of the whole apple intact with the slices parallel to the long sides of the pan. Repeat with the remaining 2 apples. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice, nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the eggs, vegetable oil, buttermilk, vanilla and 1/2 cup honey in another medium bowl until smooth. Add the flour mixture to the honey mixture and whisk until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter over the apples in the loaf pan, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure all the batter is used. Gently tap the pan 3 times on the counter to evenly distribute the batter throughout the apples. Bake until a toothpick comes out with just a few moist crumbs, about 1 hour.

Arrange the sweet potato slices in overlapping concentric circles in the skillet, brushing each layer with some of the butter, sprinkling with salt and pepper, and pressing down to compact, until all of the potatoes and butter have been used. Place a layer of foil directly on the top layer and place an empty pan on top to pack the potatoes down. Bake until the potato cake can be easily pierced with a knife indicating the potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. Run a metal spatula around the edge and then carefully invert the potato cake onto a serving platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 43953,&quot;Bomboloni Scant 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh compressed yeast Scant 1/4 cup cold water 3 1/2 cups bread flour 4 large eggs 1/3 cup granulated sugar, plus extra for coating 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed Vegetable or canola oil Raspberry jam Instructions: Dissolve the yeast in a small bowl with the cold water. Place the flour, eggs, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until the ingredients are dispersed, about 5 seconds. Add the dissolved yeast and beat for about 2 minutes on medium-high speed, until the dough is well combined and holds together. Add the cubed butter and mix for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the dough no longer sticks to the side of the mixing bowl. If the dough is overly sticky, you may need to add about 1 tablespoon of flour. It is usually necessary to scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula to encourage the dough to form a ball and come away from the side. Remove the paddle and pat the dough into a ball at the bottom of the bowl. Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes. The dough will rise slightly. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and punch it down to remove the air. Spread it onto a lightly floured baking sheet with your fingers and flatten the dough until it is about 3/4-inch thick. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight. It will slightly proof. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Flatten it slightly with your hands. Cut the dough into circles with a 1 1/2-inch diameter cutter, keeping the cuts as close together as possible. Pat any leftover dough into a rectangle and cut more circles out of it. (At this stage, the Bombolini can be frozen for up to 1 week if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Allow the Bombolini to defrost in the refrigerator before proofing.) Place the Bomboloni on a parchment covered baking sheet lightly sprayed with vegetable cooking spray. Space them 2 inches apart. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Allow the Bomboloni to proof at room temperature for about 2 hours, until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air. Heat the oil about 15 minutes in an electric fryer or in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat to 320 degrees F. If using a saucepan, check the temperature with a candy thermometer. Fry 5 to 7 Bomboloni at one time, any more than that and the oil temperature will dip down too much and they will not fry evenly. Fry for a total of 3 to 5 minutes, until they are golden brown. Turn to evenly fry each side. As they fry, they will increase in size. Remove the Bomboloni with a large slotted spoon and set on a paper towel to drain the excess oil. While the Bomboloni are still warm, roll them in a bowl filled with granulated sugar until evenly coated. If desired, fill the Bomboloni with a jam-filled pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain tip. Use a sharp paring knife to make a small hole on the bottom of each Bomboloni. Place the tip of the pastry bag in the hole and squeeze until the Bomboloni feels heavy. It is best to fill the Bomboloni while they are still warm and the dough soft and pliable. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43954,&quot;Vietnamese-Style Sandwich: Banh Mi 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar 1/2 cup julienned carrot 1/2 cup julienned daikon radish Kosher salt 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion 6 ounces ground pork 1 tablespoon roast pork seasoning mix* Pinch garlic powder Pinch ground black pepper Four 10-inch baguettes Mayonnaise, as needed 8 thin slices Vietnamese-style pork roll (cha lua), or bologna 8 slices Vietnamese-style salami, or ham or turkey 4 teaspoons soy sauce 1/2 cup fresh cilantro sprigs 1/4 medium English cucumber, cut lengthwise into 4 slices Freshly ground black pepper Asian-style chili oil, to taste, optional Instructions: Make the slaw: In a small saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and vinegar and bring to a boil.

Roll the mat into a tube and let the chocolate set. When it has set, carefully peel the mat away from the chocolate. Using a sharp, hot chef&#39;s knife, trim the edges so they are even. Set aside<br> For the Base: You will need to two bases for the centerpiece. Place an acetate or parchment sheet on your work surface with the long side facing you. Using an offset spatula, spread about a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate onto the acetate sheet. Wait until the chocolate sets. Place another dish mat on top of the white chocolate. Using an offset spatula, spread a layer of bittersweet chocolate over the mat. Allow the chocolate to set. Carefully peel the mat away from the chocolate, creating a white base with dark dots. Repeat to make another base. Use a sharp chef&#39;s knife to cut a circle from one of the bases, 2 inches larger than the diameter of whatever you will be placing on the pedestal. Set the large base on a flat tray. Use a generous amount of chocolate to glue the circular base to one end of the support stand tube. Use more chocolate to glue the other end of the support stand tube to the other, larger base. Be sure the chocolate has set completely and the stand is sturdy before you set anything on top of it.<br> If you would like to use a potato masher or a slotted spatula, first place an acetate or parchment sheet on the work surface, then place the utensil on top of the paper. Using an offset spatula, spread a layer of white chocolate over the utensil (filling the holes) and onto the acetate sheet. Carefully, lift off the utensil. Allow the chocolate to set then use an offset spatula to carefully spread a layer of dark chocolate over the white chocolate texture. Allow the chocolate to set. Use a sharp knife or cutter to cut the chocolate into interesting shapes.<br> Use these same techniques for any other textured mat and create more interesting pieces for the centerpiece.<br> To assemble the centerpiece, use the chocolate to glue the various shapes into place. Use your eye as a guide to create an interesting design. A nice thing to do is to place a cake on the stand and distribute petit fours around the base of the centerpiece. You can also decorate with fresh fruit to add color.<br> How to Temper Chocolate (From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Rioja, Syrah]&quot; 43969,&quot;Tangy Coleslaw with Smoked Corn and Lime Dressing Juice of 3 limes (1/4 cup) Kosher salt and cracked black pepper 3 ears fresh corn, shucked (2 cups kernels) 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped 2 large carrots, shredded or grated (2 cups) 1 jalapeno, halved and thinly sliced, seeds and ribs removed if desired 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced (1/2 cup) 1/2 head red cabbage, shredded (about 2 cups) 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced (1/2 cup) 1/4 head green cabbage, shredded (about 2 cups) 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1/4 cup rice vinegar 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: Sprinkle the sawdust chips over the center of the bottom of the smoker and put the rack in place.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grate the carrots using the grater attachment on a Food Processor , or use a Box Grater (if using the box grater, use the finer side) . After they are grated, use the blade on the food processor to chop the carrots more finely. In a small bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, oil, eggs, vanilla, and zest. Whisk in the dry ingredients, just until combined. Using a spoon, stir in the carrots and dried fruit. Fold in the coconut. Divide the batter into the two prepared pans and bake for about 30 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let cakes cool completely in the pans on a wire rack. Make the icing by blending the cream cheese, butter, vanilla, lemon extract, lemon juice, confectioners&#39; sugar and Lyle&#39;s Golden Syrup, until smooth. Put one of the layers of cake on a 9-inch cardboard round and then top it with 1 cup of the cream cheese icing. Cover the cake with a thin crumb coat. Then finish with a smooth coat of icing on the cake. I ran my spatula tip around the icing to create the swirls, but you&#39;ll be pressing coconut on the outside, so don&#39;t worry about getting this effect. Before moving the cake to the platter, lift it and gently press the shredded coconut onto the top and sides. This cake is wonderful the next day or even the following. Just wrap it well and refrigerate....if there is any left! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 43975,&quot;Pork and Crackling 1/2 pork loin roughly 7 pounds in weight (on the bone), scored 1/4-inch apart, bone removed Sea salt 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary 1/2 tablespoon fennel seeds 5 cloves garlic 8 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 4 bay leaves 2 tablespoons olive oil Pork bones, chopped 5 outer sticks celery, roughly chopped 1 large carrot, roughly chopped 1 large onion, roughly chopped Instructions: Lay out your pork on a board and rub some salt and 1 teaspoon chopped rosemary into the scored lines, trying to get this into every bit by pushing and rubbing in. In a pestle and mortar smash up the fennel seeds, then the garlic and remaining chopped rosemary, and rub this into the meat ? not the skin, or it will burn. Place in a large roasting tray with the balsamic vinegar, bay and olive oil. Leave for about 1/2 hour to marinate. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to its highest temperature and brown the bones. Rub the skin of the pork with lots of sea salt ? this will help puff it up and dry it out. Place the pork directly on the bars at the top of the oven. Finally add the browned bones and vegetables to the leftover balsamic marinade, add 570ml, 1 pint water and put into the oven directly under the pork. As the pork cooks all the goodness drips from it into the tray. This liquid will then become your gravy. You also get quite charred bar marks on the base of the pork. The pork will take about 1 hour to cook. After 20 minutes turn the temperature down to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Once the pork is cooked, remove it from the oven on the rack and place on a piece of foil to save any juices. Allow to rest for at least 10 minutes. Finish off any vegetables that you are going to serve with it and make a gravy out of the juices in the tray which was underneath the pork. Put the bones, the liquid and the vegetables into a large pan. Add some water to the tray that contained the bones and vegetables, as there will be some Marmite-like, sticky stuff on the bottom to the tray which is very tasty. Reboil the water, scrape off all the goodness from the bottom of the tray and then pour everything into the pan. Bring to the boil, shaking occasionally, remove any oil, grease or scum from the top, then pass the contents through a sieve, discarding all the vegetables and bones. You can reduce and then correct the seasoning, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 43976,&quot;Pulled BBQ Chicken Slider with Pineapple Coleslaw 1/2 bottle ketchup 1/2 cup brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup white vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon cinnamon whiskey, such as Fireball 1 tablespoon salt<br> 2 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons mustard<br> 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 2 teaspoons salt<br> 1 teaspoon black pepper<br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise 3 tablespoons white vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons sugar Salt 1/2 jalapeno, minced 1/2 cup diced pineapple 1/2 cup shredded green cabbage 1/2 cup shredded red cabbage 4 slider buns, split and toasted Instructions: For the BBQ sauce: Combine the ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, whiskey, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes and mustard in a saucepan.

Quarter the bulbs. Set each quarter on its side and slice off most of the core. Cut the quarters into wedges about 1-inch thick (don&#39;t worry if some pieces fall off the wedge-use those too). Put 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Place over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Add the fennel and cook without stirring until fennel is brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Stir and let the fennel continue to cook until some more pieces brown, 1 to 2 minutes.

Using a paring knife, cut a circle on the top of the bread about 3/4 inch from the side and about 1/2 inch from the bottom. Remove the top and scoop out the insides, leaving a 1/2-inch wall around the sides and bottom. Reserve the top and bread scraps for another use. Brush the outside crust (sides and bottom) of the loaf with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Completely cover the inside bottom and sides of the bread bowl with the sliced raclette. Cover the outside crust with foil to protect it from browning, leaving the hole and the cheese exposed. Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the cheese is fully melted but not browned, 15 to 20 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, cook the bacon and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium heat until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Add the thyme and shallots to the skillet and cook until the shallots are tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the bacon.<br> When the cheese is melted, remove the bread bowl from the oven and, using a small spoon, scoop the melted cheese from the bottom of the bowl and spread it up onto the sides of the bowl, gently pressing it into the crumb to create a watertight seal around the entire inside surface of the bowl.<br> Sprinkle the Gruyere over the bottom of the bowl and top with the bacon and shallots. Blend the half-and-half, salt, cayenne, nutmeg and eggs in a blender on low speed until completely smooth and creamy. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve (to remove the foam) and then pour into the bread bowl, filling it to just below the top of the bowl.<br> Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Bake until the edges of the quiche are set but the center still wobbles slightly, 55 to 75 minutes (it will continue to set after baking). Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in a warm place (stovetop is best) to prevent cracks forming on the top, at least 3 hours, before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 43990,&quot;Grilled Bratwurst with Brie and Spiral Apple Slaw 4 bratwurst, about 4 ounces each 4 pretzel hotdog buns, split<br> Melted butter, for brushing 6 ounces Brie, thinly sliced<br> 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1 tablespoon honey<br> 2 teaspoons grainy mustard<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried dill<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 crisp apples (like Fuji or Honeycrisp), unpeeled<br> 1 extra-large carrot, peeled 3 scallions, thinly sliced<br> Instructions: For the bratwurst: Prepare a gas grill for medium-high heat. Grill the bratwurst until cooked through (160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer), turning once, 20 to 25 minutes. For the slaw: Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, honey, mustard, dill, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a generous grinding of black pepper. Whisk in the olive oil to make a dressing. With a spiral slicer, cut the apples and carrot into spirals; add to the dressing. Add the scallions and toss well. Refrigerate the slaw until ready to serve. When the brats are nearly finished cooking, brush the cut sides of the pretzel buns lightly with melted butter and grill, cut-side down, on the upper shelf until crisp at the edges, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn the buns cut-side up and top with the sliced brie; grill until the brie just begins to melt, about 1 minute. Serve the bratwurst on the buns, topped with slaw.

Add the coriander and garlic and let it toast until you smell it, 30 to 45 seconds. Add half of the corn and cook for a couple of minutes to soften. Add the sugar, scallions and a pinch of salt. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the heavy cream and simmer until the cream reduces slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into a blender and puree until smooth. If the corn is \u201cstringy\u201d or the sauce grainy, strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Transfer the sauce to a large skillet and stir in the sun-dried tomatoes. Keep warm. In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil. Add a generous amount of salt. The pasta water should taste like sea water. Add the pasta to the pot and stir so it doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom as it cooks. Cook the pasta until al dente (chewy but not hard or raw tasting), 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve a little of the pasta cooking liquid in case you need it later, then drain the pasta in a colander. Toss the pasta in the skillet with the sauce and remaining corn.

Hold each carrot at root end and use the vegetable peeler to make long, thin strips of the carrot. Chop the thin slices into small carrot bits or carrot chips, 1/2-inch wide. Add the chips to celery and stir. Cut leeks lengthwise and then into 1/2-inch half moons. Place the leeks into a colander and run under rushing cold water, separating the layers to wash away all the trapped grit. When the leeks are separated and clean, shake off water and add to celery and carrots. Stir veggies together, add a bay leaf and season with salt and pepper.

Seal and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, and up to 36 hours. Preheat a grill. Remove the steaks from the marinade and pat dry. Season both sides with 1 tablespoon of the Essence and the peppercorns. Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer until thickened and reduced by 1/3 in volume, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle the thick onion slices with the remaining 1 tablespoon of Essence. Grill the steaks until medium-rare, about 6 minutes per side. At the same time, grill the onions (as though grilling a patty, so the rings stay together) until golden and char-marked by the grill, turning once. Remove the steaks from the grill and top with the grilled onions.

Add the chicken and shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is opaque and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Push to the side with the tofu, allowing the excess oil to drip down into the middle of the skillet. Add the beaten egg to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally and chopping to break up, until cooked through, about 30 seconds. Push the egg to the side with the tofu and chicken. Add the peppers to the skillet and cook just to soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the noodles, bean sprouts, scallions and sauce to the skillet. Combine the tofu, chicken and egg into the ingredients and stir fry, coating the ingredients with the sauce, and simmer to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes.<br> Pile the stir fry onto a serving plate and top with chopped peanuts and cilantro leaves. Serve immediately with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 43995,&quot;Homemade Bagels 1/2 cup plus 2/3 cup warm water (105? F to 110? F) 1/4 cup barley malt syrup 3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast 3 cups bread flour, plus more if needed 2 teaspoons kosher salt Cooking spray Cornmeal, for dusting 1 large egg white, lightly beaten Sesame seeds, coarse salt, poppy seeds and/or everything seasoning, for topping Instructions: Make the dough: Stir together 1/2 cup warm water and 1 tablespoon malt syrup in a small bowl; sprinkle the yeast on top. Let soften a minute, then stir. Set aside until foamy or bubbly, about 5 minutes. Whisk the flour and salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Pour in the yeast mixture and 2/3 cup warm water and stir with a wooden spoon to make a shaggy dough. Not all the flour will be mixed in. Knead the dough in the bowl to mix in more of the flour, and work the dough into a rough ball in the bowl. Knead the dough: Turn out the dough onto a clean surface and begin kneading. As you knead, the dough will become tacky and stick to your fingers, then it should lose its stickiness and form a somewhat smooth ball (this should take 3 to 4 minutes). If the dough is still sticky, lightly dust with flour. Once the dough starts to smooth out, continue kneading until it\u2019s very satiny and pillowy feeling (this should take 5 to 10 minutes). Rip off a small piece of dough and gently stretch the 4 corners. If it can stretch very thin without tearing, it\u2019s ready. If it tears, knead another 2 minutes and test again. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl lightly misted with cooking spray, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. You don\u2019t want the dough to over-proof or form bubbles on the surface. Keep an eye on it; the dough can proof quickly in a warm spot. Divide the dough: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and mist with cooking spray. Turn out the dough onto a clean surface and press to flatten and deflate the dough, making sure to press out any large air bubbles. Divide into 6 pieces, 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 ounces each. Pull the corners of each piece together into the center of the dough, turn over so the seam is on the bottom and roll the dough against the counter into a tight ball with a smooth surface. Do not use any flour or the dough will not stick to itself properly. Form the bagels: Form the bagels one at a time: First stick your thumb through the middle of a dough ball, then insert your index finger and gently start to stretch the hole. Roll the bagel in a circle around your index fingers to stretch the hole until 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide. If the hole pulls back together, let rest 1 to 2 minutes, then reshape. Transfer the bagel to the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough balls. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. The bagels will puff slightly. Cook the bagels: About 30 minutes before boiling, preheat the oven to 450? F and remove the bagels from the refrigerator. Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil in a wide pot. Stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons malt syrup. Gently add 2 or 3 bagels, rounded-side down, and boil for 2 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove the bagels with a slotted spoon and put back on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining bagels. It\u2019s OK if they deflate a bit as they cool but they should mostly keep their shape. (If they do deflate and wrinkle, they\u2019ll still be good \u2014 just a little flat.) Line a separate baking sheet with parchment paper and dust with cornmeal. Brush the tops and sides of the bagels with the egg white and sprinkle with toppings. Place rounded-side up on the cornmeal-dusted baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Bake on the middle oven rack until the bagels are golden brown and crisp, rotating the pan halfway through, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 43996,&quot;Caper and Tomato Butter Sauce 1/4 cup minced shallots 1 cup white wine Salt Cayenne pepper 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 1/2 sticks cold butter, cut into pieces 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons chopped shallots 1/4 cup capers 1/2 cup small diced tomatoes Instructions: In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the shallots and wine.

On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out each of the balls of dough into an 8-inch circle. Brush each of the circles with the chili oil and start to layer, dividing the ingredients among the 4 pizzas. Start with the tomatoes, then the mozzarella and Fontina cheeses, the herbs, chicken, and Parmesan. Bake until the pizza crusts are nicely browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Toss the lettuce with the vinaigrette and season lightly with salt and pepper. Remove the pizzas from the oven, arrange the lettuce on each of the pizzas, and top with some of the shaved Parmesan. Cut into slices and serve immediately. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Add the honey and let sit for 5 minutes, until foamy. Put the flour in a food processor. Mix the 1 cup cool water with the olive oil and salt. With the motor running, pour the olive oil mixture and the yeast slowly in through the feed tube. Process until the dough forms a ball on the blade. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover and let rise until double in bulk. Punch down the dough and knead it on a lightly floured surface for 1 minute. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and roll them into tight balls. Place on a tray, cover with a damp towel and let rest for several hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Roll or stretch each bowl of dough into a 7 to 8-inch circle. Place the circles, 1 at a time, on a wooden peel or on a baking sheet and build the pizza as desired. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. In a pot of boiling water, blanch tomatoes. Drain and refresh in ice water. Drain. Peel, core, cut into quarters, and remove seeds. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and arrange the tomato quarters on the tray, cut side down. Drizzle generously with olive oil. Sprinkle with thyme and garlic. In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper and sugar, and sprinkle evenly over the tomatoes. Bake until the tomatoes begin to shrivel, about 1 hour. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, transfer to a container. Pour olive oil over and cover the container. Refrigerate and use as needed. Arrange the cubed chicken in a shallow medium bowl and toss with 1/2 cup olive oil, lime juice, jalapenos, garlic, and cilantro. Season with salt and let marinate for 1 hour, refrigerated. In a skillet or saute pan large enough to hold the chicken in 1 layer, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil. Remove the chicken from the marinade with a slotted spoon. Saute the chicken just to brown on all sides. Do not overcook. Remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, lemon juice, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, mustard, and anchovies. Slowly whisk in the oils to emulsify. Stir in the cheese and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate, in a covered container. When ready to use, whisk again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 43998,&quot;Five Spice Seared Duck - Asian Greens Spring Roll 2 duck breasts 1-ounce sesame oil 1 tablespoon Chinese five spice powder 2 teaspoons kosher salt 8 spring roll wrappers 4 ounces Asian greens 1 small carrot, julienned thin 1 small cucumber, juilienned thin 1/2 cup rice vinegar 1 tablespoon siracha, (hot pepper sauce) 1 tablespoon fish sauce 1 teaspoon black sesame seeds 2 tablespoons scallion, chopped thin Instructions: For the duck: Rub the breasts with half of the sesame oil and season with five spice powder and salt.

Using a vegetable juicer, juice 6 sweet potatoes, cut into small pieces, skin left on. Once you have enough juice, about 3 1/2 cups, let it stand for about 4 hours. This will allow much of the potato starch in the juice to settle. Trim 1 large sweet potato and cut it into hockey puck size sections. Trim sides. Rub the potato steaks with a bit of the grapeseed oil and season with salt and pepper. Place steaks on a grill pan and mark. Take your sliced filet mignon, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle the steak fries with the Wondra flour. Transfer to a hot saute pan with tablespoon grapeseed oil. Saute steak fries until well browned and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, and let rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Next transfer the potato steaks to a foil lined baking sheet. Bake potato steaks until tender in a preheated 350 degree oven. While the potatoes are baking, strain the sweet potato juice into a saucepan over medium heat. Reduce the sauce until you have only 3/4 cup left and the juice has naturally thickened. Stir in the chopped Thai chili, the ginger and strain the sauce. Add the chicken stock and set aside. Plate the potato steaks with the steak fries and sweet potatoes sauce.

Toast the garlic to a pale golden brown before pouring the garlic and oil over the yuca in the roasting dish. Add the cooked bacon to the yuca and, with a spoon, stir to combine evenly. Combine the bread crumbs with the chopped nuts and sprinkle on top of the yuca. Place the dish into the oven and roast for 25 minutes or until the top is browned and crisp. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 44038,&quot;Buttermilk Fried Chicken 1 whole chicken, about 3 pounds, cut into 9 or 10 pieces, back, neck, wing tips and giblets reserved 1 1/2 cups buttermilk Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 to 4 cups vegetable shortening for frying Instructions: Place chicken pieces in a gallon size zipper lock plastic bag. Mix buttermilk with 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Pour buttermilk mixture over chicken, seal, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours. Measure 2 cups flour, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper into a large doubled brown paper bag; shake to combine. Drop half of chicken pieces into flour mixture and shake thoroughly to coat completely with flour. Remove chicken from bag, shaking excess flour from each piece. Place pieces onto a large wire rack set over a jelly roll pan until you are ready to fry. Coat remaining chicken pieces in the same manner. Meanwhile, spoon enough shortening to measure 1/2-inch deep in a 12-inch skillet; heat to 350 degrees. Drop chicken pieces, skin side down, into hot oil, cover (you can use a cookie sheet) and cook for 5 minutes. Lift chicken pieces with tongs to make sure chicken is frying evenly; rearrange if some are browning faster than others. Cover again and continue cooking until pieces are evenly browned, about 5 minutes longer. Turn chicken over with tongs and cook, uncovered, until chicken is browned all over, 10 to 12 minutes longer. Remove chicken from skillet with tongs and place on wire rack set over jelly roll pan.

Add onion, garlic and peppers and cook until the onions become translucent. Remove from heat and add oregano, cumin, cinnamon, chili powder, and ground chocolate and gradually whisk in beef stock. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Increase heat to medium-high and return pot to stove. Let reduce by two-thirds. Remove from heat and strain 1 cup of the sauce into a bowl, transferring the rest of the sauce and vegetable solids to a separate bowl. Let both bowls of sauce cool, then chill in refrigerator. (The strained sauce will be used to simulate chocolate sauce. The unstrained sauce will be used to flavor the beef and darken its color to look like chocolate.) Keep in mind that all equipment used to make the forcemeat must be clean and well chilled so that the components can combine properly. (This includes the grinding mechanism, - if using a meat grinder - the food processor bowl and blade, all preparation and mixing bowls, and utensils). Without this attention to detail you will not be able to create the illusion which is your goal. All ingredients should be refrigerated up until the moment they are ready to be used and should be prepared in bowls which are nested in another container of ice to keep the temperature low during the actual preparation. The goal of this recipe is to make a savory meal that not only fools the eye by making the meal look like something we know as sweet, but to also make a meal that tastes good. This will be accomplished as follows: The onion/garlic puree and salt and white pepper will be added to the chicken to make it taste savory, and the cream will be added to make it look like the butter-cream \filling\ of the cake. Some of the mole sauce (the part with the vegetable solids) as well as salt and black pepper, will be used to give the ground beef a savory taste and a dark \chocolate\ appearance. The balance of the mole sauce will be used to look like chocolate sauce. Begin the meat loaf by making the onion/garlic puree for the chicken. Through the feed tube of a running food processor, add the onion and garlic. Transfer this pureed mixture to a strainer placed over a small bowl. Allow the juices to drain into the bowl, then discard the juices, reserving the onion/garlic puree in the same bowl and refrigerating to 40 degrees F. (This can be hastened by putting in the freezer for a while - without allowing it to freeze.) Wash and dry the food processor bowl and blade and chill them. If the chicken you have bought is not ground, grind the chicken tenders into a prepared bowl and refrigerate. Prepare a 2 quart souffle dish by lining it with enough plastic wrap so that it covers all interior surfaces of the dish with enough additional plastic on the ends so you will be able to wrap your completed layered \cake\ completely in plastic. Then refrigerate the lined souffle dish. Have 2 large bowls of ice ready in which you have nested 2 medium bowls (respectively) in order to keep them chilled while you are working. Begin with the beef because the bottom layer of the \cake\ will look like chocolate. Through the feed tube of the running food processor (the bowl of which has been chilled), gradually feed the chilled ground beef a little at a time, alternating with the chilled mole (the unstrained mole with the vegetable solids) and salt and black pepper. (Remember to reserve the 1 cup of the strained mole sauce for later.) You may not use all of the unstrained mole if the beef is not able to \hold\ it all before becoming too soupy. STOP before you reach that point. Scrape down the sides of the bowl if the mixture looks unevenly colored. Transfer this mixture to a chilled bowl which you have been chilling by nesting in another bowl of ice. Then immediately refrigerate the beef mixture. Thoroughly wash and dry the food processor bowl and blade and chill. Next process the chicken which will be used to resemble the vanilla cream filling in your \cake.\ Re-assemble the food processor with the chilled bowl and blade and turn it on. Through the feed tube, gradually add the ground chilled chicken a little at a time, alternating with the onion/garlic puree and salt and white pepper, until it is all incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl if the mix looks unevenly colored. With the food processor still running gradually add heavy cream through the feed tube to whiten and lighten the chicken. (Add cream make it as white as possible to resemble vanilla cream filling, but remember, it has to retain some body.) This is where judgment comes into play. The recipe calls for 1 pint of heavy cream, but the chicken mixture may not \hold\ that much before it becomes too soft. Stop adding cream when you feel the mixture has reached the point where it still has body and is not soupy. Transfer the chicken mixture to the chilled bowl you have waiting in a bowl of ice and then refrigerate. Assembly: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F, (no hotter or the plastic will melt.) Divide the ground beef mixture into thirds and the chicken mixture in half. (Return the chicken mixture to the refrigerator or the bowl of ice until needed.) Pack one-third of the beef into the bottom of the chilled plastic-lined souffle dish to become the bottom layer of the \cake.\ This is easiest done by dropping spoonful-sized amounts evenly over the bottom and pressing down with your fingertips. (Return the remaining two-thirds of the beef mixture to the refrigerator or bowl of ice until needed, and retrieve the chicken mixture.) Pack half of the chicken mixture over the first beef layer in the same manner (to form a \vanilla cream\ layer), dropping spoonful sized amounts evenly over the bottom layer and pressing down with your fingertips. Chill the remaining chicken while you are doing this. Retrieve the beef and pack the second layer of \chocolate\ over the chicken keeping the remaining beef chilled. Pack in the second layer of chicken over the beef, and then finish with the third layer of beef. Bring the plastic wrap up over the top surface of the entire composition, and then place a piece of foil over the top of the souffle dish. You are doing this because the cooking method is slow steaming. Bake the \cake\ at 250 degrees F for about 1 1/2 hours, or until a long bamboo skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. You will notice that there is some shrinkage and that the meat has given up a lot of juices. Remove from the oven and let sit for about 15 minutes. Carefully pour the juices off and remove the plastic wrap. Using a sturdy plate pressed on the top edge of the souffle dish, and working over a large utility platter which will catch the juices, invert the meatloaf onto the plate to release it from the souffle dish and then carefully flip it back onto the platter so it is again upright. Let rest for 10 to 15 more minutes before transferring to a serving plate or slicing. To make the mashed potatoes and cauliflower which looks like vanilla ice cream, begin cooking the potato chunks and cauliflower in the last 10 minutes of the baking time for the meatloaf. The potatoes should be boiled until tender and the cauliflower can be boiled or steamed until tender. (Use separate pots because they cook at different rates.) Drain the potatoes and cauliflower well, add the butter, season with salt and white pepper, and using only a hand potato masher (NOT a beater) mash them together in a mixing bowl. To serve, use the ice cream scoop to simulate scoops of vanilla ice cream on the serving plate. While the potatoes are boiling, begin the syrup for the tomatoes. Combine the sugar, red wine, pomegranate juice, balsamic vinegar, and cream of tartar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat stirring until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is hot. (This may take a while, so be patient, but stop stirring once the sugar is dissolved.) Cover and simmer gently for 2 minutes, then uncover and continue to cook for another 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in grape tomatoes, coating them with syrup. Carefully pour mole sauce over the exterior crust of the meatloaf to simulate chocolate sauce, then cut into cake shaped wedges to reveal the layers of \cake.\ Any extra mole sauce can be drizzled over the scoops of potato/cauliflower to look like chocolate sauce. Spoon some tomatoes on serving plate along with syrup to look like cherries jubilee. An effective presentation is to place the meatloaf on a large serving platter, spoon the re-warmed strained mole sauce over to cover the crust of the meatloaf, then remove 1 wedge of the meatloaf to expose the layered interior, laying that wedge on its side next to the rest of the cake. Your individual serving plate will be arranged with scoops of the potato/cauliflower, topped with mole sauce if desired, and some grape tomatoes with syrup spooned over and around. Serve the rest of the meatloaf wedges to your guests at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]&quot; 44047,&quot;Devilishly Hot Pimento Cheese Dip 1 large round pumpernickel bread boule 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/4 cup minced yellow onion<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 1 tablespoon mustard powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika<br> 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, plus more if needed 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 cups whole milk<br> 8 ounces cream cheese, softened<br> 12 ounces extra-sharp Cheddar, shredded<br> 3/4 cup roasted peppers or pimentos, drained and finely diced<br> 1/4 cup hot green chiles, drained and finely diced<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: First, prepare the bread boule by slicing off the top 2 inches and hollowing out the center, leaving the walls of the boule about an inch thick. Cut the top and insides of the bread into bite-sized cubes and set aside. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the mustard, paprika, cayenne and salt; cook for an additional 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the onion/garlic mixture and stir to combine; cook about 2 minutes more. Gradually whisk in the milk and gently simmer for 2 minutes. Add the cream cheese and stir until it melts. Then add the Cheddar cheese. Once all the cheeses are melted, stir in the roasted peppers and hot green chiles. Season with black pepper to taste and additional salt, if necessary. Preheat the broiler on high. Scoop the pimento cheese mixture into the hollowed-out bread boule and place on a baking sheet. Broil until the top begins to bubble and lightly brown, a couple of minutes. Place the filled boule on a platter and serve immediately with the bread cubes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 44048,&quot;Honey-Chipotle Glazed Beef Burgers with Mint-Avocado Sauce 1 1/2 pounds ground chuck 1 1/2 pounds ground sirloin 1 tablespoon Caribbean jerk seasoning 1/4 cup Zinfandel (recommended: Sutter Home) 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 ripe avocado, peeled and pitted 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 cup mayonnaise 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves 3/4 cup Zinfandel (recommended: Sutter Home) 3/4 cup wine vinegar 1 cup honey 3 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, finely minced 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, for brushing on the grill rack 6 bakery sandwich rolls, split 6 red leaf lettuce leaves 2 ripe tomatoes, sliced Instructions: Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill with a cover, or preheat a gas grill to medium-high.

Pulse the processor until the mixture resembles fine sand. Remove the lid and add the ice water to the mixture. Run the processor just until the mixture rolls itself into a little ball. If the mixture is a bit dry, add more ice water by the tablespoonful until it comes together. Gather the dough into a ball. With a bench scraper or knife, divide the mixture evenly in half. Shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill at least 30 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: At this point you can keep the wrapped dough in the refrigerator for a few days or freeze for later use. For the filling: In a saucepan, combine the pitted cherries and 1 cup water over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cornstarch. Using a whisk, swirl the ingredients together, making sure that there aren&#39;t any lumps in the cornstarch. Add the sugar-cornstarch mixture and lemon zest to the cherries. Cook the cherry mixture until it comes to a rolling boil. Cook 1 minute more, until thickened. Allow the cherry filling to cool slightly while you prepare the crust. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a 24 cup mini muffin tin or 2 (12 cup) mini muffin tins with cooking spray. Roll the dough disks out into 10-inch rounds on a well-floured work surface. With a 1 1/2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, edge lightly dipped in flour, cut 24 rounds from the first rolled out disk. With a 2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, edge lightly dipped in flour, cut 24 rounds from the second rolled out disk. You should have a total of 24 (1 1/2-inch) rounds and 24 (2-inch) rounds for matching top and bottom crusts. Gently fit the 2-inch dough rounds into the bottom of the prepared mini muffin tin. Make sure to pat down the bottom and the excess coming up the sides. Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon cooled pie filling into each crust-lined cup. Fit the top of each mini pie with a 1 1/2-inch dough round, pushing down gently and sealing the bottom crust and top crust by crimping the edges together with a fork. With a sharp paring knife, make 3 small incisions on the top crust, to allow the steam to escape. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the filling is bubbly, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack, and then remove from the muffin tin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44050,&quot;Frozen Cactus Pear Margaritas 8 ounces white tequila 4 ounces orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Cointreau) 4 ounces cactus pear syrup 2 ounces fresh lime juice Crushed ice Lime wedge, for garnish Coarse salt, optional Instructions: Combine tequila, orange-flavored liqueur, cactus pear syrup, lime juice and ice in a blender and blend until smooth and frothy.

Then remove the sweetbreads from the water and gently pull away as much of the outer membrane as you can, being careful not to tear the flesh. Soak the sweetbreads again for 1 hour, this time in a large bowl of cold water with 1 teaspoon of coarse salt. Remove from the water and peel away more of the membrane. Separate the sweetbreads into its 2 lobes. Fill a medium saucepan with 5 cups cold water, 1 teaspoon coarse salt and the white wine vinegar. Place the sweetbreads in the pan and slowly bring the water to a simmer over moderate heat (this should take about 10 minutes). Allow the water to simmer very gently for another 5 minutes. (The sweetbreads should be firm on the outside, but still give a little when squeezed). Remove sweetbreads and place them in ice water for 10 minutes to stop the cooking. Dry sweetbreads and place in a heavy loaf pan or a terrine lined with plastic wrap. Cover with another layer of plastic wrap. Place another heavy loaf pan or terrine on top to weigh down the sweetbreads, and place in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight. When ready to cook, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and cook haricots verts until they are crisp but slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Remove and reserve at room temperature. In a small bowl combine the lemon juice with the balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of the shallots. Slowly whisk in the hazelnut oil. Season to taste with salt and the additional black pepper. Reserve. Place 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large skillet over moderately high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add remaining shallots and saute, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, making sure the pan is not overcrowded. (It may be necessary to saute the mushrooms in 2 batches). Saute with a big pinch of salt, shaking the pan occasionally, until mushrooms are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove mushrooms from skillet and reserve. If there is liquid in the pan that the mushrooms have given off, boil it until it is reduced to 1 to 2 tablespoons and pour over the mushrooms. With a very sharp knife, cut the weighted sweetbreads into broad slices that are about 1/4 inch thick. Combine the flour, the remaining 2 teaspoons of coarse salt, and the 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper on a plate and mix well. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the skillet in which the mushrooms cooked, and place over high heat. Dredge sweetbread slices in the seasoned flour on both sides and add to hot oil. Saute, turning, until sweetbreads are browned and crispy on the outside, about 3 minutes. Remove. Toss reserved haricots verts and mushrooms together. Toss mixture with about half the hazelnut vinaigrette. Place one-fourth of the mixture on each of 4 plates. Nestle pieces of the crispy sweetbread slices among the haricots verts/ mushroom mixture, and drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over the sweetbread slices. Garnish with chervil.

In a small bowl, beat egg. Cut chocolate into 1/2-inch cubes. Take an egg roll wrapper, and brush edges with egg wash, and lay on a work surface, wash side up, with a point facing you, not a straight edge. Place about 2 ounces of chocolate 1 or 2 inches from the edge, and top with 1/4 cup of microwaved marshmallow or fluff. Fold the corner closest you up and just over the filling, press lightly, then fold in the sides, making a little pull or tuck to keep the roll right. Then roll away from you and press to seal tightly. (Take care not to tear the egg roll wrapper. This can cause roll to leak while cooking. If tear occurs, pinch dough together until it reseals or discard wrap and use a new one.) Repeat until all egg rolls are formed. Fry egg rolls 4 at a time, turning almost immediately, cooking on all sides to just golden brown, less than a minute. (Make sure not to overcook filling. If you see marshmallows start to ooze out before both sides are golden, filling will be overcooked and egg roll will appear hollow inside) Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat until all cooked. Make sure to check your oil temperature between additions. When ready to serve, dust with powdered sugar and graham cracker crumbs. Serve immediately, but caution very hot! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 44078,&quot;Beef Burgers with Mushrooms and Aioli 1 1/4 pounds lean ground chuck 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 portobello mushrooms, stems trimmed 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 4 (4-inch) square or round ciabatta or foccacia squares, halved horizontally 2 cups fresh arugula Instructions: Combine the ground chuck, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.

Add onion, jalapenos, and one teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil and simmer until tender, about 1 hour. Remove meat from pot and cool. Pull chicken apart into small pieces. Chicken should be continuously pulled apart until string-like consistency. In a deep pan, heat the oil to about 375 to 400 degrees F. Dip corn tortillas into hot oil for 1/2 a second or until tortilla is soft. Lay the shredded chicken in the middle of the corn tortillas. Add enough meat to make sure you taste the flavor of the meat and the corn tortilla. Roll the tortilla up and put toothpick through the middle of the flauta to hold in place. Once rolled, deep fry each flauta in the oil already heated (used to soften the corn tortillas) until corn tortillas turn to a golden brown or to your preference. Allow cooling off time. Remove toothpicks and serve 6 flautas on a plate with salsa or guacamole. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 44130,&quot;Urta con Verduras: Red Band Bream with New World Vegetables 2 large whole Red Band Bream, cleaned 1 large green bell pepper 1 large tomato, quartered 1 large onion, sliced thinly 1 large potato, peeled and sliced very thinly 2 tablespoons olive oil Pinch salt Fino sherry Crisp green salad, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 190 degrees. Poor the olive oil into a large oven proof dish (ceramic baking dish) enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Layer half of all the vegetables in the dish. Clean the fish thoroughly, the bream can be baked whole or gutted, if preferred. Prepare the fish by shaving some of the excess scales from the outer body, slice, with a very sharp knife, diagonally into the meat on one side about 3 times. Place the fish on top of the layers of vegetables. Cover the fish with the remaining vegetables. Add a little more olive oil and a pinch of salt. Place the dish in the hot oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and pour the dry sherry over the baked fish. Replace the dish in the oven for a couple of minutes. This allows the sherry to infuse into the fish, giving it the distinctive Andalusian flavor. It is best to serve half a side to each person. A crisp green salad can accompany this dish. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44131,&quot;Caramel Chocolate Shortbreads 3/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) One 11-ounce bag caramels, pieces unwrapped Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the spoon 1 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Melt the 20 ounces chopped chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir the chocolate occasionally as it melts. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. Set aside to cool slightly. With an electric mixer, beat the eggs at high speed until frothy. Lower the speed to medium and carefully pour the hot syrup into the beaten eggs. Add the melted chocolate and butter mixture and blend to a smooth consistency. Butter a 10 inch to 12inch round cake pan lightly and pour in the chocolate mixture. Set the cake pan into a larger pan (such as a roasting pan) and add hot water to rise halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Place in the preheated oven and bake about 45 to 50 minutes.<br> Being very careful not to scald yourself or get water into the torte, remove the pans from the oven, and remove the cake pan from the water bath. Cool the torte completely to room temperature before unmolding. Run a sharp knife around the inner circumference of the pan. Place a plate over the pan, invert, and, if necessary, tap the bottom of the pan with the knife handle to encourage the torte to release.<br> The torte should then be refrigerated for at least 3 hours before serving. While the torte is cooling, place the heavy cream in a thick bottomed pot and begin to heat gently. Add the remaining 8 ounces of chocolate, stir together while the chocolate begins to melt in the hot cream. Being careful not to burn, boil or scorch the chocolate, when the chocolate has melted almost entirely, remove from the heat and allow to cool for several minutes before pouring over the torte for a glossy \finish. Place the unmolded torte on a baking rack with a cookie sheet underneath, and pour slightly cooled chocolate ganache directly onto the center of the torte in one motion so that it will flow out in one smooth sheet over the top and sides of the torte. You can gently help this along with the aid of a spatula but is important to use still warmed ganache.<br> Allow to dry a few moments at room temperature. Then place the torte, baking rack, and cookie sheet into the refrigerator to chill completely and set firm. If you haven&#39;t overheated the chocolate or cream, this \ganache\ will set and harden into a shiny \couverture\ during the hour the torte is chilling in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 44139,&quot;Cinnamon-Spiced Jaconde Biscuit 8 ounces frozen cranberries 6 cups heavy cream<br> 3 cups white chocolate chips 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped 1/2 cup brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter<br> 4 cups cubed Granny Smith apples<br> 1 tablespoon brandy<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 23 ounces whole eggs 17 ounces almond flour<br> 17 ounces confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 5 ounces cake flour, sifted 4 ounces melted butter, cooled 16 ounces egg whites<br> 3 ounces granulated sugar<br> 1 ounce egg white powder<br> 1/2 ounce gelatin sheets 26 ounces apple cider<br> 8 ounces granulated sugar<br> 3 Fuji apples, peeled and cored 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 cup egg yolks<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 3 tablespoons apple compound<br> Instructions: For the cream: In a blender, puree the cranberries until completely smooth. Place the cream in a pot and bring to a light boil. Add the cranberry puree, then pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate and mix until smooth. Strain through a fine mesh sieve and rest overnight in the refrigerator. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the Parisian cream until soft peaks form. Transfer the cream to a piping bag fitted with a star tip. For the apples: Heat the granulated sugar in a pan with the vanilla seeds until caramelized and light amber. Add the brown sugar and cook until it all melts. Deglaze the pan with the butter. Add the apples and cook for 3 minutes. Add the brandy and cinnamon, and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Whisk the eggs, almond flour, and confectioners&#39; sugar together. Fold in the cake flour and butter. Whip the egg whites, granulated sugar and egg white powder to form soft peaks. Fold the egg whites into the batter. Pour the batter into a full-size sheet pan and bake until light brown, about 7 minutes. Cool the cake and then cut out rounds with a 2-inch round cutter, about 72 total rounds. For the gelee: Soak the gelatin in cold water until completely soft, about 5 minutes. In a small saucepot, warm the apple cider and granulated sugar until a candy thermometer inserted in the mixture reads 110 degrees F. Add the gelatin and remove from the heat. Mix it all together and pour into small, rectangular candy molds, then chill in the refrigerator until firm, 20 minutes. For the foam: Puree the apples in a food processor and set aside. In a small saucepot set over medium-high heat, bring the heavy cream to a boil. In a small mixing bowl, add the egg yolks and granulated sugar, and mix together. When the heavy cream comes to a boil, immediately remove from the heat and pour half into the yolk mixture. Whisk the egg yolk mixture and return the saucepot to the stovetop. Bring the cream back to a boil and whisk in the tempered yolk mixture. Cook until the mixture starts to thicken, then remove from the heat. Pour the mixture into a small mixing bowl and add the pureed apples and the apple compound. Refrigerate until completely cool, 20 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender to make the foam. To assemble, pipe a layer of Parisian cream on a cake round, then top with another piece of cake and another layer of cream. Finish with a final layer of cake and top with some caramelized apples.

In a medium mixing bowl, add the almond paste, sugar, cornstarch, salt and yolks. Using a hand mixer, beat until the almond paste is dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Slowly pour in the milk, whisking, to temper the yolks. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and increase the heat to medium low. Cook, stirring constantly, until a few bubbles pop to the surface and the mixture is thick like pudding, 5 to 6 minutes. Immediately transfer to a medium bowl. Whisk in the plum jam, almond extract and food coloring, if using. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and let cool, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 3 hours. (Can also be made a day ahead.) For the sufganiyot: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, salt and 1/2 teaspoon of the nutmeg. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the almond paste, whole egg and yolks. Beat on high speed until the mixture is pale and most of the almond paste is incorporated (a few bigger chunks are totally fine). Add the milk, water and almond extract. Switch to the dough hook and add the dry ingredients. Knead on medium speed to make a smooth, slightly stiff dough, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, letting each addition incorporate before adding the next. Once all of the butter is added, knead on medium high to make a very smooth, supple but slightly sticky dough, 5 to 6 minutes (it should make a loose ball around the hook). Transfer the dough to a floured countertop and knead a few times to make a smooth ball. Put the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and lightly dust with flour. Punch the dough down and roll out to a little more than 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2 1/4-inch cutter to cut out as many rounds as possible (you should get about 14 rounds) and place on the prepared baking sheets. Bunch the scraps together and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes, then reroll and cut more rounds (you should have about 24 total). Cover the rounds loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until noticeably puffed, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat about 2 inches of neutral oil to 350 degrees F in a Dutch oven over medium heat. In a small bowl, mix the granulated sugar with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. Set aside. Fry the dough in batches until puffed and deep golden, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a rack placed over a baking sheet to drain. Roll in the nutmeg sugar to coat thoroughly. Let cool. Whisk the pastry cream to smooth it out and lighten it up a bit. Transfer to a piping bag with a large plain tip. Prep the sufganiyot for filling by inserting a chopstick (or something of a similar size) into the side of each sufganiyot to make a hole for the filling. Pipe the filling into each and set with the filling side up on a platter. These are best the day they are made. If storing, refrigerate because of the pastry cream filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44147,&quot;Dark Chocolate-Hazelnut Sables 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, broken into pieces 1/2 cup blanched hazelnuts 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Coarse sugar, for decorating Instructions: Pulse the chocolate in a food processor until finely chopped; transfer to a bowl.

Toast the fennel seeds in a small dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pulse the cookies in a food processor until finely ground. Add the fennel seeds and melted butter; pulse until moistened. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch pie plate. Bake until lightly browned and set, about 8 minutes; let cool completely. Make the filling: Combine the chestnuts, sugar, 1 cup heavy cream and the vanilla seeds and pod in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cream is very thick and the chestnuts are softened, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook until it smells nutty and is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Discard the vanilla pod from the chestnut mixture; transfer the mixture to a food processor, add the browned butter and process until smooth. With the machine running, slowly add the remaining 1? cups heavy cream and the eggs; process until combined. Let stand until thickened and cooled, about 1 hour. Carefully pour the filling into the crust (it will be full). Bake at 350 degrees F until the filling is set, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Make the meringue: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a large saucepan. Whisk the sugar, cream of tartar, salt and egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set the bowl over the boiling water (don&#39;t let the bowl touch the water); continue whisking until the mixture is hot (135 degrees F) and the sugar dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer; beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to high and beat until stiff, thick and glossy, 2 to 3 more minutes. Spread the meringue on top of the pie.

Salt and pepper both sides of the fish. Sprinkle the mustard seeds evenly on the skin side of the fish. Dust skin of each filet with a scant amount of flour. Saute the fish, skin side down, until golden brown. Flip the fish over adding more oil as necessary. Remove from the heat. Paint the skin with a smear of Dijon mustard. Sprinkle each fillet with one tablespoon of fresh bread crumbs and one tablespoon of whole butter. Set fish on a small sheet pan. Preheat broiler. Place the fish under the broiler until the crumbs are nice and brown and the fish is cooked just through. Spritz with lemon. Place the fillet of fish on a plate. Serve with a piece of bacon and a spoon of the braising liquid. A spoon of the Chutney goes well on the bacon. Spoon a couple tablespoons of the Fish Sauce and some All English, All American frites (french fries, gaufrettes, etc.). Generously salt the fresh bacon. In a heavy bottom saucepan, cook the sugar and one cup of water over medium high heat. Cook the sugar until it becomes an amber, caramel color. Add the fish sauce and remaining water. In a small roasting pan, place the bacon and caramelized liquid. Cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake in a moderate oven (325 to 350 degrees) for approximately 2 1/2 to 3 hours. The bacon should be tender when a knife is inserted. Allow the bacon to cool, then slice it into 1/3-inch slices. The bacon should be heated in the liquid (braising) when ready to serve. Combine all ingredients. Cook over medium heat for approximately 40 minutes. Will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks. In a large saucepan, place all the fish bones, leeks, celery, parsley and peppercorns. Sweat together in oil for three to four minutes. Deglaze with white wine. Add enough water just to cover bones, approximately three cups. Simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, then strain. In a one quart saucepan, heat the stock and reduce to one cup of liquid. Add the heavy cream, and reduce by 1/3. Whisk in the butter.

Let stand for about 3 minutes. Whisk the whole wheat flour, unbleached flour, oats, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the sponge starter, cool water, honey, molasses, and oil to the yeast mixture. Mix with your fingers for 1 to 2 minutes, just long enough to break up the sponge (the mixture should look milky and be slightly foamy). Add the flour mixture to the bowl and stir with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Don&#39;t be concerned if the dough feels very sticky at this point. Lightly flour a work surface. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, until it becomes compact and elastic. It should be very moist but not mushy. If it feels too stiff to knead, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have a soft, malleable dough. If it&#39;s sloppy wet and impossible to knead, add another 1/4 to 1/3 cup (1 1/4 to 1 2/3 ounces) of whole wheat flour. Shape the dough into a loose ball and let it rest, covered with plastic wrap, on the lightly floured work surface for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Flatten the dough and stretch it gently into a rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the pecans and raisins evenly over the dough. Fold the whole mass into an envelope and knead and fold it gently until the nuts are well distributed, about 2 to 3 minutes. If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading. Some of the nuts may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise, when the dough has softened. Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, along with any loose nuts. Turn the dough to coat the top with oil, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. (You can also refrigerate this dough overnight and shape it and bake it the next day: Let it rise for 1 hour at room temperature, or until it looks slightly puffy but not doubled, before refrigerating. The next day, let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature before shaping it.) When the dough has doubled, loosen it from the bowl with lightly floured hands and gently pour it onto a floured work surface. Press any loose pecans into the dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a log. Spread the oats for topping on a flat plate or baking sheet. Use a pastry brush or a plant sprayer to lightly moisten the top of each log with water, then roll the tops of the loaves in the oats. Place each loaf seam side down in an oiled 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. Cover them with plastic wrap and allow to rise for about 2 hours, or until they have doubled in size (a finger pressed into the dough will leave an indentation). Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan directly below the stone. When the loaves have doubled, place the pans on the baking stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately shut the door. After 1 minute, using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves quickly 6 to 8 times then shut the oven door. Repeat the misting procedure 1 minute later. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tipped out of the pan and tapped on the bottom. The sides and bottom of the loaf should feel firm and slightly crusty. If the tops are browned but the sides are still somewhat soft, place the loaves directly on the stone to bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer. Transfer the loaves from the pans to a rack and allow to cool completely before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44156,&quot;Rose&#39;s Reuben Loaf 1 pound frozen pizza dough, or 2 (10-ounce) canisters, at room temperature 2 cups Russian Dressing, recipe follows 2 cups leftover minced corned beef 2 cups leftover sauerkraut, drained well 1 pound sliced Swiss cheese, domestic or imported Oil, for brushing 2 cups mayonnaise 1/2 cup drained pickle relish 5 pitted green olives, chopped fine 1/2 tablespoon olive juice 1/2 cup ketchup Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

In the bowl of the food processor, pulse the almonds until they become like a coarse, wet powder. Add the sugar, butter, flour, almond extract, cinnamon and egg and pulse until it forms a paste. Gently spread the frangipane in an even layer over the puff pastry, leaving a 1/2-inch border, and place the baking sheet back in the center of the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Bake until the frangipane and pastry are browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. In a small pot, warm the jam over low heat until it melts slightly, about 30 seconds. Transfer the puff to a flat surface and use a serrated knife to gently cut into 9 even pieces. Arrange the pieces close together on a serving platter as if they make a whole tart. Drizzle some of the warmed jam over the top edges of the pastry and frangipane to create a \u201cglue\u201d for the raspberries to stick to the pastry. Arrange the raspberries over the top of each piece. Drizzle the remaining jam gently over the raspberries and finish with a sprinkle of sugar for added texture. Serve at room temperature. Refrigerate the leftovers (if there are any!!). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44160,&quot;18th Century recipes for Onion Pie and French Canadian Pea Soup Yeast dough, for crust homemade or store bought 4 cups diced onions 3 tablespoons butter or safflower oil 2/3 cup diced slab bacon 4 large eggs 1 cup sour cream or yogurt 1 teaspoon caraway seeds 1 pound yellow peas 1/2 pound salt pork or ham bone 2 3/4 quarts water 3 onions 2 carrots, diced into small cubes 2 to 3 bay leaves 1 teaspoon savory Salt and pepper Instructions: Prepare yeast dough and let rise.

Working batches, cook the lasagna noodles until they are soft and pliable but not limp, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the pasta from the boiling water and lay flat on a sheet tray to cool. Reserve. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until brown and crumbly. Remove from pan and reserve on paper towels. Ditch the fat from the pan and add new olive oil along with 2 cloves of garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Bring the pan to medium-high heat. When the garlic becomes golden and very aromatic, remove it from the heat and discard. Toss in the mushrooms and season them with salt. Cook the mushrooms until they are soft and wilted and dark brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from pan and reserve. Repeat this process with the remaining garlic and the zucchini. In a small bowl, combine the ricotta, 1/2 the Parmigiano-Reggiano, the eggs, and the basil. Mix to combine well and season with salt. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch deep-dish baking dish, add a couple ladlefuls of sauce and spread out in an even layer. Arrange a layer of the lasagna noodles to completely cover the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the pasta. Place a layer of pasta going in the other direction as the first layer (this will give a little more stability). Spread a light layer of sauce on the pasta and sprinkle 1/3 of the sausage over the sauce, repeat this process with 1/3 of the mushrooms and zucchini. Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella and some of the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano over the veggies. Repeat these layers until all the ingredients have been used up or the pan is full. Be sure that there is a layer of pasta on top covered with sauce and sprinkled with mozzarella and Parmigiano. Cover with foil. Place the lasagna on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, about 1 hour 15 minutes, removing the foil for the last 15 minutes of cooking. Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing. Note: For optimal slicing, make and bake the lasagna the day before. Heat it up again before slicing. Coat a large saucepot with olive oil and add the pancetta. Bring the pot to medium-high heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, season generously with salt, and stir to coat with the olive oil. Cook the onions for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently; the onions should become very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill. Be sure to pass all of the pulp through the holes leaving only the stems and the seeds, and be sure to scrape the pulp off of the bottom of the food mill. That&#39;s all of the big money stuff! Add the tomatoes to the pot and rinse out one of the empty tomato cans with water and add that water to the pot (about 2 to 3 cups). Season generously with salt and taste it; tomatoes take a lot of salt. Season in baby steps and taste every step of the way. Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally and tasting frequently. Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need. This sauce can also be cooled and stored in the fridge for a few days or it freezes really well. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 44169,&quot;Ginger Simple Syrup for Fresh Fruits 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 2 inches fresh ginger root, peeled 4 to 6 cups fresh fruit chunks Instructions: Bring sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan over moderate heat.

To make the base, process the graham crackers to make rough crumbs and then add the butter and cocoa. Process again until it makes damp, clumping crumbs and then tip them into the pan. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan to make an even base and put into the freezer while you make the filling. Put a kettle on to boil. Melt the chocolate either in a microwave or double boiler, and set aside to cool slightly. Beat the cream cheese to soften it, then add the sugar and custard power, beating again to combine. Beat in the whole eggs and then the yolks, and the sour cream. Finally add the cocoa dissolved in hot water and melted chocolate and mix to a smooth batter. Take the springform tin out of the freezer and line the outside of the tin with a good layer of cling wrap, and then another layer of strong foil over that. This will protect it from the water bath. Sit the springform tin in a roasting pan and pour in the cheesecake filling. Fill the roasting pan with just boiled water to come about half way up the cake tin and bake in the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The top of the cheesecake should be set, but the underneath should still have a wobble to it. Peel away the foil and cling film wrapping and sit the cheesecake in its tin on a rack to cool. Put in the refrigerator once it is no longer hot, and leave to set, covered with plastic overnight. Let it lose its chill before unspringing the cheesecake to serve. To make the chocolate sauce: very gently melt the chopped chocolate, cream and syrup. When the chocolate has nearly melted, take off the heat and whisk it to a smooth sauce. Let it cool a little, and pour it over the chocolate cheesecake on its serving plate. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 44221,&quot;Root Vegetable Gratin 2 large russet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled<br> 1 large golden beet (about 1 pound), peeled<br> 1 large fennel bulb (about 12 ounces), trimmed<br> 2 large parsnips (about 10 ounces), peeled 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 1/2 cups shredded Parmesan cheese (6 ounces) Freshly ground black pepper Instructions:</p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the oil and, using your hands, rub it into the flour mixture until fully incorporated. While stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually add the water, until a shaggy dough is formed. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until soft and pliable, about 3 minutes. Rub a little oil, about 1 teaspoon, over the dough, place on a plate and cover with a damp towel. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour or overnight. For the filling: Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold tap water by about 2 inches, and season with salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain, transfer to a medium bowl and set aside to cool slightly. Using a fork, slightly smash the potatoes. Meanwhile, in a small food processor (mini-chopper), combine the onion, ginger, garlic, chiles, and 1 tablespoon water and puree to a paste. Heat the ghee in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mustard and cumin seeds and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the onion paste, salt, garam masala and turmeric and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring and mashing lightly with a wooden spoon, until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in the peas. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice, chopped cilantro and remaining 2 tablespoons water. To form the samosas: Divide the dough into 10 portions. Using your hands, roll each portion into a small ball. On a floured work surface, using a rolling pin, roll each ball into a 7-inch wide disc. Cut each disc in half. Set a small bowl of water beside you. Working with one dough semi-circle at a time, fold half of the straight edge up to the rounded side and wet its outside edge with a little water. Fold the other half up to form a cone, overlapping it with the other side by 1/4 inch. Press the edges together to form a seal. Hold the cone in one hand and fill it with about 1/4 cup of the potato filling. Slightly wet the inside of the rounded edge and fold it over the filling to enclose it. Press the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling to make 20 samosas. In a large, wide heavy-bottomed pot, pour in the oil to a depth of about 2 inches. Place over medium heat, and heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 365 degrees F. Working in small batches, fry the samosas until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Serve immediately with tamarind sauce or your favorite chutney. For the ghee: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Skim off any of the white foam that comes to the surface with a spoon (being careful not to scoop up any yellow fat from the butter) and discard. Lower the heat to medium and simmer until all of the water has evaporated and the white milk solids have browned in the bottom of the saucepan, about 8 minutes. Line a sieve with cheesecloth or a coffee filter and pour the butter through into a container. Discard the browned milk solids in the sieve or reserve for another use.

Sprinkle in 1/4 teaspoon of the sugar and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Turn the mixer on low speed and add the remaining water, sugar, melted margarine, eggs, and salt. Add 2 cups of the flour and turn the speed up to medium; continue to mix until incorporated. Gradually add the remaining flour, and continue to mix until the dough holds together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl; the dough will be very soft. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface, until smooth and elastic. Rub the inside of a mixing bowl with the oil and put the dough in it, turning to coat. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for about 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size. To prepare the filling: Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Add the orange zest, raisins, walnuts, and melted margarine. Fold the ingredients together to combine. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and brush with melted margarine. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle, about 10 by 18-inches. Brush the surface of the dough with melted margarine and spread the filling evenly across. Roll the dough up, jelly roll-style, into a long cylinder, and twist it a few times like your wringing out a towel. Put the dough on the sheet pan and coil it around like a pinwheel, tuck the loose end of the dough under so it doesn&#39;t unravel. Brush the top of the dough with more melted margarine. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour until your kitchen smells like cinnamon, and the babka is golden brown. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack. To prepare the orange glaze: Mix the all the ingredients together in a bowl, until the sugar dissolves. Whisk the glaze to smooth out any lumps; drizzle it over the top of the babka while it is still warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44278,&quot;Meat Pies 1/2 pound ground beef 1/2 pound ground lamb 1 quart coarsely chopped yellow onions 1 teaspoon corn oil 1/2 cup pine nuts 1 tablespoon lemon juice (or 1/2 fresh lemon) 1 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon dry yeast 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups warm water 3 tablespoons sugar 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: For the filling: Combine the beef and lamb in a large skillet and cook over high heat until browned and well done. Drain and reserve the drippings. Place the meat in a medium mixing bowl. Using the same skillet, caramelize the onions in the meat drippings. When the onions are nice and brown, remove them from the drippings and mix into the meat mixture. While the onions are caramelizing, preheat a small skillet with the corn oil. Add the pine nuts and toast until golden brown (they burn quickly, so don&#39;t walk away from them). Add the pine nuts to the meat mixture along with the lemon juice, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg and combine well. For the dough: Dissolve the yeast, salt and sugar in 1 cup of the warm water. Stir to dissolve the yeast. Add the flour to a large mixing bowl, stir in the yeast mixture and combine well. Add additional water, as needed, to make a medium-sized, stiff dough ball. Knead thoroughly. Cut into 2 equal dough balls, cover and let stand for 15 minutes. Lightly flour a large work surface and roll out each dough ball until approximately 1/8-inch thick. Cut the dough into circles with a 5-inch round cutter. Cover and let stand a second time for 15 minutes. Try to get as many round dough pieces as you can. Any excess dough can be rolled up and saved for more meat pies. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 2 sheet pans with nonstick cooking spray. Working quickly, place 5 of the rounds at a time, on a separate work surface. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the meat filling in the center of each round. Grabbing the opposite sides of the circle, pinch together in the middle. Then, pinch the rest of the dough closed, forming a triangular pie. Place on the prepared sheet pans. When all the pies have been formed, place the pans in the preheated oven and bake until the edges and bottoms of each pie begin to brown. Rotate the pans from bottom to top during baking.

Add the mozzarella, fontina, goat cheese and Pecorino Romano. Bake both pizzas until the crusts are golden and the cheese is bubbly, 12 to 15 minutes. For the tomato basil salad: While the pizzas are baking, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a small skillet. Add the garlic and stir, lightly frying for about a minute and removing it from the heat before the garlic gets too brown (it can be golden). Pour it into a mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly. Add the tomatoes, balsamic, basil and some salt and pepper to the bowl. Toss to combine, and then taste and add more basil if needed, and more salt if needed. Set aside. Top the four cheese pizza with the tomato basil salad. Cut the pizzas into slices and serve. Add a tablespoon or so of olive oil into a hot pan over medium-high heat. Throw in the garlic and chopped onions and give them a stir. Cook until the onions are soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth, whisking to deglaze the bottom of the pan. Cook until the liquid reduces by half. Add the crushed tomatoes and stir to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste and a pinch of sugar. Add the dried oregano and basil.

Coat a straight-sided pan with the vegetable oil and set over medium heat. Add the ginger and scallion whites and cook until aromatic, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rice, sprinkle with salt and cook for a minute or two to toast the rice. Deglaze with the sake and cook for about a minute to allow the alcohol to burn off. Add a few ladles of hot stock to the rice, just enough to cover, and cook, stirring constantly, until the rice has absorbed the stock. Add a few more ladles of stock and repeat. You will do this 4 to 6 times, until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked through but still has a nice bite to it. The whole process should take about 20 minutes. Once the rice is cooked, stir in the shrimp and edamame and let the heat of the rice gently cook the shrimp. Once the shrimp have turned opaque, stir in the miso paste. Beyond this point, do not let the risotto boil; miso tastes bitter if it boils. Check the seasoning and adjust the salt as needed. Add the mirin, lemon zest and juice and scallion greens and gently fold in the crabmeat. To plate, spoon a generous amount of risotto into a serving bowl, drizzle with a little sesame oil, add a splash of soy sauce and top with some nori. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 44294,&quot;Lemon-Pepper Capellini 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons butter 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 teaspoon coarse black pepper 2 lemons, zested and juiced Salt 1/2 pound capellini 1/2 cup shredded or torn basil leaves Grated cheese, to pass at table Instructions: Place water on to boil for pasta.

Brown the lamb shanks, in batches, in the pan and then remove to a roasting pan or whatever else you&#39;ve got at hand to sit them in. Peel the onions and garlic and process in a food processor or chop them finely by hand. Add the remaining oil to the pan, and fry the onion-garlic mush until soft, sprinkling salt over to stop it sticking. Stir in the turmeric, ground ginger, cl, cinnamon and nutmeg and season with some freshly ground pepper. Stir again, adding the honey, soy sauce and Marsala. Put the shanks back in the pan, add cold water almost to cover, bring to the boil then put a lid on the pan, lower the heat and simmer very gently for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Add the red lentils and cook for about 20 minutes longer with the lid, until the lentils have softened into the sauce and the juices have reduced and thickened slightly. Check for seasoning. Toast the nuts by heating them for a few minutes in a dry frying pan, and sprinkle onto the lamb as you serve it. Fill the bottom of a steamer, or base of a couscoussier should you possess one, with water and bring to a boil. When it looks like it&#39;s almost ready to boil, fill the kettle and put it on, then empty the couscous into a glass bowl, add the salt, crush in the cardamom and mix with your fingers, then pour over a quart of boiling water from the kettle and place a plate on top of the bowl. Leave to stand for 5 minutes, then drain and empty into the steamer or couscoussier top and sit this on top of the boiling water beneath. Add the slices of butter on top of the couscous then clamp on the lid and let steam for about 7 to 10 minutes, by which time the couscous should be tenderly cooked and the butter melting. (You can do this a simpler way if you prefer, by just steeping the couscous in the boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes, but the grains will be more dense and more likely to clump. It&#39;s not disastrous, however, and you must decide what you&#39;re prepared to do.) Meanwhile, toast the almonds by frying them in a dry pan until fragrant and golden, remove them to a plate, then do the same to the pine nuts. Chop the pistachios. Once the couscous is cooked, tip the bowl, fork through (and always use a fork for mixing or fluffing up couscous; a spoon will crush it and turn it stodgy), sprinkling in the almonds and pine nuts as you do so (and taste for seasoning at the same time, too). Now fork in most of the pistachios, and sprinkle those that remain lightly on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44296,&quot;Beer-Cheese Burgers 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon mustard powder 3/4 cup beer 1/2 cup half-and-half 6 ounces grated sharp yellow cheddar cheese 1 tablespoon horseradish 1 1/2 pounds ground beef, preferably chuck Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Vegetable oil, for the grill 4 poppy seed rolls, split Tomato slices, for topping 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high.

Whisk in the beer and bring to a simmer; whisk in the half-and-half until smooth. Return the sauce to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the cheese and horseradish until smooth; keep warm. Form the beef into four 6-ounce patties, about 3/4 inch thick; press the center of each patty with your thumb to make a 1/2-inch-deep indentation. Season the patties on both sides with salt and pepper. Lightly brush the grill grates with vegetable oil, then grill the patties, indentation-side up, until marked on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until marked and slightly firm, about 3 more minutes for medium doneness. Remove the patties to a plate and let rest 5 minutes. Grill the rolls, cut-side down, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Top the bun bottoms with the burger patties, cheese sauce, tomato and chives.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). Remove the puff pastry from the refrigerator. If you are only making 1 thing at a time, return the rest of the puff pastry to the refrigerator. Cheese twists: Place a piece of puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface and pat it into a rectangle. Use a rolling pin to roll the puff pastry into a 12 by 20-inch rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Roll the dough thinly because it will rise in the oven. Flour the dough and table as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the table or the rolling pin. Place the dough on your work surface with a long side facing you. Use a pastry brush to coat the surface of the rectangle with some egg wash. Liberally sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the rectangle, followed by the salt and pepper. Use a sharp paring knife to cut the rectangle into 1-inch-wide strips from top to bottom. Flip each strip so that the cheese is on the bottom. Twist each strip by rolling each end in opposite directions. Always remember to twist so that the topping faces out --that way you can see how they are flavored. Place the strips on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and bake until well risen and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Anchovy puffs: Place a piece of puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface and pat it into a rectangle. Roll the dough into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle with the long side facing you and cut it in half from top to bottom. Use a pastry brush to coat 1 piece of the dough with egg wash. Lay the anchovy fillets spaced about 1-inch apart from top to bottom on the egg-washed dough. Place the other rolled-out dough half on top of the anchovies and mark each anchovy by pressing the dough on either side of each fillet. Use a sharp paring knife to cut between each puff pastry-covered fillet. Next, cut the filled strips in half from top to bottom to make small anchovy packets. Use a knife to score the top of the dough at a diagonal. Place on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and brush with more egg wash. Bake until well risen and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Olive puffs: Place a piece of puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface and pat it into a rectangle. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle and repeat the procedure of making anchovy strips using olives instead. There is no need to cut these in half. Just cut between the olives to make small packages. Baking and cooling is the same. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 44300,&quot;Goat Cheese and Thyme Crackers 4 ounces goat cheese 2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature 4 sprigs thyme, leaves removed and lightly chopped Zest of 1 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup flour Instructions: In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment blend the goat cheese and butter until smooth.

Place the steaks in a ziptop bag, pour the marinade over the steaks and marinate at least 30 minutes and up to overnight. Before grilling, remove the steaks from the bag and pour the remaining marinade into a small pan. Bring the marinade to a boil, lower to a simmer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Use this sauce to drizzle on the steaks as soon as you remove them from the grill. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for high heat. When up to temperature, grease the grates with a little oil, then place the steaks over the hottest part of the grill. Depending on the thickness of the steaks and the temperature of the grill, the steaks should grill about 3 minutes per side for medium rare (flank steak is best served medium rare).

Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 44303,&quot;Chocolate Mint Bites 2 1/4 cups heavy cream 1 cup fresh mint leaves<br> One 10-ounce bag bittersweet chocolate chips<br> One 10-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 cup crushed chocolate or mint-chocolate cookies<br> 1 cup chopped pecans<br> 1 cup chopped semisweet chocolate Instructions: Heat the cream in a medium saucepot over low heat. Smack the mint between your hands to help release the oils; add the mint to the cream. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat, cover and let steep for 30 minutes. Heat the cream back to a simmer. Place the bittersweet and semisweet chocolate chips in a large bowl and strain the hot mint cream over the chocolate. Let sit for 2 minutes to let the chocolate melt. Add the salt and whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and blended into the cream. Pour into a baking dish. Cover and refrigerate until chilled and set, 2 hours. Using a small round scoop, melon baller or tablespoon measure, scoop out tablespoon-size balls of the chilled chocolate and place on a baking sheet. You&#39;ll need some rubber gloves for the next part. Roll each ball in your hands so that it is uniform and smooth, then place back on the baking sheet. Place the crushed cookies, chopped nuts and chopped semisweet chocolate in 3 separate dishes. Roll each chocolate ball in one of the coatings, making sure it is completely covered. Place on a baking sheet, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Brachetto]&quot; 44304,&quot;Crack Proof Cheesecake 2 cups finely ground graham crackers (about 30 squares) 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted 2 (8-ounce) blocks cream cheese, room temperature 1 cup sugar 3 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 lemon, zest finely grated 1 pint sour cream 2 tablespoons butter 2 pints blueberries 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 lemon, juiced Instructions: To prepare crumb crust: In a mixing bowl, combine the crust ingredients together with a fork until evenly moistened. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with non-stick cooking spray. Firmly press the mixture over the bottom and 1-inch up the sides on the pan, use your fingers or the smooth bottom of a glass. Refrigerate the crust while preparing the filling. To prepare filling: In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese on low speed for 1 minute just until smooth and free of any lumps. Gradually add the sugar and beat until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Periodically scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to slowly beat until combined. Stir in the vanilla and lemon zest. Blend in the sour cream. The batter should be well mixed but not overbeaten. Overbeating incorporates too much air and will cause the cake to puff when baking, then fall and crack when cooling. Pour filling into the crust-lined pan and smooth the top with a spatula. To prepare water bath: Set the pan on a large piece of aluminum foil and fold up the sides. This will prevent water from seeping into the seams of the springform pan. Carefully set the cake pan in a larger roasting pan. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until the water is about halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 45 minutes. The cheesecake should still jiggle, it will firm up after chilling. Be careful not to overcook! Do not do a toothpick test in the cake&#39;s center, this will make a crack. Loosen the cheesecake from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim. Let cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for at least 4 hours to set up. Demold and transfer to a cake plate. Slice the cheesecake with a thin, nonserrated knife that has been dipped in hot water and wiped dry after each cut. For the topping: Combine all ingredients in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring up to a slow boil and stir gently until the berries breakdown and release their natural juice. The consistency should remain a bit chunky. Cool to room temperature and serve on top of cheesecake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44305,&quot;Almond Chocolate Biscuits 1 cup whole skin-on almonds 1/2 cup sugar 2 large egg whites 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped Instructions:</p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Chianti, Riesling]&quot; 44308,&quot;Rice Pilaf 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 shallot, thinly sliced 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 cups basmati-style long grain rice 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 bay leaf 1 sprig fresh rosemary Instructions: Melt the butter with the shallot in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Season with the salt and pepper and cook until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir until coated with the butter. Increase the heat to medium-high. Let the rice cook until toasted, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the broth, bay leaf, and rosemary. Bring to a simmer over low heat, cover, and cook until all the broth has been absorbed by the rice and the rice is tender, about 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from the heat and let set for 5 minutes. Discard the rosemary and bay leaf. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 44309,&quot;Grilled Scallop Ceviche 1 1/2 pounds sea scallops (preferably dry-packed) 2 tablespoons minced seeded jalapeno pepper 1 cup Mojito Marinade (see below) 2 tablespoons finely diced red bell pepper 1 lime, cut into 8 wedges 1/4 cup chopped garlic 1/2 cup chopped onion 2 cups fresh orange juice 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 1/2 cup olive oil 4 teaspoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon black pepper 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Plop the scallops into a glass or stainless steel bowl. Combine the jalapenos and the Mojito Marinade and pour over the scallops. Marinate for 1 to 2 hours in the fridge. Fire up the grill; then get back inside and fish the scallops out of the marinade. Dry them off really well, and string them onto skewers (if you&#39;re using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for 10 minutes before skewering). Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring it to a rapid boil. Toss in the red peppers, turn the heat to low, and simmer for 2 minutes. Keep warm Grill the scallops over the hot coals for about 2 minutes on each side, or till the edges are tinged with a rich brown color and the flesh turns opaque. Ring a plate with lime wedges. Slide the scallops off the skewers and pile them up in the center of the plate. Pour on the sauce and serve family style, with a bunch of toothpicks so everyone can dig in. Mix together the garlic, onions, orange juice, and lime juice in a bowl. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan till just smoking. Now cover up your arms and put some potholder mitts on your hands because you&#39;re about to do something that is contrary to good cooking practice but produces great flavor release. Slice the contents of the bowl into the hot oil--be very careful because the liquid will splatter. Simmer for 5 minutes to soften the onions and garlic. Season the marinade with the rest of the ingredients. Pour everything into a blender or food processor and pulse 3 times to combine. Pour into a plastic container and cool to room temperature; then cover and refrigerate.

Split the vanilla beans in half lengthwise and scrape out all the vanilla \caviar\ inside. Stir the caviar into the cream. Set aside for 15 minutes. Sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut the cold butter into pats, and then use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the butter into the flour. Keep going until the mixture resembles crumbs. Mix the vanilla cream with the egg, and then combine with the flour mixture. Stir gently with a fork just until it comes together. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle. (Mixture will be pretty crumbly.) Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 12-by-7 inches and 1/2-to-3/4-inches thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. Then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical squares/rectangles. Next, cut each square/rectangle in half diagonally, to form two triangles. Transfer to a parchment or baking-mat-lined cookie sheet and bake for 18 minutes, removing from the oven just before they start to turn golden. Allow to cool for 15 minutes on the cookie sheet, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. For the glaze: Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape out the caviar. Stir the caviar into the milk. Set aside for 15 minutes. Mix the powdered sugar and salt with the vanilla milk, adding more powdered sugar or milk if necessary to get the right consistency. Stir or whisk until completely smooth. One at a time, carefully dunk each cooled scone in the glaze, turning it over if necessary. Transfer to parchment paper or the cooling rack.

Line a baking sheet or large plate very, very tightly with plastic wrap (the wrap will be slightly suspended over the surface of the pan). Transfer the truffle mixture to a piping bag fitted with a plain 1/4-inch tip. Holding the bag about 1/4-inch over the surface of the plastic wrap, pipe about 25 (3/4-inch) cones or truffles. Sprinkle the truffle tops lightly with sugar. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes. Once set, the truffles can be held in a cool spot, out of the refrigerator for up to 2 hours. Otherwise, refrigerate the truffles covered, for up to 5 days. Truffles taste best if served room temperature not straight from the refrigerator. Finely grate the zest from the citrus with a fine holed grater, preferably a micro plane. Add half of the zest to the cream, (reserve the rest for decorating the truffles.) Bring the cream, zest and honey to a simmer, remove from the heat. Puree mixture with an immersion blender to combine the flavors. Proceed as above to form the truffles. Gently rub the turbinado sugar and the reserved zest together with your fingers. Sprinkle citrus flavored sugar on top of truffles. Pulse the fennel seed, confectioners&#39; sugar, and cocoa in a spice grinder to a fine powder. Roll basic chocolate truffle in fennel-cocoa mixture. Add 2 tablespoons malt powder to the cream and proceed with the basic recipe as above. Roll finished chocolate truffle in the 1/4 cup malt powder. Stem and seed the cl, then toast in a dry skillet over medium heat until small whiffs of smoke waft from the cl. Add the cl to the cream and honey mixture and bring to a simmer. Cover and let set for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how spicy you like your truffles. Strain and discard the cl. Proceed as above to form the truffles. Mix the turbinado sugar, chili powder, cinnamon, and sea salt together. Sprinkle seasoned sugar on top of the truffles. Add the crystallized ginger to the cream. Bring cream, ginger and honey to a simmer, remove from the heat and puree with an immersion blender to combine the flavors. Proceed as above to form the truffles. Finely chop additional crystallized ginger to equal about a tablespoon and lightly press onto the top of truffles. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 44327,&quot;Chickpea Chicken-Noodle Soup 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 ounces spaghetti, broken into small pieces 1 carrot, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 small skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 pound), thinly sliced Instructions: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.

Add the river rocks and cover with enough of the wood to get the fire underway to heat the rocks. (You will add the additional wood as needed.) Start the fire (to heat the rocks to 800 degrees F). Add the metal panels on top of the fire to contain heat without smothering the fire. Using assistance place the gutted pig in the supine position on the stretcher-like platform and wrap the affixed chicken wire around to mostly secure the pig, but leaving enough room to be able to put the heated lava rocks inside the body cavity. Place some banana \stumps\ in the body cavity of the pig to serve as a buffer between the hot coals and the pig meat to prevent the flesh from burning. Protecting your face, hands, and body with proper gear and using safe equipment, remove enough of the metal panels from the fire to retrieve the heated rocks with fire safe tongs. Someone will use heavy fire mitts to hold the rocks in a pair of tongs, while the other person uses the ti leaves \brush\ to dust off the ash. The rocks with the ash removed are then placed one-by-one in the cavity of the pig so it will cook from the inside out with dry heat. Place some additional banana \stumps\ in the body cavity of the pig to serve as a buffer between the hot coals and the pig meat to prevent the flesh from burning. The carcass of the pig is then closed with chicken wire and additional metal wire as needed to secure the chicken wire. Remove the attachments that have been holding the chicken wire to the stretcher. Transfer the pig to sit atop the metal panels of the imu, and use the additional ti leaves like aluminum foil, placing them dull side up, shiny side down in a cross configuration to steam the exterior of the pig with the moisture from the ti leaves. When the pig is cooked through, approximately eight hours, use assistance to remove it from the fire, let rest for 30 minutes, then carve it down. The cheeks of the pig should be reserved for the most honored guest. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44333,&quot;Tortellini in Broth with Arugula 4 cups chicken stock or broth 1 (9 1/2-ounce) package mushroom or cheese-filled tortellini 1 bunch arugula leaves, rinsed and patted dry Freshly grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: In a large saucepan set over moderate heat bring the broth to a simmer and simmer 3 minutes.
