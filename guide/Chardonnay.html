Arrange about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Use the handle of a wooden spoon to indent the centers, pinching together any large cracks (a few small cracks are fine). Refrigerate until firm, 20 to 30 minutes. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Fill each indentation with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon jam. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are set and lightly browned on the bottom, 20-25 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 4940,&quot;Pumpkin Pie with Bourbon-Maple Whipped Cream and Cinnamon Crunch 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup quick-cooking oats 1/2 cup light muscovado sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 7 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes 2 cups graham cracker crumbs 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 large egg, lightly beaten 3 large eggs, plus 3 egg yolks 3/4 cup dark muscovado sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons molasses 1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin puree 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon, plus more for the top 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup whole milk 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped out (or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract) 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 1/4 cups cold heavy cream 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped out 2 tablespoons Grade B maple syrup 1 to 2 tablespoons bourbon Instructions: Make the cinnamon crunch: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the flour, oats, light muscovado sugar and cinnamon in a food processor and process a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse until combined. Pat the mixture evenly into a 4-inch square on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool. Transfer to a cutting board and chop into small pieces. Keep the oven on. Make the crust: Combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter and cinnamon in a bowl and mix until combined. Press evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch pie plate. Brush with the beaten egg. Bake until golden brown and firm, about 12 minutes. Let cool on a rack. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Make the filling: Whisk the eggs, egg yolks, dark muscovado sugar, granulated sugar and molasses in a medium bowl. Whisk in the pumpkin puree, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and salt. Whisk in the heavy cream, milk and vanilla seeds or extract. Strain the mixture through a coarse strainer into a bowl. Whisk in the melted butter. Place the pie plate on a baking sheet, pour the pumpkin filling into the crust and sprinkle additional cinnamon over the top. Bake until the filling is set around the edges but the center still jiggles slightly when shaken, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Make the whipped cream: Combine the heavy cream, vanilla seeds, maple syrup and bourbon, to taste, in a large chilled bowl and whip until soft peaks form. Top the pie with the whipped cream and cinnamon crunch. Top off your feast with one (or more!) of these tasty pies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 4941,&quot;Cod Lyonnaise 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch cubes 1 1/2 pounds sweet onions, diced into 1/2-inch cubes Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 recipe Seared Cod, recipe follows 6 sprigs flat-leaf parsley, leaves finely chopped 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 (6-ounce) center-cut cod fillets, skin left on Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cloves garlic, lightly crushed 4 sprigs thyme 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: Make the Lyonnaise Garnish: Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and cook, tossing, for 10 minutes. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the onions are translucent and the potatoes are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour in the vinegar and cook until it has reduced to a glaze. Make the Seared Cod: Heat the olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Season the fillets with salt and pepper and slip them into the pan, skin side down, along with the garlic and thyme. Sear the fillets for 3 minutes, turn them over and cook for 3 minutes more. Reduce the heat to medium, add the butter and cook another 3 minutes, or until the fish is opaque, moist and lightly firm when pressed. Spoon the Lyonnaise garnish onto a serving platter, top with the seared cod, and sprinkle with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 4942,&quot;Chocolate Cornucopia 15 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered 2 pounds white chocolate, tempered Cocoa butter Sorbet or ice cream, to fill the fruit molds Powdered food coloring, as desired Cocoa butter, for spray painting Instructions: Make the chocolate fruits: Use a ladle to fill a fruit mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. Repeat to make as many fruits as you will need for your centerpiece. For my centerpiece, I used lemons, pears, oranges, bananas, pineapples and apples. When the chocolate has set, remove the fruits from the molds. Make the leaves: Use a pastry brush dipped in white chocolate to coat one side of the plastic leaf. Allow the chocolate to set and then peel off the plastic leaf. Repeat to make as many leaves as you would like. Use the same technique to make smaller leaves for the pineapple stem. Assemble the pineapple stem. I used a plastic dome mold to give my pineapple stem its final shape. You could also use a small glass bowl. Place a small dollop of white chocolate in the bottom of the mold. Add leaves resting the ends in the chocolate and the tops along the side of the bowl. Add another layer. Continue this process to make as big of a stem as you like. When the chocolate has set, pop the stem out of the mold. Paint the fruit and the leaves: If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate as you are inspired. Use an airbrush to paint the pineapple stem and the leaves green. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the stem to the top of the pineapple. Paint each of the fruit, as you are inspired to do so. Make a base: Place metal rulers on a parchment paper lined surface so they form an open space that measures about 24? by 16 inches. If you don?t have metal rulers, you could also use modeling clay or wood rulers. Place a very large cake ring or a round of aluminum flashing that is 13? inches in diameter inside the space. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring and open space to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and the rulers and peel off the parchment paper. The ring is inside but separate from the rest of the base so you can move the finished cornucopia to any position. Make the base supports: Place metal rulers on a parchment paper lined surface so they form an open square that measures about 8 inches. Pour tempered chocolate inside the space to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate begins to set but is not yet hard, use a knife to cut a line that resembles 3 half circles end to end. The curves in this piece match the curves in the mold of the cornucopia. When we are ready to set the cornucopia in place, it will rest on these triangles. When the chocolate has set, remove the rulers and peel off the parchment paper. Make the chocolate cornucopia: The mold I used was about 12 inches wide and 30 inches long. Use a ladle to pour some chocolate into 1 half of the mold. Use a pastry brush to distribute the chocolate over the entire mold. You may want to repeat this step so the finished piece is about 3/8-inch thick. Repeat with the other half of the mold. Clip the 2 halves of the mold together. Place the mold inside a box and pour chocolate inside of it. Rotate the mold so the chocolate evenly coats the inside. Pour the excess chocolate back into the mold and place the mold upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. When the chocolate is set, remove the mold. Stand the cornucopia on its open end. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the triangular base pieces to the cornucopia. Position them so they will support the cornucopia when it is standing in its final position. Prepare the paint sprayer: Place equal amounts of dark chocolate and cocoa butter over a double boiler and melt until smooth with no lumps. Place the cornucopia in the freezer for about 20 minutes. The surface of the chocolate must be chilled so the chocolate coating will harden upon contact, giving it the desired texture. Remove the cornucopia from the freezer and place on a flat surface. Place the chocolate mixture in a clean paint sprayer and use it to spray the dessert with the chocolate. Tip: Cleanup will be easier if you use a cardboard box as a backdrop to the mold when you spray it. Spray the chocolate with the sprayer to give it a chocolate velvet texture. Fill the fruits: Use a piping bag or offset spatula or spoon to fill each fruit mold with the appropriate sorbet flavor. Fill completely and place into the molded chocolate fruit back in the freezer until ready to use. You can also use tempered chocolate to close some of the fruit molds Tip: This process can be done 1 to 2 days in advance. Assembly: Tip: Anything that touches the cornucopia after it has been sprayed will leave a mark. If you have to move it, place your hand well inside the mold and move it by touching only the inside. Transfer the sprayed cornucopia onto the circle of the base. You can touch the base to rotate the presentation into any position. Arrange the frozen chocolate fruits and leaves within the cornucopia.

In a small saucepan, add the water and sprinkle the gelatin on top to soften for about 5 minutes. Begin to heat the gelatin and stir until the gelatin is dissolved and clear. Do not boil. Turn off the heat and add the glucose and glycerine, stirring until well blended. Add the flavoring. Pour into the well of sugar, and mix until all of the sugar is blended. Use hands to knead icing until it becomes stiff. Add small amounts of confectioner&#39;s sugar if the mixture is sticky. Form the mixture into a ball and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place in an airtight container. This icing works best if allowed to rest at room temperature for about eight hours before using, particularly if the weather is humid. Do not refrigerate. To cover a cake with fondant: Dust a clean pastry cloth, or a smooth, clean surface, with cornstarch and roll the fondant with a rolling pin until it is approximately 1/4 inch thick. Make sure that the fondant is large enough to fit over the top and sides of the cake. Slide both hands under the fondant and carefully center it on top of a cake that has been freshly iced with buttercream. (The icing makes the fondant adhere to the cake.) Dust your hands with cornstarch and smooth the fondant, starting at the top and working down the sides until the entire surface is even and flat. Cut off the excess icing around the bottom of the cake with a pizza cutter or sharp knife. Decorate the cake with buttercream or royal icing. This fondant keeps a cake fresh for two days at room temperature. Do not refrigerate a cake with fondant icing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 4947,&quot;Leafy Greens with Italian-Style Caramelized Vegetables 3/4 cup Hidden Valley?

Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, then insert a round of parchment cut to fit just inside the bottom of each pan. Butter the parchment, then flour the pans, tapping out any excess flour.<br> In a medium bowl, stir together the cake flour, baking powder and salt.<br> Using an electric, standing or hand mixer, beat the butter and granulated sugar until very fluffy and pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, then add the vanilla followed by the lemon zest and juice--the mixture may appear to break apart a bit or curdle, but it will come back together when the flour is added, so don&#39;t panic! Add about a third of the flour mixture and mix until just barely incorporated, then add half of the milk and blend. Repeat with one-third of the flour mixture, the rest of the milk and the rest of the flour mixture and blend until the ingredients are just completely incorporated.<br> Scrape down the sides of the bowl in the middle of this process. Scrape the batter into the prepared pans, dividing it evenly and smoothing the tops. Bake until a wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 22 to 26 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then run a knife around the insides of the pans to make sure the sides don&#39;t stick, place a wire rack over the top of each pan and invert the cake onto the wire rack. Peel off the parchment and cool completely.<br> For the lemon filling: While the cakes are baking, make the lemon curd. Whisk the granulated sugar, lemon juice, butter, egg yolks and salt in a small nonreactive saucepan. Place the pan over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Place the lemon curd in a small bowl, press a piece of plastic wrap on top of the surface and place it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours and up to a week.<br> Briskly stir the lemon zest into the chilled curd to blend well. In a medium bowl, beat the heavy cream just until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the lemon curd with a rubber spatula. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour but not more than 6 hours.<br> For the lemon frosting: In a large bowl with an electric, standing or hand mixer, beat the confectioners&#39; sugar with the butter on low speed until combined, then turn the beater speed to high and add the cream and lemon zest and juice. Beat until fluffy.<br> To assemble the cake, place each cake layer upside down on a round of cardboard or a flat plate. Using an offset spatula or butter knife, frost the top and sides of each cake layer with a very thin layer of the lemon frosting. Place the cake layers in the freezer for 15 minutes or in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to firm up the thin layer of frosting.<br> Place the bottom layer of cake on the platter that you will be serving it on and tuck thick strips of wax or parchment paper under the edges of the cake to keep the platter clean. Spread the lemon filling over the bottom layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border all around so the filling has a bit of room to spread when you place the second layer on top. Cover the filling with the raspberries, then place the second layer of cake on top.<br> Frost the cake with the rest of the frosting. The cake will keep for up to 4 days in the refrigerator, though it&#39;s best within a day of making. Bring to room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 4971,&quot;Oven-baked Salmon 12 ounce salmon fillet, cut into 4 pieces Coarse-grained salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Color about 2 cups buttercream orange. Color about 2 cups buttercream turquoise. Transfer each color as well as the remaining 4 cups white buttercream to pastry bags fitted with large plain round tips. Arrange a 4-by-6 rectangle of cupcakes. Cover all the cupcakes with about half the white buttercream and spread to cover. Chill the cupcakes until the frosting is firm, about 15 minutes. Starting at one of the top corners the rectangle, pipe horizontal lines in different colors and thicknesses, keeping the lines as straight as possible. Reserve about a quarter of each frosting to decorate the top.<br> Use a bench scraper (a flat and rectangular metal baking tool) to flatten and smooth the buttercream: With a gentle amount of pressure, drag the bench scraper along the buttercream in the same direction as the stripes, making sure to clean it after each swipe. Pipe an orange pair of flip flops on the blanket and make the strap with sour belts. Pipe a white outline of sunglasses and fill in the lens with blue. Pipe a white sunscreen bottle on the blanket.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Sprinkle the short ribs all over with 1 teaspoon salt. Brown the short ribs all over, in batches if needed, removing to a plate as they brown, 4 to 5 minutes. When all of the ribs are out, add the carrot, celery and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Make a spot in the center of the pot and add the tomato paste, rosemary, thyme, red pepper flakes and three-quarters of the garlic. Let sizzle for a minute or so, then stir into the vegetables. Add the wine and bring to a boil, then cook until reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the bay leaves and 3 cups stock. Return to a simmer and add the short ribs in one layer. Cover and bake, stirring halfway through and adding more stock to keep the ribs almost covered, until the short ribs are very tender and falling from the bone, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove the short ribs from the oven. Use 2 forks to shred the meat, discarding the bones and cartilage. For the crispy panko topping, heat the remaining tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining garlic and cook until sizzling. Add the panko. Cook and stir until the crumbs are coated with the oil. Continue to cook and toss until the crumbs are crisp and golden, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, then stir in 2 tablespoons parsley and season with salt. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the Gnocchi. Return the sauce in the Dutch oven to a simmer. Add the Gnocchi to the boiling water and boil until they float. Simmer until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes from the time they begin to float. Remove with a large spider to the simmering sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and toss to coat the Gnocchi in the sauce, adding a little of the Gnocchi cooking water if the sauce seems too dry. Serve in pasta bowls, sprinkled with the crispy panko topping. Dust a baking sheet with flour and set aside. Put the whole, unpeeled potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water by about an inch. Bring to a simmer and cook until tender when pierced with a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and let cool just enough that you can peel them. (They should still be quite warm.) Use a ricer or food mill to rice the potatoes right onto your work surface in a thin layer. Let cool completely. Sprinkle the salt and some pepper over the cooled potatoes. Drizzle the beaten egg over the potatoes and sprinkle the flour over the egg. Flour your hands and knead the dough until it comes together in a loose clump. Knead just until the dough comes together in a cohesive mass (don&#39;t overwork it)\u2014the dough should be a tight ball, not crumbly, but not too moist. You know the dough is right if you cut it in half and it&#39;s the texture of chocolate chip cookie dough (without the chips!). Cut the dough into quarters, keeping the others covered as you work. Roll a piece of dough into a long snake about 3/4-inch thick and cut crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick pieces. Dust the pieces well with flour. Hold a fork in your non-dominant hand. Rest a piece of dough at the top of the tines of the fork and roll down with the thumb of your other hand, making a little concave depression in the gnocchi to catch sauce. Repeat with the remaining dough. Transfer the floured gnocchi to the prepared baking sheet. (Gnocchi can also be frozen right on the baking sheet\u2014once they are solid, transfer to a zip-top bag for longer storage. Add a minute or two to the cooking time if cooking from frozen.) &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 4975,&quot;Maple Sage Bacon-Wrapped Turkey Breast with Stuffing Croutons Nonstick cooking spray, for the parchment paper 1/2 pound bacon (about 8 strips)<br> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature Six to eight 2-inch slices baguette<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh sage<br> 2 tablespoons maple syrup<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> One 7- to 8-pound skin-on boneless split turkey breast Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray. Shingle the bacon strips side-by-side on the parchment paper, allowing the edges to overlap slightly.

Place the salmon fillets on a cutting board, skin-side down. Cut down the center of each fillet lengthwise along the center seam. Cut through the flesh but not the skin. Draw the salmon flesh apart at the incision, flattening the fillets, leaving them skin-side down. Fold each fillet into a horseshoe shape, bending it back onto itself, so it resembles a boneless salmon steak. Brush each piece of fish lightly on both sides with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper.<br> Grill the salmon just until the flesh firms and grill marks appear, about 2 1/2 minutes on the first side and about 1 1/2 minutes on the second side. Rotate each fillet one quarter-turn (90 degrees) and grill just long enough to mark the fillets, completing a cross-hatch pattern, less than 1 minute. Turn the fillets over and repeat the grilling and rotating procedure until the other sides show the cross-hatch grill markings. Remove the fish from the grill and reserve. (The salmon can be grilled up to 1 hour in advance of the meal.)<br> Prepare the salad: Roll the cucumber pieces up in a clean linen napkin or towel, and then smash them, pressing down hard with the heels of your hands while ensuring the towel doesn&#39;t unroll, to release the juices. Transfer the crushed cucumbers to a cutting board, and then coarsely chop. Combine the cucumbers, sliced fennel, dates, walnuts, chives and some of the fennel fronds in a salad bowl and mix gently.<br> Finish cooking the salmon and dress the salad: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the salmon fillets in a baking dish, brush each one lightly with extra-virgin olive oil and roast about 3 1/2 minutes for medium-rare.<br> Meanwhile, dress the cucumber salad with the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of fruity olive oil. Then season with sea salt and pepper. Toss the salad lightly, and then arrange equal portions on each of six plates. Top each portion of salad with a grilled salmon fillet. Drizzle a little fruity olive oil on top of each portion, garnish each plate with fennel fronds and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 5007,&quot;Grilled Avocado, Tomato, Red Onion Salad 10 tomatoes, quartered 4 avocados, peeled, halved, and pitted Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1 red onion, sliced 1/2 lemon 1 cup pesto sauce 1/2 cup pine nuts Parmiggiano-Reggiano Instructions: Preheat a grill over medium heat. Cover a large tray with tomato quarters, and set aside. Place avocado halves in a bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Place each half on a hot open grill for about 30 to 45 seconds. Remove and place on top of the tomatoes arranged on tray. Drizzle with olive oil again. In another bowl, cover the red onion slices with the juice from the lemon half and olive oil. Place onions in the empty avocado pit holes. Cover with the lemon/olive oil mix. Then, top with pesto, distributing generously on all sides.

Generously coat a 13-by-9-inch straight-sided baking dish (preferably glass) with cooking spray. Separate the egg whites and yolks into 2 medium bowls. Whisk the whites until combined and just foamy, then transfer them to the prepared baking dish. Cover the dish with foil and bake until they have fully set, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely in the baking dish. Meanwhile, beat the yolks until smooth. Lightly coat a medium nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Add the yolks, and scramble over medium-low heat until fully cooked and slightly dry, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the yolks to a food processor. Add the sour cream, mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, hot sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, and pulse until smooth and creamy. Spoon the yolk mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip, or a resealable plastic bag with the tip cut off. Put a platter on top of the baking dish with the egg whites and flip to turn them out onto the platter. With a long sharp knife, trim about 1/4-inch from the edges, including any browned outer edges, to make a neat rectangle of whites. Cut the trimmings into 1/4-inch cubes that will be used for \stars\ (discard any with browned edges). Cut the large rectangle of egg whites into 54 square pieces: 6 rows across and 9 columns down. Straighten the eggs to keep the rectangle together. Pipe a heaping amount of the egg yolk mixture onto the upper left-hand corner of the rectangle (this will be the section of the flag that holds the stars). Use the rest of the yolk filling to generously pipe 6 horizontal stripes right over the middle of each egg (see Cook&#39;s Note). Sprinkle the corner square with parsley and the stripes with paprika or cayenne. Top the parsley with the small dice \stars. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 5010,&quot;Smoked Sausage with BBQ Remoulade and Green Tomato Chowchow Relish 1 cup cider vinegar 2 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon celery seeds<br> 1 teaspoon mustard seeds<br> 3 green tomatoes, seeded and diced<br> 1 large red bell pepper, grilled, peeled, seeded and diced<br> 1 large yellow bell pepper, grilled, peeled, seeded and diced<br> 1 jalapeno, grilled and diced<br> 1 small red onion, finely diced<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 3/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup whole-grain mustard<br> 3 tablespoons prepared barbecue sauce, such as Bobby Flay Mesa Grill BBQ Sauce 3 cornichons, finely diced<br> 2 green onions, green and pale green parts, finely diced<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/2 pounds smoked pork sausage links (12 to 14 links)<br> Thick-cut grilled bread, for serving<br> Instructions: For the green tomato chowchow relish: Combine the vinegar, sugar, salt, celery seeds and mustard seeds in a small saucepan, bring to a boil and cook until the sugar is dissolved.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> In a mixing bowl, toss together the Parmesan, lemon zest and parsley until combined.<br> In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg with 2 teaspoons water to make an egg wash.<br> On a floured work surface, gently roll out the puff pastry sheet, removing any fold marks but keeping the same general size and shape. Using a sharp knife or a pizza wheel, cut forty 1-by-2-inch rectangles. Place an olive in the middle of a rectangle and gently wrap the pastry around the olive, pinching the seam and ends to seal. Coat the wrapped olive first in egg wash and then in cheese mixture. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pastry and olives.<br> Bake until golden brown and crispy, about 15 minutes.

It shouldn&#39;t simmer; there should be just a bubble rising to the surface every now and then. Meaty beef bones add more depth and complexity. (If you have beef stock, you can add two cups of it in place of the beef bones.) This sauce is chunky with abundant tomato and sliced garlic. Depending on what you&#39;re using this for, it can be served as is (over a very thick hearty pasta or as part of a braising liquid). But if you were to use it for an angel hair or as a sauce for sauteed veal, you would probably want to puree it in a blender until it&#39;s uniformly smooth. This sauce freezes well, so you can make big batches, portion it into smaller containers, and freeze it when you need it. Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan or large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 2 minutes. Add the salt and garlic and cook until everything is soft but not browned, about 3 minutes.<br> Squeeze the tomatoes one by one into the pan, pulverizing them by hand, and pour in their juice, too. Add the bones, wine, oregano, red pepper flakes, if using, black pepper and bay leaf. Bring the sauce to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to its lowest possible setting, and continue to cook for 8 hours. The sauce should reduce by about one-third.<br> Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary. Remove the bones and bay leaf. If not using right away, let the sauce cool, then cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]&quot; 5015,&quot;Chocolate Bao 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup lukewarm water<br> 2 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 packet active dry yeast<br> 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 3/4 cup cake flour 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br> 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips<br> Vegetable oil cooking spray, for greasing Instructions: For the bao starter: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, water, sugar and yeast. Let stand until puffed up and has bubbles on the surface, about 20 minutes. For the chocolate sauce: In a medium bowl, mix together the chips, butter and vanilla. Place the bowl over a barely simmering saucepan of water and stir until the chocolate has melted. Whisk in the cream until the mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature. For the chocolate bao: In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, the cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the flour mixture and oil to the starter and stir together while gradually adding 1/2 cup room temperature water. Stop adding water once the dough has come together enough to knead by hand. Dump the dough onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until you have a smooth, satiny dough, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the dough to the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 3 hours. Spray a stainless-steel steamer with vegetable oil cooking spray. Use your hands to roll the dough into a long log, about 2 inches wide and 12 inches long. Cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Place a few chocolate chips in the center of each dough piece and stretch the dough around the chips, pinching one end to form a ball. Place the ball seam-side down onto a wax paper square. Continue with the remaining pieces of dough. Gently lower the bao in batches into a prepared steamer. Steam for 10 minutes, then carefully remove and let cool under a kitchen towel.

Add the garlic and saute until fragrant and tender, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, thyme, parsley, and wine. Increase the heat to medium and simmer until most of the liquid evaporates, about 8 minutes. In a small bowl, season the shrimp with salt and pepper. Add the shrimp to the skillet and saute until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool in a small bowl. Position 1 oven rack in the center and the second rack on the bottom of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out each piece of pizza dough into a 7-inch-diameter floured round. Sprinkle half of the mozzarella over the lower half of each pizza dough, dividing equally and leaving a 1-inch border. Spoon the shrimp mixture over the cheese. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the shrimp mixture. Brush the edge of the dough with egg wash. Fold the plain dough halves over the filling, forming half circles. Pinch the edges of dough firmly together and crimp to seal. Transfer the calzones to the 2 prepared sheets. Bake until the calzones puff and become golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Brush extra-virgin olive oil over calzones and serve. Mix the warm water and yeast in a small bowl to blend. Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a food processor to blend. Blend in the oil.

(This is to prevent the jars from directly touching the surface.) Set aside. Prepare the jars: It is not necessary to sterilize the jars beforehand if processing jars in a boiling water canner for 10 minutes or longer. The jars should instead be freshly cleaned and well washed in hot soapy water. Any jars processed less than 10 minutes must be pre-sterilized and the lids and rings placed into simmering, not boiling, water. Rings can be reused, but lids should be new and used only once for boiling water canning. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil. Use a paring knife to cut a small, shallow X in the bottom of each tomato (this is known as scoring). Prepare a bowl of ice water and set aside a slotted spoon or skimmer. One at a time using the slotted spoon, add the tomatoes to the boiling water. Let cook for 15 to 20 seconds, depending on the ripeness of the tomato, until the skins are just loosened. Transfer to the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. As soon as the tomatoes are cool, remove them from the ice water. Use a paring knife to pull off the skin, starting at the X. The skin should now peel off quickly and easily. Core the tomatoes, then coarsely chop to 1/3-inch pieces or so. You will need 4 cups of coarsely chopped tomato. Place the chopped tomatoes in a pot with the peppers, onion, garlic and jalapeno. Add the vinegar, cilantro, salt, cumin and coriander. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until thickened and piping hot, about 20 minutes. When ready to can: For each jar, insert a canning funnel and carefully ladle in the salsa, allowing at least 1/4 inch of headroom. Clean the rims of the jars with a clean, damp towel and tightly secure the lids. Place the canning rack in the canner and fill the pot with water; bring to a boil over high heat. If you do not have a canning kettle, you can also place a metal rack or clean towel in the bottom of a large pot and bring to a boil. Using tongs, place the jars on the rack in the canner or in the prepared pot. The water should cover the jars by at least 1 inch. Cover the canner. Return the water to a boil and boil gently for 5 minutes (at altitudes less than 1,000 feet elevation; see Cook&#39;s Note). Using tongs, transfer the jars to a towel to cool. If the seal works and fits properly, the metal lid will be slightly concave within 24 hours of processing. Store the unopened jars of salsa at room temperature for up to 1 year. Once the salsa is opened, store in the refrigerator for 5 to 7 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 5024,&quot;Sweets of the Spoon: Glyka tou Koutaliou 1 pound Mandarin orange peels, pith removed 5 cups granulated sugar 1 cup water Instructions: In a medium pot, add the orange peels, sugar, and water and bring to a boil on high heat.

Cook the ground beef with the taco seasoning according to the package instructions on the taco seasoning. Set aside until ready to use. Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, heat the cheese sauce in the microwave in 30-second intervals until warm and pourable. On a work surface, lay out 5 flour tortillas in a circle, overlapping slightly. Add a tortilla to the middle, on top of the others. Spread the ground beef evenly over the center tortilla. Pour the cheese onto the beef (it&#39;s okay if it&#39;s not completely covered). Cover the cheese with a layer of 4 tostada rounds. Press them down, breaking them a little, to make a flat layer. Spread the sour cream in an even layer over the tostadas. Sprinkle the lettuce over the top of the sour cream, then sprinkle with the tomatoes. Add the final tortilla over the tomato. Fold the sides of the tortillas up and over to wrap around the layers. The top should be covered in overlapping folds. Press the wrap down so that it is even and not domed. Brush the top with canola oil. Remove the rimmed baking sheet from the oven. Brush the baking sheet with canola oil, then carefully transfer the wrap to the baking sheet meat-side down. Bake immediately until the top is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Invert the crunch wrap onto a serving platter or cutting board.

Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper and toss well with the salad. Serve immediately. Note: To prepare artichokes the Greek way, cut away most of the stem, leaving about 1 inch of it intact. Have 1 or 2 cut lemons handy as you work with the artichokes, rubbing them on cut surfaces to prevent discoloration. Also have a bowl of acidulated water on hand. Snap off the tough outer leaves near the base. Hold the artichoke on its side on a cutting board and, using a sharp serrated knife, cut the artichoke crowns down to within 1 1/2 inches of the base. With a paring knife, trim the tough green exterior off the stem. Rub the artichoke with lemon. Using a teaspoon, thoroughly scrape away the hairy choke on the inside. Holding the artichoke on its side again, trim away any leaf stubs by going around the artichoke almost on a bias with the knife. Using a paring knife, trim the stem so that only its inner, tender core remains. Rub the artichoke with lemon and drop into acidulated water. Continue until all the artichokes are clean. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 5055,&quot;Roquefort Fritters with Pear and Tarragon Sala 8 ounces firm blue cheese, chilled (recommended: Roquefort, Maytag, or Danish Blue) 2 eggs 1/2 cup milk 2 cups bread crumbs (recommended: Japanese Panko) Vegetable oil, for frying 2 thin-skinned pears, cored and cut into 1/2-inch slices (recommended: Forelle) 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon 1 teaspoon sugar Pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Fritters: Cut the cheese into 1-inch cubes and roll lightly between your hands to round off the corners.

Using a vegetable peeler, remove the squash&#39;s hard shell. Trim about 1/2-inch off the top and bottom ends so you can set each section of the squash flat on a cutting board. Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop the seeds out with a spoon, and coarsely chop the squash into 1/2-inch chunks. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. In a bowl, toss the squash with the oil, sage, spice blend, and 1 teaspoon salt and fresh ground pepper. Spread the squash in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast the squash in the oven until very soft and beginning to brown, 40 to 50 minutes, stirring once or twice. Remove the squash from the oven and puree in a food processor with fresh nutmeg. In a large bowl, mix the squash puree, ricotta, Parmesan, eggs, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cover and refrigerate the mixture until ready to use. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the lasagna sheets until al dente. Drain the sheets and spread them on a baking sheet. Drizzle them lightly with oil and set aside. Prepare the sauce: In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a slow simmer over medium heat. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the sage and garlic to the butter, cook for 30 seconds, then add the flour and stir. Add about 3 cups of the milk, and whisk vigorously to prevent lumps. Bring to a boil, while whisking continuously. Add the remaining milk and whisk again. Add the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Adjust the heat to low to maintain a slow simmer, and cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes, whisking frequently. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Makes about 8 cups. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Spoon a ladle of bechamel into the dish and spread to coat the bottom. Place a single layer of lasagna sheets on top of the bechamel. Spread some of the squash mixture evenly over the lasagna sheets and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan on top. Repeat this step until all ingredients are used, starting with 2 to 3 ladles of bechamel for each layer. Keep building the layers until the pan is full to about 1/4-inch from the top. Finish with cheese and sauce directly over the noodles. Bake in the middle of the oven for about 1 hour. Remove the cover, and continue cooking for another 15 minutes until golden brown and bubbling. Allow lasagna to rest before slicing. Serve warm. Grind fennel with mortar and pestle. Add the cinnamon and salt and continue grinding. Or grind in spice grinder for a rough grind. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 5092,&quot;Carne Asada with Oaxaca Cheese 4 (4-6 ounces each) filet mignon 2 slices Oaxaca cheese Sea salt Black pepper Grape seed oil 8 ounces HERDEZ?

Season the water generously with salt. Add the Sardinian Gnocchi and cook until the pasta is floating and barely al dente, about 2 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, then drain well. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and garlic and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the shrimp, pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the shrimp is pink and almost completely opaque, about 1 minute. Deglaze with the wine and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Simmer for 2 minutes to reduce slightly and finish cooking the shrimp. Add the pasta to the shrimp mixture and sprinkle the bare pasta with the Parmesan. Top with the arugula and lemon zest and toss well to combine, adding pasta water if needed to maintain a sauce, until the arugula is wilted. Serve topped with additional Parmesan if desired. In a large bowl, combine the semolina and 00 flours and form a well. Add the water and salt to the center of the well. Using a fork, slowly start to incorporate the flour into the water to form a rough dough. Add a teaspoon of water if the dough is too dry or a dusting of flour if it is too wet. Lightly flour a smooth work surface and pour the dough onto the flour. Knead the dough until it springs back when you press a finger into it, 8 to 10 minutes. Flatten the dough into an even square. Wrap the dough well in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour. Cut the dough into 6 pieces. Roll a piece into a 1/3-inch-thick rope. Cut the rope into 1/3-inch pieces. Press one piece of dough firmly with your thumb against a gnocchi board or the back tines of a fork, rolling the dough as you pull it along to create a shell shape. Continue with the remaining dough, dusting the pasta with 00 flour as needed to prevent sticking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 5111,&quot;Ham and Leek Mini Quiches Cooking spray, for the muffin tin 1 tablespoon butter<br> 1 leek, sliced and cleaned/soaked thoroughly 1/4 cup half-and-half<br> 6 large eggs<br> Hot sauce, as needed<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 thin slices deli ham, chopped<br> 1 cup grated pepper Jack cheese<br> 1/3 cup sour cream<br> Thinly sliced chives, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Evenly pour the vinegar mixture over the vegetables. Toss the vegetables and press down so that they are all submerged under the pickling liquid. Pickle, refrigerated, at minimum 30 minutes and at most 1 week. To assemble and serve: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Toast the baguettes until super crispy on the outside and steamy and warm on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes. Split the baguettes, then slather the entire inside with mayonnaise. Spread the bottom of each sandwich with 1 ounce pat. Start evenly layering from bottom to top of each sandwich in this order: cucumber, 1 to 2 slices bologna, 1 to 2 slices ham hock terrine, 1/2 cup pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalape?o, 3 dashes soy sauce and a few cracks of black pepper. Close the sandwiches, cut in half, and eat right away! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 5134,&quot;Second Time Around Beef Salad Half of beef fillet, cut into 1/2inch cubes 1/2 cup leftover horseradish mayonnaise or mustard horseradish vinaigrette 1/2 cup each red, green and yellow bell pepper, diced into 1/4inch cubes Salt and freshly ground black pepper Watercress or arugula, washed Olive oil Instructions: Toss the beef with as much horseradish mayonnaise as you like to season and moisten the beef. If you have no mayonnaise leftover, then toss with a vinaigrette to which you add mustard and some horseradish. Fold in the peppers and season to taste with salt and pepper. Center the beef on a bed of watercress or arugula leaves lightly tossed with olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 5135,&quot;Tomato and Mozzarella Bruschetta with Basil Oil 1 1/2 pounds Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced salt 5 ounces fresh mozzarella, diced (about 1 cup) 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 baguette, sliced 1/4-inch thick 2 cloves garlic 3 cups tightly packed basil leaves 1 1/2 cups extra virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bruschetta Preparation: Place diced tomatoes on a VIVA? towel and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes. Remove to a bowl and mix together with mozzarella and vinegar. Season with salt to taste. Let stand at room temperature while toasting the bread. Place bread slices on a sheet tray in a single layer and bake until edges are golden, turning bread halfway through. Rub one side of toasted bread with raw garlic. To assemble, place a mound of tomato mixture onto slices and drizzle with basil oil. Serve immediately. Basil Oil Preparation: Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Fill a bowl with ice water. Drop the basil leaves into the boiling water and submerge them for 5 seconds. Remove them to the ice bath using a spider or slotted spoon. Work quickly. You don&#39;t want the basil leaves in the boiling water for too long. Blanching the leaves and then shocking them in ice water will preserve the bright green color. Remove the basil from the water and squeeze dry using VIVA? towels. You want the basil as dry as possible. Remove basil to a blender with the oil. Puree until the mixture is well combined. Place a strainer inside a bowl. Dampen a VIVA? towel with water and line the towel inside the strainer. Pour the basil oil into the strainer. It takes awhile for the oil to strain through. You may need to squeeze it gently to help along the oil. Pour strained basil oil into the neck of a small cruet or a small sterilized jar. Cover the jar or cruet tightly and refrigerate. Use within four days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 5136,&quot;Chicken Schnitzel with Sauteed Apples and Escarole 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 large eggs<br> 2 ? cups panko<br> Four 4-to-5-ounce thin boneless skinless chicken breast cutlets<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Canola oil, for frying<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced<br> One 10-ounce head of escarole, outer leaves discarded, inner leaves torn into bite-size pieces<br> 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. In a shallow dish, beat the eggs. Spread the flour and panko in 2 separate shallow dishes. Season the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper. Dredge each cutlet in the flour, then dip in the egg, letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Dredge in the panko, pressing lightly to help it adhere; transfer to a plate. In a large skillet, heat ? inch of canola oil until shimmering. In batches if necessary, fry the cutlets in a single layer over medium-high heat, flipping once, until golden and cooked through, about 6 minutes total. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet to drain, then transfer to the oven to keep warm. In another large skillet, melt the butter in the olive oil. Add the apple and onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and the apple is almost tender, about 3 minutes. Add the escarole and cook, stirring, until just starting to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with the cutlets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5137,&quot;Mascarpone with Raspberry and Pineapple 3 sheets phyllo dough (or 12 store bought phyllo cups) 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese 1/4 cup finely chopped pineapple, canned or fresh 1/4 cup raspberry yogurt Small block chocolate, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute more. Turn off heat, add in the corn and set aside. In a medium bowl, mash potatoes with a potato masher, and fold in the sour cream, cream cheese, pepper jack, salt and pepper. Stir in 1/3 of the sliced green onions and combine gently with the corn mixture. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Keep warm. In a small saute pan, over medium heat, add the remaining olive oil. Add the remaining red bell peppers and saute briefly. Stir in 1/3 more of the green onions, then add the tomatillos. Let simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, then puree with a stick blender. Keep warm. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F and put a cooling rack on a sheet pan. Heat the canola oil to 350 degrees F. Have tortillas, dish of beans, potato mixture, sliced pasilla peppers, sliced avocado and toothpicks at hand, as well as a plate lined with paper towels for draining. Put a flour tortilla on dry work surface, lay about 3 tablespoons black beans along 1 side. Top with approximately 1/3 cup of the potato mixture, 2 strips of the pasilla pepper and avocado. Roll tightly, burrito style and seal with a toothpick. Set aside and repeat with remaining ingredients. When all are assembled, check the oil temperature and gently add them to the pan, maximum 4 at a time. Do not crowd. Turn frequently and be careful, because they can brown quickly. Drain briefly on paper towels, remove the toothpicks and keep warm in the oven on the cooling rack. Put 1/4 cup of tomatillo sauce on a plate; cut a flauta in half on the diagonal and lay 1 piece down, and 1 standing up, then sprinkle with Cotija cheese and cilantro. Garnish with the remaining green onions. Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients. For a main course, serve on large plate, double the sauce, add 4 cut pieces, all up, garnish and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 5140,&quot;Cubano 1/2 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons ground cumin 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground allspice 1 teaspoon ground mustard seed 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon ground fennel seed 2 bay leaves 3 to 4 pounds pork butt (shoulder) 2 bunches fresh cilantro, roughly chopped 1/4 cup garlic cloves 1 pinch salt 2 bottles beer (Belgian white is best, but German wheat or lager work) Zest and juice of 2 limes Zest and juice of 1 orange 4 tablespoons honey 4 tablespoons Dijon mustard 4 tablespoons brown sugar 2 rings fresh cut pineapple, pureed (or two 6-ounce cans pineapple juice) The smallest bone-in ham available 2 bottles beer (Belgian white is best, but German wheat or lager work) 1 loaf ciabatta Olive oil, for drizzling Swiss cheese slices Pickles, recipe follows Chayote Slaw, for serving, recipe follows Plantain Chips, for serving, recipe follows 12 kirby cucumbers 4 cups white vinegar 3/4 cup fine salt 1 tablespoon mustard seeds 1 tablespoon whole peppercorns 2 teaspoons whole coriander 4 bay leaves 2 cloves garlic, sliced 1/2 bunch fresh dill, chopped 1 pint radishes 2 chayote squash 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves Zest and juice of 1 lime Salt 2 green plantains Vegetable oil, for frying 1 pinch salt 1 pinch sugar Instructions: For the pork: Combine the kosher salt, brown sugar, cumin, coriander, allspice, mustard, pepper, cloves, fennel and bay leaves. Then rub over the pork butt and set aside.<br> For the marinade: Add the cilantro, garlic and salt to a food processor with 1/4 cup beer. Puree until the mixture becomes pesto-like. Then add the remaining beer, lime zest and juice and orange zest and juice. Cover the pork butt and marinate in the refrigerator for 48 hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Cook the pork until the meat pulls effortlessly off the bone, about 6 hours. Pull the meat and leave in its juices.<br> For the ham: Preheat the oven to 240 degrees F. Whisk the honey, mustard, brown sugar and pineapple puree. Smother over the outside of the ham. Put the ham in a roasting pan and surround with beer. Cover with tin foil. Cook until the meat pulls effortlessly off the bone, 8 to 10 hours. Pull the meat and leave in its juices.<br> For the sandwich: Slice the ciabatta in half, drizzle the bread with olive oil and toast for 8 to 10 minutes. Then let it sit out for 30 minutes; the staleness of the bread will allow it to hold the juices from the pork and ham.<br> To assemble: Preheat the broiler. Layer the bottom half of the bread with the pulled pork and ham. Slice the Pickles lengthwise about 1/8-inch on a mandoline and place on top of the meat. Place the Swiss cheese over the pickles and broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden, about 2 minutes. Top with other half of bread and slice the sandwich in half diagonally on a long bias.

Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan. Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for 4 to 5 minutes, until light. Add the eggs 1 at a time, then add the vanilla and sour cream. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture to the batter until just combined. Finish stirring with a spatula to be sure the batter is completely mixed. For the streusel, place the brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, and butter in a bowl and pinch together with your fingers until it forms a crumble. Mix in the walnuts, if desired. Spoon half the batter into the pan and spread it out with a knife. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup streusel. Spoon the rest of the batter in the pan, spread it out, and scatter the remaining streusel on top. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Carefully transfer the cake, streusel side up, onto a serving plate. Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and maple syrup together, adding a few drops of water if necessary, to make the glaze runny.

Pulse the tea leaves briefly in a spice grinder until ground but not powdery. Transfer to a medium bowl and whisk in the flour and salt. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add 2 1/2 cups confectioners? sugar and the vanilla and beat until incorporated, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until smooth, about 1 more minute. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture, then increase the speed to medium and beat until just combined. Scrape the dough into the prepared pan. Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top and press the dough evenly into the pan; remove the plastic wrap. Bake until the shortbread is firm and the edges are just light golden, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 20 minutes in the pan. Gently lift the shortbread out of the pan using the foil overhang. Slice into 1 1/2-inch squares. Transfer to racks to cool completely.

Add the onions, vinegar, salt and pepper, stirring occasionally, until the onions are deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Fries: Drain the potatoes and dry completely on a clean kitchen towel. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium-high heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in about 5 minutes.) While the oil is heating, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and 2 1/2 cups water until smooth. Coat the potatoes in the batter. Transfer 8 to 10 potatoes to the oil, allowing any excess batter to drip back into the bowl. Fry until golden and crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. For the sauce: In a small skillet, melt the butter over low heat. Add the thyme and garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Pour the sauce over the fries and gently toss until coated. Place the fries on a platter and spoon the onions on top. Sprinkle with fontina and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 5145,&quot;Linzer Heart Sandwich Cookies 2 1/2 sticks butter 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional flour for rolling the cookies 1/2 cup slivered almonds, ground 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 cup seedless raspberry jam Powdered sugar, optional Instructions: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, whip the butter until smooth. Add the sugar and continue mixing until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. In another bowl, combine and mix the flour, almonds, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, blend the flour mixture in with the butter. When the ingredients are fully integrated, place 1/3 of the batter on each piece of waxed paper. Coat dough with a light layer of flour, and top with another piece of waxed paper of the same length to make 3 batter \sandwiches. Place 2 of them in the refrigerator and work with 1 at a time. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll the first batch into as neat a shape as possible. What matters most is avoiding creases or cracks and getting it to about 1/8-inch in thickness. When the first is rolled, refrigerate it and repeat the same process for the other 2 pieces of dough. Make the cookie bottoms: Remove the first rolled sheet from the refrigerator and cut as many 1 1/2-inch hearts (or rounds). Reserve the scraps in the refrigerator. Arrange them neatly in a single layer on a greased baking sheet. Repeat with the other two sheets, reserving any scraps. Make the cookie tops: Cut a heart, with the smaller cutter, out of the center of half of all the cookies to create a heart outline. Roll the scraps in between 2 pieces of waxed paper and cut additional hearts, if desired. Bake the cookies until they are lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the trays from the oven and allow them to cool slightly for a few minutes before gently transferring them to a flat surface. In a small pot, pour in the raspberry jam and bring it to a light simmer. Remove from the heat to cool slightly as well. Spoon about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon raspberry jam on each bottom and place a \top\ heart on each. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5146,&quot;Injera 2 cups teff flour 1/8 teaspoon active dry yeast 1 cup self-rising flour Kosher salt Instructions: Combine the teff flour and active dry yeast in a large bowl. Add 2 cups lukewarm water and whisk or, more traditionally, use your hand to mix everything together, making sure the mixture is absolutely smooth with no lumps. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until the mixture is bubbly and tastes sour like tangy yogurt, 36 to 48 hours. (It will start bubbling and rising in a matter of hours, but it can take anywhere from 36 to 48 hours to achieve a noticeable level of sourness, which is key to the flavor of the injera; see Cook&#39;s Note.) After about 36 hours, begin tasting the mixture; this will help you determine when it&#39;s just right and will help prevent it from souring too much. At this point, the batter will look separated and watery on top. If you shake the bowl a little, you should see some bubbles rising to the top. Add the self-rising flour and up to 1 cup of water a little at a time. Whisk or use your hand to thoroughly combine into a smooth, thin, pourable mixture with about the consistency of a slightly thicker crepe batter. Cover again and let sit for 1 hour. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for a few minutes. Have a lid for the skillet and a wire baking rack nearby. Whisk 1 teaspoon salt into the batter (it will bubble up). Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet, tilting and swirling to coat with a thin layer of batter. The batter should spread quickly and easily. (If it&#39;s too thick, whisk in a little more water.) Within a matter of seconds, you should start seeing small holes forming and the surface darkening as it cooks from the outside towards the center. When the injera is about 3/4 of the way cooked, cover the skillet and let steam for 1 minute. The injera is cooked when the edges are dry and lifting up from the pan. Carefully run a spatula underneath and transfer to the baking rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining batter. You can stack the injera only when they are completely cooled; otherwise, they will stick to each other. Wrap the stack of cooled injera with a dry, clean cloth or paper towels to keep them from drying out until ready to serve. Serve at room temperature, or microwave for 30 seconds to heat through. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albarino]&quot; 5147,&quot;Grilled Spicy Chicken with Sweet Plantains 2/3 cup ketchup Juice of 1 1/2 limes, plus wedges for serving 3 tablespoons jerk seasoning paste 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for the grill 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each) 3 semi-ripe sweet plantains (yellow with black spots), peeled 1 bunch scallions Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium. Stir the ketchup and juice of 1 lime in a small bowl; set aside. Mix 2 tablespoons jerk seasoning paste, 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a medium bowl. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Mix the remaining 1 tablespoon seasoning paste, 1 tablespoon brown sugar and juice of 1/2 lime in a small bowl.

Cut the plantains in half lengthwise and toss in a bowl with the scallions, remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the chicken, turning once or twice, until charred and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Grill the plantains and scallions, turning, until charred and tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Brush the jerk-lime mixture on the chicken. Roughly chop the plantains and scallions; toss together. Serve the chicken with the plantain mixture, lime ketchup and lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinotage]&quot; 5148,&quot;Instant Pot Chicken Cacciatore 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts Salt and pepper, to taste<br> 1 tablespoon oil<br> 1 small yellow onion, finely diced<br> 2 cups sliced mushrooms<br> 2 garlic cloves, minced<br> 1 cup white rice<br> One 15-ounce can diced tomatoes<br> 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth<br> 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning<br> 4 cups baby spinach<br> 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the \Saute\ function on the Instant Pot to its highest setting. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Once the display reads \Hot,\ add the oil and heat it for 30 seconds. Arrange the chicken, seasoned-side down, in the Instant Pot. Cook until the chicken becomes golden and releases easily, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook for an additional 4 minutes. Using tongs, remove the chicken to a plate and set aside. Add the onion and mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until they begin to soften, 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Add the rice, tomatoes, chicken broth and Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper and stir. Return the chicken to the Instant Pot. Place the lid on the Instant Pot and lock it in place. Set the \Meat &amp; Stews\ function for 10 minutes. It will take time for the Instant Pot to come to full pressure. The 10 minutes will begin then. Once the cook cycle is complete, carefully release the pressure using the quick-release valve and remove the lid. Using an instant-read thermometer, check that the chicken has reached at least 165 degrees F. (If it has not, set the \Meat &amp; Stews\ setting for another 3 to 5 minutes.) Serve immediately on a bed of baby spinach and top with the Parmesan. Serve immediately or chill and enjoy cold.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the honey, egg and vanilla until smooth. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture until combined. Divide the dough in half and shape each piece into a disk; wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 disk at a time, flour the dough and roll out until 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut into shapes with 3-inch cookie cutters. Arrange 1 inch apart on the prepared pans. Reroll the scraps and cut out more cookies. (If the dough is too soft to work with, refrigerate until firm.) Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool on the pans. Meanwhile, make the icing: Whisk the meringue powder and confectioners? sugar in a large bowl. Beat in 5 tablespoons water with a mixer on medium speed until soft glossy peaks form. Beat in up to 1 more tablespoon water to thin the consistency if necessary. Spread or pipe the icing onto the cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 5150,&quot;Tequila Lime Chicken 4 limes 1 cup tequila 1/4 cup olive oil 2 teaspoons kosher salt 5 cloves garlic 1 jalapeno, sliced 1/2 bunch chopped fresh cilantro 12 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 2 cups grated Monterey Jack Corn tortillas Flour tortillas Grated Monterey Jack Pico de gallo Jalapeno slices Lime wedges Avocado slices Sour cream Instructions: Slice open the limes and squeeze the juice into a food processor or blender.

Rainbow Fruit Stuffed Pork Tenderloin: Trim the tenderloin by cutting off all silverskin. In food processor, coarsely chop mixed dried fruit. Insert metal dowel or tool into the end of the meat to make a pocket through the center. Stuff the chopped fruit inside. Season the tenderloin with the olive oil, herbs, garlic, salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over a high heat. Sear the tenderloin on all sides until caramel. Cover the meat with aluminum foil and finish cooking it in the oven until the center of the meat reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes after cooking. Cut tenderloin into medallions. Keep warm until ready to plate. Cheddar Grits: Heat oil in a Dutch oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium pot, heat 2 cups of water until boiling. Add the grits and stir continuously until done, about 5 minutes. Add the butter, 1/2 cup of milk, Cheddar and salt and pepper to taste.

Season with salt and pepper. Add about 6 cups water or broth so there is about 1 1/2 inches. For larger roasts, add 1/2-inch more liquid per pound. Pressure cook until the pork is extremely tender and falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (This is important to the dish.) Remove the meat from the pot and reserve the juices. For the pork loin, oven method:<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pierce the pork with a knife and insert the slices of garlic different parts of the roast. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a heavy cast iron pot over high heat. Sear the pork until brown. Add the beef broth and vermouth (this will also deglaze the pan) and cover the pot with a lid. Bake, basting frequently with the pan juices, until the pork is pink and juicy inside but not dry and gray, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Be sure to periodically check your roast, as you want the roast to be pink and juicy inside, not dry and gray. Remove the meat from the pot and reserve the juices. Combine the cornstarch with 1/4 cup cold water. Slowly whisk the cornstarch mixture into the pan juices to thicken the juices so they will stick to the pork and dumplings. (However, Grandma and Grandpa preferred the traditional thinner juice.)<br> For the potato dumplings: While the meat is cooking, prepare the dumplings. Place a pot of water to boil. Place the potato flakes in a large bowl. Place the milk, butter and 2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Pour the potato mixture over the potato flakes and whip with a fork until smooth. Let cool. Add the eggs to the potatoes and mix well. Add 2 cups of flour and mix until a dough forms, adding more flour if needed. Turn the dough out onto a floured bread board and knead in more flour until the dough is stiff and doesn&#39;t stick to your hands. Break off small pieces and form into flat balls, drop into rapidly boiling water. Bring back to a boil and cook 10 to 15 minutes. Cut 1 and if it isn&#39;t sticky inside, they are done. For the sauerkraut: Heat the oil in a heavy bottomed pot. Add the onion and cook until transparent. Add the sauerkraut, vermouth, beef bouillon to taste, caraway seeds to taste, salt (not much) and pepper. Simmer until the flavors meld, 30 to 45 minutes. Serve along side the pork. For serving: This was usually done homestyle. Place some pork, a dumpling (cut into hearty, bit-size pieces) and some sauerkraut on a plate. Then pass and spoon or drizzle some of the reserved meat juices over the pork and dumplings--this ties everything all together and gives you a forkful of flavor in each bite. There you have it: hearty, stick-to-your-ribs pork, dumplings and sauerkraut--an excellent dish on a cold, frosty night! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 5167,&quot;Penne with Aspargus-Prosciutto Sauce Water, to boil asparagus and penne Salt, to taste 1 pound green asparagus, preferably thick stalks 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/4 pound prosciuuto di San Daniele or Parma, cut in bits 2 tablespoons freshly ground Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 1/2 pounds penne 1/4 cup light cream Freshly ground pepper, to taste Instructions: Set a large pot of cold water to boil. Once it reaches a rolling boil, add a pinch of salt and let return to a full boil. After washing the asparagus and cutting away any woody ends, boil them in the water just until you can penetrate the thick end of 1 of the stalks by stabbing it with a fork. Lift out the asparagus but continue to let the water boil. Cut off the tips of the asparagus and reserve. Chop the asparagus stalks into 1-inch pieces and then puree either in a manual food mill or in a blender or food processor. The result should be a thick cream. Melt the butter in a saucepan and then add the prosciutto bits, sauteing just until they give off a little fragrance. Then stir in the asparagus puree and, moments later, the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cook gently, taking care that the sauce does not boil. At this point, toss the penne into the pot of boiling water. Cook for 8 minutes or according to package instructions. Once penne is cooked, drain water and place penne in a warm bowl. While the penne is cooking, add the asparagus tips and some of the cream to the sauce. You do not want to make the sauce too liquid, so only add as much cream as will give the sauce a velvety texture. Once the penne is cooked, spoon the sauce on and toss.

Add 1/4 cup of the cheese to a medium bowl and set aside. Brush a work surface with a little oil and press the dough into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Cut the dough into thin strips, about 1/4-inch wide. When the oil is hot, using kitchen scissors, carefully hold the dough strips, 2 at a time, over the pan and snip off 1/4-inch pieces, letting them gently fall into the hot oil (this may take several batches). Shallow-fry the dough pieces, tossing frequently with a slotted spoon, Chinese strainer or tongs, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the croutons to the bowl with the cheese and toss to coat. Continue frying and dredging the dough in the cheese until all the dough is used. When ready to serve, add the romaine to a large bowl, drizzle with lemon juice and add the remaining 1/4 cup oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste and toss well to evenly coat the lettuce.

Butter and flour the pan of your choice.<br> Sift the flour and salt into a medium bowl and set aside. Whisk the whole eggs, yolks, milk, and the vanilla together in a 4-cup measuring cup or bowl, and set aside. In a heavy duty mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter at a medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually pour in the sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, to cream and lighten the butter. (This should take about 3 minutes.) Once all the sugar is added, turn the machine off and scrape down the sides of the bowl and paddle with a rubber spatula. Continue to beat the butter mixture until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the lemon zest and beat for 30 seconds more.<br> Turn the machine off and scrape the sides of the bowl again to assure even incorporation of the ingredients. Turn the mixer to its lowest setting. Gradually pour in the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, and beat the batter for 30 seconds. Gradually add the egg mixture. (It should take about a minute to pour all of it into the batter.) Remove the bowl from the mixer, scrape any batter off the paddle, and finish stirring the egg mixture into the batter with a rubber spatula. Take care not to over mix the batter, but make sure that you scrape the bottom of the bowl to evenly incorporate all of the ingredients.<br> Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth over the top with a spatula. Put the cake in the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 1 hour and 30 minutes, for the tube or Bundt pans; and 50 minutes to 1 hour for loaf pans.<br> Cool the cake, in the pan, on a rack, for 10 to 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a flat plate or cardboard. Re-invert the cake and set it right side up on the rack to cool completely. If not serving the same day, wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature, for 4 to 5 days or freeze for 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5173,&quot;Classic Lemon Tart with Coconut-Almond Crust 1/4 cup desiccated coconut 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 cup almond flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1/3 cup sugar<br> 1 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter 1 cup sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 3 large eggs plus 1 yolk<br> Zest of 3 lemons plus 1 cup lemon juice<br> 1 cup heavy whipping cream 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: For the coconut-almond crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the coconut on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Let cool. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the coconut for garnishing the tart. Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons cooled toasted coconut, the all-purpose flour, almond flour and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the almond extract and egg and beat until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until all of the dry ingredients are just incorporated, about 30 seconds. Form the dough into a disc and press it evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch nonstick tart pan with removable bottom; if necessary, use a piece of plastic wrap to help keep the dough from sticking. Refrigerate the tart shell until firm, about 1 hour, or freeze for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven again to 350 degrees F. Line the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights. Place the tart shell on a baking sheet and bake until the edges of the crust are barely golden, about 15 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and weights and continue to bake until the crust is golden brown all over, about 20 minutes. Cool completely, then gently remove the tart shell from the pan and onto a plate. For the lemon curd filling: Melt the butter in a large microwave-safe bowl, using the butter paper to make sure the butter does not splatter, usually about a minute on 40 percent power. Then, add the sugar and salt and whisk together. Add the whole eggs and egg yolk and whisk again. Add the lemon zest and juice and whisk well. Microwave for 1 minute. Remove carefully and whisk. Continue to microwave in 1-minute intervals, whisking after each minute, until the mixture is thick. It usually takes between 2 to 5 minutes, depending on the microwave. Note that the mixture will get thin before it gets thick. Carefully remove the bowl from the microwave and push the curd through a fine-mesh sieve into another bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the curd and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours. For the whipped cream: Place the whipping cream, sugar, vanilla and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip until soft peaks form. To assemble the tart: Pour the lemon curd into the tart shell and spread evenly. Place the whipped cream in a piping bag fitted with a plain tip and pipe a border around the edge of the crust. Sprinkle with the reserved toasted coconut. Allow the tart to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5174,&quot;White Bean and Escarole Soup 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 ounces pancetta or prosciutto cut into 1/4-inch cubes 1/2 cup diced onion 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon minced rosemary or thyme 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 head escarole, (about 1 pound) trimmed, washed, and coarsely chopped Two 15 ounce cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained 1 cup peeled, seeded, and chopped vine-ripened tomato or chopped canned plum tomato 5 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned 1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Serving suggestions: Drizzle each serving with extra-virgin olive oil and/or sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan and serve with a good crusty bread. In a soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat, add the pancetta, and saute for about 5 minutes. Remove meat with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the onion and saute until golden, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, rosemary, and pepper flakes; saute for 3 minutes more. Add the escarole, stirring for 2 minutes more. Add the beans, tomato, broth, and salt to taste; bring to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the reserved pancetta and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with the oil and/or cheese and the crusty bread.

Working in batches, dip the hot dogs into the glass of batter; let the excess drip back into the glass, then lower the hot dogs into the hot oil. Fry, turning, until golden, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. (Refill the glass with batter as needed.) Remove the corn dogs with tongs and drain on a paper towel-lined plate; season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Zinfandel]&quot; 5176,&quot;Buffalo Chicken Meatloaf 3 tablespoons ketchup 1 tablespoon hot sauce<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the loaf pan 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 3 stalks celery, small diced (about 1 cup), celery leaves reserved for garnish 1/2 medium onion, small diced (about 1 cup) 3 tablespoons hot sauce<br> 1 1/2 pounds ground chicken, 50/50 light and dark<br> 1 cup blue cheese crumbles<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper<br> 2 large eggs<br> 2 1/4 cups panko breadcrumbs<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> Instructions: For the sauce: Whisk together the ketchup and hot sauce in a small bowl and set aside. For the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and set aside. Melt the butter in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Once melted, saute the celery and onion until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture, with the drippings, to a large bowl. Add the hot sauce to the bowl and stir to combine. Add the chicken, blue cheese, salt, pepper, eggs and 1 1/2 cups of the panko and mix until well combined. Press the mixture into the prepared loaf pan, pressing more in the center of the loaf to create a divot. This will allow the meatloaf to bake evenly and not create a mound after it is baked. Spread the sauce over the top of the meatloaf. Mix the Parmesan with 1/2 cup of the panko and sprinkle the mixture on top of the sauce. Bake until the center is set and the top is golden brown, 45 minutes to an hour. Let rest about 15 minutes before cutting to serve.

Rub all over the outside of the chicken and sprinkle a little in the cavity. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour or refrigerate up to overnight. When you are ready to cook, prepare a grill for medium (350 to 375 degrees F) indirect heat (for a gas grill, leave one or two burners on low or off; for a charcoal grill, bank the coals on one side of the grill). Fold a double thickness of aluminum foil to about 10 inches square and place in the center of the indirect heat (or use a disposable aluminum pan). Cut the top from the pineapple and cut a small slice from the bottom, if needed, so the pineapple stands up firmly on its own. Use a serrated knife to cut down vertically, along the core to make a plank, stopping a little more than an inch from the base of the pineapple. Cut horizontally above the base to remove 1 plank of pineapple. Remove 3 more planks in the same manner--ending up with a firm base holding up the pineapple core. Cut the flesh from the pineapple. Coarsely chop 1 cup and set aside for the sauce. Cube the remaining pineapple for salsa, about 1 1/2 cups, and set aside. Stuff the pineapple core in the cavity of the chicken to make it stand up straight. Place on the foil on the grill and cover the grill. Cook the chicken for 1 hour. For the sauce: Meanwhile, melt the achiote paste in a small skillet over low heat, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons water if it is too thick to melt (different brands have different textures). Once melted, add the garlic and cook until sizzling, about 1 minute. Stir in the cumin, oregano, cloves and 1/2 teaspoon salt and remove from the heat. Transfer to a blender with the reserved 1 cup chopped pineapple, vinegar and agave. Blend to make a smooth sauce about the consistency of BBQ sauce. Season with salt. You will have about 1 1/2 cups. Divide the sauce between 2 bowls, reserving one bowl for basting and one for serving. After 1 hour, brush the chicken with some of the basting sauce and re-cover the grill. Continue to cook, basting every 10 minutes, until the skin is deep golden brown and the chicken is cooked through and tender (an instant-read thermometer should read 165 degrees F in the thickest part of the thigh), 30 to 40 minutes more. Remove the chicken to a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes and remove the pineapple core. For the salsa: While the chicken rests, toss the reserved 1 1/2 cups pineapple cubes in a medium bowl with the lime juice, oil, plum tomato, jalapeno, red onion and 1 teaspoon salt. Toss well. Add the cilantro and toss just to combine. Cut the chicken into pieces, then carve the meat from the bones and chop into bite-size pieces. Serve with the salsa, cabbage, avocado, lime wedges and tortillas on the side. Drizzle the tacos with the reserved pineapple sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 5184,&quot;Incredible Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie Vegetable oil, for brushing pie plate 1 3/4 cups chocolate wafer crumbs 1/4 cup unsalted roasted peanuts, chopped 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch 2 1/2 cups whole milk 3 large egg yolks 3/4 cup crunchy peanut butter 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 cup chopped unsalted roasted peanuts Instructions: To make the nutty wafer crust, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Frost the top and sides of the cake with the whipped cream frosting and decorate with the sprinkles. If the cake begins to get too soft, put it back into the freezer for a few minutes. Freeze an additional 1 1/2 hours and up to overnight. Before serving, let the cake sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 5217,&quot;Chicken Pot Pie 1 whole chicken, 3 pounds 1 gallon cool water 2 carrots, cut in 2-inch pieces 2 celery stalks, cut in 2-inch pieces 1 onion, halved 1 head garlic, halved horizontally 2 turnips, halved 4 fresh thyme sprigs 2 fresh rosemary sprigs 1 bay leaf 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 carrots, cut in 1/2-inch circles 1 bag frozen or fresh pearl onions, see note 1 box frozen or fresh peas, see note Leaves from 4 fresh parsley sprigs 2 frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed 1 egg mixed with 3 tablespoons water 1/4 cup shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: Put the chicken in a large stockpot and cover with 1 gallon of cool water. Add the vegetables and herbs and bring the pot up to a boil over medium-high heat. Skim well; then simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes, skimming frequently as the oil rises to the surface. What we&#39;re doing here is not only cooking the chicken but also creating the base sauce for the pot pie. Remove the chicken to a platter to cool. Continue to cook down the chicken broth for another 15 minutes to condense the flavor; you should have about 8 cups when you&#39;re finished. Using a colander, strain the chicken broth into another pot and discard the solids. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and discard the skin and bones. Wipe out the stockpot and put it back on the stovetop over medium heat. Melt the butter and then whisk in the flour to form a paste. This is a roux, which will act as a thickener. Now, gradually pour in 8 cups of the chicken broth, whisking the entire time to prevent lumps. Whisk and simmer for 10 minutes to cook out the starchy taste of the flour and thicken the broth; it should look like cream of chicken soup. Season with salt and pepper. Fold in the shredded chicken, carrots, pearl onions, peas, and parsley. Stir to combine and turn off the heat. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the thawed puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured, cool surface. Invert individual crocks on the pastry sheet and, using a sharp knife, cut circles around the outside of the bowls, slightly larger than the bowl itself. Fill the crocks 3/4 of the way with the chicken mixture, making sure each serving has a nice amount of chicken, vegetables, and broth. Carefully cap each crock with a pastry circle, pressing the dough around the rim to form a seal. Lightly beat the egg with 3 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash and brush some on the pastry. Sprinkle the pastry with the Parmigiano. Set the crocks on a cookie sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, until puffed and golden. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 5218,&quot;Spicy Tomato Jam 4 large lemons 5 1/2 pounds plum tomatoes, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces 4 cups light muscovado sugar or packed light brown sugar 4 teaspoons ground cumin Kosher salt 2 scant teaspoons red pepper flakes 4 small cinnamon sticks 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 8 1/8-inch-thick slices peeled ginger Instructions: Start with our step-by-step canning how-to. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the lemons in wide strips, leaving the bitter white pith behind. Squeeze the lemon juice through a strainer into a large, wide saucepan. Add the lemon zest, tomatoes, sugar, cumin, 4 teaspoons salt, the red pepper flakes, cinnamon sticks, cloves and ginger. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are juicy and the sugar dissolves, 15 to 20 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are dark and syrupy and a candy or deep-fry thermometer registers 220 degrees F, 40 to 50 minutes (the timing may vary depending on the juiciness of the tomatoes). Reduce the heat if the mixture starts to scorch. Discard the cinnamon sticks. Meanwhile, sterilize four 8-ounce canning jars and lids. Fill the jars with the tomato mixture, leaving 1/4 inch headspace, then seal and process. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Barbera, Dolcetto]&quot; 5219,&quot;Kashmiri Greens 4 pounds braising greens 1 tablespoon canola oil or olive oil 1/4 teaspoon asafetida 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 2 large shallots, sliced 1/2 cup julienne strips peeled ginger 1 small dried red cl, broken in half Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Discard the tough stems from the greens. Chop the tender stems and set aside, then roughly chop the leaves. Heat the oil in a 4-quart pot over moderately high heat until it shimmers and add the asafetida and cumin seeds. Cook, stirring until the spices are fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add the shallots, ginger, and cl and cook, stirring, until the shallots are translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the stems of the greens and salt to taste, then cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the greens and cook, tossing occasionally with tongs, until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard the cl and season with salt and pepper to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 5220,&quot;Mozzarella and Pesto Twists One 8-ounce tube refrigerated crescent dough All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella (about 5 ounces) 1/4 cup store-bought basil pesto Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Unroll the crescent dough sheet onto a lightly floured work surface and gently stretch into a 14-by-8-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the dough in half into two 7-by-8-inch rectangles. Using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon, spread 2 tablespoons of the pesto on the top half of each rectangle, then sprinkle 1/2 cup of the mozzarella evenly over each half. Fold the bottom half of the dough upwards to cover the mozzarella and pesto and gently press the edges to seal.<br> Cut each rectangle into 8 strips, each about 1/2 inch wide. Carefully twist each strip several times, making sure to keep the filling intact, then place on the prepared baking sheet and pinch the ends to seal. Refrigerate the twists for 30 minutes. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Chianti]&quot; 5221,&quot;Cream of Chicken Soup 1/2 cup unsalted butter 1 medium Spanish onion, chopped 2 stalks celery (with leaves), chopped 3 medium carrots, chopped 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour 7 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned 3 sprigs parsley 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 bay leaf 2 3/4 cups cooked, diced chicken 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 1/2 teaspoons dry sherry 1 tablespoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper to taste 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Melt the butter in a large soup pot over medium heat.

Save the bone for stock. Turn the chicken over and press down firmly to crack the keel bone. Your chicken is now spatchcocked and will lay flat. Sprinkle salt all over the chicken from 8 inches above the bird. That ensures the salt falls evenly over the chicken. Place on a baking sheet or a baking pan and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 12 hours and up to 36 hours. When the chicken is ready, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Toss the potatoes with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper and place on a sheet tray. Place the chicken over the bed of potatoes, breast-side up and wings tucked under, then brush with olive oil. Roast for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 400 degrees F and roast until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165 degrees F, about 40 minutes more. You can make the Green Goddess Sauce now. When the chicken is fully cooked, place it on a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. While waiting for the chicken, put the potatoes back in the oven at 450 degrees F and roast until crispy, another 10 to 15 minutes. To serve, slice the chicken breasts off the bone and slice each breast at an angle into 1-inch slices. Remove the wings and leg quarters and separate the thigh from the drumstick. The remaining carcass can be saved and frozen to make chicken stock. Serve the chicken with the schmaltz potatoes and Green Goddess Sauce. Soak the cashews in hot water for 10 minutes. Drain, then add the soaked cashews, 6 tablespoons water, the lemon juice, olive oil, horseradish, maple syrup, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a high-speed blender. Blend until the mixture is smooth. Add the cilantro, parsley, tarragon, dill and green onion and blend until all the herbs are fully incorporated. The sauce can be stored in the fridge for 2 to 3 days. If it becomes thick, thin with water as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 5227,&quot;Harissa BBQ Pulled Jackfruit 4 radishes, thinly sliced 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar Good pinch flaky sea salt 1/4 cup tomato ketchup 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon smoked harissa paste Pinch flaky sea salt Pinch freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil One 14-ounce can jackfruit chunks, drained 2 flatbreads, warmed Handful mixed salad leaves 2 tablespoons store-bought crispy onions 50 grams (about 2 ounces) vegan feta Instructions: For the quick-pickled radish: Put the sliced radishes into a bowl, cover with the cider vinegar and add the salt.

Put the par-cooked potatoes in the bundt pan, along with the 3 smashed garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Stir to combine. Mix together the lemon zest with the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence and the clove grated garlic in a small bowl. Pat the chicken dry and spread a little of the oil mixture under the skin of the breasts and thighs. Brush or rub the rest all over the chicken. Sprinkle with a little more salt and pepper. Place the chicken cavity over the middle of the Bundt pan so that the chicken is sitting upright on top of the potatoes. Carefully put the Bundt pan on the indirect side of the grill, with the back of the chicken facing the hotter side. Cover and cook for about 40 minutes. Carefully rotate the Bundt pan so that the breast is facing the hotter side of the grill, and give the potatoes a quick stir for even cooking. Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh (avoiding the bone) reads at least 165 degrees F, 25 to 30 minutes more. Remove from the grill and let rest 20 minutes before carving. Transfer the potatoes with a slotted spoon to a serving dish. Remove the pieces of garlic. Check for seasoning and add more salt and pepper, if necessary. Strain the fat and liquid in the bottom of the Bundt pan into a small saucepan, then spoon out most of the fat. Heat up the remaining liquid just enough to warm through. Squeeze in some lemon juice to taste and stir in the parsley. Serve the potatoes on the side and the cooking liquid drizzled over the carved chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, GSM blend]&quot; 5257,&quot;Kitchen Sink Salad 2 cups loosely packed basil leaves 3/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 clove garlic put through garlic press 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 pieces pancetta, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons pine nuts 1 (12-ounce) package mixed baby salad greens 1/2 English cucumber, halved, diced 1/2-inch pieces 1 large tomato, diced in 1/2-inch pieces 12 kalamata olives, pitted and sliced in 1/2 vertically 2 tablespoons crumbled Gorgonzola Freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: To make the dressing: In a blender combine all ingredients except olive oil.

Whisk the egg whites till frothy. In a separate bowl beat the yolks and sugar with the 1/4 cup Frangelico for the filling. Add the mascarpone to the yolks and sugar mixture, beating it in well to mix. Gently fold in the foamy egg whites, and mix again. Pour half of the coffee and Frangelico mixture into a wide shallow bowl and dunk enough Savoiardi cookies for a layer, about 4 at a time, into the liquid, coating both sides. Line your tiramisu dish with the soaked Savoiardi cookies; they should be damp but not falling to pieces (though it wouldn&#39;t matter if they did). Pour any leftover liquid from the dipping process over the layer you have made. Put half the mascarpone mixture on top of the soaked cookies and spread to make an even layer. Pour the remaining coffee and Frangelico mixture from the pitcher into the shallow dish and make another, final, layer of Savoiardi, dipping as before and layering on top of the mascarpone in the dish. Pour any leftover liquid over the Savoiardi layer, and then cover with the final layer of mascarpone. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and leave overnight, or for at least 6 hours, in the refrigerator. When you are ready to serve, take the tiramisu out of the refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. Mix the chopped roasted hazelnuts with 2 teaspoons of cocoa and sprinkle over the top layer of mascarpone. Then dust with the final teaspoon of cocoa powder, pushing it through a strainer for lighter coverage, over the nut-rubbly tiramisu. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 5264,&quot;Alessia&#39;s Favorite Mushroom Sauce 3/4 ounce dried porcini mushrooms 2 cups water 2 to 3 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon finely minced shallots 10 ounce package domestic mushrooms, caps sliced finely 1/2 cup heavy cream 12 ounces fedelini Salt and pepper Shaved Parmesan cheese for garnish Instructions: Soak dried porcini in water for two hours at least or for as long as possible.

Layer each with the Vegetable Mix, BBQ Onions and cheese. Fold in half to form half-moons. (You can also make one large quesadilla by layering just one tortilla and topping it with the other tortilla, bean-side down.) Press down to even out the ingredients. Melt the butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the quesadillas and cook on one side until deep golden brown and starting to crisp, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until also golden brown and crispy, another 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and cut into wedges. Serve warm with sour cream. Add the carrots, broccoli and zucchini to a food processor and pulse until very finely chopped, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil, then the vegetables, garlic and onion powders, salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the vegetables start to brown and release all their liquid, 5 to 10 minutes. Use immediately or cool and store in an airtight container for up to 3 days. This is a great way to add veggies to kid\u2019s pasta sauces, soups and snacks\u2014like quesadillas. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are very soft and translucent, about 20 minutes.

Set aside.<br> For the summer roll; In a small pot, bring 4 cups water to a boil and add the shrimp. Cook until the shrimp turn pink, about 2 minutes. Drain well and let the shrimp cool. Slice the shrimp in half lengthwise.<br> Prepare the vermicelli according to package instructions and splash with mirin. Hold the noodles in the colander to allow the mirin to drain and the vermicelli to cool.<br> Meanwhile, peel, pit, and slice the mango into thin strips and set aside. Next, halve, pit, peel, and slice the avocado into 1/4-inch slices and set aside. Fill a large bowl with warm water. Place a spring roll wrapper in the water and soak until soft, about 2 minutes. Gently transfer the wrapper to a dry board and blot excess water with a paper towel. The paper can rip easily if it soaks too long, so be sure to remove it from the soaking water as soon as it&#39;s pliable. Allowing the summer roll ingredients to chill before rolling produces best results. Starting an inch from the bottom of the wrapper, place 3 Thai basil leaves face down in a row. Next, place 3 shrimp face down in a row next to the basil. Continue the pattern and place 2 slices of avocado across the shrimp, then top with some vermicelli, and finish with mango slices. Fold in the sides of the wrapper and roll tightly. Place the rolls on a tray with the Thai basil side up and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve the rolls with the cashew dipping sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 5267,&quot;Cranberry Meringue Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the pan 4 egg whites<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br> Pinch salt<br> 4 cups chopped ginger snaps 1 cup chopped walnuts<br> 8 ounces (1 cup) cream cheese 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 1/2 cup powdered sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Sparkling Cranberries, recipe follows, for garnish 3/4 cup agave nectar 2 cups fresh cranberries<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until tender, about 18 minutes. Drain, reserving 3/4 cup potato cooking water. Let the water cool until lukewarm (90 to 100 degrees F). Use a ricer or food mill to puree the warm potato into the bowl of a stand mixer. (You can also mash with a masher; just make sure to get the potatoes very smooth.) Add the butter, honey and salt to the warm potatoes and stir until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Add 1 egg, the yeast and the lukewarm cooking water. Mix with the dough hook on low speed to combine. Add 3 1/2 cups of the flour and mix on low to combine. Knead on medium-high speed, adding up to 1/4 cup more flour, if needed, to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough that forms a loose ball on the dough hook, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the dough onto a floured countertop and knead a few times to make a smooth ball. Oil a large bowl, add the ball and turn to coat. Cover loosely and let rise until doubled in size, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Punch the dough down. Dust a clean, flat work surface with flour. Turn out the dough and cut it into 8 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, pinch the dough under itself to form a ball. With the pinched side down, cup your hands under the dough and rotate on the counter to form a smooth ball. Use one hand to roll the ball into a 4-inch-long oval roll. Place on a lined baking sheet and repeat with the remaining balls of dough. Cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rise until light and airy looking, 30 to 40 minutes. Place an oven rack in the lower and upper third positions. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. When the dough has completed the second rise, beat the remaining egg with a tablespoon of water in a small bowl and gently brush the rolls with the egg wash. Sprinkle with the poppy seeds. Bake, rotating from top to bottom and back to front halfway through, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Rolls can be made a day ahead.

In batches, place the dough in the water and cook for 30 seconds on each side. Using a slotted spatula, remove the logs and place onto the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle the logs with pretzel salt as they come out of the water, to ensure the salt sticks. Then cut 3 diagonal slits on top of the bread, not too deep. Bake for 10 to 13 minutes, rotating between the top and bottom racks of the oven halfway through the cooking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5276,&quot;Banana Pudding 4 large eggs 3/4 cup sugar<br> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon plus a pinch salt<br> 2 cups whole milk<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 30 to 40 vanilla wafers<br> 3 to 4 medium ripe bananas<br> Instructions: Separate the yolks from the whites of 3 of the eggs; set aside the whites. Add the remaining whole egg to the yolks. In a saucepan, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in the whole egg and 3 yolks, and then stir in the milk. Cook uncovered, stirring often, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spread a thin layer of the pudding in a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Arrange a layer of vanilla wafers on top of the pudding. Thinly slice the bananas crosswise, about 1/8 inch thick, and arrange a layer of banana slices over the wafers. Spread one-third of the remaining pudding over the bananas and continue layering wafers, bananas and pudding, ending with pudding. To make the meringue, beat the reserved egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are stiff. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until the whites will not slide out of the mixing bowl when it is tilted. Spread the meringue over the pudding with a spatula, making a few decorative peaks on top, and bake until the meringue is lightly browned, 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 5277,&quot;Lowfat Green Tea, Honey and Nutmeg Smoothies 1/2 cup lowfat vanilla frozen yogurt 1/4 cup chilled triple-strength green tea 1 tablespoon honey, plus more for garnish 1 cup ice Dash ground nutmeg Dash ground cinnamon Instructions: Place all ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth.

Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until the figs are tender and soft, 20 to 25 minutes. Pour off the liquid into a separate bowl; set aside. Make the stuffing: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and rosemary and gently saute until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the sausage and saute until browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Scrape the sausage mixture into the bowl with the figs. Add the cornbread pieces and season well with salt and pepper. Give it a good toss until it&#39;s well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, heavy cream and 1/2 cup stock; pour over the cornbread-sausage mixture and stir to combine, adding up to 1/2 cup more stock if the mixture is dry. Set aside while you work on the turkey. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse the turkey thoroughly inside and out with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Using your fingers, gently lift the skin from the turkey breast and massage the 1 stick softened butter onto the breast meat. Sprinkle the cavity and skin liberally with salt and pepper. Stuff the bird with the cornbread stuffing. Cross the legs over each other and tie with kitchen twine. Put the turkey on a rack in a large roasting pan and place it in the oven. Roast 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Bring the reserved fig liquid to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook until reduced by half, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and cook until syrupy, about 8 more minutes. Cut up the remaining stick of butter and whisk it into the glaze. After the turkey has roasted 2 hours, baste it with the fig glaze and continue roasting until a thermometer inserted into the meaty part of the thigh registers 170 degrees F, 30 minutes to 1 hour more. (If the legs or breast brown too quickly during roasting, cover them with foil.) Transfer the turkey to a platter or cutting board, loosely cover with foil and let rest up to 30 minutes before carving.

Grease and flour 2 (8 or 9)-inch round pans. Sift together the flours and baking powder. Cream the butter and sugar in a large mixer bowl until fluffy. Add the salt and vanilla and mix well. Add the eggs, scraping the sides of the bowl, and mix until light and fluffy. Add the flour mixture in 3 batches alternating with the milk, mixing after each addition and ending with the flour. Mix just until combined. Do not overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the cakes in the pans on wire racks for 15 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the racks and remove the pans. Let the cakes cool completely.

Butter four 9-inch round cake pans, dusting them in flour to ensure the batter does not stick to the pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl and set aside. In another medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg whites until incorporated. Set aside. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until very light, about 3 minutes. Beat in the almond and vanilla extracts. Continue to beat on medium speed and add 1/3 of the sifted flour mixture until incorporated. Add 1/2 of the buttermilk mixture, again beating until incorporated. Again, add 1/3 of the sifted flour and, once incorporated, add the rest of the buttermilk mixture until homogeneous. Finally, add in the remaining flour mixture and continue beating the batter on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes to insure the ingredients are well mixed. Divide the batter evenly among the four pans and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean and the cakes are springy to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes. Place the cakes on a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Run a knife between the rim of the pan and the cake to insure the cake will cleanly detach. Remove the cakes from the pans and invert on the rack until completely cool. To assemble the cake: Level each layer of almond cake with a cake leveler or serrated knife. Place a spoonful of buttercream on your serving plate, followed by your first layer of cake, cut-side up. Place the remaining buttercream in a pastry bag with a frosting tip. Evenly cover your first layer with about 1/3 cup of creme frangipane. Next create a moat of buttercream around the layer of cake with the piping bag in preparation for the lingonberry jam. Evenly spread 1/3 cup lingonberry jam within the moat. Finish the layer by piping icing over the layer, about a 1/4 inch thick. Add the next layer of cake and repeat the previous steps. Repeat with the third layer of cake. Complete the cake with the 4th layer of cake, cut-side down. Frost the cake with the remaining buttercream and top with a few lingonberries from the jam. Be sure all tools are thoroughly degreased before beginning. (I usually use lemon juice or vinegar to remove all traces of grease.) In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of water with the almond and vanilla extracts and set aside. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk the egg yolks on medium speed for 1 minute. Set aside. In a small saucepan, place 1/2 cup water and the sugar on the stove. Bring the sugar and water to a boil until it reaches 238 degrees F. DO NOT STIR. Stirring will cause the sugar crystals to adhere to the edge of the saucepan, causing the syrup to become grainy. Be sure not to overcook the sugar, as it will crystalize and form brittle chunks in your frosting. Once the syrup is heated to 238 degrees F, immediately remove from the heat. Slowly and steadily stream the syrup into the eggs while mixing on low, avoiding the edge of the bowl as well as the whisk. Once the eggs and syrup are incorporated, add in the extract mixture and beat on medium speed until completely cool, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in the butter, one piece at a time until silky smooth. (If your buttercream curdles, do not despair! Simply heat the bowl over the stove until slightly warmed, 10 to 20 seconds, until the buttercream becomes slightly melted near the edge of the bowl. Return the bowl to the mixer and beat on medium-high speed until smooth.) In a food processor, pulse the almond paste until crumbly. Add the cream, sugar, butter, flour, almond extract, vanilla extract and salt and pulse until the mixture forms a smooth paste. Cover tightly and refrigerate until needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5294,&quot;Orange &amp; Avocado Natilla (Mexican Custard Pudding) 1 1/2 cups fresh squeezed orange juice 2/3 cup sugar 2 cups milk 1 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons cornstarch 5 egg yolks Pinch of salt 1/2 cup ripe and completely mashed avocado<br> 1/4 cup cacao nibs Instructions: Pour the orange juice into a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Add the sugar, stir and, once it comes to a gentle simmer, 4 to 5 minutes later, cook for 5 minutes. Let cool. In another saucepan, pour in the milk and place over medium-low heat. Once it comes to a simmer, remove from the heat.<br> In a medium bowl, beat together the cream, cornstarch, egg yolks and salt until thoroughly combined. Gently pour the warm milk in a thin stream into the egg yolk mixture, beating well with a whisk or fork. Once mixed, pour the orange mixture into egg yolk-milk mixture in a thin stream, whisking as you do. Return the entire mixture to a saucepan and place over medium-low heat, bring to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until it coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Mix in the avocado, whisking thoroughly with a whisk or fork until thoroughly combined. Strain the mixture, using a fine strainer, onto a bowl.<br> Chill the mixture by placing the bowl over an ice bath. Cover the natilla with plastic wrap placed directly onto the custard so it will not create a film. Place in the refrigerator and let completely chill.

Spray a 10-by-15-inch jellyroll pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with a piece of parchment. Spray an 8-inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with a parchment round. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.<br> Add the granulated sugar and eggs to a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on high speed until thick, fluffy and lightened in color, about 3 minutes. Beat in the pumpkin puree. Add the dry ingredients and mix on low to incorporate. Scrape down the bowl and beat on medium for 1 full minute.<br> Pour about 3/4 cup of the batter into the prepared 8-inch cake pan and spread into an even layer. Scrape the remaining batter into the prepared jelly roll pan and spread into an even layer. Bake until the cakes spring back when gently touched, 14 to 17 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 2 minutes.<br> Loosen the edges of the jelly roll pan cake with a knife. Using a sieve, generously dust a clean kitchen towel larger than the jelly roll pan with confectioners&#39; sugar. Flip the cake onto the towel and peel off the parchment. Starting on a long end, fold the towel over the cake edge and begin to roll the cake up with the towel as tightly as possible without cracking the cake. Leave the cake rolled in the towel to cool completely, about 30 minutes. When the round cake is cool enough to handle, run a knife along the edge and invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the cream cheese filling: Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese and butter in a stand mixer on medium speed until smooth and combined. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, pumpkin pie spice and vanilla and beat until the ingredients are incorporated. Refrigerate until ready to use.<br> When the rolled cake is cool, unroll it, leaving it on the kitchen towel. Spread the cream cheese filling over the cake in an even layer. Roll the cake back up tightly, this time keeping the towel on the outside. Transfer to a baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 hour.<br> To assemble the charlotte: Line a 2 1/2-quart stainless steel or glass bowl with plastic wrap, leaving a few inches of wrap overhanging the outside of the bowl.<br> Trim the edges of the cake roll, then slice the roll into 20 rounds, each about 1/2 inch thick. Starting in the center of the plastic wrap-lined bowl, arrange the rolls next to each other tightly. Cut any remaining rolls to fit and fill the top edge of the bowl as best as possible. Trim the cake roll rounds to come 1/2 inch below the edge of the bowl.<br> Add the white chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted. Pour the chocolate into the cake-lined bowl and use an offset spatula to spread into an even layer and fill any cracks between the cake roll pieces. Refrigerate while you make the pumpkin mousse filling.<br> For the pumpkin mousse filling: Put 2 tablespoons cold water in a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over it; stir to moisten and set aside.<br> Add the sweetened condensed milk to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer, stirring constantly, until the milk thickens to a paste-like consistency and just starts to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the pumpkin, return to the heat and cook until the mixture just begins to bubble and sputter, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the bloomed gelatin. Transfer the mixture to a separate bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> When the pumpkin mixture has cooled, add the heavy cream to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip on high until the cream begins to thicken. Add the cooled pumpkin mixture, pumpkin pie spice and salt. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form.<br> Spoon the whipped cream mixture into the center of the cake-lined bowl, smoothing the top to an even layer. Trim the 8-inch cake to fit on top of the filling. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to overnight.<br> To serve, invert the charlotte onto a cake stand. Remove the plastic wrap and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5296,&quot;Arctic Char with Tangerine-Habanero Glaze and Meyer Lemon Couscous Broth 4 (6-ounce) fillets artic char, skinned 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Tangerine-Habanero Glaze, recipe follows Meyer Lemon Broth, recipe follows Couscous, recipe follows 4 cups tangerine juice 2 cups red wine vinegar 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/2 habanero cl, chopped Salt 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small Spanish onion, coarsely chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped 2 cups homemade clam broth 1/2 cup fresh Meyer lemon juice 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, optional Fresh parsley leaves or cilantro leaves, torn Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups water 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup instant couscous 1 tablespoon Meyer lemon zest Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Brush peppers with 2 tablespoons of the oil (reserving the balance of the oil) and roast until blackened, about 10 minutes. Remove and cover roasting pan with foil or use tongs to transfer peppers to a plastic bag. Let \sweat\ for 15 minutes. This will help you remove the skin from the pepper. In a small bowl, mix jack cheese, goat cheese, thyme, rosemary, and sage, and mash together. Peel charred skin from peppers and stuff each pepper with about 2 tablespoons of the cheese/herb mixture. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Spread blue cornmeal on a piece of waxed paper and roll stuffed peppers to coat with cornmeal. Sear coated peppers on all sides, leaving undisturbed for the first 2 minutes to allow the cornmeal to integrate into the surface of the peppers and to allow the caramelization process to begin to prevent crusting off of the cornmeal. Transfer to a platter and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 5298,&quot;Linguine With Almond Pesto and Beans Kosher salt 1/3 cup unsalted roasted almonds 1 clove garlic 1 1/2 cups fresh parsley 1 1/2 cups fresh basil 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 cup ricotta cheese 1/2 cup chopped pitted kalamata olives 12 ounces linguine 1 15-ounce can cannellini or navy beans, drained and rinsed 2 plum tomatoes, chopped Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Cut four 12-inch square pieces of parchment or wax paper. Mix the flour and salt in a medium bowl. Add the oil and mix with a fork until it begins to come together. Drizzle with the cold water and gently mix. If it looks dry, add additional cold water by the tablespoon. Gather the dough into a ball and divide in half, letting one half be slightly larger than the other (the larger will be your bottom crust). Place each ball of dough between 2 sheets of the trimmed parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll each ball of dough into a circle that almost reaches the edges of the paper, making a 12-inch diameter (the smaller half will be slightly smaller). As you are rolling, continuously rotate the paper so the crust is even. Flip one of the crusts over and peel off the top piece of paper. Transfer the crust to a 9-inch pie pan paper-side up. Gently peel off the remaining sheet of paper and fit the pastry into the pan, leaving an overhanging edge. Using a pastry brush, brush the inside of the crust with the beaten egg. For the filling: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the cherries, sugar and flour. Bring to a low simmer, stirring often, and cook until the juices release and begin to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the filling to the prepared pie crust. Dot with the butter. Peel the paper from the remaining crust and flip onto the top of the cherry pie. Use your fingers or a fork to pinch the crusts together to seal. Cut an X vent in the top with a knife. Brush with the beaten egg. Transfer the pie to a baking sheet and bake for about 20 minutes. Check to see if the edge of the crust is getting dark; if so, use aluminum foil to create a guard around the edge of the pie. Continue to bake until the crust is golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes longer. Let cool before slicing. Serve with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 5308,&quot;Lemon-Ginger Zapper 6 large, juicy lemons, peel and pith removed 2 ounces fresh ginger (about a 2-inch piece) 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon agave syrup 1/2 cup coconut water or tap water 1 tablespoon chia seeds, optional Instructions: Juice the lemons, then the ginger, following your juicer&#39;s specific settings for each.

Stir in 1/4 cup of olive oil, the crushed garlic and chopped red peppers. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, until softened. Now add the Worcestershire sauce, nutritional yeast flakes and tamari. Mix them in and saut for 1 or 2 minutes, until the liquid evaporates. Take off the heat and stir in the flour, followed by the flaxseed mixture. Mash until it comes together. Then shape (using hands) to form 12 burger patties; I like them thinner and wider. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to a flat griddle and when hot add 4 of the patties and cook for 2 minutes on each side, until crisp and dark brown. Remove from the pan, stack 2 burgers on top of one another with a cheese slice in between. Keep warm whilst you cook the remaining 2 batches. For the assembly: Spread the ketchup, vegan mayo and mustard on the toasted buns, then add burger stacks followed by fixings of your choice. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 5311,&quot;Grilled Shrimp with Mango, Lime and Radish Salsa 12 large shrimp 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 lemon, juiced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 limes 2 mangoes, diced 4 to 5 red radishes, diced 1 red onion, diced 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large bowl, toss the prawns with the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.

Reduce heat and slowly add milk and cook until thermometer reaches 248 degrees F. Pour mixture onto the 4 buttered baking trays. When taffy is cool enough to handle, butter your hands and bring corners to the center to form into a ball. Take all 4 balls and form into 1 large ball. Place onto a table or marble slab so you and a helper can start the pulling process. Start folding and stretching your taffy ball. You should pull the taffy from your friend, fold over and over in your hands, then let your friend pull the taffy from you, repeating this process until the taffy turns light in color. Pulling the taffy adds tiny air bubbles throughout the candy, making it lighter and chewier. Place the taffy on your pulling table/slab, add the color and flavoring, and start the pulling process all over again until the liquids are well incorporated and the taffy is the color you want. Now you can lay the taffy on the table that has a small amount of cornstarch to keep it from sticking. While still soft, press into a 3/4-inch thick sheet. Take a yardstick and cut a straight line with buttered scissors or knife. Continue cutting the taffy into 1/2 to 3/4-inch wide strips. Cut strips into pieces that you want to wrap, about 2-inches. Begin wrapping the pieces in the waxed paper and twisting the ends. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 5313,&quot;Panroasted Brussels Sprouts with Pancetta 1/2 pound thickly sliced pancetta, cut into 1/4 inch dice 8 large shallots, quartered Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 pounds Brussels sprouts, quartered 1/2 cup white wine vinegar Instructions: In a large deep skillet, cook the pancetta over moderate heat until it is slightly crisp and the fat is rendered, 8 to 10 minutes.

Set the oven temperature to 425 degrees F and bake the bacon until crisp, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven. While the bacon cooks, whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.<br> Place the butter in a large heatproof bowl. Line a plate with paper towels and set a fine-mesh sieve over a heatproof liquid measuring cup.<br> Once the bacon is crisp, immediately transfer it to the prepared plate. Carefully tilt the baking dish and scoop or pour the hot bacon fat through the strainer into the measuring cup.<br> Pour 1/4 cup of the hot fat over the butter; save any additional fat for another use and discard the solids in the strainer. (If you don\u2019t have enough bacon fat to yield 1/4 cup then make up the difference with melted butter.) Let the fat and butter sit for 1 minute, to slightly melt the cubed butter.<br> Cream the bacon fat and butter together with a handheld electric mixer on medium speed until slightly aerated (the mixture should still be quite loose and resemble the consistency of mayonnaise), about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar, granulated sugar and molasses. Mix on medium speed until lightened in color, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla, mixing on low speed until incorporated, 30 seconds to 1 minute.<br> Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until the dough is about three-quarters of the way mixed, about 1 minute. The dough will still be chunky with streaks of flour.<br> Roughly chop 6 slices of the bacon to yield 1/2 cup. Add the chopped bacon and chocolate chips to the dough. Fold in with a rubber spatula, incorporating the streaks of flour and evenly distributing the bacon and chocolate chips. Refrigerate the dough 30 minutes to 4 hours.<br> While the dough chills, chop the remaining 3 slices of bacon into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces.<br> When ready to bake the cookies, position the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.<br> Scoop half of the dough into scant 2-tablespoon balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake on the upper and lower oven racks for 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and press 1 piece of the remaining bacon into the top of each cookie. Rotate the baking sheets and bake until the cookies are light golden and just set around the edges, 5 to 7 minutes more.<br> Let cool 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack. You can let them cool completely but I recommend eating them warm!<br> Repeat the scooping, baking and cooling with the remaining cookie dough after the baking sheets have cooled completely. Or freeze the scooped dough to bake later (see Cook\u2019s Note). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5317,&quot;Jerk Meatloaf Balls 4 tablespoons coconut oil 3 green onions, chopped<br> 2 shallots, chopped 1 red bell pepper, chopped<br> 1 Scotch bonnet cl, minced 2 garlic cloves, minced<br> 1/2 teaspoon dark brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 pound ground beef<br> 8 ounces ground pork<br> 1 egg, lightly beaten<br> 1/4 cup coconut milk<br> 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup dried breadcrumbs 1 cup ketchup<br> 1/4 cup soy sauce<br> Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.

Rub the flour and fat together with your fingertips until the mixture is flaky and the consistency of coarse bread crumbs. Drizzle half of the beaten egg over and toss until the dough comes together, adding the remaining egg if necessary to bind the dough. Gather the dough into a compact ball and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before rolling out. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. With a cookie cutter or the rim of a glass, cut the dough into 3 1/2 inch rounds. Gather the scraps into a ball, re-roll them and cut more rounds. Repeat until you have used all the dough. Fit the dough rounds into ungreased 2 1/2 inch tart pans or the cups of a muffin pan, pressing them gently against the bottoms and sides to form deep molds. Place the pan in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm the dough. Place the tins on a baking sheet and bake for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Set the shells aside in their tins to cool. Reduce the oven to 350 degrees. In the bowl of an electric mixer or with a handheld mixer, beat the cream cheese, farmers cheese, and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolk, cinnamon, and salt and beat until smooth. Spoon the filling into the tart shells, dividing it evenly, and filling up to within 1/4-inch of the top. Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes, or until the filling is set and doesn&#39;t jiggle when shaken. Cool the tarts to room temperature and carefully slip them out of their tins. Serve, garnished with a few grape halves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5321,&quot;Fish Nuggets with Roasted Corn and Tomato Salad with Fire Cracker Sauce 3 cups buttermilk 1/2 cup lemon iced tea<br> 3 eggs<br> 2 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 4 tablespoons hot sauce<br> Salt and pepper 3 pounds halibut fillet, cut in 1-by-2-inch pieces<br> 3 cups yellow cornmeal (not self-rising)<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> Salt Vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup mayonnaise 3 tablespoons hot sauce<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> 4 ears corn 3 large heirloom tomatoes (yellow, pink or orange), diced<br> 4 Roma tomatoes, diced<br> 1/2 red onion, diced<br> 1 green bell pepper, diced<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> 1/4 cup vinegar<br> 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 3 teaspoons sugar<br> 1/4 cup lemon tea<br> Salt and pepper Instructions: For the fish nuggets: Mix the buttermilk, iced tea, eggs, garlic powder, onion powder, hot sauce and some salt and pepper in a large bowl.

Boil the sauce for 10 minutes to reduce. As it cooks, the color will deepen. Allow the sauce to cool before injecting it into the turkey. It is best to inject the turkey with the sauce at least 12 hours before frying. Set up a 40-quart deep fryer with burner base and propane tank according to manufacturer&#39;s directions. As a safety precaution, measure the amount of oil needed to fry by filling the pot first with water and covering the turkey by 1-inch. You may want to put the turkey in a plastic bag for ease. Remove the turkey and mark the water level on the side of the pot ? this insures no spill over when working with hot oil. Pour out the water, dry the pot and turkey thoroughly. Fill the pot with oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Have a deep fry thermometer attached to the pot. Put the turkey on the fry stand and attach to the metal hanger that comes with the fry kit. Slowly ease the turkey into the hot oil, long oven mitts and an apron are essential. Keep a close eye as the oil bubbles up. Turkey cooks 4 minutes per pound so check it at 45 minutes. The internal temperature of the bird should read on a thermometer between 170 and 180 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the oil as carefully as it went in. Set the turkey stand on a roasting pan to drain the excess oil.

Process until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. With the motor running, add 1 tablespoon water and the olive oil in a steady stream until emulsified and smooth. Pour the sauce into an airtight container and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. For the branzino: Dry the branzino fillets well with paper towels. Score the skin of each fillet three times with a sharp knife. Sprinkle with the salt. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Lay 4 fillets, skin-side down, in the pan; press gently to ensure full contact with the pan. Cook until the skin is golden brown and the flesh is opaque at the edges, 2 minutes. Flip the fillets and cook for an additional 10 seconds; remove to a plate. Wipe out the pan and repeat with the remaining oil and fish. To serve, spread some sauce on each serving plate and shingle 2 fillets on top. Drizzle with a little more sauce if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 5336,&quot;Mexican Red Rice 1/3 cup vegetable oil 3 cups long grain rice, rinses 1 medium onion, chopped 5 Serrano chiles, or to taste, stemmed, seeded if desired 2 garlic cloves, chopped 3/4 cup chicken stock, vegetable stock, or water 3 cups Red Tomato Salsa (recipe follows) 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion, thinly sliced 4 cups diced canned Italian plum tomatoes 1 cup tomato juice 2 garlic cloves, peeled 1 large jalopeno cl, stemmed, seeded if desired 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat the oil in a medium heavy saucepan or skillet over medium low heat. Saute the rice, stirring constantly, until golden and crackling, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and Serranos and cook until the onions just soften. Then add the garlic and saute until the aroma is released. Pour in the stock or water and the tomato salsa, mixing well to combine. Transfer to a 4 quart baking dish or casserole. Cover with foil and bake until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, 30-40 minutes. Stir and serve hot. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over moderate heat. Cook the onions until soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a food processor fitted with the metal blade, or a blender. Add the remaining ingredients except salt and puree, in batches if you are using a blender, until smooth. Pass through a medium strainer, pressing with a spatula or wooden spoon to push through as much pulp as possible. Pour into a saucepan, and add the salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, 20 minutes.

Transfer the milk to a small bowl and let it cool to about 110 degrees F.<br> Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt.<br> Add the egg to the milk and whisk to combine. With a wooden spoon, add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir it into a ball. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough until it is smooth, about 5 minutes. You can add a little bit more flour at this point if necessary.<br> Next, knead the butter into the dough piece by piece, using a flexible bench scraper to scrape the butter back into the dough as you knead. The dough will seem sticky and buttery, but don&#39;t add more flour. Just keep kneading and stretching the dough until the butter is completely absorbed and the dough is smooth. Pop the dough into a buttered bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.<br> For the apple mixture: The next day, toss the apples with the cider vinegar in a medium bowl.<br> In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the melted butter and cook, stirring, until the sugar turns deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. (The butter and sugar may separate. Don&#39;t worry.) Add the apples and toss to combine. Cook until the apples release some of their juice and are just tender but still hold their shape, 1 to 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the apples to a plate. Cook the remaining liquid down until thick and syrupy, about 3 minutes more. Drizzle the caramel over the apples and toss gently to combine. Let cool to room temperature.<br> Pull the dough out of the fridge. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a large rectangle, with the short sides at the bottom and the top, about 1/4 inch thick. Use a slotted spoon to transfer half the apples to the bottom half of the rectangle. Leave most of the apple liquid behind. Fold the top half of the dough over the bottom half. Press the dough down to seal in the apples. Spread the rest of the apples, without too much of that liquid, on the right half of the dough square. Then fold the left half of the dough over the apples and press to seal. Roll this into a ball, transfer it to a buttered bowl, cover lightly and set aside to double, about an hour.<br> On a floured surface, tip the doubled dough out and press it into a big square. Use the bench scraper to cut the dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a rough ball as best you can. Don&#39;t worry if they seem messy or apples pop out. Just smoosh them back together and proceed. Transfer the pieces to well-floured baking sheets. Cover lightly with plastic and let stand until puffed, about an hour.<br> Heat 3 inches of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot to 360 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towel.<br> For the glaze: Meanwhile, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk and vanilla in a bowl. Add more milk or a little water if necessary. It should be runny.<br> Very carefully transfer a puffed piece of dough to a large spider or spatula and lower it into the oil. Add a few more dough balls, but don&#39;t crowd the pan. Cook until they are golden brown and puffed, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping halfway through. Make sure to keep the oil temperature between 350 to 360 degrees F. Lift the fritters out with the spider and set them on the paper towel-lined baking sheet for about 3 minutes.<br> Transfer the fritters to a rack and use a pastry brush to cover them in glaze.

Reduce the heat; hold at a gentle simmer. Melt the butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the thyme, cumin and orzo, and toast the pasta for 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully pour in the simmering broth and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, then cover the pot and reduce the heat to medium low. Cook until all the liquid is absorbed, 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Fold in the cherries, pistachios, lemon zest, olive oil and mustard greens.

Set aside. Set up a double boiler with a heat-proof bowl set on top of a 4-quart pot with 1 to 2 inches of simmering water. The water should not touch the bottom of the bowl. Off of the heat, add the sugar and egg yolks and whisk together until they lighten. Whisk in the prosecco and rum, if using.<br> Put the bowl over the simmering pot and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and becomes thick and frothy, 3 to 5 minutes. You&#39;ll know it&#39;s done if it forms a ribbon (figure 8) when drizzled back into the bowl. Remove from the heat and set in the ice bath to cool.<br> Meanwhile whip the cream to soft peaks and set aside. When the zabaglione is cooled, add a spoonful of the cream to the zabaglione to lighten it and stir with a whisk. Gently fold in the remaining cream in 2 intervals.<br> Put the halved strawberries into 4 dessert bowls. Spoon over the zabaglione and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vin Santo, Riesling]&quot; 5340,&quot;Guinness Floats with Whiskey Whipped Cream 1/2 cup cold heavy cream 2 tablespoons Irish whiskey, plus more to taste 2 teaspoons sugar 2 cups vanilla, chocolate or coffee ice cream 1 12-ounce bottle Guinness or other stout, chilled Instructions: Combine the heavy cream, whiskey and sugar in a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form.

Slowly whisk in the oils. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and set aside. Whisk again when ready to serve. In a small skillet, heat the olive oil. Season the diced artichokes lightly with salt and pepper and saute until al dente, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool. Blanch the carrots and beans by placing each into a fine mesh basket. Set the basket into a pot of boiling salted water and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Plunge onto cold water to stop the cooking process. Drain, cool, and add to the artichokes. Add the onion, radicchio, corn and celery. When ready to serve, dice the avocado and the tomato and add to the other vegetables. Reserving a little vinaigrette, toss the vegetables with the vinaigrette, sprinkle with the grated cheese, and toss again. Correct seasoning to taste. Toss the greens with the reserved vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the salad greens among 4 salad plates. Mound the chopped salad on the greens and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5342,&quot;Vegetable Sushi 3 cups short-grain Japanese rice, rinsed 1/3 cup rice vinegar 3 tablespoons sugar Salt 10 nori sheets (dried seaweed), halved Sesame seeds, for sprinkling 1 cucumber 1 avocado 1 plum tomato, seeded 1 small red onion 20 asparagus spears, trimmed and blanched Wasabi paste, for spreading and serving 1 romaine lettuce heart Pickled ginger, for serving Instructions: Make the rice. Combine the rice and 3 1/4 cups water in a rice cooker and cook according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. A rice cooker is the best way to get perfect sticky-firm rice, but if you don&#39;t have one, just use a saucepan. Fold in the vinegar. Combine the vinegar, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Transfer the cooked rice to a large wooden bowl (traditionally, a wooden tub). Drizzle a quarter of the vinegar mixture over a wooden spoon or spatula onto the rice. Fold the rice gently with the spoon to cool it and break up any clumps; be careful not to smash the grains. Fold in the remaining vinegar mixture and let the rice sit 5 minutes. Spread the rice. Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap. Place a half nori sheet rough-side up on the mat. Moisten your hands and scoop a handful of rice, slightly larger than a lemon, onto the nori. Press the rice to spread it evenly up to the edges of the nori, moistening your fingers as you go. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Prepare the vegetables. Peel the cucumber and slice into matchsticks. (Morimoto cuts the entire cucumber into a paper-thin sheet, then quickly slices it into strips-but he&#39;s had some practice.) Thinly slice the avocado, tomato and red onion; peel the tough ends of the asparagus. Add the filling. Carefully flip over the nori so it&#39;s rice-side down on the mat with the short end facing you. Spread a bit of wasabi paste in a line about one-third of the way up the nori-it&#39;s spicy, so use it sparingly. Arrange a few pieces each of lettuce, cucumber, avocado, tomato and onion in a tight pile in the lower third of the sheet. It&#39;s OK if the vegetables hang over the edges of the nori. Roll the sushi. Roll the sushi away from you with your hands, tucking in the vegetables as you go. Remove the mat from under the roll and place it on top. Press the roll into a compact rectangular log, using the mat to help you. Slice the roll. Cut the sushi roll into 4 to 6 pieces. Repeat with the remaining nori, rice and vegetables. Serve with pickled ginger and more wasabi.

Remove the steak from the pan and let rest in a warm spot for 7 to 8 minutes. For the mushroom sauce: Drain the fat from the pan. Add the shallots, bring the pan to a medium heat and season with salt. Cook the shallots for 3 to 4 minutes, and then add in the garlic. Cook the garlic and shallots together for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and stir to coat with the oil. Cook the mushrooms until they look soft and wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the veal demi-glace. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes; the consistency should be almost as thick as gravy. If it is still thin, let it simmer for another couple of minutes until it does thicken. Check the consistency by coating a spoon with the sauce, turn the spoon over and draw a line down the middle of the spoon with your finger. If your finger leaves a track down the spoon without moving, then it is ready! Taste and adjust the salt, if needed.

Add the chicken and onion, turning to coat well. Firmly press down so the chicken is just covered in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours. Fill two 12-inch cast-iron skillets with about 2 1/2 inches oil each. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. While the oil heats, make the breading: Put 3 cups flour in a large bowl. Remove 1/3 cup of the chicken marinade and add to the flour; stir until clumpy. Whisk in the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour, the baking powder, paprika, dill, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Working with a few pieces at a time, remove the chicken and onion from the marinade, letting the excess drip off, and dredge in the flour mixture, pressing with your hands to coat. Transfer to a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Carefully add about 5 pieces chicken to each skillet, then adjust the heat to keep the oil temperature between 300 degrees F and 325 degrees F. Fry, turning the chicken occasionally, until golden and crisp on the outside and no longer pink inside, 15 to 16 minutes.

Cut the pork into even 2 1/2-inch squares to ensure even cooking. Once the oil is hot, slowly add the pork. (You can tell that the oil or lard is ready by adding a small slice of onion. If you see the onion sizzling, then the pot is ready for the meat.) Avoid dropping the meat in; you do not want the oil or lard to splash. If you see it boiling, just slowly stir; you do not want the meat to stick to the pot. Continue to cook until the meat turns a brown caramel color, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Once the fat is gone, add the salt to the pot. Let cook for about 5 minutes more, then take the pork out to a colander to release any extra oils. For the salsa verde: In a small pot, add the tomatillos in 1 cup water. Cook over medium-high heat until they go from a bright green color to a light brownish green color, about 8 minutes. Transfer the tomatillos to a blender and add the cilantro, Mexican oregano, salt, cumin, garlic and pickled jalape?o. Blend together, adding a bit of the water the tomatillos were cooked in. (The sauce should be on the thinner side.) Set aside. For the salsa roja de tomate: In a medium pot, bring to a boil the tomatoes with 2 cups water on medium-high heat. Cook until the tomatoes begin to slightly peel, then take them out and add to a blender with the oregano, salt, garlic and pickled jalape?o. (The sauce should the same consistency as the salsa verde.) Set aside. To assemble the chicharron en salsa: In a large saute pan, add some oil and heat on medium-high heat. Saute the onions, green onions and garlic. Add the chicharrones and mix together. Add equal parts salsa verde and salsa roja de tomate. Reduce the heat and have it simmer for about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, plate and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 5376,&quot;Candy Cane Kissed Peppermint Patties 14 tablespoons butter, room temperature 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 egg yolk 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup Dutch process cocoa 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons peppermint extract 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon light cream 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup crushed candy canes Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line an 18-by-13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Have another 18-by-13-inch baking sheet and piece of parchment on hand. Roll out the puff pastry to a 12-by-15-inch rectangle. Cut in three equal rectangles, about 12 by 5 inches each. Dock all over with a fork to suppress the puff pastry&#39;s rise in the oven. Transfer the pieces to the prepared baking sheet, cover with the other sheet of parchment and top with the second baking sheet. Bake until the flour structure has set and the pastry looks light golden and flaky, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the top baking sheet and piece of parchment and return to the oven until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes more. Cool completely on a baking rack. Meanwhile, combine the granulated sugar, salt, vanilla and 2 1/2 cups of the milk in a large saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edges. While the milk is warming, whisk together the cornstarch, flour, eggs and remaining 1/2 cup milk in a large bowl. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk mixture, adding a ladleful to the egg mixture at a time, whisking the whole time. Once you&#39;ve added two-thirds of the milk mixture to the egg mixture, pour it back into the pan and cook on medium heat, whisking constantly. Once the mixture thickens and comes to boil, stir vigorously and count to 60. Remove from the heat. Pass the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then stir in the butter and Scotch. Cool over an ice bath, stirring occasionally, until the pastry cream reaches room temperature. Transfer the pastry cream to a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. (Or, if not using immediately, cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic wrap onto the surface of the pastry cream to keep a skin from forming.) Whip the cream in a medium bowl with a hand mixer or balloon whisk until medium-stiff peaks form. Put the whipped cream in a separate pastry bag with a medium round tip. Add the white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon of the corn syrup to a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) and heat until melted and smooth; stir to combine. Add the semisweet chocolate chips and remaining 1 tablespoon corn syrup to a separate metal bowl over a pan of simmering water. Heat until melted and smooth, then stir to combine. Trim the cooled puff pastry carefully with a serrated knife to produce three identical pieces. Lay down one piece of pastry on a serving plate and pipe a layer of pastry cream on top. Sprinkle with chocolate crumbs. Top with a second layer of pastry and pipe a layer of whipped cream on top. Sprinkle with sliced almonds. Dip the top of the third layer of pastry in the melted semisweet chocolate, then spread with a knife to smooth the top. Top the whipped cream layer with the chocolate-covered pastry. Drizzle on some of the white chocolate with a spoon and create a swirled pattern with a wooden skewer if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5383,&quot;Cornbread Salad with Smoked cl Vinaigrette 3 cups 1/2-inch diced stale cornbread 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper 1/2 cup diced yellow bell pepper 1/4 cup finely diced red onion 1/4 cup finely sliced green onion 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 1/3 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon pureed canned chipotle pepper 1 tablespoon honey 1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil and tenderloin and sear 1 to 2 minutes per side. Set aside to cool. For the mushroom duxelles: Add the mushrooms, garlic and shallot to a food processor and pulse a few times until coarsely chopped. Heat the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add the mushroom mixture and stir. Cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until the mushrooms begin to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, deglaze with the sherry, then add the fresh thyme. Set aside to cool. Place a piece of plastic wrap on a work surface and lay the prosciutto slices in the middle, overlapping them slightly to create a rectangle. Spread the mushroom mixture evenly over the prosciutto. Place the cooled tenderloin in the middle of the rectangle, then roll the prosciutto over the tenderloin using the plastic wrap until it&#39;s wrapped tight. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface and roll out into a rectangle large enough to envelop the tenderloin. Using a pizza cutter, make 1/2-inch slices halfway through each side of the rectangle, making sure you do not intersect the cuts. Remove the tenderloin from the plastic and place in the middle of the puff pastry sheet. Start at the bottom (or the \feet\ of the mummy) and wrap the pastry strips around the tenderloin, alternating sides. Make sure to tuck the end of each pastry strip under the tenderloin to secure. No need to be precise--this is a mummy! Continue until you are about 4 inches from the top. Leave a hole for the \face\ about 1 inch thick. Continue wrapping until the \head\ is completely covered. Position the olive \eyes.\ Transfer the mummy to a greased baking sheet and brush the pastry with the egg wash. Bake until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 125 degrees F, 35 to 40 minutes. For the red wine sauce: Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and garlic and saute until softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Deglaze with the red wine, bring to a simmer and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the beef stock, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix the remaining 2 tablespoons butter with the flour in a small bowl with a fork. Reduce the heat under the skillet to low, slowly whisk in the butter and flour mixture and cook until the sauce thickens to the consistency of maple syrup, about 10 minutes. Let the tenderloin rest for 10 minutes, then slice into 2-inch rounds and serve with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 5398,&quot;Gochujang Roasted Butternut Squash 1 large butternut squash (about 3 pounds) 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red cl paste) Kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Pour the batter into the jelly-roll pan, spread it evenly with a spatula, and bake the cake in the middle of the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Dust the cake lightly with cocoa powder, cover it with wax paper, and let it cool to warm. Pull the edges of the wax paper away from the pan, invert the cake onto a baking sheet and carefully peel off the paper. Dust the cake lightly with the remaining cocoa powder, cover it with wax paper, and roll it up. Let the cake cool completely. Make the chocolate butter cream: In the bowl of the upright mixer beat the egg yolks until light and creamy. In a small heavy saucepan combine the sugar with the water. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook it over moderate heat, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with the brush dipped in cold water, until the syrup reaches the soft-ball stage, or the candy thermometer registers 238 degrees. With the mixer running, add the hot syrup to the yolks in a stream, beating, and beat the mixture until completely cool. Beat in the butter and the chocolate, a little at a time. Pour the buttercream into a bowl, beat in the framboise, and chill the buttercream, covered, until the cake is ready to be frosted. To assemble the cake: Cut a 2-inch piece diagonally from each end of the cake and set the pieces aside. Transfer the cake to a serving tray and arrange the reserved end pieces on top of the cake to stimulate sawed-off branches. Beat the chilled buttercream until smooth and with a spatula spread it over the cake. Gently pull the tines of a fork lengthwise over the buttercream to simulate bark and garnish the log with the meringue mushrooms and chocolate leaves. Force the green almond paste through a medium sieve and with the tip of a small knife attach it to the log around the mushrooms to simulate moss. Gently dust the log with sifted confectioners&#39; sugar, simulating snow. Let the cake come to room temperature before serving. Cut the cake with a sharp serrated knife. In a heavy saucepan combine the 1 cup sugar with the water and bring the mixture to a boil over low heat, washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with the brush dipped in cold water until the sugar is dissolved. Boil the syrup until it reaches the soft-ball stage, or until the candy thermometer registers 240 degrees. While the syrup is cooking, in a bowl with the mixer beat the egg whites with the salt until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat the whites for 30 seconds. Sprinkle in the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat the meringue for 10 minutes, or until cool. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Line baking sheets with the parchment paper. Fill the pastry bag fitted with the plain tip with the meringue and pipe out 66 mounds, each about 1-inch in diameter, 1-inch apart onto the baking sheets. Sift a bit of the cocoa over each cap, if desired, to simulate sand. Holding the pastry bag straight up, pipe out 66 medium-wide lengths onto the baking sheets, to resemble mushroom stems. Bake the meringues in the middle of the oven for 2 hours. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and with your finger tip push in the underside of each mushroom cap. Return the meringues to the oven and bake them for 30 minutes more. Turn off the oven and let the meringues stand in the oven overnight. Push a stem into each cap and chill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5420,&quot;Cosmopolitan 1.25 oz.

Starting at the long end of the pastry, place 1 piece of the sausage on top of the mustard and roll it up tightly, overlapping the end by 1/2-inch and sealing the pastry by brushing the edge with water. Cut off the excess pastry. Roll the other 3 pieces of sausage in puff pastry. Place the 4 rolls, seam side down, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush with the egg wash. Lightly score each roll diagonally to make 7 equal pieces. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until browned. Slice and serve hot with mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Tempranillo, Barolo, Garnacha]&quot; 5444,&quot;Lomi Salmon Salad 2 cups kosher salt or Hawaiian salt 1/2 cup sugar 4 (6-ounce) sushi-quality salmon fillets 3 fresh limes 1 large red onion, diced find 2 large tomatoes, seeds removed and diced fine 4 scallions, tender green and white parts only sliced on the diagonal into very thin slices 2 tablespoons minced fresh dill leaves Instructions: Please note that this recipe takes 36 hours to complete. Begin curing the salmon the day before. Combine the salt and sugar and mix well. In a shallow nonreactive container which is large enough to accommodate the salmon fillets in a single layer, spread half the salt/sugar mixture, reserving the balance. Lay the salmon fillets on top of the mixture and use the rest of the salt/sugar mixture to completely cover the fish fillets. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours to salt-cure. Early the next day, microwave the limes in a small bowl to release the essential oils, and set aside until they are just cool enough to handle. Soak the salmon fillets in cold water to remove most of the salt. Rinse and dry the same non-reactive container in which you cured the salmon. Place the fillets in the container and squeeze the lime juice over, cover and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours to allow the acids in the lime juice to chemically cure the fish. Dice the lime cured salmon into small cubes, keeping in mind that the completed salad will resemble the texture of salsa. Add red onion, scallions, and tomato and gently fold in. Season, to taste, with black pepper and chill. Transfer salad to serving dish and sprinkle with fresh dill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 5445,&quot;Curried Potatoes and Chickpeas 1 1/2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch chunks Kosher salt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 2 cups fried onions (one 2.8-ounce can) 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus leaves for topping 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced (remove seeds for less heat) Instructions:</p><ol><li>Put the potatoes, 2 teaspoons salt and enough cold water to cover in a medium saucepan.

Line a cupcake pan with paper liners. Sift the cake flour, cinnamon, salt and 1/3 cup powdered sugar into a bowl. Place the remaining 1/3 cup powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add the egg whites and cream of tartar and beat on low speed until frothy, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form, 5 to 6 minutes more. Pour in the vanilla and mix for 30 seconds more. Spoon the sifted ingredients into the egg mixture and whisk to combine. Spoon the batter into the lined cupcake pan, creating a heaping mound of batter in each cup. Bake the cupcakes until lightly golden, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool 10 minutes before removing from the pan, then let cool completely. For the dark chocolate filling: Place the heavy whipping cream in a medium mixing bowl and whip until soft peaks are formed, 2 to 3 minutes. Melt the chocolate in a microwave or over a double boiler, then allow the chocolate to cool for 2 minutes. Scrape the chocolate into the whipped cream and whisk to form a thick ganache. Remove 1/2 cup chocolate ganache and place in a small mixing bowl. Add the cayenne pepper to this mixture and whisk it in. Place the regular and the spicy ganache into separate piping bags fitted with medium round tips. Use a small knife to make an X on the surface of each cooled cupcake. Pipe the regular ganache into 9 of the cupcakes, pushing the tip of the pastry bag gently into the center of each. Pipe the spicy ganache into 3 of the cupcakes in the same manner. For the 15-minute meringue frosting: Place the egg whites and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, and beat until foamy. Add the vanilla extract and cream of tartar and whip the mixture at medium speed until glossy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in 1/2 cup boiling water. Increase the speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form, 12 to 15 minutes. Generously top each cupcake with the meringue frosting. Use an offset spatula to create peaks in the mounds of meringue. Top each cupcake with a red cinnamon jelly bean and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5447,&quot;Pistachio Pinwheels 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon plus 1 pinch of salt 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 2 large eggs 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2/3 cup unsalted raw pistachios 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract 3 drops green food coloring Instructions: Whisk the flour, baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Beat 6 tablespoons butter and 1/3 cup sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in 1 egg and the vanilla (don?t worry if the mixture looks separated). Reduce the mixer speed to low; mix in the flour mixture until combined. Turn out the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap; shape into a disk. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the filling: Pulse the pistachios and remaining 1/3 cup sugar in a food processor until very finely ground. Mix in the remaining egg, 2 tablespoons butter, the almond extract, pinch of salt and food coloring. Process, scraping the bowl occasionally, until a thick paste forms. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Roll out the dough into a 10-by-11-inch rectangle on a floured surface. Spread the pistachio filling over the dough almost all the way to the edges. Starting with a short side, roll up the dough into a tight spiral. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate, reshaping the log after 1 hour, until firm, at least 3 hours or overnight. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice the log into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Arrange the rounds 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are firm and light golden around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the butter in a large (12-inch) saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery and bell pepper and cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Place the fish on top of the vegetables and add the cream, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover and simmer for 6 to 12 minutes (depending on the thickness of the cod), until the fish is just cooked. Set aside in the pan for 10 minutes, then flake the fish into large pieces with a fork. Put 2 cups of the panko in a large bowl. Add the cod mixture, including the cooking liquid, the dill, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon zest, eggs, lobster, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper and mix gently. Using a 2 1/4-inch ice cream scoop as a measure, shape the mixture into 14 (3-inch) fish cakes. Place the remaining 2 cups of panko on a plate and coat the cakes all over, patting the coating to adhere. Wipe the saute pan clean with a paper towel and heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in the pan over medium heat.

Sprinkle the yeast and sugar onto the top of the water. Briefly let the water absorb the yeast, then stir to dissolve it. Let stand for 15 minutes until the mixture is foamy. In the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 1 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt on low speed. Add the yeast mixture and oil, and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the remaining 1 cup of flour and beat for 1 minute, until the dough just clears the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic. The dough should be soft, but use additional flour as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rest in a warm place until tripled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Cut the dough into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball. Using a rolling pin or your hand, flatten into 6-inch circles on a lightly floured surface. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. To fill calzones, distribute the cheese and meat equally among the 8 circles of dough, placing the fillings on the lower 1/3 of each circle. Moisten the edges of each dough circle with water. Fold the top 1/2 of the dough over the bottom 1/2 to form a half moon, and seal the edges by crimping with a fork. Lightly brush the top and edges of each calzone with egg wash. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Serve each calzone on top of a small mound of Jimmy&#39;s Olive Salad. To prepare the olive salad, combine all ingredients thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to allow the salad to marinate. Store in container with a tight-fitting lid. Yield: 8 servings Preheat the oven to300 degrees. Place the garlic in a small ovenproof container and pour in the oil. Use additional oil if needed to completely immerse all the garlic cloves. Cover the container with aluminum foil and roast 1 hour, until garlic is soft and light golden brown. Strain the garlic and place in a blender along with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Puree to a smooth consistency, adding a small amount of oil if necessary. Pour into a container and cover the top of the puree with a thin layer of the oil. Cover and store in the refrigerator.

Wash and cut the vegetables into a large, rough dice and place in the bottom of a large covered pan (squarehead). Add the beef, seasonings and stock. Cover and place in a preheated 375 to 400 degree oven and bake for about 6 hours. Check the meat with a meat fork. The briskets should be extremely fork tender (practically falling apart). When done lift from the stock with a fork and a spatula underneath to a holding pan to cool slightly. Meanwhile -- into a large plastic food bucket, strain the vegetables and stock through a medium hole china cap (sieve). Using a mallet or ladle squeeze some of the vegetable pulp through into the stock for flavor and texture. Discard the squeezed veggies. Cool the stock so the fat will rise to the top. While the meat is still warm cut out the large pieces of meat separating it from the fat layer in the middle. Scrape off any excess soft fat and discard it. Keep the meat pieces (pot roast) to eat soon or refrigerate them. To Make Gravy: Heat the Pot Roast Stock separately. In a large heavy saucepan heat the beef fat, boiling out any water particles (takes a couple minutes). Make a roux by whisking in the flour and cornstarch stirring constantly -- cooking a few minutes. Continue stirring (it could burn) browning slightly is okay. It adds color to the gravy. Add some of the hot stock gradually. Stir swiftly to break up lumps and make a smooth paste. Add more stock to thin to the desired consistency. Let simmer 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Check for color, taste and thickness. Adjust color if desired with a few drops of Gravy Master or Kitchen Bouquet. Add salt and pepper and more stock if needed. Slowly reheat Pot Roast in hot stock. Remove from stock to a cutting board. Slice the meat thinly on the bias against the grain of the meat. Arrange on the plate, ladle on the gravy and garnish with the julienne vegetables, if desired. Serve with fresh mashed potatoes and a vegetable. This is a meal to enjoy. Garnish: Julienne carrots, celery and onion (just a few for pretty). Then simmer them in a little stock to soften slightly. Cool until needed. Dip in stock to reheat and arrange on top of gravy on the meat. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 5486,&quot;Cheesy Curry Veggie Turnovers 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 medium cremini mushrooms, cut into 1/4-inch pieces 1/2 cup diced leeks, white and light green parts (about 1/2 medium leek) Kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon Madras curry powder 1 cup 1-inch cauliflower florets 1 plum tomato, cored and diced 1/3 cup frozen peas, thawed 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed according to package instructions All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 1/2 cups Sargento Fine Cut Shredded Sharp Cheddar (6 ounces) 1 large egg, beaten Mango chutney, for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with baking spray or line with parchment. Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Set aside. Beat the butter and granulated sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until smooth and creamy. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, until incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and beat until incorporated, then remove the bowl from the mixer. Sift the flour and baking powder together in a bowl, then stir into the creamed butter mixture by hand. Mix the milk into the batter until smooth. You should have about 6 cups of batter. Pour 1 1/2 cups of the batter (or a quarter of your total batter) into one of the prepared cake pans; add a quarter of the apples and a quarter of the brown sugar mixture, lightly patting the apple mixture into the batter. Gently pour another 1 1/2 cups of the batter over the apple layer; top with another quarter of the apples and brown sugar mixture. Lightly pat the apples into the batter. Repeat with the remaining cake pan, batter, apples and brown sugar mixture. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool the cakes slightly, then invert them onto a rack to cool completely. For the cinnamon buttercream: Add the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and 1 tablespoon heavy cream to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Turn the mixer on slow to incorporate all the ingredients. If the frosting seems too thick, add the remaining tablespoon heavy cream. Turn the mixer on high and beat until the frosting is lighter and fluffier, 1 to 2 minutes. (You want the frosting to be a spreadable consistency.) To assemble the cake: place the first layer of cake on a cake stand. Drizzle with up to 3 tablespoons of caramel. Spread the top of the layer with all of the frosting. Place the other cake layer on top and drizzle with up to 3 tablespoons of caramel. Serve immediately.

Let rest for 1/2 hour before adding to frying pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 5530,&quot;Triple Pastry Cream Croquembouche 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter 3 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 2 cups flour<br> 9 eggs 4 cups whole milk 1 1/3 cups sugar 12 egg yolks 1/2 cup cornstarch 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/2 ounces 80-percent dark chocolate, chopped 1 drop mint extract 2 drops orange extract 3 caramel squares, microwaved for 10 seconds to melt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 1/2 cups sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup Instructions: For the puffs: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large saucepan set over medium-high heat, bring 2 cups water, the butter, sugar and salt to a rolling boil, then immediately remove the pan from the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add the flour all at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, to cook off some of the moisture, 30 seconds. Scrape the mixture into a bowl. Using a hand mixer set on low to medium speed, add 8 of the eggs, one at a time, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a large plain round tip. Pipe the dough in big dollops onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Whisk the remaining 1 egg with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash to push down any points. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F, and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 20 minutes more. The puffs should have a crust, but also still be soft. Avoid opening the oven door while the puffs bake. Cool the puffs on the baking sheet. For the fillings: In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, cook the milk until it just begins to bubble along the edges. In a bowl, whisk the sugar and yolks until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk until incorporated, being careful to avoid scrambling the eggs. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan for a later use. Pour the pastry cream through a fine mesh strainer back into the saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens and comes to a slow boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract. Remove one-third of the pastry cream to a bowl. Then add the chocolate into the larger batch of pastry cream and stir until the chocolate is completely incorporated. Divide the chocolate cream into two bowls, adding the mint to one batch and the orange to the other. Add the melted caramel and cinnamon to the plain pastry cream, stirring to combine. Cover all three creams with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill for at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. Use a plain pastry tip to poke a hole in the bottom of each puff. Place each of the pastry creams into a piping bag fitted with a small tip. Separate the puffs into three equal piles and fill each pile with one of the pastry creams. For the caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup and 2/3 cup water in a saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Bring to a boil and cook until the mixture reaches a deep amber color, the thermometer will read about 350 degrees F. Remove from the heat. Then quickly but carefully, dip the bottom and sides of the puffs in the caramel to start building the tower. Create a large circle of puffs as the base, then a second, slightly smaller circle on top of the first to draw the circle in and create a tower of cream puffs. Repeat for the remaining puffs. Check it from all sides occasionally to make sure it&#39;s straight. When the tower is finished, drizzle the remaining caramel all over and then decorate as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5531,&quot;Baby Back Ribs 2 full racks (quartered) baby back ribs 1-quart beef broth 2 cups barbeque sauce (recommended: Bullseye Original Barbeque Sauce) 1 cup honey Instructions: Place ribs and beef broth in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, and add enough water to fully cover ribs.

In a medium pan over medium heat, cook the pancetta and capers. Remove from the pan, reserving a little of the pancetta fat in the pan. Add the Brussels sprouts to the pan and cook over medium heat to begin to brown. Dress with balsamic and olive oil, a little salt (capers and pancetta are salty) and pepper. Place into the oven and roast, tossing a couple of times, until nicely caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. Put the pine nuts in a small, dry, saute pan and toast over a low flame, tossing a couple of times, just until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Once the sprouts are ready, remove them from the oven and put into a big serving bowl. Add the pancetta, the capers, pine nuts, currants and raisins. Toss and check for seasoning.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 5538,&quot;Herb and Lemon Butter Mussels 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> Salt 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped sweet onions, such as Vidalia 2 teaspoons chopped garlic<br> 2 tablespoons diced fresh tomatoes<br> 1 tablespoon finely sliced scallions 3 large leaves fresh basil, sliced chiffonade-style<br> 2 cups Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.) mussels<br> Juice of 1 lemon 2 ounces fruity Chardonnay wine, plus more if needed 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons butter Toasted bread, for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil and vegetable oil in a large saute pan on medium heat. When the pan is hot, add a pinch of salt along with the onions and garlic. Sweat until they are a tad past translucent and are just starting to acquire color. Before the garlic starts to brown, add the tomatoes, scallions and basil. Saute so that the flavors blend together, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes more. Add the mussels to the pan. Next, add the lemon juice and then the Chardonnay to deglaze the pan, and then quickly cover with a lid to steam the mussels. Note: Do not open for at least 1 1/2 to 2 minutes so the mussels can steam. Then, lift the lid and add the parsley (checking to make sure that there is enough moisture in the bottom of the pan to continue to steam the mussels). If everything is going properly, the mussels will have almost fully opened and there will be plenty of liquid still in the bottom of the pan to finish steaming the mussels. In that case, quickly cover the pan for another minute and a half. If the wine has evaporated and the mussels have not opened, add a small additional amount of wine, about a half cup more, and then re-cover the pan to cook out the additional raw alcohol taste and allow the mussels to fully open. Once 3 to 4 minutes total have passed since the beginning of the cooking process, all of the mussels should have opened and their natural juices should have leaked out into the bottom of the pan, combining with the fresh herbs and vegetables to create a simmering broth. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the butter until melted. Plate the mussels in a bowl and pour the sauce on top. Serve with your favorite toasted bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 5539,&quot;Roasted Tomato, Arugula and Mozzarella Salad 4 plum tomatoes, cut in 1/2 and seeded 3 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 5-ounce box baby arugula One 8-ounce package baby mozzarella balls, drained 1/4 cup chiffonade basil leaves Balsamic vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Add the tomatoes to a shallow 2-quart casserole dish in a single layer. Toss the tomatoes with the oil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Make sure the tomatoes are cut side up after tossing. Roast until the tomatoes are extremely tender, about 35 to 40 minutes. Remove them from the oven and keep warm. In a large salad bowl, toss the arugula, mozzarella balls, basil and the warm tomatoes along with any juices from the dish.

Place the mochi on a small baking sheet, spacing the pieces at least 2 inches apart, and bake until lightly golden and puffed up, about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and prepare a large bowl of ice water. Add the spinach to the boiling water and cook just until wilted, about 1 minute. Using a spider or tongs, transfer the spinach to the ice bath just until cooled, then drain. Squeeze any excess liquid from the spinach. Form into a tight \u201clog\u201d about 5 inches long, then cut crosswise into 4 equal pieces and set aside. Combine the chicken, 2 tablespoons of the sake and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a very small saucepan. Add 3/4 cup water (or enough to just cover the chicken). Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and gently simmer, stirring once or twice, until the chicken is just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Meanwhile, bring the dashi to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the daikon, shiitakes and carrot and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce, remaining 1 tablespoon sake and 1 teaspoon salt. Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary. Drain the chicken and divide it among 4 soup bowls (preferably narrow and deep). Place a piece of mochi and fish cake, if using, in each bowl. Top with the broth and vegetables, followed by a parcel of spinach. Sprinkle with yuzu or lemon zest, if using, and serve. Combine the kombu and 6 cups cold water in a medium saucepan and let sit for about 30 minutes. (You can skip this step if you\u2019re short on time, but it does lend a little extra flavor.) Heat over medium heat just until the water comes to a near boil, but doesn\u2019t actually boil, about 5 minutes. Discard the kombu. Scatter the katsuobushi evenly over the water, bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately remove from the heat. Let steep, undisturbed, for about 10 minutes. Pour the dashi through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl or quart-size measuring cup. Do not press down on the katsuobushi, which can make the dashi cloudy and/or bitter. Dashi is best used the day it is made but can be cooled and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Line 2 baking sheets with silicon mats or parchment paper and set aside. For the cookies: Beat the butter and sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt and baking powder. In a third bowl, combine the milk and sour cream. Add half of the milk mixture to butter mixture while mixing on low speed. Then add half of the flour mixture and mix until incorporated. Repeat the process. With a measured scoop, portion out the batter into small rounds on the prepared baking sheets, spaced at least an inch apart. You can make the cookies whatever size you like; I like mine a bit big so I use a 4-ounce ice cream scoop. Bake until the tops lightly spring back when touched, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. For the filling: Add the sliced strawberries to a bowl and sprinkle with the granulated sugar and let sit for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to a broil and set a rack 6 inches from the broiler. When the cookies are cooled, place them round-side down and then top half of them with sliced strawberries. Press 3 marshmallows together using the palm of your hand, until mostly flattened, and then place them on the other half of the cookies. Place the marshmallow-covered cookies back on the baking sheets and place under the broiler to let the marshmallows char and soften until lightly golden on top, 1 to 4 minutes. Keep an eye on them as they can burn quickly. For assembly: Top the strawberry side of the cookie with one of the marshmallow cookies, gently press together and then stand back and marvel at your creation. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling, Cava]&quot; 5552,&quot;Whiskey Hot and Sour 2 ounces bourbon 1-ounce fresh lemon juice 1/2-ounce simple syrup or agave syrup 1 teaspoon egg white Crushed ice 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce Orange slice and halved serrano pepper, for garnish Instructions: Pour the bourbon, lemon juice, syrup and egg white into a cocktail shaker and shake well so the egg white can emulsify.

Add the salmon, skin side down. Add more water, if necessary, to cover the salmon. Cover the skillet and simmer over a low heat until the fish is just cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer the fish to a plate, cover it and chill it completely in the refrigerator, about 3 hours. To serve, peel the skin from the fillet and scrape away any brown flesh. Put the fish on a serving plate, garnish with scallion and the remaining lemon slices. Serve with Lemon Mint Tzatziki. Line a strainer with paper towel and put the strainer over a bowl. Put the yogurt in the strainer and place it in the refrigerator to drain and thicken for 3 hours. Seed and coarsely grate the cucumber. Drain it well. In a medium bowl, stir together the thickened yogurt and olive oil. Stir in the cucumber, lemon juice, garlic, zest and mint. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 5554,&quot;Grilled Cheese with Olivada 2 slices white or egg bread (Challah) Green or black olivada Small amount of mayonnaise Swiss cheese Thin slices of ripe tomato Salt and pepper Instructions: Spread each slice of bread with olivada, and a little bit of mayonnaise. Sandwich a slice or two of cheese in between the bread, with or without a slice of tomato. Saute or grill sandwich on each side until cheese has melted. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5555,&quot;Sesame-Lemon Chicken 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest 2 teaspoons dried thyme 1/2 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs, trimmed (2 to 2 1/2 pounds) 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 romaine lettuce hearts, chopped (about 8 cups) 1 cucumber, chopped 1 tomato, chopped 2 cups lightly salted pita chips, crushed Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Make the rub: Combine the sesame seeds, lemon zest, thyme, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a spice grinder; pulse until the seeds are slightly cracked. Season the chicken with salt and all but about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rub. Set skin-side down on a broiler pan and broil, flipping the chicken and rotating the pan halfway through, until the chicken is golden and a meat thermometer registers 170 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes per side. Make the dressing: Mix 1 tablespoon of the reserved rub, the lemon juice, vinegar, and salt to taste in a bowl. Whisk in the olive oil. When the chicken is done, whisk 1 tablespoon of the pan drippings into the dressing. Add the lettuce, cucumber, tomato and pita chips; season with salt and pepper and toss. Sprinkle the chicken with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon rub and serve with the salad.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 5556,&quot;Crystals, Rubies, Pearls 1 Maine lobster, cooked 1/4 cup sliced scallions Salt and pepper 8 ounces wheat starch 1 1/2 ounces tapioca starch 1 1/2 ounces potato starch 1 pint boiling water 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 4 ounces blue fin tuna 1 tablespoon truffle salt 1/2 cup truffle oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon Sriracha Garnish: caviar Instructions: Dumplings: Remove meat from the lobster, and coarsely chop. Mix in scallions and season with salt and pepper. In a seperate bowl, mix wheat starch, tapioca starch and potato starch. Add boiling water, mix in a stand mixer. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Mix well, pinch small pieces of dough, flatten with cleaver, fill with lobster, fold and press edges to seal. This should make about 12 dumplings (3 per serving). Place in steamer basket and steam for 3 to 4 minutes. Tuna: Sear tuna, slice about 12 sashimi slices, 3 pieces per serving, and season with truffle salt. Set aside. Foam: Mix all ingredients except caviar in blender, insert into foamer and shake to combine. Plate: Lay scallions across each plate. Place tuna and steamed dumplings next to each other. Top dumplings with osetra caviar, spray foam into ramekins for dipping. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 5557,&quot;Ron&#39;s Gluten-Free Chocolate Meringue Cookies 12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, broken into pieces for melting, plus 2 ounces chopped 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Pinch salt 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lemon juice 4 large egg whites 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup chopped walnuts Instructions: Melt the 12 ounces of bittersweet chocolate pieces in a microwave-safe dish or over a gently simmering double-boiler. Let cool but not harden. Add the vanilla.<br> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> Place the salt and vinegar (or lemon juice) in a clean mixer bowl for a stand mixer. Use a paper towel to wipe off any possible grease. Use the paper towel to wipe the blades of the whisk attachment as well. Do not rinse. This procedure will ensure that the egg whites will whip to their full potential.<br> Beat the egg whites on medium speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to high. Slowly add the sugar in a steady stream and continue beating until stiff peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes. (The bowl can be turned upside down without the meringue falling out.) Add a third of the meringue to the melted chocolate and mix well to lighten. Gently but thoroughly fold the melted chocolate into the meringue, and then fold in the remaining two ounces chopped bittersweet chocolate and the walnuts.<br> Fill a large resealable plastic bag with the meringue and snip off the bottom corner, or use a pastry bag. Pipe the meringue into 1 1/2-inch rounds 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.<br> Immediately place in the oven and bake about 10 minutes. The cookies will develop a shiny crust but will still be gooey inside. Let rest on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to a rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5558,&quot;Grilled Mozzarella and Gorgonzola Pizza 1 pound pizza dough 1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh mozzarella 1/3 cup coarsely chopped Gorgonzola cheese Fresh ground black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Use a charcoal or gas grill with a cover. Pile the coals or lava rocks high on one side of grill and place them sparsely on other side. Top with grate. Light grill and let coals heat up. Divide dough into 8 pieces and stretch each piece by hand until 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Let rise a second time, covered, on a baking sheet. Place as many rounds as you can fit without crowding on hot side of grill. Grill for 1 to 2 minutes or until bottoms are light brown. Flip over and grill for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until top sides are colored. Flip again and place pizzas on cool side of fire. Top with cheeses, sprinkle with pepper and drizzle with oil. Cover grill and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or just until cheese melts and browns slightly. Check once or twice to make sure underside is not getting burned; if it is, push coals away from the cool side of the fire. If cheese doesn&#39;t brown, you can run it under a hot broiler for a minute. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 5559,&quot;Charred Corn Guacamole with Chips 2 ears corn 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced 1 serrano cl, finely chopped 1 red onion finely diced 1 lime, juiced 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves Blue, yellow and white corn chips, as accompaniment Instructions: Remove the outer husk from the corn and loosen the silks without removing. Dunk into water and place directly onto a hot grill for 15 minutes. Remove from grill. Remove remaining husks and silks and cut the kernels off of the cob. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Serve with fried blue, yellow and white corn chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 5560,&quot;Braised Oxtail 6 pounds oxtails (1-inch cut) 2 tablespoons olive oil, not extra virgin 3 cups onions, medium dice 1 cup scallions, sliced 1/2 cup garlic, sliced 1/2 cup olive oil 2 teaspoons fresh ground pepper 8 sprigs thyme Water 1 1/2 teaspoon cloves, whole 1 1/2 teaspoon allspice, whole 2 cups tomatoes, seeded and chopped 1 1/2 cups red peppers, chopped Salt 1 Scotch Bonnet pepper, seeded and chopped Instructions: Toss the ingredients together in a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Take oxtails out of marinade and reserve onion mixture. In a heavy-bottom braiser over medium-high heat, brown both sides of oxtail in batches in olive oil, drain excess oil leaving just enough to saute onion mixture and thyme. After the onions and thyme are sauteed return oxtails to braiser and add enough water to cover 1/4 of the oxtails. Allow the liquid to come to a simmer. Put cloves and allspice into a sachet or tie in a cheesecloth, and submerge in liquid. Season with salt, cover, and put into a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour. Then add tomatoes, red and Scotch Bonnet peppers. Stir well and return pot to the oven for half an hour or until oxtails are tender. Check to see if additional water is needed during braising process. Seasoning with more salt is recommended when finished. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 5561,&quot;Affogato Sundaes 1 pint hazelnut gelato or hazelnut ice cream 1 pint vanilla gelato or vanilla ice cream 8 tablespoons Tia Maria or Kahlua liqueur 8 tablespoons freshly brewed hot espresso Sweetened Whipped Cream Chocolate-covered espresso beans, chopped or whole Instructions: Place one scoop each of hazelnut and vanilla gelato in each of 4 dessert or cafe au lait bowls.
