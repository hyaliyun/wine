Add the prawns and cook just until the prawns are cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain the prawns, reserving the orange juice. In a saute pan, add 1/4 cup of the sugar and the pineapple and cook over high heat for 30 seconds. Add the reserved orange juice and vanilla bean and cook for 3 minutes, until sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let steep while you prepare the vinaigrette. Whisk together the sherry vinegar, vanilla sugar, and Worcestershire sauce. Add in 2 tablespoons of the pineapple liquid. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Place the greens on a platter. Remove the pineapple from the liquid and place on the greens. Top with the poached prawns. Drizzle with the vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 30004,&quot;Rotini with Chicken Marsala Ragout 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 pound sliced white button mushrooms<br> 1 medium sweet onion, chopped<br> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 garlic clove, minced<br> 1 cup dry Marsala<br> 1 cup chicken broth<br> 1 pound rotini pasta 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> Grated Parmesan or pecorino, for serving Instructions: Pat the chicken thighs dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes total; transfer to a plate (the chicken will not be cooked through). Add the remaining tablespoon oil and then add the mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms release their liquid and turn golden brown along the edges, about 8 minutes. Add the onions and continue to cook until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the flour and garlic over the vegetables and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the Marsala and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the Marsala reduces slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Return the chicken and any collected juices to the skillet, cover, reduce the heat to medium low and cook until the chicken is cooked through and tender, about 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When the chicken is cooked, transfer the thighs to a cutting board and increase the heat under the sauce to medium high. Boil until slightly thickened, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, coarsely shred the chicken using 2 forks. Return the shredded chicken to the skillet and keep warm. Cook the rotini in the boiling water according to the package directions. Serve the rotini topped with the chicken ragout. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with the grated Parmesan or pecorino. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 30005,&quot;Panzanella 1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes (about 3) 1 shallot, minced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 10 ounces stale country-style bread, torn into large pieces 1 cup fresh basil leaves Instructions: Core the tomatoes and, if large, cut them into chunks; if small, halve or quarter them. Toss them gently with the shallot, garlic, oil, vinegar, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper. Set aside until the tomatoes are very juicy, about 10 minutes. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Add the bread and set aside until soft, no more than 5 minutes. Using your hands, scoop the bread from the water, squeeze out as much water as possible, and rub it through your fingers into the tomatoes. Tear the basil over the salad and toss gently. (The bread salad can be served now or set aside at room temperature for a couple of hours.) Cook&#39;s Note It&#39;s easy to dry fresh bread. Tear it into chunks and microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Or place the chunked bread on a baking sheet in a 250 degrees oven for a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30006,&quot;Cream Cheese Flan 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup water 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened 5 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk Instructions: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Arrange 8 (6-ounce) oven-safe custard or dessert cups in a large roasting pan. Stir sugar and water in a small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high and boil without stirring until liquid is a deep golden brown, brushing down sides of saucepan with a wet pastry brush to prevent sugar from crystallizing, about 12 minutes. Quickly pour syrup into prepared cups. In a blender, combine condensed milk, cream cheese, eggs, and vanilla. Blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to an 8-cup measuring cup or large bowl. Whisk in evaporated milk. Divide custard equally among prepared cups. Transfer roasting pan to oven. Pour enough water into roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the custard cups. Bake until sides are firmly set and only the very center of custards jiggle slightly when cups are gently shaken, about 45 minutes (custards will firm up as they cool). Remove cups from pan, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Run small sharp knife around sides of custards. Invert each cup onto a dessert plate, shaking gently to release custard from cups. Drizzle caramel sauce over custard. Serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30007,&quot;Pesto Pizza with Feta and Artichokes 2 teaspoons sugar 1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 3 cups loosely packed fresh basil leaves 1/4 cup pine nuts<br> 2 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled<br> 6 cups loosely packed baby arugula<br> 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 ounces bacon or pancetta, chopped<br> 1 1/2 cups shredded low-moisture mozzarella<br> 1 cup crumbled feta<br> 1 cup sliced marinated artichoke hearts<br> 1/4 cup pickled jalapeno slices plus 1 tablespoon brine from the jar<br> Instructions: For the dough: Mix the sugar and yeast in 1 1/2 cups warm water (100 to 110 degrees F). Let sit until foamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the olive oil. In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the yeast mixture with the flour and salt and mix on low until smooth. Switch to the dough hook and knead on medium, adding a little more flour or water if needed, until the dough forms a loose, sticky ball around the hook. Increase the speed to medium-high and knead until the dough is soft, smooth and springy, 2 to 3 minutes. Put the dough in a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. For the topping: Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine the basil, pine nuts, garlic and 3 cups of the arugula. Process to make a chunky paste. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and process until smooth. Add the Parmesan and pulse just until incorporated. Season lightly with salt and pepper. In a medium skillet, cook the bacon until crisp. Drain on paper towels. When the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with a baking stone on the bottom rack. Punch down the dough. Brush an 18-by-13-inch rimmed half-sheet pan liberally with olive oil. Transfer the dough to the pan and press it all the way into the corners (it helps to cover the dough with a sheet of plastic wrap while pressing so the dough doesn&#39;t stick to your fingers). Bake on the preheated stone until the dough has puffed and just begins to color, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the dough from the oven, loosen from the baking sheet with a metal spatula and brush lightly with olive oil. (The crust can be baked ahead to this point and topped and finished in the oven later, if desired.) Spread the pesto on the dough almost to the edges. Top with the mozzarella, feta, artichokes, cooked bacon and jalapeno slices. Bake on the top rack until the cheese is browned and crusty, about 8 minutes more. In a large bowl, toss the remaining 3 cups arugula with the remaining tablespoon olive oil and the jalapeno brine. Season with salt and pepper and scatter over the pizza. Cut into squares to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 30008,&quot;Curried Tofu Vegetable Skewers 2 cups white wine 1 cup yellow curry paste 2 cups olive oil 1 organic firm tofu, cut into strips 1 red bell pepper, diced into 2-inch pieces 1 red onion, diced into 2-inch pieces 1/2 baby shiitake mushrooms, cleaned, stems discarded 1 Japanese eggplant diced into 2-inch pieces Instructions: Mix white wine and curry paste, while mixing slowly add oil to emulsify. Skewer the rest of the ingredients and marinate in curry marinade, let sit 1 hour to overnight. Grill until all vegetables are cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Garnacha]&quot; 30009,&quot;Guava Bbq Ribs 1 rack baby back ribs Creole seasoning 1 (12-ounce) can tomato sauce 1/2 cup guava jelly 1 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon black strap molasses 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 cup sangria Instructions: Preheat the grill. Season the ribs with the Creole seasoning, to taste. To make the sauce, in a medium pot over medium heat, add the tomato sauce with 1 teaspoon of Creole seasoning.

Add the cranberries, pine nuts, sliced red pepper and fennel and toss to combine. For the dressing: In a small bowl, add the oil, Parmesan, lemon juice, salt, pepper and garlic and whisk for 1 minute. Dress the salad with about a quarter of the dressing and toss to coat. Pour the remaining dressing into a small round jar or cup. Place the jar of dressing in the center of a large round platter. Arrange the salad mixture around the jar to form a wreath shape. To create a bow for the wreath, cut two 1/4-inch strips from the reserved red pepper for the ribbons and set aside. Lay the remaining bell pepper piece in front of you horizontally. Cut out 2 rectangles, each with a curved piece of pepper on one side, and a square from the middle. Arrange the rectangles with the curved parts on the outside and the square in the middle. Tuck the reserved strips underneath to make ribbons hanging down. Add a small ladle or spoon to serve the dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 30012,&quot;Linguine with Lobster and Vodka Cream Sauce 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 eggs plus 4 egg yolks 1/3 cup loosely packed tarragon leaves, finely chopped Kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 shallot, minced<br> Kosher salt 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 1/2 cup vodka<br> Two 14-ounce cans no-salt-added diced tomatoes<br> 1/4 cup loosely packed tarragon leaves, chopped, plus small leaves for garnish<br> 3 fresh basil leaves, chopped<br> 1 lemon, zested<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Two 6-ounce lobster tails, chopped into 1-inch pieces<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/2 lemon<br> Instructions: For the pasta dough: Create a mound of flour on a clean, flat work surface. Using your fingers, make a well in the center of the mound. Pour the eggs and egg yolks into the well; add the tarragon and 1 tablespoon water. Using a fork, whisk the eggs while incorporating the flour from the inside of the mound, working outward until the flour and eggs are combined. With the palms of your hands, knead the dough. If the dough seems dry and shaggy, dampen your hands with water and knead until the dough is moist but not wet. If it feels wet, add flour, 1 teaspoon at a time. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. For the vodka cream sauce: Meanwhile, heat the butter and oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the butter is melted. Add the shallot, sprinkle with salt, and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook until fragrant but not burned, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat before carefully adding the vodka and tomatoes. Then put the pan back over medium-high heat and simmer until the alcohol has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the tarragon, basil and lemon zest. Then lower the heat to medium-low and add the heavy cream; cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sauce thickens. Cover and keep warm over low heat. To make the linguine, remove the dough from the plastic wrap. Cut the dough into equal quarters and roll each into a small, thick log. Use your hands or a rolling pin to flatten the logs of dough. Feed one piece of dough through a pasta roller set to the widest setting. Fold the dough into thirds and continue to rolling, adjusting the setting to achieve desired thickness. Cover with a thin towel and repeat with the remaining dough logs. Cut the sheets into the preferred noodle length. Switch the pasta roller to a linguine cutter. Feed each sheet through the cutter. Flour the noodles and then separate them, or hang them to dry to prevent sticking. Repeat with all of the pasta sheets. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the fresh pasta and cook until al dente, about 3 minutes. Remove the pasta and transfer to the pan with the sauce. Turn off the heat and gently stir just to coat the noodles. For the lobster: Heat the oil in a heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the lobster pieces, sprinkle with salt and cook until the lobster is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Squeeze the lemon over the lobster. Transfer the pasta to serving bowls, cover with a spoonful of sauce and top with the cooked lobster. Garnish with tarragon leaves and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 30013,&quot;Mushroom, Goat Cheese And Truffle Oil Panini 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 3 tablespoons fresh thyme, chopped 1 pound mixed mushrooms, such as button, cremini, shiitake or oyster 1/2 pound fresh goat cheese, or other soft fresh cheese 2 tablespoons truffle oil*, optional 1 small focaccia loaf 1 small bunch arugula Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and 2 tablespoons thyme and cook for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until they are browned and soft, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let them cool for about 15 minutes. Put the mushrooms into a food processor and pulse a few times until they are finely chopped. (Alternately, you can chop them on a board with a knife.) Scrape them into a bowl. Crumble in the goat cheese and add the remaining thyme. Pour in the truffle oil, if using, and mix well to combine. Cut the focaccia into 4 pieces, slice them horizontally, and drizzle with some olive oil. On the bottoms place 1/4 of the mushroom mixture and top with some arugula. Put the tops on and gently press each sandwich to flatten it slightly. Drizzle some more olive oil over the tops. Place each sandwich on a preheated panini press and grill until the bread is toasted and the cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes. Alternately, preheat a dry cast iron or non stick pan. Place the sandwich in the pan and weight it down with another pan or a clean brick wrapped in foil. Grill 5 minutes, turn the sandwich over, re-weight it, and grill for another 5 minutes.

Pour 6 tablespoons of the butter into a bowl and set aside. To the remaining 2 tablespoons browned butter left in the pan, whisk in the sugar, cornstarch and salt until it forms a thick paste. Add the milk, bourbon and vanilla, whisking until smooth. Return the saucepan to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens to the consistency of loose pudding, about 3 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl; keep warm. For the pancake: Toast the pecans in a large skillet over medium heat until they smell nutty, about 4 minutes. Transfer the pecans to a cutting board to cool for 5 minutes. Roughly chop enough pecans to measure 1/2 cup and reserve for garnish. Finely chop the remaining pecans (you should have about 1 cup) and reserve for the pancake batter. Whisk the all-purpose and buckwheat flours, the cornstarch, confectioners&#39; sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl. Add the 1 cup finely chopped pecans and whisk again to evenly coat. Whisk the reserved 6 tablespoons browned butter, the milk, vanilla and eggs together in another bowl. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir until ingredients are just incorporated and form a thick batter (it&#39;s okay if there are some lumps). Let the batter rest for 5 minutes.<br> Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour all the batter into the skillet, smoothing the top. Cook until bubbles break on the surface of the pancake, and the underside is golden brown, about 6 minutes (reduce heat if pancake is browning too quickly). To flip the pancake neatly, use a spatula to lift the edge of one side of the pancake and carefully slide it, batter side up, onto a large plate. Invert the skillet over the plate then use kitchen towels or oven mitts to carefully invert the plate and skillet together, allowing the pancake to fall back into the pan, cooked side up. Return the skillet to the heat and cook until the second side is golden brown and the pancake is completely cooked through in the middle, about 6 minutes more. Transfer the pancake to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes.<br> Using a serrated knife, cut the pancake into 8 wedges, placing 2 wedges on each plate. Dust heavily with confectioners&#39; sugar, drizzle with the brown butter sauce and top with reserved roughly chopped pecans.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 30038,&quot;Honey Baked Apples with Raisins and Cinnamon 3 1/2 cups apple cider 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, plus 2 tablespoons 1/3 cup honey (preferably 100 percent raw honey from a small producer) 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon salt Pinch freshly ground pepper 6 unpeeled Braeburn, Golden Delicious or McIntosh apples, halved and cored with a melon baller 1/2 cup golden raisins or currants 1/2 cup dried apricots, julienned 6 whole cloves 2 or 3 star anise pods 2 to 3 cinnamon sticks, optional 1/4 cup apple brandy Instructions: In a medium saucepan, combine the apple cider, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 25 minutes or so, or until mixture is syrupy and reduced to about 2 2/3 cups. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the apples, cut side down, in a 12-inch baking pan. Distribute the raisins, apricots, cloves, star anise, and cinnamon sticks, if using, over the apples. Pour the hot syrup over the apples. Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until the apples are almost tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Remove from the oven, turn the apples over, add the brandy. Baste apples with the apple cider and apple brandy many times, allowing the apples to absorb the flavor. Let the pan stand, covered, for 15 minutes.

Add the olive oil and pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta to a paper-towel-lined plate and reserve. To the pan with the pancetta drippings, add the shallots, garlic and salt. Cook until fragrant, stirring with a wooden spoon, 2 minutes. Stir in the rice and coat with all the flavors of the pan. Toast the rice for 2 minutes. Deglaze with 1 cup of the prosecco and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid is almost entirely absorbed. Add 1 cup of the clam juice and cook, stirring, until almost completely absorbed, 6 to 8 minutes. Continue adding the clam juice, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring often and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next. Cook until the rice is tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, to a small saucepan, add the remaining 1/2 cup prosecco and the New Zealand clams. Cover the pan and place over high heat. Cook, shaking occasionally, until the clams have opened, about 4 minutes. Discard any clams that do not open. Set aside. To finish the risotto, stir in the Parmesan, butter, reserved pancetta and the chopped littleneck clams along with their juice. Cook until the clams are cooked through and the butter and cheese are melted in, an additional 2 minutes. The risotto should have some movement and not be too thick. In a small bowl, mix together the parsley and lemon zest. Stir half of the mixture into the risotto. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the steamed New Zealand clams over the top of the risotto and finish with the remaining parsley mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 30041,&quot;Red Snapper Tacos 1 package store-bought taco shells 1 pound red snapper, catfish or wild striped bass fillets, diced into 3/4-inch cubes 1 tablespoon ancho cl powder 1 canned chipotle pepper, finely minced 1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped Few dashes hot sauce Juice of 3 limes Oil, for sauteing Avocado Relish 2 avocados, diced 1 tomato, chopped 1/2 jalapeno, minced 1/2 red onion, minced 1/2 mango, diced Juice of 1 lime Instructions: Place saute pan over medium-high heat, and add a few tablespoons oil for sauteing.

Coarsely grate 2 sticks (1 cup) of the butter on the large holes of a box grater onto one of the prepared baking sheets. Toss the butter with a sprinkle of flour and arrange the butter in an even layer on the prepared sheet. Freeze until rock solid, about 30 minutes. Whisk together the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Fold in the frozen butter pieces. Slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup ice water, whisking with a fork until small pieces form and the dough just starts to come together, being careful not to overwork it. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll out into a 12-by-1/4-inch-thick circle. Transfer to the other prepared baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, peel, core and halve the apples. Cut all but one of the apple halves in half again. Put the lemon juice in a large bowl and toss the apple pieces with the lemon juice; set aside. Cut the remaining 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter into small cubes; set aside. Sprinkle the sugar over the bottom of a large ovenproof skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until melted and amber brown, about 6 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and whisk in the cubed butter until melted and smooth (the sugar will start to bubble as the butter cools it down). Place the apple half in the center of the skillet rounded-side down. Arrange the remaining apple quarters rounded-side down in a tight circle around the center apple, making sure there is as little space between the apples as possible (any space left between apples will cause the tart to collapse when flipped out of the skillet). Place the pastry round on top and carefully tuck the edges down around the apples. Poke the pastry all over with a fork. Bake until the apples are cooked through and the pastry is golden brown, about 1 hour. Let cool for 5 minutes in the skillet; any longer will cause the caramel to harden and make it very hard to get the tart out of the skillet. Place a serving dish or cake stand upside down on top of the skillet. Using oven mitts, carefully flip the skillet over to invert the tart onto the serving dish. Slice and serve with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 30045,&quot;Beef Noodle Salad Bowls with Peanut Sauce 1 sirloin or rib-eye steak (12 ounces to 1 pound) Kosher salt 3/4 cup ponzu or regular soy sauce, plus more for drizzling 3 tablespoons sesame oil<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger<br> 1 teaspoon hot chili oil<br> 2 cloves garlic, finely minced 8 ounces thin noodles<br> 1/2 cup sliced green onions 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, for serving<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 tablespoon curry powder<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 shallot, minced<br> 1-inch piece fresh ginger, minced<br> 1/2 cup coconut milk<br> 1/4 cup soy sauce<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter<br> 1/2 teaspoon hot chili oil<br> Juice of 2 limes<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: For the beef and dressing: Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Season both sides of the steak with salt. Grill until medium rare, about 4 minutes per side. Set aside. To make the dressing, combine the ponzu (or soy sauce), sesame oil, olive oil, vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, hot chili oil and garlic in a bowl. Mix to combine, then taste and adjust the flavors/seasonings. When the steak is cool enough, place in a large resealable plastic bag. Add 3 tablespoons of the dressing. Seal the bag tightly and place in the fridge until needed. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the package directions. Drain and place in a bowl. Pour the remaining dressing over the top and toss to combine. Finally, toss in the green onions. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours or until cool. You can make the steak and noodles well in advance of when you want to serve them. For the peanut sauce: Heat the vegetable oil in a small pot over low heat. Add the curry powder, garlic, shallot and ginger and cook until the aromatics soften, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a blender and add the coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, peanut butter, hot chili oil, lime juice and a pinch of salt. Blend, adding hot water as needed a little at a time to thin it and make it smooth. To serve, slice the steak against the grain into thin strips. Drizzle a little ponzu (or soy sauce) over the noodles, just to give them a little flavor boost, throw in the chopped cilantro and toss to combine. Serve the strips of beef over a mound of noodles, or throw it all into a bowl together. Put some of the peanut sauce into small bowls and serve on the side--to be poured over when you eat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvdre), Tempranillo]&quot; 30046,&quot;Campari Squeeze Ice cubes 2 shots Campari 2 splashes red grapefruit juice 2 splashes club soda 2 orange peels Instructions: Fill a cocktail shaker with ice.

Add 4 tablespoons of the olive oil to a small bowl. Grate 3 cloves of garlic into the olive oil and whisk to combine. Pour the olive oil mixture into the breadcrumb mixture and fluff with a fork until the mixture is evenly combined and resembles wet sand. Arrange one slice of beef on a clean work surface. Top with 1 slice of prosciutto, folding if necessary to fit the slice of meat. Top the prosciutto with 2 tablespoons of the breadcrumb mixture and press slightly to compact it. Fold in the side edges of the beef about a 1/4 inch. Starting from the bottom, roll up the beef like a jelly roll, creating a cylinder. Secure the opening with 2 toothpicks. Place the finished roll on a rimmed baking sheet and continue the process with the remaining meat, prosciutto and breadcrumb mixture. Once all the meat is rolled, season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to a large high-sided pan and heat over medium. Once the oil is shimmering add the beef rolls, in batches, being sure not to overcrowd the pan. Brown on both sides, about 2 minutes. Remove to the rimmed baking sheet and brown the remaining rolls. Once all the rolls have been browned and removed from the pan, add the red wine. Cook, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan, until the harsh alcohol smell burns off and the wine slightly reduces, about 2 minutes. Next, add the tomatoes, basil sprigs, red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the remaining 2 cloves of garlic. Stir to combine. Add 1/2 cup water to the can of tomatoes and swirl it around to clean any residual tomato from the sides of the can. Add the tomato water to the pan.

Slice the mushrooms thinly, but tear girolles, chanterelles and blewits in half. Put the olive oil in a very hot frying pan and add the mushrooms. Let them fry fast, tossing once or twice, then add the garlic and chilli with a pinch of salt (it is very important to season mushrooms lightly, as a little really brings out the flavor). Continue to fry fast for 4-5 minutes, tossing regularly. Then turn the heat off and squeeze in the lemon juice. Toss and season to taste. Meanwhile cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Add to the mushrooms, with the Parmesan, parsley and butter. Toss gently, coating the pasta with the mushrooms and their flavor.

Add the oil. Season the meat evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and add to the hot pan. Cook until the meat is deep brown on the first side, about 4 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until deep, dark brown, an additional 3 minutes on each side. Remove the meat to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions and an additional 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the bits from the bottom and coating the onions in the oil from the pan. Cook the onions, stirring often, until deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Add the garlic, carrots and celery and cook until fragrant and soft, another 2 minutes. Clear a little space in the pan so you can see the bottom. Add the tomato paste to that spot and toast the paste, stirring often, until deep red, about 2 minutes. Stir the paste into the vegetables and deglaze with the Marsala. Simmer for 3 minutes to reduce slightly. Place the meat back into the pan and add 3 cups water to cover three-quarters of the way. Nestle the Parmesan rind into the sauce. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover with a lid just slightly ajar and simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until slightly reduced and the onions are practically melted into the sauce, about 2 1/2 hours. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Remove the piece of meat and the cheese rind. Discard the rind and save the beef for another use. Using a handheld immersion blender, pulse the sauce to even out the consistency. Stir in the butter until combined. Remove 1 1/2 cups of the sauce and reserve for the assembly. For the meatballs: Preheat the broiler to high. Mix together the milk, bread and egg with a fork in a medium bowl and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to thicken. Stir in the Parmesan, oregano and salt. Using your hands, mix in the beef until just combined. With damp hands, scoop 1/2-teaspoon mounds and roll into uniform balls. Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil until browned, about 7 minutes. Set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. For the filling: Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add the oil and bacon and cook, stirring often, until the bacon is crispy and browned, about 5 minutes. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat. Stir in the peas and salt and remove from the heat. For the assembly: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season well with salt. Add the pasta and cook for 2 minutes. Using tongs, remove the pasta from the water and add directly to the sauce in the Dutch oven. Sprinkle the bare pasta with 1 1/2 cups Parmesan and toss well with the sauce. Add 1/2 cup pasta water to loosen slightly and help the sauce coat the pasta, if needed. Using the tongs, place half of the sauced pasta in the bottom of a springform pan. Spread 1/2 cup of the reserved sauce on top of the pasta. Sprinkle with the smoked provolone. Follow with the pea mixture, then the meatballs. Sprinkle the meatballs with 1/2 cup Parmesan. Press down slightly to pack. Top with the remaining pasta and 1 cup reserved sauce. Press gently to compress. Top the pasta with the remaining 1 cup Parmesan. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until golden brown on top, 50 to 60 minutes. Allow the timbale to rest for 30 minutes before running a knife around the edge and unmolding.

Cover and soak in the fridge overnight, or up to 24 hours. My mom always did it this way. When you&#39;re ready to fry the chicken, remove the bowl from the fridge and let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes, just to take off the chill. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To mix up the breading, place the flour, seasoned salt, cayenne if using (extra if you like heat), paprika, black pepper and thyme in a very large bowl and stir together well. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup buttermilk and the milk. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, with a pastry cutter or fork, gradually mix until there are little lumps throughout. This will adhere to the chicken and make for a crispier breading. If necessary, add a little more flour or milk to the bowl in order to make it slightly lumpy. Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 365 degrees F. Lower the heat slightly, if necessary, to keep the oil from getting hotter. Working in batches, thoroughly coat each buttermilk-soaked chicken piece with the breading, pressing extra breading onto the chicken if necessary. Place the breaded pieces on a plate. Add the chicken to the oil three or four pieces at a time. Make sure they aren&#39;t sticking together, then cover the pan and fry for 5 to 7 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the chicken isn&#39;t getting too brown. Turn the pieces over, cover again and cook 3 to 5 minutes more. All the while, monitor the temperature of the oil to make sure the chicken doesn&#39;t burn. Keep in mind that we&#39;ll finish cooking the chicken in the oven, and it will continue to brown. Place the fried pieces on a baking sheet and continue frying the rest of the chicken. When all the chicken has been fried, bake the chicken for 15 minutes to finish the cooking process. Sometimes I&#39;ll cut into the thicker part of one of the larger pieces, just to make sure the chicken is cooked through. If any pink (juice or meat) is visible, the chicken needs to continue cooking in the oven. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, GSM]&quot; 30062,&quot;Orange-Spiced Mini-Muffins 1 medium orange 1/2 cup dates, cut up 1/2 cup pecans, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons melted butter 1/2 cup orange juice 1 cup sugar 1 egg, beaten 2 cups sifted flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Collect the dough trimmings and form them into another ball; roll it into another 1/4-inch-thick disk, cut out more doughnuts, and transfer them to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Let the dough circles rest in a warm, draft-free area for 1/2 hour. Then heat about 1 inch of oil in a high-sided skillet over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking (365 to 375 degrees F). Working in batches, fry the doughnuts until they&#39;re golden brown on one side, then flip them and finish frying, about 3 minutes total. Transfer the doughnuts to a paper towel to drain. Fill and finish: Transfer some of the Concord Grape Jelly to a pastry bag or to a zip-top bag with a small hole cut from one corner. When the doughnuts have cooled completely, use a small knife to gently burrow from the side of the doughnut to the center. Insert the tip of the bag into the opening and pipe in as much filling as possible. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts and filling. Dust the doughnuts generously with powdered sugar, and sprinkle each with a small pinch of coarse salt. Combine the grapes, sugar, and water in a nonreactive pot. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring often, until the grapes have broken down, 6 to 8 minutes. Place the cardamom pods and citrus-zest-strips in a piece of cheesecloth and secure it with twine; add the cheesecloth bundle to the grape mixture. Cool to room temperature and transfer the pot to the refrigerator overnight. Meanwhile, place 4 to 6 spoons (regular dinner is fine) in the freezer (you&#39;ll use them to test the jelly at the end). Press the chilled grape mixture through a coarse mesh strainer. Discard the seeds. Return the strained grape mixture to a clean nonreactive pot, along with the lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook until it begins to look shiny, 10 to 15 minutes. Test the jelly: Take one of the spoons from the freezer and place about 1/2 teaspoon of the grape mixture on it. Return the spoon to the freezer for 3 to 4 minutes. (Meanwhile, turn the heat to low and cover the pot so the mixture does not reduce further than necessary.) Remove the sample from the freezer and try spreading it; if it&#39;s not thick enough, uncover the pot, turn the heat back up to medium, and cook the grape mixture for another 5 minutes before testing a second sample using another frozen spoon. Continue this testing process until the jelly spreads smoothly. Let the jelly cool, then store it in the refrigerator.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 30074,&quot;Conversation Heart Cake 2 15- to 16-ounce boxes vanilla cake mix (plus required ingredients) 1 16-ounce tub white frosting 1 10-ounce bag marshmallows 1/4 cup water 8 drops green liquid food coloring 2 1-pound boxes confectioners&#39; sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature Hot pink or red liquid food coloring, for the letters Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350? F. Coat a 9-inch round and a 9-inch square cake pan (2 inches deep) with cooking spray. Prepare the cake mixes as directed; divide between the pans. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool, then remove from the pans. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level. Cut the round cake in half as shown. Working on a cake board (you can cut the board into a heart shape to fit the cake) or a cutting board, position the 2 half circles of cake against 2 sides of the square cake to make a heart. Cover the cake with the white frosting, using the frosting to fill in any gaps between the cakes.<br> Combine the marshmallows and water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, stirring with a rubber spatula, until melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the green food coloring and stir until smooth. Transfer the marshmallow mixture to a stand mixer. Gradually add all but 1/2 cup of the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until combined. Beat in the butter. Scrape the marshmallow fondant onto a sheet of parchment and knead in confectioners&#39; sugar until it\u2019s no longer sticky. Dust the parchment with more sugar; roll out the fondant until it\u2019s large enough to cover the cake, at least 13 by 16 inches. Carefully flip the parchment and fondant onto the cake; peel off the parchment. Gently press the fondant against the sides of the cake and smooth with your hands; trim the excess. Brush off the extra sugar. Use the wide end of a chopstick to press letters into the fondant (it\u2019s best to do this before the fondant dries out). Use a small brush to paint hot pink or red food coloring in the letter indentations. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 30075,&quot;Peach and Bacon Frittata 8 eggs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 peaches, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> 8 ounces applewood-smoked bacon, cut into 1/3-inch pieces<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven the 425 degrees F.

Squeeze the lemon into the water, add to the pot and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes.<br> For the lobster: Add the lobster to the court bouillon, cover the pot and cook for 10 minutes. Transfer the lobster to a sheet tray to cool. Remove the claws and knuckles and take the meat out of the shells. Slice the lobster in half lengthwise through the body and the tail. Remove any roe from the cavity.<br> Heat a small saute pan over medium-high heat with the olive oil. Add the shallots, sprinkle with kosher salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the halved lobster bodies, flesh-side down, and sear for 2 minutes. Remove the lobster, then spread the inside with some of the ma?tre d\u2019 butter. Add the claw and knuckle meat into the pan, sprinkle with kosher salt and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Toss in the chives and stir to combine, then turn off the heat.<br> For the steak: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the canola oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Season the steak on all sides liberally with kosher salt and black pepper. Place each steak upright on its fat-cap side onto the pan and nestle the steaks next to each other so they stand up. Cook until the fat renders down, 5 minutes. Turn the steak onto one of the flat sides and sear until a crust forms, about 4 minutes, then flip the steak and continue to cook until a crust forms, another 4 minutes. Add the butter, garlic, rosemary and thyme to the pan. Tilt the pan and baste the steak with the butter and aromatics. Transfer the steaks to a sheet tray lined with a rack. Spoon some of the leftover butter and aromatics over the steak. Transfer to the oven and cook for 10 minutes or until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 130 degrees F for medium rare. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Slice the steak against the grain.<br> For the potatoes: Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and season generously with kosher salt. Add the black peppercorns, garlic and thyme.

Add the chilled water 1 tablespoon at a time and mix it into the flour mixture with your fingers. Use just enough water so that the dough just comes together. Gather the dough into a ball and wrap in parchment paper. Set it aside in the refrigerator or until ready to use. For the filling: Cut the acorn squash into thin slices. In a medium skillet over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the sliced squash and 1/4 cup water, cook until the squash is soft and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Add the heavy cream to the pan halfway through, about 5 minutes into the process. Remove the squash from the pan and set aside in a bowl to cool. Once the squash has cooled, toss together with the cheese. Melt 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pan. Add the sliced onion and sugar and cook over low heat about 30 minutes, until the onion has browned and caramelized. After the onion has cooked, divide the mixture into 6 equal portions and let cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature for about 10 minutes. Cut the dough into 6 equal portions. Take each portion and roll it out into a small circle, about 3 inches in diameter. The dough does not have to be rolled out perfectly evenly?a galette is a rustic, free-form tart. In the center of each galette, place a portion of the cooled caramelized onion and squash mixture. Create an edge to the galette by folding the edges of the pastry up towards the center and pressing down gently. Don&#39;t cover the filling with the pastry. Place the pastries onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 25 minutes until the crust is lightly browned. Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil and kosher salt over each galette.

Place the ham on a roasting rack in a roasting pan with the fat-side up. Use a knife to lightly score the fat in a diamond pattern, taking care not to cut into the meat. Bake the ham for 1 hour. While the ham is baking, make the glaze. In a small saucepan, combine the jam, butter, mustard, sage, vinegar, bay leaf, cloves and cinnamon over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until the glaze is thin and syrupy. After the ham has baked 1 hour, brush with about half of the glaze and return to the oven. Cook, glazing the ham every 15 to 20 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches about 130 degrees F, 1 to 1 1/2 hours longer. If the glaze starts to burn, tent with a piece of greased foil. Remove the ham from the oven and tent with a piece of greased foil. Let rest for about 10 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 30085,&quot;Herb Roasted Chicken 5 sprigs rosemary, picked and finely chopped, about 2 tablespoons 10 sage leaves, picked and finely chopped, about 2 tablespoons 3 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped Pinch red pepper flakes 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 (3 to 3 1/2-pound) whole chickens Kosher salt 1 large or 2 small onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 large or 2 small carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 3 ribs celery, cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 bay leaves 1 bundle thyme, about 10 sprigs tied together with string 4 cups rich chicken stock 1 1/2 cups dry white wine Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Instructions: In a small bowl combine the chopped rosemary, sage, garlic, red pepper flakes and olive oil. Season generously with salt. Using your fingertips carefully work your way under the skin of the chickens to separate the skin from the breast to develop a pocket. Schmear the herb paste under the skin of both chickens. Use all of the paste and try to distribute evenly. Drizzle each chicken with more olive oil and massage the skin. The idea here is to lube them up like suntan lotion. This will really help to get a nice brown crispy skin. Sprinkle each chicken generously with salt. Truss each chicken. Place the diced veggies, bay leaves and thyme bundle in a roasting pan large enough to accommodate the 2 chickens without touching. Usually a 9 by 13-inch roasting pan will be perfect. Add 2 cups of chicken stock and season generously with salt. Arrange the chickens on top of the veggies in the roasting pan and place in the preheated oven. Check the chickens about 15 minutes into the cooking process, the skin should be starting to turn a lovely brown. Lower the heat to 375 degrees F and continue roasting. After another 15 minutes, remove the chickens from the oven and turn over. At this point check the level of liquid in the roasting pan. If most of the liquid has evaporated, add another cup of stock and return the chickens to the oven. When the chickens have browned on the bottom, about 15 minutes, remove them from the oven and turn them back over. Return the chickens to the oven for the final 15 minutes of cooking. During this time the skin on the chickens should be very brown and crispy. Remove the chickens from the oven and take the temperature in the crease between the thigh and the breast. (When doing this be sure not to have the thermometer probe touch a bone or you will get an inaccurate reading.) The thermometer should read between 160 and 170 degrees F. When cooking poultry in general the rule is 17 minutes per pound. If the thermometer reads less than 160 degrees F return the chicken to the oven for an additional 10 minutes and then re-check the temperature. When chickens have reached the proper temp remove them from the roasting pan, place them on a warm platter and cover loosely with foil. Let sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes before carving. After the chickens have been removed from the roasting pan, skim off the excess fat from the surface of the liquid. The easiest way to do this is to prop up 1 end of the pan and allow the fat to run to the other end of the pan. You may not be able to get all of the fat, which is ok-fat tastes good! Put the roasting pan on a burner, add the wine, bring to a medium heat and reduce by half. Add the remaining chicken stock and taste. Add salt if needed- you probably will need salt. At this point you can decide if you are a \strainer\ or not a strainer, meaning if you would like to strain the chunky vegetables out of the sauce or not. I myself, am not a strainer. When the sauce has reached the desired consistency and flavor remove from the heat and pour into desired serving vessel. To carve the chickens: Cut off the twine. Pull the thigh and leg away from the breast of the chicken until the thigh bone \pops\ out of the socket. This is also a sign that the chicken is cooked properly. Separate the thigh and drumstick. Remove the breast from the carcass by feeling for the ridge of the breastbone in the center of the chicken and slicing around the rib cage. Arrange the chicken on a serving platter or on individual plates with the mashed potatoes and gravy &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 30086,&quot;Roasted Cauliflower Popcorn with cl-Lime Seasoning 1 head cauliflower, florets cut or broken into bite-size pieces 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> About 1 tablespoon Mexican cl-lime seasoning, such as Tajin<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

In a separate bowl, soak the salt cured beef in cool water to cover to tenderize the meat, do this overnight also but change the water a couple of times. Drain the beans and carne seca; cut up the cured beef into chunks. Coat a large heavy pot with the oil and place over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the salt pork, onions, garlic, pepper, and bay leaves. Cook and stir for 5 minutes to render out the pork fat and soften the vegetables. Add the ham hocks, sausage, ribs, cubed beef, carne seca, and black beans. Cover with just enough cold water to cover (about 21/2 quarts). Bring the liquid to a boil and then reduce to medium-low heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours, stirring now and again. Skim any foam that rises to the surface during cooking and add more water if necessary to keep the ingredients covered during cooking. Dig the ham hocks out of the pot, discard the rind and fat, shred the meat, and return the ham to the pot. The beans should be really tender, like they are almost bursting. Mash about 1 cup of the beans against the side of the pot to cream them out. Give the stew a good stir, taste and check for seasoning. To serve, ladle some of the bean broth into shot glasses or little cups, add a dash of hot pepper sauce and drink ? this is traditionally done to get the palate prepared for the feijoada. Serve feijoada in large wide bowls, garnished with orange segments and accompanied by collard greens and white rice. To prepare the greens: cut away the tough stalks and stems from the collards and discard any leaves that are bruised or yellow. Fill the sink with water and salt, the salt helps to remove any impurities. Wash the collards thoroughly to remove the grit, 2 or 3 times, until the water runs clear. Dry thoroughly. Stack up several leaves and roll up lengthwise in a bundle, cut them into 1-inch ribbons. Repeat until all the leaves are shredded. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; blanch the collard greens for 3 minutes until tender but still bright green. Drain the greens well. Heat a large deep skillet over medium flame and coat with the oil. Add the garlic and saute for 2 minutes to soften. Add the blanched greens and toss well with the oil and garlic. Pour in the chicken broth and cook for 5 minutes until the greens are wilted and tender; take care not to overcook. Season with salt and pepper and serve with the feijoada. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Rioja, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 30097,&quot;Peking Duck Noodle Soup 3 tablespoons vegetable oil Bones from 1 duck 1 onion, chopped 2 celery stalks, chopped 2 carrots, chopped 2 inches fresh ginger, sliced 1 clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns 2 kaffir lime leaves Salt and pepper 2 baby bok choy, sliced 1 cup chopped scallions 1 hot red cl, cut into thin strips 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 package wonton egg noodles 2 cooked duck breasts Thai basil, for garnish Lime slices, for garnish Sriracha sauce, for serving Instructions: For the broth: In a large stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.

In a sweeping motion, make a pocket inside each chop without carrying the knife completely through the rim of fat, leaving about a 2-inch hole. Season the chops on both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside. For the stuffing. In a large bowl, gently combine the crumbled muffins, celery, cranberries, onion, parsley, butter, paprika, sage and enough stock to moisten it. This should not be drippy wet or cakey dry. Taste and season with a pinch salt if needed and a few grinds of pepper. Put the stuffing in a piping bag with the largest tip (or use a plastic bag and cut a corner). Squeeze the stuffing into the center of each pork chop and secure the hole with a toothpick. For the dredge: Set up a dredging station with the flour in one shallow dish and the buttermilk in a second shallow dish. Season each with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Dredge the chops in the flour first, then in the buttermilk and finally back in the flour. Rest the chops in the flour or on a wire rack for 15 minutes. For the sauce. In a small saucepot on medium heat, add the jellied cranberry sauce, chicken stock and honey. Cook until the cranberry dissolves and the liquid reduces and becomes slightly thicker, about 5 minutes. Add the thyme and stir in the butter until it melts. Taste and season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Keep warm. To fry and serve: Using a Dutch oven, your heaviest pot or a deep fryer, bring at least 4 inches of oil to 370 degrees F. Gently place the chops into the oil without overcrowding; you may need to do this in batches. The temperature will lower while frying; hold it at 350 degrees F. Cook until the chops reach an internal stuffing temperature of 150 degrees F, 10 to 14 minutes. Remove to a wire rack, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and gently cover with aluminum foil, allowing for air to escape so the chops don&#39;t steam. Rest the chops 5 minutes like this. Serve with a drizzle of the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 30100,&quot;Spiced Iced Hot Chocolate 6 egg yolks 8 ounces confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 6 ounces butter 3 ounces dark chocolate 2 ounces honey<br> 1 ounce brandy<br> 1/2 ounce espresso<br> 1 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 3 ounces cocoa powder<br> 1 cup heavy cream<br> 500 milliliters (2 cups 2 tablespoons) heavy cream 500 grams (17 2/3 ounces) granulated sugar<br> 3 vanilla beans, split and seeded 4 whole eggs 10 sheets gelatin 250 grams (8 3/4 ounces) raspberry puree<br> 250 grams (8 3/4 ounces) sugar<br> 200 grams dried cranberries, chopped<br> Instructions: For the chocolate: In an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the yolks and confectioners&#39; sugar until doubled in volume.

Allow to rest. Meanwhile, using a saute pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, the roasted poblano and jalapeno chiles and onion. Cook for 5 minutes, until the onion is translucent. Remove and cool. Then, in a large saute pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the shallots. Cook softly over medium heat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Then add the cl-onion mixture and cook for another 5 minutes. Then add the nopales. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper and set aside. On a hot grill, cook the steak for 7 to 8 minutes on each side until medium-rare and remove from the grill. Allow to rest for 5 minutes, then slice into 1-inch pieces. Divide the cl-onion mixture onto 4 plates and top with the sliced steak. Next, top with some Epazote Butter, however much you&#39;d like, and put the plate under a broiler just for a few seconds, long enough for the butter to melt. Good to go. Serve and enjoy! Heat a dry skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in the cumin, coriander, fennel and mustard seeds along with the pieces of ancho and pasilla chiles. Toast, stirring constantly, until it&#39;s very aromatic and just begins to smoke, about 3 minutes. Dump the mixture onto a plate and let it cool to room temperature. Grind it to a fine powder in a spice grinder or clean coffee grinder. Put the powder in a large bowl and add the oregano, paprika, garlic powder and onion powder. Stir them really well to combine. Store the adobo in an airtight container or resealable plastic bag in a cool, dark place for up to a month. In a blender, puree the epazote, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, salt and pepper with 1/2 cup water. Then take herb puree and mix well with softened butter until a green butter occurs. Once mixed, you can wrap in parchment paper and freeze. It keeps for up to a month. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 30113,&quot;Leek and Potato Cake 7 ounces all-purpose flour 1 stick unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 large egg yolk 3 tablespoons cold water (for emergency) 3 medium Yukon gold potatoes, peeled 2 leeks, trimmed, dark greens removed, rinsed well and sliced 1 shallot, finely chopped 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons butter, plus more for topping 2 ounces chopped guanciale, optional 3 large farm fresh eggs 1/2 cup whole milk 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for sprinkling Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the dough: Add the flour, butter and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer. Run the machine at its slowest setting for 5 to 7 minutes. Add the yolk, and as the butter starts breaking into the dough, you will notice that your mix will start looking like coarse crumbs. As time goes by, the crumbs will become smaller and smaller until the dough will start forming. This is the only tricky part: in case the dough is not forming right (it&#39;s usually because of a small egg yolk), slowly add the cold water, not all at once, just the right amount for the dough to come alive and start detaching from the sides of the bowl. Remove the dough from the mixer, form it into a disc and put it to rest, covered in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Butter an 11-inch tart pan.<br> For the filling: In a pot of boiling water, cook the potatoes half way, for about 15 minutes, then remove from the hot water and set aside to cool off. Once cool, slice into thin slices.<br> In a medium pan, saute the leeks and shallots over medium heat in the oil and butter until soft and just golden, about 7 minutes. (Or saute the leeks and shallots with the guanciale.) Let cool.<br> In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk, Parmesan and some salt and pepper. Add the leeks and shallots to the egg mixture and stir well with a fork until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.<br> Dust some flour on a flat surface. Lightly dust your wood rolling pin and start working the dough. Do not press too hard, give the dough some time to respond to the pin and start softening up. Flip it a couple of times, dust it with flour, and mostly importantly do not guess the size. Keep the buttered pan close and prop it on top of the dough from time to time. Keep in mind that you will have to roll the dough a bit wider, as the pan has edges that need to be completely covered. Place the dough into the tart pan and, using a fork, poke holes into it to prevent swelling during the cooking process.<br> Pour the egg mixture slowly into the dough, using a spoon to make sure you create an even layer. Get creative and place the sliced potatoes very gently on top of the egg mixture, creating a pleasant concentric pattern. Sprinkle the top of the cake with freshly grated Parmesan, 3 or 4 small tabs of butter and some ground pepper. Place the pan on a sheet tray.<br> Cook in the oven for about 45 minutes, but make sure you check the cake after the first half hour, turn it around once or twice, and keep an eye on its color, which is the best indicator. The cake will be ready when the crust looks golden and the butter and cheese on top have become crisp and irresistible! When ready, let your new creation rest and settle for about 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and serve warm. Buon Appetito! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 30114,&quot;Classic Sour Cream Coffee Cake 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 pinch fine salt 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 cup sour cream Instructions: Combine the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl and mix to combine. Add the butter and mix thoroughly with your fingers or a fork until all of the butter has been evenly distributed and incorporated into the flour. Form into small to medium clumps with your fingers. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour, beating until just incorporated. Spoon the cake batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula. Sprinkle on the crumb topping. Bake until the cake and topping are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan 20 minutes, then invert onto a plate and re-invert onto a rack to cool completely.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30115,&quot;Meatballs 1 small onion, minced 1-ounce fresh white bread crumbs Milk to soak bread crumbs 1 pound 80 percent lean ground beef (chuck) 1 egg, lightly beaten 2 tablespoons each minced Italian parsley &amp; fresh mint Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Flour for dredging Instructions: Bring 3 cups of water to a boil and add minced onions. Immediately remove water from heat and pour into a strainer. Drain parboiled onions well, pat dry and set in a bowl. Soak bread crumbs in milk for 10 to 15 minutes. Drain through a sieve and press down lightly to squeeze out excess milk (but leave moist). To the onions add the ground beef and mix together with a fork. Add the parsley and mint, salt and pepper. (To taste for seasoning, first heat some of the mixture in a skillet; taste, then adjust seasoning). Set aside, refrigerated and covered for 1 hour to firm up. When ready to cook your meatballs, take a teaspoon of the meat mixture and form a ball the size of a walnut. To help shape the mixture dip your hands in cold water. Shape meatballs smoothly but don&#39;t overwork the meat. When all meatballs are shaped, heat oil and butter in a large skillet. Lightly dredge meatballs in flour and shake off excess. Saute meatballs for about 4 to 5 mins a side or until just done. They should be just cooked through, but still moist inside. Pat dry on paper towels. When ready to serve, place meatballs in the tomato sauce (see recipe below) to reheat and serve atop spaghetti. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barbera]&quot; 30116,&quot;Yucatan Rice 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock 2 (5-ounce) packages saffron yellow rice (recommended: Mahatma) 2 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup chopped pimientos 1/4 cup-seeded and diced canned green chiles, optional 1 cup frozen chopped onions, thawed Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan.

Grease two 6-inch cake pans. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the cake flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Mix until combined. In a separate bowl, mix 1/4 cup plus 2 3/4 tablespoons water, the egg whites, sour cream, lime zest and lime juice. In another small bowl, mix together the butter and oil until it reaches a mayonnaise-like consistency. Add half of both the sour cream and butter mixtures to the flour. Mix on medium speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the rest of the sour cream and butter mixtures and mix on medium speed until fully mixed together, 2 minutes. Divide the cake batter between the prepared cake pans, filling each to about two-thirds full. Bake until cooked through and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 24 minutes. Let the cake set in the refrigerator for 1 hour or in the freezer for 30 minutes before applying icing. Trim the tops of each cake and cut each widthwise into 2 layers. This will give you 4 layers of cake. Starting with the bottom layer, brush with the Tequila Simple Syrup. Using a pastry bag filled with Salted Lime Buttercream, pipe a thin ring around the outside edge of the cake, this will keep your curd from oozing out. Spread a thin layer of Lime Curd inside ring. Use the pastry bag to pipe a full layer of buttercream on top of curd, about 1/4-inch thick. Place the next cake layer on top and repeating the process with the syrup, buttercream and lime curd and repeat the process with the third layer of cake, ending with the final cake layer on top of the buttercream. Remove the excess filling from the outside of cake with an offset spatula. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to set. Once the cake is cool, ice with the remaining Salted Lime Buttercream and serve. Combine 1/2 cup water with the sugar in a pot, heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the tequila and stir until combined. Set aside to cool. In a small pot combine the sugar and 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage. Use a candy thermometer to monitor temperature. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, use an electric mixer to whip the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed to a soft peak. When the sugar syrup reaches 225 degrees F, add it slowly to the whipped egg whites, continuing to beat on medium speed until cool. While the mixer is running, add the butter a few pieces at a time. Add the lime juice, salt and vanilla extract. Mix until combined. In a large metal bowl, combine the sugar, lime juice and lime zest. Whisk the eggs into the lime mixture and set the bowl over a pot of boiling water. Stir constantly until the curd starts to thicken, about 10 minutes. Strain the curd through a mesh strainer into another bowl. Add the butter a few cubes at a time and whisk until smooth. Set aside to cool, stirring frequently. Once the curd is cool, keep it in the refrigerator in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30118,&quot;Pan Fried White Fish 1 1/4 pounds sea bass fillets, skin on Coarse salt and cracked black pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, to coat fish 2 teaspoons olive oil Instructions: Unwrap fish but leave it on the butcher paper.

Allow to cool until lukewarm to the touch. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the all-purpose and bread flours, superfine sugar, salt and yeast and attach a dough hook. Turn the mixer to low speed and then slowly pour in the butter mixture. Add the egg and knead on medium speed for 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Knead with your hands until you have a smooth, soft and elastic dough. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover and let stand for 15 minutes. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a rough rectangle about 17 inches wide and 12 inches tall. The dough should be about 1/4 inch thick. Use a pastry wheel or knife to trim off any rough edges and create an even rectangle. Butter a 7-inch cake tin with a removable base and set aside. For the filling: Spread the peanut butter on top of the dough to the edges, leaving a small (1/2-inch) border uncovered at the top and bottom of the dough (tip: if your peanut butter is slightly too stiff to spread, pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds). Repeat the process with the jam. Use a knife or pastry wheel to cut long strips of dough 2 inches wide. Roll each strip into a tight spiral and transfer to the prepared cake tin. Leave enough space between each for them to proof. Cover with a damp tea towel and allow to rise until the buns have doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 170 degrees C/340 degrees F. Bake until golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. If the buns are browning too quickly, simply cover them with aluminum foil. For the icing: Meanwhile, add the powdered sugar and vanilla to a medium bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of milk and whisk the mixture together. Add more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the icing is lump-free and thick but still runny. Assembly: Remove the buns immediately from the cake tin, then spread the icing over top.

Coat a large wide pot lightly with olive oil. Lay the duck legs skin side down, in a single layer, in the pan. Cook the duck legs low and slow over low heat to render the fat. This process will take a while, don&#39;t rush it. It is really important to render as much fat out of the duck legs as possible. Once the pan is full of fat, turn up the heat and brown the duck legs on both sides. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Once the legs have rendered and are nice and brown, remove them from the pan and reserve. Add the onions and season with salt. Stir to coat with the duck fat. Cover and cook over medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes. Once the onions are really nice and wilted, remove the lid and cook for another 15 minutes or until the onions start to caramelize. Taste to make sure they are very well seasoned, add salt if needed. Return the duck legs to the pan, snuggle them in with all the onions and add the wine, thyme and bay leaves. Cover the pan and place in the preheated oven. Braise the duck in the oven for about 90 minutes. Stir the onion and duck every 30 minutes to be sure that the onions are not burning. When done, the duck should be incredibly flavorful, tender and falling off the bone. Remove the tough lower stems from the dandelion greens, wash and spin them dry. Cut them into 1 -inch lengths. Place the greens in a large bowl with red wine vinegar. Season with salt and some of the warm duck fat. Strain some the onions out of the duck fat and toss them in with the greens. Place a large mound of the dressed dandelion greens on each serving plate, lay a duck leg on the greens and top with a little more of the onions. It&#39;s just ducky!!! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 30131,&quot;Nashville Hot Chicken 2 cups buttermilk 2 tablespoons hot sauce<br> 12 chicken tenders, or 3 chicken breasts sliced into tender strips<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil 3 dried guajillo chiles, left whole<br> 1/4 cup dark chili powder<br> 1/4 cup smoked paprika<br> 1/4 cup cayenne pepper<br> 1/4 cup crushed red pepper 4 ounces brown sugar 3 ounces cayenne pepper<br> 1 ounce ground cinnamon<br> 1 ounce dark chili powder<br> 1 ounce smoked paprika<br> 1 ounce ground white pepper<br> 1 ounce kosher salt<br> 1 pound all-purpose flour 2 ounces coarse black pepper<br> 1 ounce smoked paprika<br> 1 ounce celery salt<br> 1 ounce kosher salt<br> 1/2 ounce garlic powder<br> 1/2 ounce onion powder<br> 1/2 ounce dried thyme<br> 12 Hawaiian sweet slider rolls 1 red onion, thinly sliced<br> Pickled cucumber slices, for serving Instructions: For the chicken: Pour the buttermilk and hot sauce over the chicken in a shallow dish. Let sit for 15 minutes. Preheat a deep-fryer or a large Dutch oven filled with 3 inches oil to 325 degrees F. Line a sheet tray with a wire rack. For the cl oil: Add the oil, chiles, chili powder, smoked paprika, cayenne and crushed red pepper to a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Allow the oil to come to a simmer, then turn off the heat and let the chiles steep in the oil for 5 minutes. Strain and let cool. For the shake: Add the brown sugar, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, chili powder, smoked paprika, white pepper and salt to a bowl. Stir to combine and set aside until later. For the dredge: Add the flour, pepper, smoked paprika, celery salt, kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder and thyme to a very large bowl or shallow dish. Add the marinated chicken pieces, one by one, and pat the dredge onto the chicken, creating little crackles in the chicken piece. Shake off any excess dredge and add the chicken to the fryer. Fry in batches, turning occasionally, until just slightly golden and it has an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and let rest on the wire rack until just cool to touch. Add back to the fryer and double-fry until super golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain again on the wire rack. Dip the fried chicken in the cl oil and add to a shallow dish. Dust each piece with the shake thoroughly until no oil is apparent on both sides. To serve: Split the Hawaiian rolls in half. Put a tender between each roll, then top with the sliced onion and a pickle chip or two. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 30132,&quot;Sauternes Apple Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Pinch baking powder Pinch fine salt 2 sticks cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 tablespoon Sauternes wine 8 to 10 tablespoons ice water 1/4 cup Sauternes wine or Moscato 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 5 pounds baking apples, such as Golden Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Braeburn or Golden Delicious (10 to 11 medium-large apples) 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus 1 tablespoon melted, for brushing 2/3 cup sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for sprinkling 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, optional Instructions: For the crust: Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a food processor and run for 10 seconds. Add the butter and pulse in 1-second bursts until only very small pieces of butter are visible, 12 to 15 pulses. Pulse in the Sauternes, and then pulse in the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough just comes together. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and bring together into a ball. Turn the dough out onto a dry surface and divide into 2 disks, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Roll out the larger disk of dough on a lightly-floured surface until 1/8-inch thick and 11 inches in diameter to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place into the pie plate and trim the overhang to 1/2 inch without crimping the edges. Refrigerate while preparing the filling. For the filling: Combine the Sauternes and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve and core the apples and slice them into 1/4-inch wedges. Toss the apples with the wine and lemon juice. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the apples and some of the wine and lemon juice, sprinkle with half of the sugar and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the apples until they soften and there are no juices in the pan, about 8 minutes. Transfer the apples to a medium bowl. Melt 2 more tablespoons of butter in the same skillet, and repeat with the remaining apples, wine and lemon juice and sugar. If any juice has collected from the first batch of apples, pour those juices over the second batch of apples while they are cooking. Toss together both batches of apples with the cinnamon and cardamom, if using. Set aside to cool completely. For assembling: Pour the filling into the prepared pie shell. Roll the smaller disk of dough on a lightly-floured surface to 1/8-inch thick and place on top of the filling. Fold the edges over and then decoratively crimp. Cut slits into the top crust to allow steam to escape, and then transfer to the freezer for 30 minutes to let the dough rest. Brush the crust with the melted butter and sprinkle with the sugar. Place in the lower third of oven and bake until golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cook&#39;s Note: You can cook the apples for the filling 1 day ahead. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 30133,&quot;Whole Grilled Bluefish 1 whole bluefish, cleaned 3 tablespoons, olive oil 2 lemons, juiced 3 limes, juiced 2 tablespoons freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons sea salt 1 to 2 lemons, cut in wedges Instructions: Preheat grill to medium.

For each pot of crabs, add water, beer, and approximately 1/4 packet of crab boil seasoning to pot. Bring to boil. With gloves on, remove crabs from bushel, you may have to pull them apart (carefully!) and put/shake a few at a time into pot. It is best to grab them from behind to avoid the claws, as their legs only move forward. Add enough crabs to fill bottom of pot. Sprinkle more crab boil seasoning over first layer of crabs. Continue, alternating crabs and seasoning until pot is nearly full, leaving about an inch at the top. Cover tightly. Steam over high heat for 14 to 16 minutes, or until shells are bright orange. Halfway through cooking time, shake pot to redistribute seasoning. When done, remove pot from heat. Drain over sink the accumulated liquid from pot. Spread crabs onto large tray; place in center of table where guests help themselves. Serve with small dishes of melted butter and, for those who like added seasoning, place small bowls of extra crab boil seasoning on table. Eating guidelines: It is easier to learn how to eat crabs from an expert, but if none is available, here are step-by-step instructions. First, pull off claws and legs. Break legs and check for meat. Sucking is okay. Some like to save the claws for last because they are rather dessert-like, although the \lump\ meat from the body is prized most. Next, turn the crab on its back. You will see an elongated part of the shell that looks like a \T.\ Some call it the key, even though it doesn&#39;t look very much like one. The female key is plumper; the male&#39;s is more elongated. Pull the key back, breaking it off, which makes the rest of the shell easy to remove. Now the body of the crab is shell-less. You will now see the long rib-like strips on either side of the cavity. These are the crab&#39;s gills. Edible, but not very good. Pull them off, and you will more easily be able to break the crab in half. When you do this, you will most likely now see a good amount of white, fleshy \lump\ crab meat. Continue opening the small sections to expose more meat. You will not need mallets or hammers for this. When you are ready for the claws, break them in half at the joint. Take a wooden mallet and whack the large half hard. Don&#39;t be shy. Other helpful hints: Don&#39;t wear your Sunday best. If it tastes good, you can eat it. Plates and cutlery are unnecessary; the brown paper is a communal plate. Bibs are for babies. When finished, steamed hand towels are very welcome. The easiest way to dispose of the mess is to roll up the brown paper with all the shells, etc. on it -- taking care to \rescue\ knives, bowls, etc. first -- and discard in outdoor trash can. The garbage may attract animals, so be sure to keep the lid on tight. Note: Leftover crabs are excellent cold, served with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce. Cooked crabs will keep in refrigerator for a few days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30158,&quot;Loaded Potato Soup 6 slices bacon, chopped 2 medium yellow onions, chopped<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 3 tablespoons flour<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cups chicken broth<br> 1 cup heavy cream<br> 3 pounds russet potatoes, chopped<br> 1 cup sour cream<br> 3 cups shredded cheddar 4 scallions, sliced, for garnish<br> Instructions: Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

Add the allspice. Make a slurry by mixing the cornstarch into the remaining 1/4 cup broth, whisking to get out all the lumps. Whisk the slurry into the skillet and when the mixture starts to boil again, slowly add the cream, whisking constantly. Add the All-Purpose Meatballs, cover and cook until the sauce thickens and the meatballs are heated through, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve over buttered noodles and garnish with fresh parsley. To make the meatballs, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, milk, cream, parsley, mustard, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Mix together well with your hands. Scoop out 1-tablespoon portions and roll them into balls with your hands. Place the meatballs onto parchment-lined baking sheets and put the baking sheets in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes for the meatballs to firm up. To brown the meatballs, heat the olive oil in a heavy pot or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook, turning the meatballs to make sure they brown all over, 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels. Freezer instructions: Put the cooked meatballs in a single layer on baking sheets and put into the freezer. When frozen, divide them into freezer bags, 25 per bag, and return them to the freezer. Yield: 125 meatballs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 30190,&quot;Big Eye Tuna Ceviche with Peppercress and Roasted Calabaza Salad in a Tuna Caviar Vinaigrette 1 teaspoon tuna caviar 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 lemon, juiced 1 lime, juiced 2 tablespoons pumpkin seed oil 1/2 cup toasted, ground pumpkin seeds 1 tablespoon garlic chives, chopped 1 pound Big Eye Tuna, diced Salt and pepper, to taste 1 pound Calabaza squash, 1-inch dice 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and pepper, to taste 8 ounces peppercress 1 tablespoon pumpkin seed oil 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 1 lemon, juiced 1 lime, juiced Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Blend tuna caviar, olive oil, lemon and lime juice and pumpkin seed oil in a blender.

Heat a 6-inch non-stick pan over medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons crepe batter into the pan and quickly rotate the pan so the batter forms a thin layer over the bottom of the pan. (Return excess batter to the remaining batter.) Cook the crepe for 1 to 2 minutes until it is golden brown. Loosen the edge of the crepe with a knife and using your fingers, invert the crepe and cook the other side for about 10 seconds. Continue cooking crepes until you have at least 12. Make sure the crepes are cool and then cover them with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until you are ready to serve them. Apple Balls: Peel the apples. Using a melon baller, scoop out the apple balls making sure you do not scoop into the core. Make 42 balls total. Combine the cider, sugar, and water in a medium-sized saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil for about 30 seconds until the sugar dissolves. Reduce the cider mixture to a gentle boil. Place the apple balls in the cider syrup and cover them with parchment paper or a cloth towel. Poach the apple balls for about 5 minutes until the are soft. Be careful not to over-poach them as you want them to retain their shape. Poaching timing will depend on the variety of apple being used. Remove the apples from the cider syrup, reserving the syrup. The apples can be poached ahead of time. Plating: Place the cider syrup in a large saute pan over medium heat. Place the crepes 1 at a time in the liquid, folding them into quarters once they have been coated with the syrup. Heat the crepes until they are warmed through. Place 2 crepes on each plate.

Set halibut over the vegetables, season with salt and pepper and add stock or broth just to cover. Simmer, covered, over low heat, until fish is just done, about 10 minutes. With a slotted spatula, remove haibut from the liquid and divide into two portions. Set each portion in the bottom of a deep soup plate and garnish with carrot threads or snow peas; season the broth and spoon it over the top; garnish with black sesame seeds if you wish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30213,&quot;Kimchi Pizza with Bacon 3 1/2 cups prepared kimchi 1 ripe pear, peeled, cored and roughly chopped (about 1/2 cup) 8 slices bacon, cut in 1/2-inch pieces 1 pound store-bought pizza dough All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar 1 cup shredded mozzarella 2 tablespoons sesame seeds 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallion greens, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F and place a rack on the bottom shelf. Place 2 cups of the kimchi and the pear into the bowl of a food processor. Blend to a chunky puree. Drain the liquid from the remaining kimchi into the food processor, and then chop into bite-size pieces. Cook the bacon in a large saute pan over medium heat until crispy and most of the fat has rendered, 12 to 15 minutes. While the bacon is cooking, roll out the pizza dough. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the back of an inverted baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the oven on the bottom shelf. Lightly dust the parchment with flour. Divide the dough in half, and then stretch or roll 1 piece of dough into an 11-inch round directly on the parchment paper. Once the bacon is crispy, use a slotted spoon to transfer half of the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Add the kimchi puree to the remaining bacon in the pan. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble 1 pizza, spread half of the kimchi sauce on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle half of both cheeses over the kimchi sauce. Spread half of the chopped kimchi over the cheese. Brush the crust with half of the remaining sesame oil and sprinkle with half of the sesame seeds. Carefully lift the parchment onto the heated baking sheet. Cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with half of the reserved bacon and garnish with some sliced scallions. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 1 more pizza. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 30214,&quot;Caramelized Onion Dip 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 3 pounds yellow onions, cut in half lengthwise and crosswise into 1/4-inch slices<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> Salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br> 3 dashes hot sauce, optional<br> One 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened<br> 1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream<br> Chopped chives, for garnish, optional<br> Instructions: Heat the butter and olive oil in a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until soft and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt. Stir in the vinegar and simmer until the mixture is dry. Add the hot sauce if using. Remove the mixture from the heat and allow the onions to cool slightly. Mix the cream cheese until smooth in a large bowl. Fold in the sour cream and caramelized onions. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with chives if using.

Mix the Parmesan, egg yolks, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper together in a medium bowl; set aside. Snap off the woody ends of the asparagus stalks. Use a vegetable peeler to shave the asparagus into thin wide ribbons. (The last strip of asparagus will be a little thicker than the others, but it is fine to use.) Set aside. Cook the fettuccine in the boiling water according to the package instructions for al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water, then drain. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat from the skillet. Add the crushed red pepper flakes and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium low, add the drained pasta and asparagus and toss until well coated and mixed with the bacon.<br> Whisk 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water into the egg mixture, then quickly pour it over the pasta and toss to gently cook the eggs and make a creamy sauce. Thin out the mixture with more pasta water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time. Divide among 4 bowls and garnish with the parsley and more Parmesan if desired.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 30216,&quot;Cucumber Cups with Salmon Mousse 10 seedless cucumbers, each about 10 ounces and 11 inches long, ends trimmed 18 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 ounces smoked salmon Several drops freshly squeezed lemon juice Several drops orange blossom water Pinch hot paprika 2 to 3 tablespoons heavy cream Freshly ground white pepper, to taste Coriander sprigs, for garnish Instructions: If cucumbers are waxed, peel them. Cut each crosswise into 5 (1 3/4-inch) pieces. With a small melon baller, carefully scoop out the insides of each piece, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edge and a 1/2-inch border on the bottom. The cucumber cups may be prepared up to 4 hours in advance, arranged on damp paper towels, tightly covered and refrigerated. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the cream cheese, smoked salmon, lemon juice, orange water, paprika, cream and white paper and process until smooth. Chill for at least 30 minutes. To assemble spoon salmon mousse into a piping bag fitted with a decorative tip, pipe the mousse into the cucumber cups. Garnish with parsley or coriander sprig. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30217,&quot;Fudgy Salty Peanut Butter Brownies 1 1/4 sticks unsalted butter, plus more, softened, for pan 1 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 1/3 cups sugar 1 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips 1 cup creamy peanut butter (don&#39;t use old-fashioned or natural) 1/2 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup powdered sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 1/4 tablespoons milk 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups salted cocktail peanuts 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips 7 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. For your brownie batter: Melt your butter in a medium (or large) heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. While the butter is melting, whisk the cocoa powder, sea salt and sugar in a separate bowl. (The sugar and salt will work as abrasive agents to get any lumps out of the cocoa.) Whisk the cocoa/sugar/salt combo into the melted butter until the sugar has dissolved fully. The mixture should look like fudge and pull away from the bowl into a ball. Take off the stove and set the pan on a dishtowel on your counter. Allow the fudgy mixture to cool down until it&#39;s warm, but not hot anymore. While that is cooling, line the bottom and sides of your 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper or foil. You want to leave about 4 inches of overhang on the 2 opposite sides. These serve as your handles to remove the brownies from the pan in 1 piece, so make sure that there is enough of the overhang for you to have a solid grip. Grease the parchment or foil well. Stir in the vanilla into the cooled fudge mixture to loosen it up. Add the eggs into the mixture 1 at a time, adding the second egg after the first egg is fully incorporated. The batter should look shiny and well blended. Add in your flour and stir it until it&#39;s fully incorporated. Once it looks fully blended, beat the batter vigorously for at least 45 strokes. This&#39;ll not only get out any pent up stress, but it will make the brownies chewy. Fold in your chocolate chips. Spread the very thick and fudgy brownie batter evenly in the lined pan with an offset spatula or your greased hands. Pop the brownies in the oven and bake until they get a nice crust and your house smells like brownies, 30 to 35 minutes. Let them cool completely on a rack or a dishtowel on your counter. While the brownies are cooling make the buttercream and ganache. For the buttercream: Mix your peanut butter and butter together in a stand mixer until they are totally blended. Turn your mixer down and slowly add your powdered sugar and fine sea salt. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Turn your mixer back to medium, add your milk and vanilla and keep mixing until it&#39;s fully blended. Dollop the peanut butter buttercream in heaping spoonfuls on top of the cooled brownies. Evenly spread it with the back of a butter knife the over the surface. Scatter the peanuts evenly over the buttercream, pressing into the buttercream so that the ganache has something to hold on to and the peanuts are all covered. For the ganache: Melt the chocolate chips and butter together in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Allow the ganache to cool down slightly for 10 minutes or so, then pour it evenly over the peanut butter buttercream layer. Smooth the ganache out with the back of a butter knife, making sure to cover the buttercream and peanuts completely. Chill the brownies in the refrigerator until the toppings are set, 1 1/2 hours or so. Remove these delicious guys from the refrigerator. Lift up the ends of the foil liner and place the Fudgy Salty Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownies on a cutting board. Cut into squares. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Merlot]&quot; 30218,&quot;Penne with Pesto 1 large bunch fresh basil 2 cloves garlic 1/4 cup pine nuts 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning Freshly ground black pepper 1 pound penne rigate or other ridged small tube pasta Instructions: Meanwhile, pluck the basil leaves from the stems (you should have about 2 cups leaves). Wash the leaves in a large bowl of cold water and dry in a salad spinner or pat dry with paper towels. Smash and peel the garlic. Put the basil, garlic, and pine nuts in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. With the processor running, gradually add the olive oil and process until the pesto is smooth. Transfer the pesto to a large bowl and stir in the cheese. Season with the salt and some pepper. Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil over high heat and salt it generously. Add the penne and boil, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain in a colander and save about 1/4 cup pasta cooking water. Add the pasta to the bowl. Use tongs and toss with enough of the cooking water so the pesto coats the pasta evenly. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm. Upgrades: a. Make the pesto creamy by adding 1/4 cup ricotta cheese when processing the basil, garlic, and pine nuts. This is great with tortellini or ravioli. b. Top dressed pesto pasta with 1/2 pound diced large or halved small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), 3 medium tomatoes cut in large chunks, and 1/2 cup pitted black olives, (we like kalamata for this), roughly chopped. c. Add cooked 1 to 2 cups chicken or shrimp. Twists on Pesto: In place of basil, try the following combination: 1 cup parsley, 1 cup fresh spinach leaves, 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves, 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves. Substitute walnuts for the pine nuts &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 30219,&quot;Chorizo and Corn Bread Stuffing 1 pound hard chorizo diced 1 white onion diced 1/2 cup chopped carrot (1 large carrot) 1/2 cup chopped celery 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 cups crumbled corn bread 1/2 cup chicken stock 1/4 cup chopped cilantro Instructions: Cook the chorizo in a skillet over medium heat until the fat has been rendered, about 5 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic to the chorizo and cook until the vegetables have carmelized, about 10 minutes. Add the crumbled corn bread, chicken stock, and cilantro. Make sure that the stuffing itself is not to dry but at the same time not to wet. Place the stuffing into a buttered casserole and bake in the oven until heated through and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 30220,&quot;Porcini Carpaccio 4 porcini mushrooms, sliced very thin on a mandoline Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Fresh lemon juice Shaved Parmesan, for serving Instructions: Arrange the mushroom slices on a large platter.

Sprinkle each duck leg with the rub and place in a nonreactive dish. Cover the dish in plastic wrap and cure in the refrigerator for 2 days. Place the cured duck in a large sous vide bag with the duck fat. Seal at 100 percent and sous vide the legs at 180.5 degrees F. for 8 hours. Cool the bagged duck in an ice bath and refrigerate. For the curry paste: Combine the curry paste, ginger, turmeric, curry powder, shallot and dried chiles in a blender and puree to a smooth consistency. Set aside. For the soup base: Heat the coconut cream in a 4-quart pot until boiling. Add the curry paste mixture. Lower the heat to medium, stir the mixture and cook until the curry paste is completely incorporated and the sauce is thick, approximately 15 minutes. In a separate 2-quart pot, combine the chicken stock, fish sauce, soy sauce and palm sugar and bring to a boil. Add the chicken stock mixture to the coconut cream and curry paste. Cook at a low boil until thickened, about 20 minutes. For the squid ink pasta: Pour the flour on a work table and make a well in the middle. Combine the eggs, gochugaru and squid ink together in a small bowl and pour into the well. Add salt and slowly whisk together the eggs and flour with a fork, collapsing the flour wall slowly into the eggs. Incorporate all the egg mixture into the flour and knead for 10 minutes. Form the dough into a flat disc and wrap it in plastic. Let it rest 1 hour before rolling it out with a pasta machine to fettuccine width. For garnish and assembly: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Reheat the soup to a simmer. Heat an 8-inch saute pan over medium heat, add some grapeseed oil and, working in batches if necessary, sear the duck legs until the skin crisps up, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the pieces to a baking sheet and place in the oven until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest, keeping the duck warm. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water for 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and divide among 6 deep soup bowls. Pour the soup in the bowls, top with the duck confit.

Build a base of coals by burning down several logs until the temperature reaches 225 degrees F. Coat the brisket on all sides with 8 ounces salt and then 8 ounces pepper, starting on the bottom and moving to the top. Place the brisket in the smoker and smoke for 6 hours. Replenish the wood as needed to maintain a steady stream of smoke, and adjust the airflow to maintain a constant temperature of 225 to 250 degrees F. Wrap the brisket tightly in foil and return it to the smoker until the probe of a meat thermometer easily slides through the meat (see Cook&#39;s Note). Let cool for 6 to 12 hours. While the coals are still hot, or over a gas flame, roast the peppers until the skins are completely black, turning frequently to ensure the flesh doesn&#39;t burn. Peel the peppers under cold water, then remove the stems and seeds. Butter the rolls on both sides and toast in a skillet over medium heat; set aside. Place the peppers in the skillet and place the cheese on top; cook until melted. Slice the brisket 1/2-inch thick and divide it among the bottom buns. Spread with barbecue sauce.

All cheese fondue recipes should contain some sort of starch, preferably flour or cornstarch; they protect the cheese from separating and curdling when melted.<br> Rub the inside of a fondue pot with the cut side of the sliced garlic and then discard. Place the pot over a sterno flame. Add the wine and bring to a gentle simmer, until tiny bubbles begin to rise to the surface, the wine&#39;s natural acidity makes the cheese smooth and creamy. Gradually stir the cheese into the simmering wine, allowing each handful to melt before adding another; melting the cheese slowly encourages a smooth fondue. Once the consistency is smooth, stir in the mustard, nutmeg and pepper. Plating: Arrange an assortment of bite-size dipping foods, such as chunks of baguette, vegetables, and meats, on a lazy Susan around the fondue pot. Spear with fondue forks or wooden skewers, dip, swirl, and enjoy! If the fondue begins to get too thick during the meal, add some more wine and stir vigorously until the fondue is smooth.

Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 30232,&quot;Strawberry Swirl Cheesecake Bars Crisco?

Put the chicken drumettes in a 1-gallon size, resealable plastic bag. Add the pineapple liquid to the chicken and seal removing as much air as possible from the bag. Marinate the chicken for 3 hours in the refrigerator. Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray it liberally with vegetable cooking spray. Remove the chicken from the marinade and arrange in a single layer on the prepared pan. Season the chicken with salt, to taste, and bake until the skin is caramelized and very dark in spots, about 30 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, put the marinade into a small saucepan. Whisk in the arrowroot or cornstarch, if using, and bring to a boil over medium heat (in order to kill bacteria). Reduce the heat to a low boil and cook until thick, about 5 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes. Using a pastry brush, brush some of the cooked marinade over the chicken or pour it into a small bowl and serve on the side. Arrange the chicken on a platter, sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]</p><p>&quot; 30234,&quot;Salsa de Molcajete 6 Serrano chiles, stems removed 2 ripe tomatoes 2 cloves garlic 1 teaspoon coarse salt Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Instructions: On a comal, roast the serranos and tomatoes for 5 to 10 minutes or until they are charred.

Add the water to the center of the bowl and mix on low speed to combine. Raise the speed to medium and knead until the dough pulls away from the bowl in a smooth, clean mass, about 10 minutes. \u200bLightly flour your workspace, turn the dough out of the bowl and lightly knead for about a minute, then shape into a ball. Lightly oil the inside of a large bowl, add the dough and rub oil over the top. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then put in a warm spot, such as the top of the fridge, until it\u2019s more than doubled in size, about 45 minutes.<br> \u200bWhen the dough is almost ready, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F with a rack in the middle position. Stack two matching baking sheets and place in the oven. Or, if you have a baking stone, use that instead.<br> Turn the dough out of the bowl, punch it down and flatten it until it\u2019s about 2 1/2 inches thick. Shape the dough into a boule (round loaf). Lightly flour the top, cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rise for another 25 minutes. \u200bRemove the plastic wrap and score the top of the loaf. Open the oven door all the way and use a baking peel or the floured underside of a baking sheet to slide the loaf onto the hot stacked baking sheets or baking stone, working gently but quickly so as not to deflate the dough. Bake for about 10 minutes, then open the oven door and carefully throw a few handfuls of water at the bottom of the oven to create steam. Close the door quickly and continue to bake until well browned, 12 to 15 minutes more. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F and bake until the loaf is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when you tap it, 15 to 20 minutes more. Transfer the loaf to a wire rack and let cool completely, at least 1 hour. That lets the crumb set. Listen to the loaf crackle as it cools\u2014that\u2019s a good sound. Serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 30238,&quot;Pasta and BLT Bake Kosher salt 8 ounces penne pasta 4 strips bacon 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand, with juices 5 ounces baby kale 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper 4 to 5 fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish, optional 8 ounces part-skim mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1/2 cup ricotta 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta. Set aside. Meanwhile, lay the bacon in a large ovenproof skillet and cook over medium heat, turning once, until brown and slightly crispy, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove the skillet from the heat, transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the drippings. Break up the bacon into bite-size pieces. Return the skillet to medium heat, add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and juices, kale, crushed red pepper, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the reserved pasta water. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens and the kale wilts, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the cooked pasta and mozzarella to the sauce and stir to thoroughly coat. Mix together the ricotta and Parmesan in a small bowl. Drop spoonfuls of the ricotta mixture on top of the pasta mixture. Sprinkle with the bacon pieces and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with additional basil if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 30239,&quot;Pistachio-Dusted Rose-Glazed Yeast Doughnuts 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup sugar 3 teaspoons instant yeast 1 lemon, zested 1 orange, zested 1/3 cup plus 4 tablespoons whole milk 2 teaspoons vanilla 2 eggs 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon salt Oil, for frying 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1 tablespoon rose water, orange blossom water or vanilla extract Red food coloring, for coloring, optional 1/2 cup pistachios, finely ground Instructions: For the doughnuts: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add 3 cups of the flour, the sugar, yeast, lemon zest and orange zest, and mix for a couple seconds. In a small bowl, mix the milk, vanilla and eggs, and set aside. Turn the mixer on and alternate adding the milk mixture with the melted butter, scraping down the sides. Repeat for the remaining milk and butter, until it is all incorporated, then add the salt in. When you finish adding in all the liquids, the dough will be a little wet. Slowly sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup flour until the dough comes together and leaves the sides of the mixing bowl almost clean. (If it reaches this stage before adding in the full 1/4 cup, do not add in the rest.) Turn the dough out and knead it on a floured surface until the dough is soft and comes together, 1 minute. Place the dough in a bowl with a little oil and cover with a damp cloth. Store in a warm place to proof until it doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours.<br> Roll the dough out to 1/2- to 1-inch thick and cut into doughnut shapes. Place the doughnuts on a floured tray and cover with a damp cloth, let rise for another 30 to 40 minutes.<br> While the dough is rising, heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. When the dough is fluffy and doubles in size, place it in the fryer for 2 minutes on each side. Take out the doughnuts and cool on a cooling rack.<br> While the doughnuts are cooling, make the glaze.<br> For the glaze: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar through a sifter into a bowl. Add the cream, rose water and a few drops food coloring if using, and mix. Set aside until the doughnuts are ready to be glazed.<br> When the doughnuts are cool, place a tray underneath the cooling rack and then dunk the doughnuts in the icing for a nice thick layer. Sprinkle with a dusting of the ground pistachios then place on the rack to set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30240,&quot;Fried Apples 4 apples, preferably green 2 tablespoons butter 1/3 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons water Instructions: Core the unpeeled apples, then cut into circles or slices. Cook in the butter, turning often, until soft. If you have a sweet tooth or if the apples are bland in flavor, stir in 1/3 cup brown sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Continue cooking until apples are coated with syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 30241,&quot;Almond Tarts 1/3 cup (67 grams) granulated sugar 1 3/4 cups (228 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 cup (168 grams) unsalted butter, cold and cubed<br> 2 large eggs, separated<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 1 cup (120 grams) almond meal 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, softened<br> 1 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1 large egg<br> About 1 cup (120 grams) powdered sugar, or more as needed 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) heavy cream, or more as needed, or 2 ounces fresh raspberries<br> 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br> To decorate: sprinkles, sliced almonds<br> Instructions: For the shells: Pulse together the granulated sugar, flour and salt in a food processor to combine. Add the butter and continue to pulse until mealy. Add the egg yolks (reserve the egg whites for the filling) and pulse until the dough comes together. Press the dough into a disc, then wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour, or up to overnight. To mold the shells, grease a muffin tin with nonstick spray. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to 1/4-inch-thick, dusting with more flour as needed. Cut out 3-inch circles and press them into the muffin cups so that the dough comes all the way up the sides. (No worries if the dough tears; just patch it up with additional dough.) Freeze the shells for 15 minutes.<br> For the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the almond meal, granulated sugar, salt, and butter, either by blending it in the food processor (no need to clean it out after making the dough, you can just use it immediately for this step), or by stirring it together in a large bowl (I find it&#39;s easiest to get in there with my hands). Add the almond extract, egg and the reserved egg whites from the shells, and continue to blend/stir until smooth and combined. Fill the frozen shells with the filling so that it comes up about 1/4-inch from the top. Bake until the tops and edges are lightly browned; begin checking for doneness at 30 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then use a small offset spatula or a knife to remove to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the glaze: If making the glaze with heavy cream, combine the powdered sugar, heavy cream and almond extract in a bowl until smooth. Add additional powdered sugar or liquid to thicken it up or thin it out so that you get the consistency of a thick glue.<br> To make the glaze with the raspberries, place the raspberries in a fine-mesh sieve and give them a rinse. Place the sieve over a bowl and use a stiff rubber spatula or wooden spoon to smash them through the sieve into the bowl until you&#39;re just left with seeds in the sieve. Be sure to scrape the underside of the sieve to get the stuff that&#39;s sticking to it. (You should be left with about 2 tablespoons seedless puree. If it&#39;s a tiny bit more or a tiny bit less, that&#39;s fine.) Add the powdered sugar and almond extract and mix to make a thick glaze. If it&#39;s too thick, add a few drops of water to thin it out, and if it&#39;s too thin, add a few more spoonfuls of powdered sugar. It should be the consistency of a thick glue.<br> Spread the glaze over the cooled tarts and decorate with sprinkles, almonds and anything else you&#39;d like! These will keep for several days at room temperature or in the fridge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30242,&quot;Cinnamon-Espresso Churros 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting 1 cup water 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons instant espresso powder 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 2 large eggs, at room temperature, beaten Canola oil, for frying Instructions: Cinnamon sugar: In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, cinnamon and espresso powder. Set aside.<br> Churros: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and dust liberally with flour. Set aside. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven, combine the water, butter, sugar, espresso powder, and salt over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and, using a wooden spoon, stir in the 1 cup of flour all at once. Return the pan to low heat and stir continuously until the mixture forms a thick dough, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. With the machine running on medium speed, slowly add the eggs. Continue to beat until the eggs are fully incorporated and the dough is thick, about 4 minutes. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe the dough onto the prepared baking sheet in 4-inch long logs.<br> In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about 1/3 of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in a couple of minutes.) Using a thin metal spatula, transfer the dough, 4 pieces at a time, into the hot oil, and fry until dark-golden and crispy, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and roll in the cinnamon-espresso sugar while still hot. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 30243,&quot;Chocolate-Dried Cherry Bread Pudding 2/3 cup (about 4 ounces) dark chocolate chips 5 large eggs 5 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons brandy Finely grated zest of 1/4 orange Seeds of 1/2 vanilla bean 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 5 tablespoons granulated sugar 6 slices soft white bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1/2 cup (about 3 ounces) milk chocolate chips 1/2 cup dried cherries Nonstick cooking spray 1 tablespoon Turbinado sugar Instructions: Put the dark chocolate chips in a large heatproof bowl.

Add 2 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat; cover, reduce the heat, and simmer until the vegetables are somewhat soft, about 10 minutes. Halve and seed the butternut squash and cut it into wedges. Tie parsley sprigs together with kitchen string. Add squash, zucchini, chickpeas, and parsley sprigs to the pot. Using your fingers and working over the pot, tear the tomatoes into big pieces and add them to the pot with their juices. Simmer the stew, covered, until it is slightly thick and fragrant, and the vegetables are fork tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes. (You can test the vegetables a bit sooner, remove them as soon as they are tender, and return them to the pot when you are ready to serve. All the vegetables should be tender enough to cut with the side of a fork, but still hold their shapes.) Remove cinnamon sticks. For the couscous: Bring water to a boil with the butter and salt in a small saucepan. Stir in the couscous, pull the saucepan off the heat, cover, and set aside until the water has been absorbed and the couscous is plump, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and fluff with a fork. To serve, spread the couscous over a large serving platter and, using a slotted spoon, mound the vegetables in the center. Pour some of the broth over the vegetables and sprinkle with the almonds.

In a pot, heat the water over medium heat. As the water begins to slowly heat, carefully pour the pulverized sugar into the center of the pot, creating a mound. Do not touch or mix the sugar into the water, let it dissolve on its own. Once the sugar-water begins to boil, keep a close eye on it: in a few minutes the water will boil away and then the sugar will begin to boil. Watch closely, the second the molten sugar begins to turn a light brown or caramel color, take it off the heat and add the whipping cream and butter. Cook&#39;s Note: Careful, it will spatter. Whisk the mixture until smooth. Add a big pinch of fleur de sel and whisk to incorporate. To make the French toast: In a big bowl, combine the eggs, milk, vanilla bean, sugar, and sea salt. Beat these ingredients together. In a frying pan, heat the unsalted butter over medium heat. Dip the bread slices in the egg mixture, turning the bread to coat evenly. Allow the excess egg mixture to drip back into the bowl and add the bread to the hot butter. Fry the bread for about 1 minute per side, or until golden. Turn the heat down to medium low and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Repeat as necessary.

Stir in the pine nuts and saute until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Watch the nuts carefully; they will continue cooking off of the heat and can burn easily. In a saucepan, combine the apricots, corn syrup, cinnamon, and almond extract with 1 cup of water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the sauce is fairly thick and spoonable, about 10 minutes. Stir in the pine nuts. Keep the compote warm or let it cool to room temperature. Start the pancake batter, placing 3/4 cup of the nuts in a food processor and pulsing briefly until ground. Avoid processing the nuts so long that they turn to butter. Add the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt and pulse to combine just until a coarse meal forms. Spoon the mixture into a large bowl and stir in the butter until it disappears. Add the eggs, milk, almond extract, and remaining nuts. Warm a griddle or a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Pour a thin film of oil onto the griddle. Pour or spoon out the batter onto the hot griddle, where it should sizzle and hiss. A generous 3 tablespoons of batter will make a 4-inch pancake. Make as many cakes as you can fit without crowding. Cook the pancakes until their top surface is covered in tiny bubbles but before all the bubbles pop, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook until the second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a bit more oil to the griddle as needed.

Boil this down until it gets thick--approximately 1 hour. (If it seems too thick, thin it out with water, chicken stock or more cream.) Cut the fillet into scallops and salt evenly on both sides. Allow them to sit for a half hour so that they will drain. After a half hour, dry off the liquid and brush off salt. Nick all around the edges of the fillets with a sharp knife. This allows the fillets to stay flat and cook more evenly. Heat the clarified butter in a saute pan. Coat fillets with instant or granulated flour, and then saute in clarified butter. The fillets should develop a crunch on the outside. Lightly steam the spinach and place on a plate. Dry off fillets on a towel and place them on a nest of spinach. Combine the minced tomatoes and the sherry vinegar and place the mixture on top of the fish. Drizzle cream sauce on top of the tomato concasse and then drape sauce around the plate.

Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate, and steam the artichokes until they&#39;re tender when pierced with a knife, or until the large leaves pull off easily, about 25 minutes. Drain, run under cold water to stop the cooking, and transfer to a platter. When cool enough to handle, remove the artichoke leaves. Using a small spoon, scrape out and discard the hairy chokes. Cut each artichoke bottom into eighths. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and heat until hot but not smoking. Add 2 tablespoons butter and melt. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds, or until golden. Add onion, celery, leek, and mushrooms and cook for about 2 minutes, or until mushrooms are cooked through. Add artichoke pieces and herbs and cook for 30 seconds, or until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Carefully add brandy (it will flame) and cook for 30 seconds, or until flame dies. Transfer mixture to a bowl and chill in the refrigerator until cool, about 30 to 45 minutes. Stir the bread and egg into chilled mushroom mixture. Place a medium skillet over medium-high heat and heat until hot but not smoking. Add 1 teaspoon butter and melt. Add shallot and cook for 30 seconds, or until golden. Add spinach and cook for about 3 minutes, or until spinach is tender. Carefully add wine (it will flame) and cook for 30 seconds, or until flame dies. Season with salt and pepper. Set the sauce aside and keep warm. Place the flour in a shallow bowl. Divide mushroom mixture into 4 balls and press mixture into cakes about 1 1/2 inches tall. Dust cakes in flour. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and heat until hot. Add the oil and heat until hot but not smoking. Add cakes and cook for about 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until golden and heated through. Drain on paper towels. Stir tasso ham and Creole seasoning into hollandaise. To serve, divide spinach among 4 dinner plates. Arrange 2 cakes over spinach and top each cake with a poached egg. Drizzle tasso hollandaise over eggs and garnish with parsley. Combine the water and vinegar in a large, shallow pot, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. One at a time, break each egg into an individual cup, being careful not to break the yolks. Gently slide the eggs into the simmering water and let cook 3 to 4 minutes. A poached egg should be soft and have an egg shape to it. If it is hard, it is overcooked. Carefully remove the eggs from the water with a skimmer. Gently pat dry with a towel, and serve. If you want to hold eggs for later service, plunge them into ice water to halt the cooking process. To reheat eggs, season water with salt and pepper over medium heat and bring almost to a simmer. Place the eggs in the water for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, until hot. Remove, gently pat dry with a towel, and serve. Yield: 4 servings Recipe courtesy Ti Martin and Jamie Shannon, From Commander&#39;s Kitchen, Broadway Books 2000. Place 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice and the hot water in a stainless-steel bowl or in the top half of a double boiler set over simmering water. Add the egg yolks, and whisk until the eggs thicken and triple in volume, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to very low, add the mustard, and slowly drizzle in the clarified butter, constantly whipping as you add the ingredients. If the sauce seems to thicken and looks ready to break, add the remaining lemon juice; it may not be needed. Keep whisking in the butter until all is incorporated. Add the hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Keep in a warm place until ready to use. Use as directed in recipes using hollandaise. Note: Clarified butter has no milk solids or water and therefore makes the sauce less likely to break. To get this amount of clarified butter, melt about 1 pound of butter in a pot. It will separate. Skim away the foam or solids. The golden liquid remaining is the clarified butter. Pour it off, and discard the water in the bottom of the pan.

Mix together with hands. In a large skillet over a low flame, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the onion, garlic, potato, and red pepper and saute. Add the meat, sofrito, and tomato paste. Break up the meat thoroughly with a wooden spoon or spatula. Cook until the mixture is fully cooked, about 30 minutes, then stir in the cilantro. Drain excess liquid and transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Add the pineapple and mix well with a wooden spoon. Frying Fiesta Empanadas: In a large skillet heat the canola oil over medium heat. If using small empanada shells put 2 heaping tablespoons (3 tablespoons for the larger shells) of the mixture into the center. Fold the dough over and seal it using a fork to crimp the edges. Repeat this process for all of the empanadas and set them aside without letting them touch each another. The oil will sizzle when you test it by dipping a corner of a completed empanada in it. Working in batches, fry the empanadas for approximately 3 minutes on each side. Don&#39;t crowd the pan. Make sure your empanadas are not touching each other while frying. When golden brown on both sides transfer them to paper towels to drain.

Add the garlic and onions and season with salt and the red pepper flakes. Cook until the onions become translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the sugar and the canned tomatoes. Use a wooden spoon to break up some of the whole tomatoes and cook 10 to 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring from time to time. Taste for seasoning. The tomatoes should be fairly broken down and the flavors coming together. Cook for another few minutes if the tomatoes still taste like they need a little more time to break down. Add 2 to 3 cups water to the sauce as it cooks if it looks like it&#39;s getting too thick. Set aside to cool.<br> For the eggplant: Arrange the eggplant rounds in a single layer on 2 baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt, on both sides of each slice, and allow it to sit for about an hour. (Salting it draws out the liquid and bitter flavor.) After an hour, rinse with cold water and dry them thoroughly with a kitchen towel.<br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Put the flour in a medium bowl. In another, whisk together the eggs and milk. In a third bowl, combine the breadcrumbs with the oregano and fresh thyme leaves. Dip each eggplant slice in the flour and shake off any excess. Then, dip in the egg mixture and finally in the breadcrumbs. Make sure to coat both sides of each slice. Arrange them in single layers back on the baking sheets.<br> In a large skillet, pour enough oil to accumulate about 1/2-inch in the bottom. Heat the oil until it begins to smoke lightly (alternatively, test with a thermometer and wait until it registers between 380 and 400 degrees F). Use a pair of kitchen tongs to add a single layer of the eggplant to the oil. Cook them until they are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the oil and transfer to a baking sheet fitted with a kitchen towel so the eggplant can drain as the others cook. Season lightly with salt. Take care to reheat the oil back up to temperature before adding another batch of slices to the pan.<br> To assemble: In a 17- by 11-inch baking dish, spoon about one-quarter of the tomato sauce on the bottom. Top with a layer of the fried eggplant. The eggplant slices can overlap slightly. Top with about one of the mozzarella slices. Sprinkle with about one-quarter of the Parmesan and provolone cheeses. Spoon more sauce and repeat two more times to make 3 layers. Top with the remaining mozzarella. Place the dish in the top part of the oven and cook until the cheese is melted and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes. I always nibble on a bit of that before sharing it with my friends!

In a large heavy bottomed pan with a tight fitting lid, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil. Generously season the pork with salt and pepper. Brown the meat well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side; remove the meat and set aside. Add the onion, pepper, garlic, cumin, thyme, and bay leaf; fry until softened, about 5 minutes, scraping up the browned bits in the pan. Stem and seed the soaked chiles reserving the soaking liquid; hand tear them into the pot. Return the meat to the pan along with any accumulated juices. Top the meat with the tomatoes. Pour in the chili soaking liquid, straining out any seeds, until it almost covers the meat; add water if you need more liquid. Squeeze the orange and lime juices into the pot and add the rinds. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the pork is very tender. Remove the meat to a platter and cover to keep warm. Strain the braising liquid and reserve. Shred the pork. Add some of the reserved braising liquid if the meat is dry. Take a tortilla and place about 2 tablespoons of the mixture on top. Garnish with the avocado, radishes, and Salsa Verde; fold the sides up and serve. Put the masa harina in a bowl and mix in the salt. Add about 1 cup warm water and mix with your hands; add more water as needed until the dough comes together. Knead for a few minutes to smooth the dough out. The dough should be firm and springy and should not stick to your hands. Test by forming a small disk, if it cracks around the edges you need more water. Place a piece of heavy plastic (like from a garbage bag) onto a tortilla press. Form a 1 1/2-inch ball of dough and place it in the center of the press. Top with another piece of plastic, close the press, and push the lever down to form the tortilla. (Alternately, the dough balls can be rolled between plastic sheets with a rolling pin.) Open the press and remove the top layer of plastic. Carefully peel the tortilla off the bottom plastic and place it onto a hot, ungreased cast iron skillet; cook for about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the tortilla and place it on a clean tea towel; keep it covered to keep it soft and pliable. Continue until you have used up all the dough. Yield: 20 (6-inch) tortillas Prep Time: 20 minutes Cook Time: 40 minutes Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the tomatillos, jalapeno, onion, garlic, and 1 tablespoon salt. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 5 to 10 minutes until the tomatillos are soft but have not burst. Add the cooked vegetables to a blender with the cilantro leaves and lime juice. Pour in 1/4 cup of the reserved cooking liquid and process to a coarse puree. Taste and adjust seasoning with more cilantro, lime juice, or salt.

Mix the garam masala, five spice powder, and salt in a bowl and liberally season the duck on both sides. Heat a saute pan on high heat. Char the grapes until they almost split open, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Zinfandel and reduce the juices into a syrup on medium heat, about 15 minutes. Add the demi-glace. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. In a large saute pan over medium high heat, cook the duck, fat side down, with no oil, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn the breast over and brown again, about 5 minutes. The duck should be served rare to medium rare, but if you desire more cooking, bake it in a 350 degree F oven until desired doneness, for medium about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing on the bias. Spoon sauce over the duck prior to service. For the Spaetzle: In an electric mixer, add the flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg. On slow speed, drop 1 egg at a time, until the mixture is smooth, then add the yolks. Add the milk and the melted butter. Let the mixture relax for at least a half an hour. Over boiling water, squeeze the batter through a spaetzle press, once it floats, spoon it out into a cold water bath to stop the cooking process.

Salt it generously.<br> Core the cabbage. Gently peel away the leaves to expose the heart (by heart, I mean the ball of more yellowish leaves at the center which are too tightly packed to bother prying apart). Cut out that core of inner-most leaves and shred to add to the stuffing. Cut the thick ribs out of the remaining leaves (they will look like you&#39;ve stolen a sliver from a pie). Set aside.<br> Blanch the cabbage leaves for 5 to 7 minutes. Drain, and refresh under ice-cold water. Drain and pat dry with a towel.<br> Break the bread into crumbs in a bowl, pour over the milk and set aside to soften. Heat the butter and olive oil in a skillet and gently fry the onion and shallot until transparent, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped cabbage, mushrooms, garlic and thyme. Cook another 5 minutes. Add the bread and cook until the milk has evaporated. Stir through the quatre-epices and season generously with salt and pepper. Add this mixture to the sausage meat in a large bowl and mix thoroughly with a fork. Make a small ball and fry it in the frying pan. Taste it to check the seasonings. Adjust as needed.<br> Lay a tea towel on the counter with a piece of cheesecloth or muslin large enough to wrap the cabbage in. You&#39;re going to reconstruct the cabbage, but with layers of stuffing between the leaves. So, first lay down the large outer leaves, in a circle, slightly overlapping with the prettiest side out. Spread over a layer of stuffing. Lay over another layer of leaves and repeat the action. Continue until you have run out of leaves. Pull up the edges of the cheesecloth, like a bag, and twist, as if making the head of a puppet, to shape the cabbage into a round loaf shape. Tie a string around the beard of cheesecloth where it meets the cabbage ball, to secure the package. The cabbage can be prepared to this stage in advance, refrigerated and then cooked before serving. To cook: Steam the cabbage over water or good chicken stock (about 2 cups/500 ml of it) for 45 minutes. The flavor from the stuffed cabbage will drip into the water or stock and give it the most amazing flavor. When the cabbage is done, boil down the cooking juices and serve a spoonful around each wedge of cabbage in a soup bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 30414,&quot;Fried Chili Chicken 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Shortening or vegetable oil for frying 23 limes 2 chickens, 2 1/23 pounds each 2 cups buttermilk 1 1/2 cups flour 2 tablespoons paprika 1 tablespoon cumin 1 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon sea salt Instructions: Cut the chicken into serving pieces. The breast pieces should be cut in half. Place the chicken in a bowl and cover with the buttermilk overnight. In a medium-size bowl, combine the flour, paprika, cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Heat enough oil to a depth of about 3/4-inch in a large heavy skillet. When the oil is medium hot dip the chicken pieces in the flour mixture and fry, without crowding the chicken. If necessary, use 2 skillets or fry in batches. Reduce the heat to medium and fry until the coating becomes a deep golden brown, turning the chicken as needed. The white meat should be done in 20 to 25 minutes, dark meat in about 35 minutes. Juices should run clear when the chicken is pricked with a fork. Squeeze lime juice over the chicken 10 minutes before it is done. Drain chicken on paper towels. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 30415,&quot;Spicy Lemongrass Tofu 2 lemongrass stalks, outer layers peeled, bottom white part thinly sliced and finely chopped (about 1/4 cup) 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 teaspoons chopped Thai bird chiles or another fresh cl 1/2 teaspoon dried cl flakes 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 2 teaspoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 12 ounces tofu, drained, patted dry and cut into 3/4-inch cubes 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 yellow onion, cut into 1/8-inch slices 2 shallots, thinly sliced 1 teaspoon minced garlic 4 tablespoons chopped Roasted Peanuts, recipe follows 10 pepper leaves, shredded, or 2/3 cup loosely packed Asian basil leaves 1 cup raw, shelled peanuts, skin removed Instructions: Combine the lemongrass, soy sauce, chiles, cl flakes, turmeric, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Add the tofu cubes and turn to coat them evenly. Marinate for 30 minutes. Heat half of the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat. Add the onion, shallot and garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the onions are soft, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and keep warm. Wipe the pan clean and heat the remaining oil over moderate heat. Add the tofu mixture and, using chopsticks or wooden spoons, turn so it cooks evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onion mixture and cook, uncovered, for another 2 to 3 minutes. Add half the peanuts and all the pepper leaves. Remove from the heat and transfer to a serving plate. Garnish with the remaining peanuts and serve immediately with steamed rice. Place the peanuts on a cookie tray and bake in a preheated 325 degree F oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Halfway into the baking, gently shake the tray so the peanuts roast evenly. (You can also roast the peanuts in a dry pan over low heat). Remove and set aside. Use the peanuts whole or coarsely chop them with a mortar and pestle, a food processor or a knife.

Mix for a few minutes at low speed, or stirring with a wooden spoon. Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes Place the dough into a greased bowl and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until doubled in size. The dough is ready if you touch it and the indention remains. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently roll out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with a floured donut cutter. Let the donuts sit out to rise again until doubled in size. Cover loosely with a cloth. Heat the shortening in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 370 degrees F.

The next day, discard the milk, then trim any veins or discoloration from the sweetbreads. Rinse them well and set aside. Put the sweetbreads in a pot, cover with water, and add the salt. Bring the water up to a low simmer, then cook for about 5 minutes. Remove the sweetbreads and plunge them into an ice bath. Clean off any tough membranes and fat. Line two quarter-sheet pans with clean kitchen towels in a single layer. Fold the towels over the sweetbreads to cover, then place another quarter-sheet pan on top, and weigh down with a heavy pot. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 1 to 2 hours. For the celery root salad: Whisk the mayonnaise, parsley, capers, Dijon, vinegar and Espelette pepper together in a bowl. Fold in the celery root, celery seeds and apple. Set aside. Prepare the seasoned flour by whisking together the instant flour, salt and white pepper. Cut the sweetbreads into pieces about 3 inches across. Toss the sweetbreads in the seasoned flour. Set aside. Melt the clarified butter in a 12-inch, heavy-bottomed cast-iron skillet. Add the floured sweetbreads, garlic cloves, bay leaves and shallot.

While pulsing, add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is just wet enough to hold together when pinched between your fingers. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap, form into a disk and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll the dough out into a circle about 1/8-inch thick, and then fit into a 9-inch pie dish. Dock the crust all over using a fork. Cover the crust with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Line the crust with foil and fill with dried beans or baking marbles. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, and then remove the foil and beans and bake until the crust just begins to brown, another 15 minutes. For the filling: While the crust is baking, combine the farmer cheese, sugar and cardamom in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and whip together until well incorporated. Add 1 egg at a time on medium speed, waiting until fully incorporated and smooth before each new addition. Stir in the heavy cream. Fill the crust with the cheese filling and bake until the top is browned and the filling is just slightly jiggly, 45 minutes. Let cool, and then eat the pie.

For the egg wash: In a bowl combine the buttermilk and eggs, and whisk to combine. For the sauce: In a bowl combine the mayo, capers and lemon juice, and mix. Season with salt and pepper, being very careful with the salt as the capers are already salty. For the sandwich: Preheat enough oil to come 2 to 3 inches up the side of a medium saucepot over medium-high heat, until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Dredge the fish in the egg wash then in the seasoned flour. Dip in the egg wash again and the flour again. Carefully float the fish in the hot oil and cook until golden brown. Remove from the oil and rest the fish on paper towels to drain excess oil. Set a skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat, and heat the grapeseed oil (you may have to do this in batches so portion out the oil for how many batches it will take to toast all of the buns). Toast the buns until golden brown. Spread 1 tablespoon of the caper sauce on both sides of the toasted buns and 1 tablespoon of the ketchup on the top half of each bun. Season the tomato slices with salt and pepper and arrange 2 slices on the bottom halves of each bun. Place some shredded lettuce on top of the tomatoes. Place 3 to 4 onion rings on top of the lettuce. Cut the fish in half and stack the 2 pieces of fish on top of each bun and top with the top half of the bun.

Set aside. Combine 1 1/2 cups of the pecans with the bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of the parsley on a large plate. Open up and cut the trout, diagonally, into two fillets. Season both the flesh and skin sides with salt and pepper to taste, and then, working with one at a time, press the flesh side of the trout into the pecan mixture to make a thin coating. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Using a tablespoon of the peanut oil, generously grease a baking sheet. Set aside. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan over high heat. When very hot but not smoking, add 6 trout fillets and sear to set the crust. Turn and sear the other side. Using a fish spatula or a large, wide spatula, transfer the trout to the prepared baking sheet. Add additional oil to the pan and continue to sear the remaining trout. When seared, transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the trout for about 7 minutes or until cooked through. While the trout is baking, melt the butter in a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Watching carefully and lowering the heat if necessary, allow the butter to foam and turn golden brown. Immediately add the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. While the butter is still foaming, add the remaining pecans and parsley. Do not allow the butter to burn or it will be unusable. Place 2 fillets on each of 6 dinner plates and pour the Parsley Brown Butter over the top. Sprinkle with reserved lemon zest and serve.

Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. For the brisket pot stickers: In a large pot place the brisket piece and peanut oil and cook on low heat for approximately 7 hours until brisket begins to fall apart. Remove cooked brisket from the oil and allow to slightly cool. While brisket is cooling, saute the diced onion with the butter until translucent. Place the onions in a large bowl. Once the brisket has cooled, chop into a small dice and add to the onions. Add the chiles, garlic and cilantro and season the mixture with salt and pepper, to taste. Fill each dumpling wrapper with a small amount of the brisket mixture. Seal the edges with the beaten egg. Bring a medium size pot of water to boil. Place the pot stickers in the boiling water and cook for approximately 2 minutes. Once the pot stickers are cooked, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain before adding them carefully to the hot saute pan. At the same time, in a medium size saute pan, heat a little olive oil until slightly smoking. Working in batches, sear both sides of the pot stickers until golden brown. Remove from the pan and place on more paper towels to soak up excess oil. Repeat with remaining pot stickers. Serve immediately with a side of the citrus dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 30441,&quot;Grilled Tequila Lime Pineapple Chunks 1 large ripe pineapple 1/4 cup Tequila 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 2 tablespoons brown sugar Instructions: Soak 1 dozen small bamboo skewers in cold water. Cut off top and bottom poles of pineapple. Stand it upright on the cutting board and cut off rind, using a sharp knife and smooth downward motions. Remove any remaining eyes with the tip of a paring knife. Cut in quarters lengthwise and cut out and discard woody core. Cut flesh into 1 or 1 1/2-inch chunks.

Add the meat and cook, stirring, for a minute; then add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it softens and begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the peas and 4 cups water and bring to a boil; turn the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the peas are completely tender--10 minutes for cooked or canned black-eyed peas, about 30 minutes for frozen. Stir in the watercress and cook, stirring occasionally, for just a couple of minutes, or until it wilts. Add more water, if necessary. Taste and adjust the seasoning, stir in the remaining tablespoon oil, and serve. With Minimal effort: The meat can be prosciutto or ham; you can use bacon or pancetta instead, but cook them a little longer. Instead of onion, you can use garlic, leek, or shallots. Black-eyed peas are the traditional choice, but any legume will work perfectly well. For the watercress, substitute arugula or spinach, or any winter green, like kale, mustard, collards, and turnips, all of which will take a little longer to cook--add them to the soup along with the peas. Liquid condiments, like Tabasco or another hot sauce or vinegar, are good here. Increase the amount of meat to 1/2 pound or so (this is especially good with ham), double the amount of greens, and cook the soup until it&#39;s thick; you can call it a stew. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 30443,&quot;Pear and Polenta 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cups yellow cornmeal<br> 1 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons butter<br> 3 cups vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup gorgonzola 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 ripe Bartlett pear, cut in half and core removed 1 teaspoon chiffonade fresh basil<br> 1 teaspoon toasted pine nuts<br> 1 teaspoon roughly chopped sun-dried tomatoes Instructions: For the parmesan polenta: Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a heavy saucepan.

Bring to a simmer. While soup is heating, heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Cut the tortillas into thin strips and fry them in batches until they are golden brown. Drain on paper towels or a paper bag and season with salt. When the soup is hot, taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve it in bowls topped with the tortilla strips, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges. In a large pot, put the chicken, 1 whole onion, and large pinch of salt and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 1 hour. While the chicken is cooking, make the salsa by mixing together the diced red onion, pineapple chunks, jalapeno, cilantro, chili powder, lime juice, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove the chicken and allow it to cool. Strain the cooking liquid and reserve it and the onion. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat, discarding the bones and skin. Save 1 cup of meat. Wrap the tortilla in a damp towel and microwave for 45 second or until warm and pliable. Heat the beans in a small pot over low heat. Lay out one tortilla onto a flat surface. Place 1/4 of the chicken, into the middle of the burrito. Top with 1/4 cup of cheese, 1/4 of the beans and 2 tablespoons of the salsa. Fold the bottom of the tortilla up over the filling then fold the sides in and roll up from the bottom. Repeat with remaining ingredients and garnish with remaining salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 30456,&quot;Cheeseburger Pasta 1 pound ground beef 1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell&#39;s?

Line a baking pan with parchment paper. Stir the mascarpone, Parmesan and egg yolk together in a bowl with a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Unroll the pie crusts and cut out 8 rounds with a 4 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Lay out the rounds on a work surface and drop a level tablespoon of the cheese mixture onto the center of each, spreading just enough to leave a 1/4-inch border. Arrange the tomatoes on top of the cheese in the center of the tarts (about 6 halves per tart), leaving about a 1/4-inch cheese border. Fold and crimp the edges of the crust just over the cheese but leaving the tomatoes uncovered. Top the tomatoes with the shallot and thyme, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Transfer the tarts to the prepared baking pan and bake until the crust is golden brown and the tomatoes are wilted and lightly browned in spots, 20 to 25 minutes.

I dare say it was because the novelty of using so many garlic cloves had not worn off; it seemed somehow dangerously excessive. Even so, I don&#39;t think anyone would think it quite unremarkable now to put 40 cloves of garlic in a casserole. Certainly, if you peeled and chopped - let alone minced - the garlic, it would be inedible, but garlic cloves cooked encased in their skins grow sweet and caramelly as they cook, like savory bonbons in their sticky wrappers, rather than breathing out acrid heat. This is a cozy supper, not a caustic one. This dish entered my canon under someone else&#39;s auspices. A few years ago, for the fortieth birthday of a then-colleague and friend of mine, Nick Thorogood, his partner asked everyone to contribute something written expressly for purpose to be compiled in a fat tribute of a book. Since most of Nick&#39;s and my conversation dwells, with almost fetid passion, on food, it seemed only proper to write a recipe for him. And given that it was his fortieth birthday, this seemed the right recipe. It is not quite the classic version (not that there is only one: food is as variable as the people who cook it) but it sticks to the basic principles. Maybe because the white meat on chicken tends towards the utterly tasteless these days, I prefer to use not a whole chicken, but thigh portions only. Naturally, this wouldn&#39;t make sense if you were raising your own chickens, then slaughtering them for the pot, as was the custom when this recipe came into being (and very good it would have been, too, for adding oomph to an old bird) but if you&#39;re following the contemporary shopping model, it works very well. For some reason, I veer towards recipes that can easily be cooked in one of my wide and shallow cast-iron Dutch ovens and this fits the bill perfectly. By all means, add some steamed or boiled potatoes alongside if you wish, but I&#39;d prefer, by far, a baguette or two to be torn up and dunked into the flavorsome juices; though don&#39;t rule out the option of sourdough toast, which is the perfect vehicle for spreading the sweet-cooked garlic onto. Otherwise, some green beans or baby peas or a plain green salad is all you need for a sure-fire salivation-inducing supper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil on the stovetop in a wide, shallow ovenproof and flameproof Dutch oven (that will ultimately fit all the chicken in one layer, and that has a lid), and sear the chicken over a high heat, skin-side down. This may take 2 batches, so transfer the browned pieces to a bowl as you go. Once the chicken pieces are seared, transfer them all to the bowl. Finely slice the scallions, put them into the Dutch oven and quickly stir-fry them with the leaves torn from a few sprigs of thyme. Put 20 of the unpeeled cloves of garlic (papery excess removed) into the pan, top with the chicken pieces skin-side up, then cover with the remaining 20 cloves of garlic. Add the vermouth (or white wine) to any oily, chickeny juices left in the bowl. Swish it around and pour this into the pan too. Sprinkle with the salt, grind over the pepper, and add a few more sprigs of thyme. Put on the lid and cook in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Make Ahead Note: Chicken can be browned and casserole assembled 1 day ahead. Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator. Season with salt and pepper and warm the pan gently on the stovetop for 5 minutes before baking as directed in recipe. Making Leftovers Right: If I do have any chicken left over - and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had more than 1 thigh portion - I take out the bone then and there and put the chicken in the refrigerator. Later (within a day or two), I make a garlicky soup, by removing the chicken, adding some chicken broth or water to the cold, jelled juices, placing it over a high heat and, when that&#39;s hot, shredding the chicken into it and heating it through thoroughly, till everything is piping hot. You can obviously add rice or pasta. Otherwise, mash any leftover garlic into the concentrated liquid (which will be solid when cold), chop up some leftover chicken, and put it all into a saucepan with some cream. Reheat gently until everything is piping hot, and use as a pasta sauce or serve with rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 30467,&quot;Chopped Liver 2 medium onions, diced 1/2 cup chicken fat 1 pound chicken livers, trimmed of membrane Salt and pepper Grated Black Radish Lettuce leaves Matza Crackers Instructions: Saute onions in 1 tablespoon chicken fat, until soft.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Mix together the paprika, coriander, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Season the steaks liberally with salt and pepper on both sides. Rub the spice rub on one side of the steaks and let sit 5 minutes. Heat a few tablespoons of canola oil in a medium cast-iron pan over high heat until smoking. Add the steaks spice rub-side down and cook, without touching, until a crust forms, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until a crust forms on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Add the butter and rosemary to the pan. Transfer to the oven and cook, basting occasionally with the butter, until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 130 degrees F (for medium-rare), about 10 minutes. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Drizzle with some of the brown butter. For the crispy potatoes: Put the potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water by 2 inches and add 2 tablespoons of salt. Bring to a boil and cook until a skewer inserted into the center meets with no resistance, about 25 minutes. Drain well and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to dry further. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place the potatoes on a large plate or baking sheet and gently smash them a bit; season well with salt and pepper. Line another large plate or baking sheet with paper towels. Heat 3 inches of canola oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat until it registers 365 degrees F. Fry the potatoes in batches in an even layer in the pan until golden brown on all sides and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon to the plate lined with paper towels and immediately season with the cheese and more salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Transfer to a platter and garnish with the parsley, oregano and pickled shallots or onions. For the broccoli rabe with garlic, oil and red cl: Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 1 tablespoon of salt. Prepare an ice bath. Add the broccoli rabe to the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Remove with tongs and place directly into the ice bath. Let sit for 3 minutes, then drain well on paper towels. Reserve a cup of the cooking water. Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the cl flakes and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the broccoli rabe, season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing constantly in the oil, until just warmed through and crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Add a bit of the cooking water if needed. Transfer to a platter and drizzle with more oil, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Barbera]&quot; 30469,&quot;Potato-Crusted Flounder Stuffed with Fire-Roasted Red Peppers and Chorizo Topped with Roasted Tomato Sauce 3 large vine-ripened tomatoes 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon butter Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 pound chorizo, diced small 1 large yellow onion, diced small 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, stemmed and chopped 1 bay leaf 3 ripe red bell peppers, charred over an open flame, chilled, peeled and diced 2 tablespoons sherry 1 1/2 to 2 cups bread crumbs Salt and pepper 2 large russet potatoes Salt and pepper 3 tablespoons cornstarch 2 fresh flounder fillets per person, about 4 to 5 ounces per person Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons butter Serving suggestion: sauteed spinach Instructions: To make the tomato sauce: Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Cut the tomatoes into wedges and put in a small bowl. Add the oil and balsamic vinegar, and then season with the salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes on a rack, and then place the rack on a sheet pan. Roast for 30 to 45 minutes until the edges brown well and the tomatoes become very soft. Put the tomatoes and all juices in a sieve and drain over a small pot. This should remove the skin and seeds and leave you with a thin tomato sauce. Bring the sauce to a simmer and reduce until the sauce is a medium thickness, about 5 minutes. Stir in the butter. Add the salt and pepper, to taste, and keep warm. To make the stuffing: In a large saute pan, add the olive oil, then chorizo, and let it cook for about 2 minutes. Add the onion and garlic, and saute on medium heat until the onions are soft, about 2 or 3 minutes. Add the oregano and bay leaf and cook another 2 minutes, until you can smell the herbs cooking. Add the diced bell peppers and sherry and let simmer 1 minute. Turn off heat. Fold in the bread crumbs until all liquid has been absorbed. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and set aside. To make the potato crust: Using an Asian turning mandoline or a vegetable peeler, peel long thin strings of potato. Put the potato strings in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper and add the cornstarch. Mix with a spoon until well blended and set aside. To stuff and crust the fish: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lay out the fillets flat on a work surface and season with salt and pepper. Place a golf-ball sized piece of stuffing in the center of 1 fillet. Lay another fillet over the stuffing and press softly to distribute the stuffing. Take a small handful of the stringed potato mixture and lay it over the top fillet, leaving only 1/4-inch uncovered around the edges. Press down lightly. Repeat process with remaining fillets. Heat a large nonstick, oven-proof saute pan and melt the butter. Place the flounder in the pan, potato-side down, and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip over stuffed flounder and place pan in oven for 9 to 12 minutes, or until fish is cooked through. Remove the fish from the oven. Ladle 2 ounces of tomato sauce onto the plate. Lay the stuffed flounder over the sauce and serve with a vegetable, such as sauteed spinach. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 30470,&quot;Beef Stew with Carrots and Fresh Herbs 2 tablespoons canola oil 3 pounds boneless beef stew meat, preferably chuck, cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch cubes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 medium yellow onions, cut into thin slices<br> 1 bottle dry red wine<br> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br> 4 cups enriched beef stock<br> 1/4 cup smooth Dijon mustard<br> 12 small parsnips, peeled<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided<br> 1 tablespoon dark-brown sugar<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 12 small carrots, peeled<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 cup shelled peas<br> Parsley for garnish Chives for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Cook the meat: Heat a Dutch oven over high heat and add the canola oil. Season the pieces of beef on all sides with salt and pepper. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, use a pair of metal tongs to arrange the beef in a single layer in the hot oil, making sure not to crowd the pan (you might need to cook the beef in batches). Brown the meat on all sides. When brown, add onions and steam over the beef, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine and vinegar and cook until all of the liquid evaporates, 10 to 15 minutes. Add stock and mustard and continue to simmer about 8 to 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, add parsnips and enough water just to cover. Add 2 tablespoons butter, brown sugar, and bay leaves and simmer until parsnips are slightly tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain, discard bay leaves, and set parsnips aside. In the same pan, add carrots and enough water just to cover. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the olive oil. Simmer until slightly tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Cook and finish the stew: Add the parsnips and carrots to the beef. Cover and place in the center of the oven. Cook until the meat is tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove the stew from the oven and use a large spoon to skim any excess fat or impurities that form on the surface. Taste for seasoning. Allow it to \rest\ for 15 minutes before serving. Stir in the peas, parsley and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 30471,&quot;Homemade Corn and Coriander Tortillas 2 cups instant masa<br> 2 teaspoons ground coriander<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 5 tablespoons cold duck fat<br> 2/3 cup warm water<br> Vegetable oil, for frying, optional<br> Lime-Chili Salt, for sprinkling, optional, recipe follows 1 cup flaky sea salt, such as Maldon 1/4 cup lime zest (from about 6 large limes) 2 tablespoons chili powder Instructions: Combine the masa, coriander and salt in a medium bowl. Using your hands, cut the duck fat into the masa mixture until it looks like small peas are in the masa and it holds together when you squeeze it. Still mixing with your hands, slowly fold in the water. The dough should be moist but not sticky and hold together as a ball. Cover with a damp paper towel and let rest 10 minutes. Roll 2 tablespoons of the dough into a ball (the ball should be about the size of a golf ball). Press the ball in a tortilla press lined with wax paper. Hold the pressed tortillas between wax paper and keep any that are exposed to the air covered with damp paper towels. Heat a cast-iron pan over medium heat. Cook the tortillas in the dry pan until lightly browned and speckled on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Allow to cool completely. Eat immediately, if using as fresh tortillas. To make tortilla chips: Fill a Dutch oven with about 4 inches of vegetable oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches a temperature of 360 degrees F. Cut the tortillas into quarters and, working in batches, fry until golden brown, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with Lime-Chili Salt if using. Combine the salt, lime zest and chili powder in a small bowl and use immediately. Great for garnishing cocktails, seasoning tortillas or as a finishing salt for a dish. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 30472,&quot;Lamb Kabob with Mint Pesto 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup lemon juice 1/4 cup honey 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 small onion, minced 1/4 cup minced mint leaves 1/4 cup minced parsley leaves 1 teaspoon minced rosemary leaves 1 teaspoon minced oregano leaves 2 pounds boneless lamb leg or shoulder, cleaned and cut into 1 1/2 -inch cubes, makes about 32 pieces 16 pear or cherry tomatoes 16 pearl onions, peeled 1 large green pepper, cored, seeded, cut into 1-inch squares (at least 16 pieces) 16 small button mushrooms Salt Freshly ground black pepper Mint Pesto, recipe follows 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves 1 tablespoon honey Pinch kosher salt 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar Freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup olive oil Instructions: In a non-reactive bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, honey, garlic, onion, mint, parsley, rosemary, and oregano.

Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles and add to the bowl with the onions. Using the cooking liquid as needed (reserving the rest of the cooking liquid), mash into a paste with the onions and garlic. Using the same skillet heat the reserved tablespoon of grapeseed oil over medium-high heat and fry the paste for a few minutes. Remove from heat and set aside until needed. Prepare the hominy as directed on the package, utilizing the remaining cl cooking liquid as part of the cooking liquid for the hominy. (Usually you will need 4 times as much water as hominy). Mix the cl paste well with the cooked hominy. Stir into the pot of tripe, season with chili powder and return to a simmer and allow to thicken. Ladle into bowls and place small amount of sliced radishes in the center. Squeeze fresh lime juice over. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 30497,&quot;Furikake Seaweed Snacks 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds, toasted and cooled (see Cook\u2019s Note) 2 tablespoons black sesame seeds, toasted and cooled (see Cook\u2019s Note)<br> 3 tablespoons lightly packed bonito flakes<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon wasabi powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon togarashi<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 8 (8-inch) toasted nori sheets (reserve the desiccant packet from the nori packaging)<br> 2 tablespoons water<br> 1/4 to 1/2 cup toasted sesame oil, for spritzing<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and place racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle positions. Have two half sheet pans ready. Combine half of the white and black sesame seeds with the bonito flakes, sugar, wasabi powder, togarashi, and salt in a spice grinder. Pulse until coarsely ground, about three pulses. Transfer the seasoning mix to a small bowl and mix in the remaining white and black sesame seeds. Place a sheet of nori on a cutting board and, using a pastry brush, lightly moisten with the water. Immediately sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the seasoning mix evenly over the nori. It may start to curl up on the edges; that\u2019s okay. Using a large chef\u2019s knife, slice each sheet into 6 even rectangles and transfer to the half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining nori sheets, dividing them evenly between the two pans. Leave at room temperature for 30 minutes to dry. (You will have extra seasoning; save for another use, like\u2026popcorn.) Add sesame oil to a spritzer and evenly spritz the seasoned side of the nori sheets (You will have extra oil). Transfer to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Rotate the pans and continue to bake until the snacks are crisp but not yet brown, about 3 more minutes. Transfer the nori sheets to a wire rack to cool. To store, transfer to a gallon-size zip-top bag and add the desiccant packet from the nori packaging to help maintain crispness. The seaweed snacks will keep for at least 1 week at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 30498,&quot;Grilled Sausage and Pepper Heroes 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 2 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 red bell pepper, top and bottom removed, cut into 4 planks<br> 1 yellow bell pepper, top and bottom removed, cut into 4 planks<br> 1 large sweet onion, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rings<br> One 1 1/2-pound Italian pork sausage ring, preferably cheese and parsley flavor<br> Four 6-to-8-inch hoagie rolls, split<br> 8 slices provolone (about 6 ounces) Instructions: Combine the olive oil, vinegar, oregano, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a small jar or other lidded container.

(Of course, this does not make them edible!) You may need more than one coating. Place the coated branches on a sheet of parchment paper until the chocolate has fully set. For the base of this presentation, use a small plastic container as a mold, the size of which depends upon the size of the branches you&#39;ve coated in chocolate. Center the branches inside the container and add bittersweet chocolate, filling it to the top. Allow to harden. When the chocolate has set, remove the plastic container. Use bittersweet chocolate to \glue\ whatever you&#39;ve chosen to hang from the tree. There is no set pattern, just let your eye guide you as you randomly decorate the branches. Use as many or as few as you like, depending on the size of your tree. It will look more interesting if color is added (i.e. fresh fruits, orange peels, white chocolate leaves, etc). Use the chocolate tree as a centerpiece for the dining room table during dinner. When it is time for dessert, your guests can simply pick the petit fours and candies from the tree. Assorted items to hang from the \tree, for example: cookies, petit fours, fresh fruits such as cherries or raspberries, orange peels, white chocolate leaves, etc. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Reds, Pinots, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 30517,&quot;Buttermilk Brined Chicken Thighs\u202f 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 5 thighs) 2 cups buttermilk 2 sprigs fresh rosemary plus 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves, plus additional chopped rosemary for garnish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds baby Yukon, baby purple or fingerling potatoes, quartered 6 tablespoons olive oil 2 heads broccoli, cut into florets Zest and juice of 1 lemon Instructions: Add the chicken, buttermilk, 2 sprigs of rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to a large resealable plastic bag.

Season with additional salt if desired. Transfer the herb filling to a second large resealable plastic bag and refrigerate while you arrange the egg whites. Lay a large wooden cutting board (at least 22 inches by 16 inches) in front of you with one of the shorter sides facing toward you. Place 1 egg white (pointed-side up) on the bottom of the board. Arrange 2 egg whites (pointed-side down) directly above the first with the points nestling the point of the first egg, so that there is very little space between the eggs. Continue arranging the eggs in this manner to form 8 rows, working upward and alternating eggs pointed up and pointed down to form the carrot, adding 1 egg to each row (36 egg white halves total).<br> Arrange the remaining 12 egg white halves in 3 separate lines at the top of the carrot (4 egg white halves per line). The lines should be slightly angled, so they resemble carrot tops.<br> Cut a 1/2-inch-wide opening in one corner of the bag with the pimento cheese filling. Fill the 36 egg white halves that make up the carrot with a dollop of the filling, then squeeze any remaining filling on top of the egg whites.

Butter a 6-cup loaf pan and line it with parchment or waxed paper. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter. Add 1 cup of the sugar and mix. With the mixer running at low speed, add the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla. Working in alternating batches, and mixing after each addition, add the dry ingredients and 1/4 cup of the lemon juice to the butter mixture. Mix until just smooth. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until raised in the center and a tester inserted into the center comes out dry and almost clean (a few crumbs are OK), 65 to 75 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and the remaining 1/3 cup lemon juice until the sugar is dissolved. When the cake is done, let cool in the pan 15 minutes (it will still be warm). Run a knife around the sides of the pan. Set a wire rack on a sheet pan with sides (to catch the glaze) and turn the cake out onto the rack. Peel off the waxed paper. Using a turkey baster or pastry brush, spread glaze all over the top and sides of the cake and let soak in. Repeat until the entire glaze is used up, including any glaze that has dripped through onto the sheet pan. Let cool at room temperature or, wrapped in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator (Well wrapped, the cake will last up to a week). Serve at room temperature, in thin slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30528,&quot;Horseradish Crusted Salmon 1 pound unsalted butter 1 fresh horseradish, peeled and grated 2 cups dried plain bread crumbs 1 (3 pound) salmon fillet Salt and freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 shallots, minced 4 cucumbers, peeled, seeded and sliced 2 small bunches fresh dill, trimmed and snipped 1 bunch fresh chives, snipped 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 shallots, minced 1 cup dry white vermouth 1 cup chicken stock Snipped fresh dill Snipped fresh chives Instructions: To make the crust.

Add the egg yolk and vanilla and beat until smooth. Sift in the flour and cocoa powder and beat on low speed until just combined. Scrape the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form it into a disk. Wrap and chill until firm, about 1 hour, or up to 3 days. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the tart dough to an 18 by 12-inch rectangle, 3/16-inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out 24 rounds of dough and press them into mini-muffin tins or 2-inch tart pans, trimming away any excess dough; prick the dough all over with a fork. Chill the tart shells for 20 minutes. Line the tart shells with foil and fill with dried beans, rice or pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until the pastry looks dry and set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. (The tart shells can be made 8 hours ahead.) To prepare the filling, place 1/2 cup water in large saucepan. Add the sugar and corn syrup and cook the mixture over medium-high heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until you have a dark caramel, about 10 minutes. Carefully whisk in the butter, cream, and creme fraiche (the mixture will hiss and bubble up, so stand back), whisking until smooth. (The caramel can be made up to 5 days ahead and refrigerated.) Divide the caramel among the tart shells while still warm (or reheat the caramel in the microwave or over low heat until it is pourable) and let sit until the caramel is set, at least 45 minutes. To make the ganache glaze, in a saucepan, bring the cream to a boil. Place the chocolate in a bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Pour some of the glaze over each of the tarts while still warm. Let the glaze set at room temperature for at least 2 hours before serving. Sprinkle with salt, if desired, just before serving. Variation: For a large tart, line a 10-inch tart pan with the pastry dough, then prick, weight, and bake as directed, adding 5 to 10 minutes to the baking time. When the tart shell is cool, spoon the warm caramel to set before pouring the warm ganache onto the tart. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 30530,&quot;Sauteed Calf&#39;s Liver with Fig-Chinese Vinegar Syrup 4 each calf&#39;s liver 3 tablespoons clarified butter 3 minced shallots 4 black mission figs, cut into1/4 inch disks 1/2 cup Chinese vinegar 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar Salt and coarse ground green peppercorn to taste Instructions: Pre-heat hot a large, thick skillet.

Cover with water and swish around with your hands until the water is cloudy. Pour off the water, then repeat this process until the water runs clear, 3 or 4 times. Cover with water and let soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Set an electric pressure cooker to saut on high. Add 2 tablespoons ghee, the bay leaves, pepper, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and the hing. Allow to cook until the leaves are sizzling, about 1 minute. Drain the rice and lentils in a strainer. Carefully add to the pressure cooker and stir well. Continue to cook, stirring often, for about 2 minutes, until the water has evaporated off the grains and they sizzle. Add the grated ginger, turmeric and 5 1/2 cups water to the pressure cooker. Stir well and add 2 teaspoons salt. Put the lid on the cooker and set the steam valve to the sealing position. Cook for 12 minutes on high pressure. Let the cooker naturally release the pressure for 20 minutes. Manually release any remaining pressure, then open up the cooker and stir, discarding the bay leaves. The porridge should be the consistency of a soft polenta or risotto; feel free to add more water until it\u2019s just right. Start making the toppings while the pressure is releasing. Make birista, or fried onions: Set a small skillet over medium heat and add the sliced onion. Pour in just enough canola oil to cover. Gently fry the onion until uniformly golden brown, about 10 minutes, stirring every now and then. Using a slotted spoon, remove the onion to a paper towel\u2013lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Add the cashews and coconut to the oil and fry until golden brown. Remove the cashews and coconut to the plate and sprinkle with salt. Pour off all but 1 to 2 tablespoons of the oil. (But don\u2019t discard it! The oil is great to drizzle over vegetables before you roast or saut them; it\u2019s also a great start to a soup, pasta sauce or curry.) Add the remaining 2 tablespoons ghee to the remaining oil in the skillet. Once shimmering, add the dried chiles, garlic and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds. Cook, shaking the pan and stirring, until the garlic is golden brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pour the porridge into a serving bowl, then pour the contents of the skillet on top and gently stir. Top with a big dollop of yogurt, the fried onion, cashews and coconut, and some cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Tempranillo]&quot; 30533,&quot;\Brat n Brau\ Sliders 4 cups beer, plus beer for serving 1 large onion, sliced 6 (3-ounce) brat patties 2 cups sauerkraut 1 tablespoon butter 1/4 cup water 6 mini rye rolls 3 ounces Swiss cheese, cut into triangles 3 ounces German mustard Beer, for serving Instructions: In a medium saucepan, bring the beer to simmer over medium-high heat.

Add the butter and pulse until pea-size pieces remain. Sprinkle in 2 tablespoons ice water and pulse until the dough begins to come together. Pinch the dough with your fingers; if it doesn&#39;t hold together, add up to 2 more tablespoons ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each addition. Put the dough on a large piece of plastic wrap and pat into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or preferably overnight. (The dough can also be frozen for up to 2 months.)<br> Lightly flour a work surface. Roll out the chilled dough into a 12-inch round and transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edges with your fingers. Pierce the bottom and sides all over with a fork. Chill at least 1 hour and up to overnight. (If refrigerating overnight, cover with plastic wrap.)<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the chilled dough with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the edges are golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue baking until the crust is golden all over, 10 to 15 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the filling: Gently whisk the pumpkin, cream, granulated sugar, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and salt in a large bowl until just smooth (do not overmix). Pour the filling into the cooled crust and smooth the top. Bake until the filling is set around the edges but still slightly jiggly at the center, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.<br> For the marshmallow meringue: Bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Add the egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment along with the sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Whisk to combine. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer base and place over the simmering water (make sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water).

Seal the bag, put it in a rimmed dish and marinate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight in the refrigerator, flipping the bag periodically for even distribution of the marinade. Make the glaze: Meanwhile, combine the sake with 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/3 cup water and the remaining 1/2 cup soy sauce, 4 sliced garlic cloves, and 2 smashed ginger coins in a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 5 minutes to develop flavor. Using a fork, stir the cornstarch in a small bowl with 1 tablespoon water. Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the sauce. Simmer the sauce for 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and add 1 teaspoon vinegar. Cool to room temperature, then strain, discarding the solids. Set aside 1/4 cup for drizzling at the end. Make the pickled peppers: Place the sliced peppers in a medium bowl. Bring 1/2 cup of water to a boil with 1/2 teaspoon salt, then pour over the peppers. Let sit 10 minutes, then drain. Return the peppers to the same bowl. Add 1/4 cup vinegar, 2 tablespoons water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining tablespoon of brown sugar, and stir to dissolve. Set aside. Take the chicken out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking. Remove from the marinade, and pat dry with paper towels. (Discard the marinade.) Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Lightly sprinkle the chicken all over with salt and pepper, and place its cavity over the cola can so that the chicken is sitting upright. Carefully put the chicken on the can on the indirect side of the grill, with the back facing the hotter side. Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the breast (avoiding the bone) reads 140 degrees F, 35 to 40 minutes. Baste the chicken all over with the glaze and cover for 5 minutes. Turn the chicken so that the breast is facing the hotter side. Baste a second time, and cover again until the thermometer reads at least 165 degrees F in the thickest part of the thigh, about 25 minutes more. Carefully remove from the grill and let rest 20 minutes before carving. Drizzle with some of the glaze and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Serve the pickled peppers on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 30555,&quot;Cuban Ropa Vieja 6 pounds flank steak 3/4 cup Delicioso Adobo seasoning, recipe follows 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce 6 bottles beer 1/2 cup canola oil 2 medium yellow onions, chopped 2 red bell peppers, cored, seeded, ribbed and chopped 2 green bell peppers, cored, seeded, ribbed and chopped 6 scallions, white and light green parts only, chopped 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons garlic powder 2 tablespoons onion powder 2 tablespoons dried oregano 2 tablespoons lemon pepper 2 tablespoons parsley flakes 2 tablespoons achoite powder from annatto seed 1 tablespoon cumin powder Instructions: Cut the flank steak into large pieces and place them in a large bowl.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. Start with 2 colors. I used green (mint) and yellow (lemon). Place the sugar pieces side- to-side. Pull and lengthen. Cut in half. Place them side-to-side again. Pull to lengthen. Cut in half and place them side-to-side. Now you have a flat piece of sugar that you are pulling long. Cut off the ends, (they are bulky), when the sugar starts to harden. Make some waves to create the ribbon. Join the 2 edges to make a circular ribbon. Voila!

Drizzle with a little more olive oil and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30607,&quot;Slow-Cooker Pulled Pork Sandwiches 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 2 teaspoons hot paprika 1 teaspoon mustard powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 3-to-4-pound boneless pork shoulder, trimmed of excess fat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, plus more to taste 3 tablespoons tomato paste 6 potato buns Barbecue sauce and prepared coleslaw, for serving Instructions: Combine 1 tablespoon brown sugar, the paprika, mustard powder, cumin, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture all over the pork. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet; add the pork and cook, turning, until browned on all sides, 5 minutes. Remove the pork and transfer to a plate; whisk 3/4 cup water into the drippings in the skillet. Transfer the liquid to a 5-to-6-quart slow cooker. Add the vinegar, tomato paste, the remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 2 cups water to the slow cooker and whisk to combine. Add the pork, cover and cook on low, 8 hours. Remove the pork and transfer to a cutting board. Strain the liquid into a saucepan, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Roughly chop the pork and mix in a bowl with 1 cup of the reduced cooking liquid, and salt and vinegar to taste. Serve on buns with barbecue sauce and coleslaw. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 30608,&quot;Friendship Butterflies Friendship Butterflies Instructions: Friendship Butterflies &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 30609,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Apple Cider Donut Pudding 8 apple cider, pumpkin spice or plain cake donuts, sliced in half horizontally 2/3 cup dried cranberries<br> 2 cups orange juice 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 cup chopped pecans<br> 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Zest of 1 lemon plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar<br> 1/3 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 large egg yolks<br> 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice<br> 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 cup heavy cream<br> 2 pints vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Place the donuts cut-side up on a baking sheet. Turn the oven to 350 degrees F and while it&#39;s preheating, place the baking sheet with the donuts inside to toast, flipping once after about 10 minutes. Continue to cook until lightly toasted on both sides, another 5 minutes. Remove the baking sheet and continue to preheat the oven. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add the cranberries and 1 cup of the orange juice. Bring to a simmer and cook until the cranberries are plump, 10 to 15 minutes (the orange juice will reduce; that&#39;s just fine). Set aside. Cube 7 tablespoons of the butter. In a large bowl, add the pecans, flour, salt, lemon zest, 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar and the cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, mix everything together until crumbly. Refrigerate until ready to bake. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar and egg yolks until well incorporated, less gritty and slightly lighter yellow in color. Add the pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract and remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar and whisk until everything is well blended. Slowly add the heavy cream while continuing to whisk, then whisk in the lemon juice and remaining 1 cup orange juice. Slowly add the simmered cranberries and orange juice. Butter the bottom and sides of an 8-by-8-inch casserole dish with the remaining tablespoon of butter. Break the donuts into large chunks and add to the casserole dish. Pour half of the custard mixture over top, making sure to nestle the cranberries in the nooks and crannies. Press everything down into the custard and allow it to soak for 10 minutes. Pour the remaining custard over top. Remove the topping from the refrigerator and sprinkle evenly over the top. Bake until golden brown and bubbly around the edges, 35 to 40 minutes. Let sit 15 minutes before serving warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 30610,&quot;Orzo with Thyme and Lemon Zest 1 1/2 cups chicken stock or broth 2 cups water Pinch dried red pepper flakes 1 garlic clove, minced or pressed 3/4 cup orzo 1/2 lemon, zested 2 tablespoons fresh chopped thyme leaves Salt Instructions: In a medium saucepan, add the stock, water, pepper flakes, and garlic and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the orzo, lower the heat, and simmer until most of the liquid has been absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, and stir in lemon zest and thyme leaves. Season with salt, to taste, and transfer to a serving bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 30611,&quot;Coconut Layer Cake 2 1/2 cups sifted cake flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 pound (1 stick) butter 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 eggs 1 cup milk 1 large orange, zest finely grated A few spoonfuls melted, strained apricot preserves Fluffy White Icing, recipe follows 8 to 10 ounces (3 to 4 cups) grated, toasted coconut, see note<br> 4 egg whites 1/4 cup light corn syrup 2 tablespoons water 2 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar Pinch salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almond extra Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Adjust the rack to the center of the oven. Butter 2 (9-inch) round layer-cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the paper and dust all over lightly with flour. Set aside.<br> Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In large bowl of electric mixer, beat the butter to soften a bit. Add the vanilla and sugar and beat for a few minutes. Add the eggs and milk and beat until smooth. On the lowest speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula as necessary, and beating only until smooth after each addition. Remove from the mixer and stir in the orange rind.<br> Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Tilt and shake the pans gently to level the batter. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cakes come away from the sides of the pans and tops spring back when lightly touched.<br> Remove from the oven. Let stand for about 5 minutes. Cover with racks or cookie sheets and invert. Remove pans and papers. Cover with racks and invert again to cool right side up.<br> When the layers have cooled completely, place 4 strips of waxed paper or baking parchment around a cake plate, and place 1 layer on the plate, upside down. Spread with a thin layer of smooth preserves, reserving some for the second layer.<br> Make the Fluffy White Icing.<br> Spread 1/3 of the icing on the bottom layer. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the coconut. Put on the second layer, right side up, so that the 2 cake bottoms meet in the middle. Spread the top with the remaining apricot preserves. Use another 1/3 of the icing to ice around the sides of the cake. Use the remaining 1/3 of the icing to ice the top of the cake. Quickly spread with a long, narrow metal spatula to smooth the top and sides.<br> With the palm of your hand, press another 1/3 of the coconut onto the sides and sprinkle the remaining coconut evenly over the top. Remove the paper strips, pulling each 1 out by a narrow end. Mix all of the ingredients except for the vanilla and almond extracts in the top of a large double boiler; it must have at least an 8 to 10-cup capacity. Place over hot water on moderate heat. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed for 5 to 6 minutes, until the mixture stands in peaks when the beaters are lifted.<br> Immediately, in order to stop the cooking, transfer to a the large bowl of an electric mixer. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and beat at high speed for about 5 minutes more, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl almost continuously with a rubber spatula, until the mixture is smooth and very thick. Use immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 30612,&quot;Medieval Roasted Chicken 1 roaster chicken 2 cups water 1/2 cup paprika 1/2 cup granulated garlic 2 cups lemon juice 1/2 cup lemon pepper 1/4 cup Italian spice 2 teaspoons salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
