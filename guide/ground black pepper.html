black pepper 1 teaspoon ground allspice 2 bay leaves 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 pound diced carrots, approximately 4 small 1/2 pound diced onions, approximately 2 small 1 pound potatoes, peeled and chopped, approximately 3 medium 1/4 pound diced celery, approximately 2 stalks 1 small head cabbage, chopped, approximately 2 pounds 2 quarts water 1 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons saltpeter 1 cinnamon stick, broken into several pieces 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 8 whole cloves 8 whole allspice berries 12 whole juniper berries 2 bay leaves, crumbled 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 2 pounds ice 1 (4 to 5 pound) beef brisket, trimmed 1 small onion, quartered 1 large carrot, coarsely chopped 1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped Instructions: Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium heat. Add the bell pepper and cook until it begins to brown slightly, approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic, corned beef and cabbage, thyme, oregano and black pepper to the skillet and stir to combine. Once combined, spread the hash evenly over the pan and firmly press down with a spatula. Place a heavy lid, heatproof plate or second pan directly atop the hash and allow to cook until browned, approximately 10 minutes. After 10 minutes stir mixture, press down again, top with the lid and allow to cook another 5 to 6 minutes, or until browned. Serve immediately. *Cook&#39;s note: Brisket should be prepared through the brining stage, but not cooked. Place the corned beef, pepper, allspice, bay leaves and salt into a large 8-quart pot along with 3-quarts of water. Cover and set over high heat. Bring to a boil, decrease the heat to low and cook, at a low simmer for 2 1/2 hours. After 2 1/2 hours add the carrots, onions, potatoes and celery. Return to a simmer and cook uncovered for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, add the cabbage and cook for an additional 15 to 20 minutes until the potatoes and cabbage are tender. Remove the bay leaves and serve immediately. Place the water into a large 6 to 8 quart stockpot along with salt, sugar, saltpeter, cinnamon stick, mustard seeds, peppercorns, cloves, allspice, juniper berries, bay leaves and ginger. Cook over high heat until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the ice. Stir until the ice has melted. If necessary, place the brine into the refrigerator until it reaches a temperature of 45 degrees F. Once it has cooled, place the brisket in a 2-gallon zip top bag and add the brine. Seal and lay flat inside a container, cover and place in the refrigerator for 10 days. Check daily to make sure the beef is completely submerged and stir the brine. After 10 days, remove from the brine and rinse well under cool water. Place the brisket into a pot just large enough to hold the meat, add the onion, carrot and celery and cover with water by 1-inch. Set over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and gently simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until the meat is fork tender. Remove from the pot and thinly slice across the grain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48117,&quot;Mojito 6 teaspoons sugar 20 mint leaves 6 key limes, juiced 6 ounces white rum 1 ounce seltzer Instructions: Using a pestle and mortar, or a large glass, combine the sugar and mint leaves, and crush to a paste. Add the lime juice and rum. Shake the mixture and divide between 4 small glasses. Top off with seltzer. &quot;,&quot;[Cuba Libre, Mencia, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 48118,&quot;Perfect Roast Chicken 1 5- to 6-pound roasting chicken Kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 large bunch fresh thyme<br> 1 lemon, halved<br> 1 head garlic, cut in half crosswise<br> 2 tablespoons butter, melted<br> 1 Spanish onion, thickly sliced<br> 1 cup chicken stock<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the chicken giblets. Rinse the chicken inside and out. Remove any excess fat and leftover pinfeathers and pat the outside dry. Place the chicken in a large roasting pan. Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the chicken. Stuff the cavity with the bunch of thyme, both halves of the lemon, and all the garlic. Brush the outside of the chicken with the butter and sprinkle again with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken. Scatter the onion slices around the chicken. Roast the chicken for 1 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and thigh. Remove to a platter and cover with aluminum foil while you prepare the gravy. Remove all the fat from the bottom of the pan, reserving 2 tablespoons in a small cup. Add the chicken stock to the pan and cook on high heat for about 5 minutes, until reduced, scraping the bottom of the pan. Combine the 2 tablespoons of chicken fat with the flour and add to the pan. Boil for a few minutes to cook the flour. Strain the gravy into a small saucepan and season it to taste. Keep it warm over a very low flame while you carve the chicken. Slice the chicken onto a platter and serve immediately with the warm gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 48119,&quot;Shishito Peppers with Chili and Lime 3 tablespoons canola oil 1 pound shishito peppers<br> 2 teaspoons chili powder<br> 1 tablespoon sesame seeds<br> Zest of 2 limes<br> Kosher salt and ground pepper<br> 2 tablespoons ponzu<br> 1 tablespoon lime juice<br> Flaky salt, for finishing<br> Instructions: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot, then add the shishito peppers. Cook, stirring frequently to allow even charring, until softened slightly and blistered in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the chili powder, sesame seeds, zest, 2 teaspoons salt and some black pepper in a small bowl. Combine ponzu and lime juice in another bowl. Place peppers in a large bowl and toss with the spice mixture and about half the ponzu-lime mixture, stirring well to evenly coat the peppers. Place on a serving platter, finish with flaky salt and serve with the remaining sauce alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 48120,&quot;Wild Shaxi Mushrooms Wok Tossed with Cured Pork One 4-inch piece cured pork 4 cloves garlic, finely sliced 1 green pepper, sliced 1 red pepper, sliced 8 ounces ox-liver or porcini mushrooms, sliced 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, sliced 2 young garlic shoots, sliced into 2-inch lengths 2 tablespoons Chinese cooking wine Pinch salt Instructions: Heat a pan or wok until smoking hot. Add the cured pork and cook until the fat has been rendered out, 2 minutes. Add the garlic and peppers and stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add the mushrooms and garlic shoots and stir-fry for 1 minute. Pour in the Chinese cooking wine and sprinkle with the salt and stir-fry for 1 minute longer. Serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48121,&quot;Master Recipe for Pizza Dough 1/2 cup milk, room temperature 2 tablespoons dry yeast or 1 1/2-ounces fresh yeast 3 cups sifted cake flour, plus more for kneading 3/4 teaspoon fine table salt Cornmeal, for sprinkling Instructions: In a small bowl or cup combine milk with 3/4 cup water that is warm to the touch (about 125 degrees). Sprinkle dry yeast or crumble fresh yeast over. Stir once and let sit in a warm spot until it foams, 10 to 20 minutes. In a large bowl combine 3 cups flour with salt. Pour yeast mixture over flour, stirring with a wooden spoon to mix well. Dough will be very wet. Generously flour a work surface and turn out dough. Begin kneading, adding extra cake flour a handful at a time or less, scraping up and turning dough with a dough scraper. You will need about 10 minutes to knead and add flour. Dough is ready when it is smooth, silky and just past stickiness. Do not add too much flour or dough will be very dry. Gather up dough in a ball. Lightly oil a large bowl, add dough and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature about 2 hours or until doubled. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and cut into 4 even pieces. Shape into rough rounds, about 7 inches in diameter, 1/4-inch thick with a 3/8-inch-thick rim. Transfer to pizza peels or baking sheets sprinkled lightly with cornmeal. Cover loosely with towels and let rise 10 to 60 minutes. Top and bake according to recipe instructions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 48122,&quot;Fresh Basil Pasta with Eggplant and Tomato 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup fine semolina flour 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil<br> 2 tablespoons finely grated parmesan cheese 2 tablespoons finely grated pecorino romano cheese Kosher salt 3/4 cup whole milk<br> 2 large eggs<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 large eggplant (about 1 1/2 pounds), cut into 1-inch chunks 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 5 cloves garlic, smashed Pinch of red pepper flakes 1 28-ounce can whole peeled Italian tomatoes, crushed with your hands 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, plus 1/2 cup torn leaves 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes Grated pecorino Romano cheese, for topping Instructions: Make the pasta: Whisk both flours, the basil, both cheeses and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk the milk, eggs and olive oil in a separate bowl, then pour into the flour mixture and stir with a fork until the dough comes together. Knead the dough on a floured surface with floured hands until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding more flour as needed so the dough is soft but not sticky. Wrap in plastic wrap; let rest at room temperature for 2 hours. Cut the dough into quarters. Working with one piece at a time (keep the rest wrapped in plastic), roll the dough through a pasta machine on the thickest setting. Continue rolling the dough through progressively thinner settings, dusting with flour as needed, until it is about 1/8 inch thick. Using a knife, cut the sheet of dough into 4-by-1/4-inch noodles. Dust the noodles with more flour, then scatter on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Cover the pasta with a kitchen towel and set aside until ready to cook or refrigerate up to 4 hours.<br> Make the sauce: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Toss the eggplant, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Spread on a baking sheet and roast, stirring once or twice, until tender and browned, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove to a plate and set aside.<br> Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil with the garlic and red pepper flakes in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the garlic is tender and golden, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, then add 1 cup water to the empty can and add to the saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the chopped basil and season with salt and pepper.<br> Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until it floats to the top and is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water; drain the pasta and return to the pot. Add the sauce and cook over medium heat, stirring, until coated, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, three-quarters of the eggplant, the mozzarella and 1/4 cup torn basil. Add the reserved cooking water as needed to loosen. Transfer to a large shallow bowl. Top with the remaining eggplant and 1/4 cup torn basil; sprinkle with pecorino.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 48123,&quot;Fried Shrimp and Okra Vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 large eggs 1 1/2 cups fine cornmeal 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning 1 teaspoon fresh thyme 3 cups fresh or frozen okra (thawed if frozen) Kosher salt 24 large shrimp, peeled and deveined (tails intact) 3 large tomatoes, cut into wedges Tartar sauce and lemon wedges, for serving (optional) Instructions: Heat 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil in a medium Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F.

Cover and let sit at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld. For the soft pretzels: Combine the sugar, salt, yeast and 1 1/2 cups warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix with the dough hook until combined. Let sit 5 minutes. Add the butter and 4 1/2 cups of the flour and mix on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, 3 to 4 minutes. If the dough appears too wet, add additional flour a tablespoon at a time. Remove the dough from the bowl, place on a flat surface and knead the dough into a ball with your hands. Oil a bowl with vegetable oil, add the dough and turn to coat with the oil. Cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and spray liberally with cooking spray. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large pot over high heat and add the baking soda. Remove the dough from the bowl, place on a flat surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope measuring about 22 inches. Shape each into an upside-down U shape, then bring the ends together and twist them to create a pretzel shape. For the salt mixture: Combine the salt, black pepper and pink pepper in a small bowl; set aside. Boil the pretzels in the water solution 2 at a time for 30 seconds; remove with a large flat slotted spatula or a spider. Place 4 pretzels on each baking sheet, brush the tops with the egg wash and season liberally with the salt mixture. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.

Grate the zucchini with a box grater or the shredder attachment on a food processor; after doing so, you should have about 4 cups. Place the zucchini in a large microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high, stirring after 3 1/2 minutes, until tender and liquid has collected in the bottom of the bowl, about 7 minutes. Set the zucchini aside until it is cool enough to handle. Once cool, use a slotted spoon (or your hands) to transfer it to a kitchen towel or piece of cheesecloth; roll up the cloth and twist and squeeze out as much liquid as you can. Squeeze hard to get out all the excess water; this is crucial to getting good taco shells. You should end up with about 2 cups of shredded cooked zucchini. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray it with cooking oil to help prevent sticking. Add the zucchini, Parmesan, scallions, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt and eggs to a medium bowl; stir until blended into a dough. Scoop this mixture into 1/4-cup-size balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Use your hand to flatten each ball into a very thin 5-inch diameter round, about 1/8 inch thick. Bake the shells until they are brown around the edges, about 15 minutes. Let them cool and then remove them from the parchment. For the zucchini-tomato salsa: Add the tomatoes, basil, mint, salt, zucchini and lime juice to a medium bowl and toss together. For the taco filling and fixings: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef, shallot, serrano and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook this mixture until the beef is done through and the veggies are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the corn kernels, ancho cl powder, cumin, 1/4 cup water and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook this mixture for 3 minutes more, adding more water if needed to thin the taco filling out. Spread about 1/4 cup of the refried beans onto each zucchini taco shell. Place 1/4 cup of the beef filling onto each, then top with 1 heaping tablespoon of the zucchini tomato salsa and 1 heaping teaspoon of the feta. Fold up and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 48137,&quot;Marinated Cumin-Scented Butterflied Pork 1 cup fresh cilantro or Italian parsley leaves 1/4 cup olive oil Juice of 3 limes or 1/3 cup lime juice 1 small onion finely chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 1/2 pounds boneless pork loin, trimmed of all fat and butterflied Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the broiler or a grill. In a food processor or blender, process the cilantro or parsley, olive oil, lime juice, onion and cumin until smooth. With a sharp knife, make many shallow slashes across both surfaces of the pork. Pour half the cilantro mixture over the pork, spreading it evenly over the meat and working it into the slashes. Flip the pork over and repeat the procedure on the other side. If you have time, let the pork marinate to pick up flavors. Otherwise, place it on a broiler pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil 3 inches from the heat source for 10 minutes. Flip the meat over and broil until cooked through, about 10 minutes more. Remove pork from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes. Thinly slice the pork across the grain and serve with pan juices delicious warm or at room temperature; great in salads too. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 48138,&quot;The Margherita Pizza 14 ounces high-gluten flour 0.2 grams instant yeast<br> 8 grams table salt<br> 32 grams olive oil, plus additional for greasing the bowl<br> 2 ounces extra-virgin olive oil, in a squeeze bottle 2 ounces finely chopped garlic<br> 1 ounce Romano cheese, finely grated<br> 4 ounces provolone piccante, shredded<br> 16 ounces diced Roma tomatoes<br> 12 slices fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch strips<br> 2 teaspoons table salt<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 ounce fresh basil, thinly sliced Instructions: For the dough: Add flour, yeast and 4.05 ounces water to a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.

Cut the sweet potato into rough 1 1/2-inch cubes and the red potato slightly smaller (1-inch cubes) as the sweet potato will cook more quickly. Halve the red onion, then cut each half into 4 to 6 segments, discarding any tough outer skin. Seed the peppers and cut into 1-inch squares, and separate the cloves of garlic. Put everything into a 2-quart flameproof casserole dish, or whatever you want to use (it should be big, otherwise use 2 dishes) and, using your hands, give the vegetables a good coating of olive oil. Season with black pepper, but no salt as the cheese will make it salty (and anyway, the salt will make water leach out). Bake for 45 minutes, by which time the vegetables should be cooked through and here and there tinged with brown. You&#39;ll need to turn the oven up to maximum heat or light the broiler for the endgame: so place the thinly sliced cheese on top of the bake, and put it back in the very hot oven or under the broiler until the cheese has melted and turned slightly brown on top, about 5 to 10 minutes. Serve straight out of the casserole dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 48149,&quot;Peppercorn Steak Four 7-ounce top sirloin steaks<br> Half 1-ounce package au jus mix 2 ounces brandy<br> 2 tablespoons margarine<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup heavy cream, such as Minor&#39;s Culinary Cream<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper Instructions: Heat a grill to medium. Grill the steaks to the desired doneness. Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the au jus mix and the brandy. Let boil for 10 minutes. While that cooks, in a separate small saucepan, combine the margarine and the flour to make the roux. Let the roux cook for 5 minutes. Add the roux to the au jus mixture and stir with a wire whisk until smooth. Stir in the cream and the black pepper. Arrange the steaks on serving plates and serve drizzled with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 48150,&quot;Oatmeal Cake with Penuche Frosting 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs, room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups unbleached flour 1 cup oats, ground fine in a blender 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup milk 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons milk 1 cup confectioners sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/3 cup very finely ground pecans or walnuts Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9inch springform pan. In a large mixing bowl cream the butter with an electric mixer until soft. Add the sugar and beat until well blended. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat until light and very fluffy. Thoroughly combine the flour, ground oats, baking powder, cardamom, and salt in a medium bowl. Beat these ingredients into the butter mixture, alternating with the milk, until well blended. Scrape into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake 50 to 55 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Do not overcook. Cool on a wire rack 15 minutes, then loosen the edges of the cake, invert onto a platter, and invert again onto the rack so the cake is right side up. Let the cake cool completely, about 2 hours. When the cake is cool, make the frosting: In a small saucepan melt the butter over medium low heat. Add the brown sugar and stir until melted and blended with the butter. Slowly pour in the milk, mix well, and bring the mixture to a boil. Scrape it into a medium bowl and cool 10 minutes. Add the confectioners sugar and vanilla and beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Spread all over the cooled cake. Decorate the cake by sprinkling the ground nuts on top, leaving a 3/4-inch border bare.

This stuff is hot! Be careful with splatter! Reserve. For the chicken: In a large braiser or saucepot, warm 3/4 cup of the olive oil over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the onions, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, black pepper, cayenne and red pepper flakes. Stir well and cook until the onions are translucent. Stir the fresh chopped bell peppers into the onion mixture. Stir to coat. Add the reserved hot sauce. Continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the tomato sauce, heavy cream, Romano and sugar. Whisk well! Lower the heat until the sauce slightly bubbles, and stir well. Turn the heat to low or off while sauteing the chicken strips and cooking the rigatoni noodles. When the sauce is nearing doneness, cook the rigatoni noodles according to package directions. I like to pre-cook my pasta for sauteed pasta dishes such as this. Pre-cooking rigatoni to near doneness, straining and holding at room temperature, or completely chilling down if holding for several hours or more and then dunking in hot, boiling water prior to sauteing works well. For the chicken saute, heat a large saute pan with the remaining olive oil. First, sprinkle the chicken strips with 1 teaspoon salt (more or less), and add to the hot olive oil, one layer at a time. Do not overcrowd the pan. Cook in batches if necessary. Add a dash of black pepper if desired. Flip and shake the chicken pieces around in the hot pan to sear all sides. Cook until opaque and lightly brown, about 4 minutes. Set aside. Toss the tomato sauce and chicken in a large bowl in half-batches, or altogether. Pour onto a serving platter or individual pasta bowls.

Transfer to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until you are ready to use it. To make the burgers: Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high. Divide the ground beef into 4 equal pieces and gently form into patties. Use your thumb to make a small indentation in the middle of each burger (this is so the burger grills flat and doesn&#39;t contract and puff up on the grill). Brush both sides of the burgers with the oil and then season with salt and pepper. Place the burgers on the grill and cook until they have grill marks, about 4 minutes. Flip the burgers, cook 2 minutes longer, and then top each with about 1 tablespoon of the mozzarella. Cook the burgers 2 more minutes for medium-rare doneness and remove from the grill. Place the buns on the grill, cut side down, and lightly toast, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Set a burger on each bottom bun half. Top with a salted tomato slice.

Using a knife, make a 3-inch incision lengthwise from the root end of each cabbage and split open in half with your hands. Make another 3-inch incision from the root end of each half and split in half again into quarters. Make the brining solution: Combine 1 cup of the salt and 10 cups water in a large bowl and mix until most of the salt is melted. Dip each cabbage quarter in the brining solution and shake dry directly above the solution.<br> After all of the cabbage is dipped and dried, use the remaining salt to distribute among the cabbage, working a quarter wedge at a time. Place the root end of each facing you, working over another large bowl. Gather the leaves with one hand and flip them open as though you\u2019re turning the pages of a book; use your other hand to salt the leaves, 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon per leaf at a time, depending on the size of the leaf. Salt well on the thick white part, closer to the root, rather than the leafy ends. Make sure to use the entire 1 cup salt for this step. (If you run out of salt while salting, continue with more salt up to 1/2 cup; oversalting can deter the fermentation process, so do not go over 1/2 cup.)<br> Once the cabbage is all salted, place back in the brining solution cut-side down. If there is any salt left behind in the large bowl (or any salt sticking to your hands), add it back to the brining solution. Rotate and gently press down on the cabbage every 1 to 2 hours to ensure each quarter is submerged in the brining solution at some point. In the beginning of the brining process, not all of the cabbage quarters will be sitting in the brining solution. Let sit at room temperature until the thickest white part of each becomes pliable and bends over in half without breaking, 6 to 8 hours. If the thick white part cracks loudly and there is a rip where you folded it over, then it needs more time.<br> For the dasima anchovy broth: While the cabbage is brining, add the dasima and 4 cups cold water to a medium pot. Let sit until the dasima doubles in size and the water turns a slight green-yellow, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, remove the heads of the dasima anchovies and split them in half along the spines to remove the guts. Set aside.<br> Bring the dasima pot to a boil over medium-high heat; boil until the dasima starts to foam around the sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard the dasima, then add the cleaned anchovies and dried shiitake. Lower the heat to low and cook at a gentle boil (where you see 2 to 3 bubbles appearing on the surface at most), for 10 minutes. At this point, some broth will have evaporated and the remaining broth will be slightly darker. Turn off the heat and let sit for 5 more minutes. Strain through a mesh strainer. Reserve the pot for later use. Cool the broth completely in the refrigerator.<br> When the cabbage is properly brined, drain it and discard the brining solution. Submerge the cabbage in a running bath of cold water and wash, massaging and rubbing the thick white part of each quarter between your fingers, one leaf at a time. Drain and repeat this 2 to 4 more times, until the thick white part closest to the root is no longer slippery. Tear off a piece of cabbage and taste. The cabbage should taste seasoned after a thorough wash. Hold each quarter wedge root-side up and with one hand, gently squeeze out the water from the leafy part. Be careful not to rip the leaves as you squeeze. Shake gently to separate the leaves and place back in a colander root-side up to drain for 1 to 2 hours.<br> For the rice glue: Add the glutinous rice flour, sugar and 2 cups cold dasima anchovy broth to the reserved pot and whisk until combined. Place the pot over medium-high heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture starts thickening and comes to a boil, 5 to 6 minutes. Switch to a silicone spatula, lower the heat to medium low and continue to cook, stirring, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the spatula, about 1 minute. (This mixture will thicken as it sits; you should have a total of 2 cups.) Remove from the heat and transfer to a heatproof container to cool immediately in the refrigerator.<br> For the paste: Put the fish sauce, dried bori shrimp, garlic, salted shrimp, quartered onion, ginger and apple in a blender and process until smooth. Transfer the blended mixture to a large bowl and whisk in the gochugaru and glue until combined. Add the radish, chives and sliced onion and stir again until incorporated. (Keep in mind that this paste is supposed to be salty.)<br> Place a quarter wedge of cabbge, root end facing you, in a big bowl. Gather the leaves with one hand and flip them open as though you\u2019re turning the pages of a book; use your other hand to brush with roughly 1 tablespoon of the kimchi paste one leaf at a time, working from root to tip. Coat the entire leaf thoroughly with paste; slide most of the vegetables in the paste down by the thick white part closest to the root before moving on to the next leaf. Make sure not to coat too heavily in the beginning, as there are many cabbage quarters to coat. When finished coating, press down on all the leaves and curl up the leafy parts. Wrap the two largest, outermost leaves of each wedge around the entire wedge in a tight bundle. Repeat for the remaining wedges.<br> Pack the cabbage in a clean, airtight container as tightly as possible, pressing down gently to squeeze out as much air as you can. Use a weight or a plate to weigh down the cabbage, leaving an inch or more of space on top, as the cabbage will release liquid and build up pressure as it ferments. Allow the cabbage to ferment for 2 to 4 days at room temperature on a kitchen countertop, away from the sunlight or heat, opening the container every 1 to 2 days to release built-up pressure and press down to submerge the cabbage in its juices. The kimchi will release more liquid as it sits, and bubbles will start forming; it will become slightly effervescent. (Keep in mind that the kimchi juice ferments faster than the cabbage, so taste the cabbage, especially closer to the thick root parts, as it ferments.) The kimchi will change in level of salt, flavor and texture throughout the fermentation process; when the kimchi has reached the desired level of pungency and taste, store in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.<br> To serve, slice off the root and cut the kimchi horizontally in 1- to 2-inch pieces, keeping the leaves neatly stacked. Serve alongside rice and/or soup.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]&quot; 48181,&quot;Apple Chutney 6 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and half-inch diced 1 cup chopped yellow onion 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (2 oranges) 3/4 cup good cider vinegar 1 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed 1 teaspoon whole dried mustard seeds 1/4 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 3/4 cup raisins Instructions: Combine the apples, onion, ginger, orange juice, vinegar, brown sugar, mustard seeds, pepper flakes and salt and in a large saucepan.

Place on a baking sheet and leave out several hours or overnight, until completely dried out. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the bacon to a skillet and saute until cooked and almost crisp, about 7 minutes. Remove to a plate and wipe out any grease. Melt the butter in the skillet; throw in the onion, celery and red pepper and cook, stirring, 4 to 5 minutes, until they are soft. Add the jalapeno and garlic and saute 2 minutes more. Pour in the chicken broth. Add the parsley and rosemary, season with salt and pepper and cook for a couple of minutes, then turn off the heat. Pour the cornbread into a bowl and spoon in some of the broth mixture. Keep adding broth, tossing as you go, until it&#39;s all mixed in. Season with salt and pepper, add the bacon and toss again. If you like your dressing extra moist, add a little more broth. Pile the dressing into a 3-quart casserole pan and bake, uncovered, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve piping hot. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Add the cornmeal to a large bowl along with the flour, baking powder, salt, basil, sage and thyme and stir together. Measure the buttermilk in a measuring cup, add the whole milk and egg and stir together with a fork. Add the baking soda and stir. Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir with a fork until just combined. Do not overmix. In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons shortening in the microwave and slowly add to the batter, stirring constantly until combined. In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and shortening.

Liberally spray an extra-large mixing bowl (not plastic) with olive oil spray.<br> Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and toast it in the oven, stirring it once or twice, until it is golden, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool, leaving the oven on. Put the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot, add the corn kernels and set over medium-high heat. Cover and shake the pot occasionally until the popping begins, about 5 minutes. Once the popping starts, shake the pot continuously until the popping slows down dramatically, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, but continue shaking it until the popping stops entirely. Dump the popcorn into the prepared mixing bowl, trying not to let any unpopped kernels fall into the bowl. Add the toasted coconut and the Candied Peanuts.<br> Before beginning the caramel process, spray a rubber spatula, a wooden spoon and 2 cookie sheets liberally with olive oil spray.<br> In a medium saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter and corn syrup. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with the oil-sprayed spatula, until the butter is melted. Continue cooking, stirring constantly and being careful not to splatter the hot caramel, until the mixture thickens and a candy thermometer registers 255 degrees F, about 7 minutes. (If you do not have a candy thermometer, you will know it is ready when the bubbles of the mixture get noticeably larger and slower.) Remove from the heat. Add the curry leaf if using, salt, baking soda, cumin seeds, black mustard seeds, turmeric, mace if using, paprika, cayenne if using and cinnamon. Stir quickly to incorporate, and then immediately pour the caramel over the popcorn mixture. Stir with the wooden spoon until all of the popcorn is well coated.<br> Pour the mixture out onto the oiled cookie sheets and spread it out evenly. Bake for 1 hour, stirring it every 20 minutes to keep it from burning. Remove the cookie sheets from the oven and let the popcorn cool to room temperature. The popcorn will crisp as it cools.<br> When it is cool, you can serve the popcorn immediately or package it in airtight bags for storage. It will keep well for 4 days. In a small mixing bowl, combine the peanuts, coconut milk, brown sugar, kaffir lime leaf, salt and reshampatti. Put the mixture in a nonstick saute pan and cook over high heat without stirring until the nuts have started to brown and toast, about 2 minutes. Then stir, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the peanuts have browned, about 5 minutes. (The nuts will brown evenly and the pan may smoke slightly from the coconut milk, but this is all okay if you are stirring continuously.)<br> Transfer the mixture to a plate and set aside to cool. The nuts will still be somewhat moist at this point but will crisp as they cool.<br> Once the nuts are cool, break them up. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 48187,&quot;Spicy Pepper Butter Fried Turkey 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 tablespoons Original TABASCO? brand Pepper Sauce 1/4 cup water 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 (12- to 14-pound) turkey, rinsed and trussed Up to 4 gallons peanut oil Turkey Fry Kit with Injector Instructions: Two days before frying, set up a large deep fryer with burner base and propane tank, meant for frying turkey, according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Measure the amount of oil needed by placing the wrapped turkey in the pot and filling the pot with water to cover the turkey by 1 inch.

Pour in the grapeseed oil and add the onion. Let the onions sizzle and saute slightly until golden brown. Add the Chips on top of the onions and stir. Add Mom\u2019s Red cl Sauce over the top of the chips and simmer for 20 seconds. Pour the contents of the skillet into a serving bowl. Using serving tongs, add the Pulled Pork to the top of the chips. Add the avocado on top of the pork, then set the Poached Egg on top of the avocado slices. Sprinkle the chopped scallions and queso fresco over the top of the chips. Add small dollops of the Onion Date Jam on top of the chips. Add the microgreens to garnish the top of the egg. Cut each tortilla into 6 triangular pieces. Put aside. In a deep saucepot, add the oil and heat on medium-high heat until the oil is at 350 degrees F or is creating movement in the pot, 15 to 20 minutes. Add some of the tortilla triangles to the oil. Let fry, moving them around with a long-handled metal slotted spoon or spider, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a sheet pan lined with paper towels to absorb the oil. While chips are still hot and slightly oily, sprinkle a generous amount of salt over them. Repeat the process with the remaining tortilla pieces. Add the cl pods to 6 cups of the filtered water in a pot. Bring to a boil, then let boil until the cl pods soften, about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool for 30 minutes before adding to a blender. Confirm that the blender top is snugly fitted before blending. Holding a folded kitchen towel on top of the blender lid, turn the blender on low speed, gently blending the water and pods together until a bright red puree develops. Pour the blended puree mixture through a sieve into a deep container to catch the cl puree. Press the cl pod skins with the back of a rubber spatula against the sieve to extract the maximum amount of red cl puree. Transfer the puree to a saucepan, then add the remaining 1 cup filtered water on low heat and whisk in the cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and salt. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a baking dish, put the cushion meat. Pour 3 cups water over the meat, then make the dry rub. In a bowl, combine the cumin, garlic powder, onion powder and salt. Pinch generous amounts of dry rub and press onto the cushion meat, coating the top and sides thoroughly. Cover with foil and bake for 4 hours. Remove the baking dish and let sit for 30 minutes before pulling the meat apart with 2 forks. Mix the shredded pork with the pan drippings in the baking dish. Heat 2 cups water in a saucepan on high heat and bring to a boil. Add the vinegar and stir the water in a counterclockwise motion. Crack open the egg into a small bowl. Pour the egg out of the bowl into the whirlpool of boiling water and cook for 3 minutes. Scoop out and add to the Chilaquiles or serve on top of toast. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil, then onions and dates. Stir and cook until the onions have caramelized into a dark golden brown color, about 25 minutes. Add the filtered water and bring to a boil. Add the raw sugar and stir until it has dissolved and the onion date jam has cooked down and is thick and caramelized. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, GSM Blend, Tempranillo, Dolcetto]&quot; 48213,&quot;Potato-Onion Tian 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the dish 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (4 to 5), thinly sliced 2 teaspoons fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 sweet onion, sliced into 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick rounds 1 leek (white and light green parts only), sliced into 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick rounds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425?.

I don&#39;t bother to beat them before adding them to the flour, but if you prefer to, do. Just find the way that you prefer. All you do is mix the flour and eggs together, and then knead the mixture until it comes together in a satiny mass. Kneading involves no more than pushing the mixture away from you with the heels of your hands and then bringing it back toward you. If you&#39;ve got an electric mixer with a dough hook, then use that, though for some reason I don&#39;t find it makes the pasta cohere any sooner. And you don&#39;t get the relaxing satisfaction of making it by hand. When the pasta is silky smooth, form it into a ball, cover with a cloth and leave for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Then get out your pasta machine, read the instructions and away you go. Two tips first: cut each slice you want to feed through the pasta machine, read the instructions and away you go. Put through the no. 1 press quite a few times, folding the strip in 1/2 and pushing it through again after each time. When the pasta dough&#39;s been fed a few times through the no. 1 slot, pass it through the remaining numbers on the gauge before pushing it through the tagliatelle-cutters. And I find that pasta strips cut into tagliatelle is better if you leave them hanging over the table or wherever to dry a little first (10 minutes is enough). When you cook the pasta, make sure you&#39;ve got plenty of boiling, salted water and start tasting as soon as the water comes back to the boil after you&#39;ve put the pasta in. Use about 1/3 of the Meatballs in their sauce to toss with the cooked, drained pasta and then pour the rest of them over the scantly sauced ribbons in the bowl. This is ambrosia: food to get you through the winter happily. Just put everything in a large bowl and then, using your hands, mix to combine before shaping into small balls. Place the meatballs on baking sheets or plates that you have lined with plastic wrap, and put in the refrigerator as you finish them. Put the onion, garlic and oregano into the processor and blitz to a pulp. Heat the butter and oil in a deep, wide pan, then scrape the onion-garlic mix into it and cook over low to medium heat for about 10 minutes. Don&#39;t let the mixture stick, just let it become soft. Add the tomatoes and then add about 3/4 cup cold water to the pan with a pinch of sugar and some salt and pepper, and cook for about 10 minutes. The tomato sauce may appear thin at this stage, but don&#39;t worry, as it will thicken a little later. Stir in the milk, and then drop the meatballs in 1 at a time. Don&#39;t stir the pan until the meatballs have turned from pink to brown, as you don&#39;t want to break them up. Cook everything for about 20 minutes, with the lid only partially covering it. At the end of cooking time, check the seasoning, as you may want more salt and a grind or 2 more of pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 48217,&quot;Oriental Pork Wrappers 1 (12-ounce) package pork sausage 2 green onions, minced 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 24 square wonton wrappers Nonstick vegetable cooking spray For dipping: soy sauce, hoisin sauce, chili garlic sauce, and hot Chinese-style mustard Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the sausage, green onions, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and garlic.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Scatter pine nuts on a small rimmed baking sheet. Toast the nuts until golden, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet. Mix the cilantro and pine nuts into the quinoa. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 48226,&quot;Gingerbread House Base 1 cup vegetable shortening 1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks) 7 cups bread flour 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons ground ginger 5 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt 1 1/2 cups dark corn syrup 4 teaspoons vanilla extract Royal Icing, recipe follows 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons meringue powder (egg white powder) 3/4 cup water 2 pounds confectioners&#39; sugar (about 7 1/2 to 8 cups or 2 boxes) Food coloring, as desired Instructions: Melt the shortening and butter together in a medium saucepan. Let cool. Sift the flour, sugar, spices, and salt into the bowl of a standing mixer. Mix the butter mixture into the flour mixture with the paddle attachment until sandy. Add the corn syrup and vanilla and mix until evenly incorporated, but still crumbly in texture. Press the dough together by hand and divide into 4 equal portions. Press into disks about 1/2-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Dust the dough and a work surface with flour. Roll the dough about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into desired shapes. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Position racks evenly in the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake until a rich tawny brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack. Combine all the ingredients, except the food coloring, in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix slowly until stiff enough to form peaks. The icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is overbeaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the icing sit to settle, then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth it out. Alternatively, combine ingredients in a large bowl, and beat with hand beaters on low speed until the frosting thickens to stiff peaks. Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. (Adding too much color reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days.) Store icing, covered, with plastic film on the surface of the icing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48227,&quot;Baked Cod with Olives and Limes 4 (6-ounce) cod fillets, pin bones removed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 thin lime slices 1/4 cup pitted chopped kalamata olives 1/4 cup drained capers 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1/4 cup olive oil Lime wedges, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.

Trim and discard the thin belly section from the salmon fillets and season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the salmon in the center of the casseroles and surround the fillets, in this order, with the peas, fava beans, snow peas, bacon, scallions and lettuce. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper. Lay the butter slices over the vegetables. (Recipe may be made ahead to this point several hours ahead; cover and chill.) Pour the fish fumet into the dishes and place each dish on top of a stove burner turned to high heat. Bring the fumet to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 minutes, until a metal skewer inserted into the center of the salmon for 5 seconds feels barely warm when touched to your lip; the salmon will be rare. Sprinkle the chopped mint over the vegetables and lay the mint sprigs on the salmon. Put the casseroles on serving plates and serve immediately. Remove the gills and eyes from the fish, or have your fish store do it. Cut the heads and bones across into 4-inch pieces. Put them in a shallow pan and cover with cold water: Let stand for 1 hour, changing the water twice. Drain. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, fennel, leek, peppercorns, salt, parsley and bay leaf. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the fish bones and cook, stirring from time to time, until the bones and any flesh around the bones turn from translucent to white, about 12 minutes. Add the wine and water and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes, skimming off the foam as it rises to the top. Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes. Strain the fumet through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing firmly on the solids to extract as much of the flavorful liquid as possible. If you have more than 3 cups of fumet, place the liquid in a clean saucepan and boil until reduced to 3 cups.

Add the tarragon, some salt and pepper, and whisk together. Add the cubed challah and let it soak in the egg mixture for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ham, peppers and spring onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the ham is a bit browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining butter and spread the ham and vegetables out evenly in the pan. Pour in the challah-egg mixture and let cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the frittata becomes light and fluffy, about 3 more minutes. Place the pan under the broiler until the top is browned, about 1 minute. Transfer the frittata to a plate and cut into wedges. Note: If you don&#39;t have a broiler, use a heat proof rubber spatula and carefully flip the frittata over, and cook for 1 minute. Or, melt a tablespoon of butter in a separate skillet until it sizzles. Pour the melted butter over the frittata and place the empty skillet over the frittata pan. Holding both handles, carefully flip the pans over, and cook the frittata on the other side for a minute. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 48242,&quot;Creamy Italian Dressing 2 heads garlic, tops sliced off 4 short sprays of 100 percent extra-virgin olive oil cooking spray 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (any combination of parsley, basil, oregano and thyme leaves) 4 ounces light sour cream 1/4 cup buttermilk 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 lemon, juiced 12 cups salad greens, washed and dried Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place garlic heads on aluminum foil and lightly spray each head with 2 sprays olive oil cooking spray. Wrap aluminum foil around the garlic to form a tight package. Roast for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and place whole heads of garlic in a food mill. (Adding the whole garlic heads eliminates the step of removing the pulp from the cloves because the food mill squeezes the pulp out.) Process the garlic until smooth. Transfer garlic pulp to a bowl. Add the fresh herbs and sour cream and stir until completely blended. Slowly add buttermilk, adding just enough to give the dressing a consistency that is easy to pour. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Chill for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

Then scrub them clean to remove any dirt or barnacles from the outer shells and then drain. Add the white wine and cleaned clams to a large saucepan. Cover and heat over medium. After a few minutes, check to see if any of the clams have opened. Once they start opening, remove the opened clams to a large bowl to cool. Cover the pot and wait another minute or so before checking to see if any more clams have opened. Discard any clams that don\u2019t open after 5 minutes. Once all the clams have been removed, turn the heat down to low and let the white wine and clam juice mixture reduce until there is about 1/3 cup of liquid left. In the meantime, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to render its fat and slightly browns, about 2 minutes. Next, add the shallots and bell pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Use a small fine-mesh sieve to strain the 1/3 cup of white wine-clam juice mixture into the skillet. Stir to combine and cook until the mixture is slightly reduced and cohesive, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool slightly. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and preheat the oven to broil. Mix the panko, olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a small bowl. Set aside. Carefully remove the top shell from each clam and use a spoon to loosen the meat from the bottom shell. Place the meat back into the bottom shell and then onto the prepared baking sheet. Divide the bacon mixture evenly among the clams, using a spoon to pack the mixture tightly into the shell. Top each of the clams with about 1 teaspoon of the panko mixture. Transfer the clams to the broiler and cook until the breadcrumbs are just golden brown, 30 seconds to a 1 minute. Keep an eye on them as the browning can happen quite quickly. Remove the clams from the oven and use tongs to transfer them to a serving plate. Garnish with chopped chives.

Add flour and mix just until combined. Add chocolate chunks and mix just until incorporated. (Mixture will look crumbly.) Divide dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper, waxed paper or plastic wrap and use your hands to form the dough halves into logs about 2 to 2 1/4 inches in diameter. Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours. I hastened this along in the freezer (30 minutes, tops) but did feel that the cookies were better after resting longer. (But do know that it works!) When you&#39;re ready to bake the cookies, heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 1 or 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly beat the egg and unwrap the chilled cookie logs to brush it over the sides. Sprinkle the coarse sugar on the open wrapping and roll the logs into it, coating them. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut logs into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. You&#39;re going to hit some chocolate chunks, so saw gently, squeezing the cookie to keep it from breaking if needed. Arrange cookie slices on prepared baking sheets 1 inch apart (they don&#39;t spread much) and sprinkle each with a few flakes of sea salt. Bake until the edges are just beginning to get golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly before transferring the cookies you don&#39;t eat immediately to a wire rack to cool.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48273,&quot;Paella &#39;Puerto Rico&#39; 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 (3 to 4-pound) octopus, beaked and headsac cleaned Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large pinch saffron 1/2 cup warm water 1/2 pound chorizo sausage, cut on the diagonal into 1-inch pieces 1 pound boneless chicken parts, preferably skin on, cut into 2-inch pieces 1 large white onion, diced 5 cloves garlic, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade, and minced 1 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley 6 cups chicken stock 3 cups white rice 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 pound mussels, scrubbed and bearded 1/2 pound (21-25 size) shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Brush 1 tablespoon of the oil on the octopus (reserving the rest), season with salt and pepper, and add to a pot with enough water to cover. Simmer until the octopus is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove octopus to a utility plate to drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the octopus head and legs, split in half, then slice and dice small. Add the saffron to 1/2 cup warm water and let it sit for 10 minutes to allow it to \bloom.<br> Heat the remaining grapeseed oil over medium high heat in a 16 inch paella pan. Brown the chorizo on all sides and remove to a utility platter. Brown the chicken pieces and remove to the same platter. Add the onion to the pan and saute until translucent, then add the garlic and gently cook until softened, monitoring to make sure it doesn&#39;t burn. Add the white wine and allow most of it to evaporate. Stir in the paprika, parsley, cup of bloomed saffron, and chicken stock, and bring to a gentle boil. Return the chorizo and chicken to the pan, and add the octopus. Stir in the rice, salt and pepper and reduce heat to medium. Cook uncovered without stirring for about 20 minutes, then add the mussels and cover. Let cook until the mussels open, about 7 minutes, then remove them to a utility platter. Add the shrimp to the pot, cover, and cook until they turn pink and opaque, about 5 minutes, then remove the shrimp to a utility platter. Serve in the pan and sprinkle with fresh cilantro. Arrange the shrimp and mussels on top. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 48274,&quot;Carrot Hash with Eggs and Pesto 1 bunch carrots with tops (about 1 pound) 1 large russet potato (about 12.5 ounces), peeled<br> 3 scallions, white parts minced and green parts reserved Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> 1/4 cup golden raisins<br> 3 tablespoons harissa<br> 1 tablespoon light brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground sumac<br> 5 large eggs<br> 1 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 20 fresh basil leaves 1/3 cup salted sunflower seeds 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar<br> 1 clove garlic<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grate the carrots (set the tops aside--you will use them later) and potato in a food processor fitted with the shredding attachment. Transfer to a colander set over a large bowl and add the scallion whites and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Use your hands or a clean dish towel to squeeze as much moisture out as possible. Discard the liquid in the bowl, then add the carrot mixture to that bowl. Stir in the panko, raisins, harissa, brown sugar, cumin, sumac, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a bunch of grinds of black pepper (I did 20) until well combined. Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat (see Cook&#39;s Note). Drop a small amount of the carrot mixture into the skillet. When it starts to sizzle, your oil is ready. Add the rest of the carrot mixture to the skillet and press down using the back of a spatula. Let cook, untouched, until the edges of the carrots turn a very deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Create 3 small divots in the top of the carrot mixture using the bottom of a measuring cup. Brush 1 tablespoon oil on top and transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake until the carrots are set and the top is a deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Carefully crack the remaining 3 eggs into the divots and bake until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 8 minutes. (Cracking the eggs into a small bowl and pouring them into the divots makes this part a little easier and less messy). Use a spatula to help slide the hash out of the skillet onto a serving platter. Meanwhile, make the pesto. Roughly chop the carrot tops and scallion greens and add to the bowl of a food processor along with the basil, sunflower seeds, vinegar, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Pulse until everything is very finely chopped. Slowly drizzle in the remaining 1 1/2 cups oil and 1/4 cup water until smooth and drizzly. Drizzle the pesto over the top of the hash and slice into wedges. Serve with the remaining pesto on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 48275,&quot;Eddie&#39;s Grilled Shrimp and Roasted Red Pepper Salad Two 12-ounce jars roasted red peppers Zest and juice of 1 lemon 5 cloves garlic 1/2 bunch green onions, chopped, plus more for topping 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus for oiling the grill grates 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined 4 cups arugula, for plating 4 cups mixed greens, for plating One 12-ounce brick feta cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes Instructions: In a food processor or blender, combine the roasted peppers, lemon zest and juice, garlic, green onions, olive oil, crushed red pepper and some salt and black pepper. Pulse until well combined. Pour half of the marinade over the shrimp and toss well. If desired, marinate the shrimp in the refrigerator for up to 30 minutes. Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Oil the grill grates. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and transfer to the grill. Grill on both sides until cooked through, about 2 minutes per side; the shrimp should be pink and firm. Transfer the remaining marinade to a saucepan with 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer; cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. To serve: Make a small salad with arugula and mixed greens in the center of each plate. Top with grilled shrimp, and drizzle over the sauce. Scatter feta cheese and green onions over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 48276,&quot;Ultimate Backyard Burger 1 cup minced shallots 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons honey 1 cup canned chopped tomatoes, such as Bel Aria 1/2 cup corn syrup 1/2 cup sherry vinegar 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 2 teaspoons chipotle puree Vegetable stock, if needed Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice 1 egg yolk 1/2 cup canola oil 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon yellow mustard 1 teaspoon mustard powder, such as Coleman&#39;s 1/2 teaspoon salt 12 slices bacon 4 ounces very soft unsalted butter, melted<br> 3 pounds ground beef (or mixture of ground beef, ground brisket and ground lamb) 3 tablespoons paprika 1 tablespoon cumin Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 brioche buns Olive oil, for brushing 6 thick slices artisanal American cheese (found at your local cheese shop) Instructions: For the ketchup: Saute the shallots and garlic in the olive oil in a large skillet over low heat until translucent, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the honey and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the tomatoes, corn syrup, vinegar, sugar and chipotle puree and simmer for 30 minutes. Puree the mixture in a blender or food processor, adding vegetable stock if the ketchup is too thick. Season with salt and pepper. For the mustard aioli: Combine the lemon juice and egg yolk in a food processor. Whisk together the canola and olive oil, and then slowly stream in until the mixture is thick and emulsified. Alternatively, this can be done in a mixing bowl with a whisk. Add the mustard, mustard powder and salt and combine. Season with more salt if needed. For the burger: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the grill to high heat. Brush both sides of the bacon with some of the smoked chili ketchup. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, turning halfway through. Gently fold the butter into the ground meat along with the paprika and cumin. Form the beef mixture into 6 patties, and sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and black pepper. Brush the brioche buns on each side with olive oil and grill the insides until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Grill the burgers until medium rare, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Once you flip the burger, add a thick slice of the cheese to each and keep the cover closed to let melt. Spread the mustard aioli on one side of the buns and the smoked chili ketchup on the other. Place the burgers on the bun cheese-side up and top each with 2 strips of bacon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 48277,&quot;Cranberry Sandwich Cookies 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup plus 1/4 cup dried cranberries 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt, plus a pinch 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus 2 tablespoons at room temperature 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening 1 large egg 1 tablespoon cranberry juice cocktail 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 8 drops red gel food coloring 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Pulse the granulated sugar and 1/3 cup dried cranberries in a food processor until finely ground.

Toss pears with the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Set aside to cool, then skim the white foam off the surface and discard. Spoon the melted butter into a bowl, leaving behind the solids at the bottom of the saucepan. Heat 2 tablespoons of the reserved butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pear mixture and cook until pears start to give off juices. Add cranberries, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until pears are crisp-tender, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 2 tablespoons of the bread crumbs; cool the mixture slightly. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar with allspice and ginger in a small bowl. Cut a piece of parchment paper slightly longer than the phyllo sheets and lay it with a long edge parallel to you. Set the stack of phyllo sheets beside it and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Transfer one sheet of phyllo to the parchment with a long edge facing you. Brush with some reserved butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon each of the nuts and sugar mixture. Repeat with each remaining phyllo, replacing the towel as you work. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons bread crumbs over top sheet of phyllo. Spoon the pear mixture across the phyllo about 1 inch from the edge closest to you to make a mound, with a 2-inch border at each end. Using the parchment to help you get started, roll the phyllo tightly over the filling to make a log, seam-side down. Lift the parchment with the strudel onto a baking sheet. Bake until golden, about 30 minutes. Transfer on the baking sheet to a rack to cool. Trim ends with a serrated knife. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm or at room temperature with creme fraiche or whipped cream, if desired. Style: Cut the strudel into thirds, then cut each one of the pieces in half on an angle. This way, you get beautiful portions that stand at attention, showing off the layers and the filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 48281,&quot;Beer-Poached Blue Crabs with Sweet &#39;n&#39; Savory Coleslaw Six 12-ounce bottles pale lager beer 4 tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning<br> 4 bay leaves<br> 10 whole black peppercorns<br> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 12 blue crabs (preferably male)<br> Sweet &#39;n&#39; Savory Coleslaw, optional, for serving, recipe follows 3/4 cup mayonnaise, or to taste 2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 3 cups peeled and shredded carrots<br> One 3-pound head of green cabbage, shredded<br> 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions, green part only<br> 1/4 teaspoon celery seed<br> Instructions: In a large pot on high heat, combine all the ingredients, except the crabs, and bring to a boil.

Break the eggs into tall glass or frappe cup and whisk to blend for 1 minute. (The Waffle House uses a 15,000 rpm malt shop mixer.) While moving the skillet in a circular motion, pour in the eggs. Continue to move the skillet in a circular motion, allowing the outside of the eggs to cook and fluff up. When the outside edges have firmly cooked, flip the omelet and cook on the other side for approximately 30 seconds. Keep moving the pan in a circular motion, but not as often as before it was flipped. (Too much movement at this time will cause the omelet to fall.) Flip the omelet once more to finish cooking--no more than 30 additional seconds. Overlap 2 slices of American cheese in the center of the omelet in a diamond shape. Fold the omelet in half, being certain to cover the cheese slices, and slide it onto your plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 48283,&quot;Falconetti&#39;s Chicken Thai Sausage 3 teaspoons ground white pepper 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 cup mild curry powder 1/4 cup Thai basil leaves, chopped 6 tablespoons salt 4 teaspoons garlic granules 29 to 32 mm hog casings 10 pounds boneless chicken leg and thigh, skin on 1 can coconut milk 3 teaspoons lime juice 2 teaspoons sesame oil<br> Instructions: Grind the chicken, preferably with a coarse grind. Add 1 cup water, the coconut milk, lime juice and sesame oil to the meat and incorporate. Then add the curry powder, basil, salt, garlic granules, white pepper, coriander and chili powder, and mix into the meat thoroughly. Mix just enough as not to break down the meat. Stuff into the hog casings, and remember to pin prick the links when done. You can grill, broil, saute, or bake...just make sure it reaches a safe internal temperature of 165 degrees F. One way to enjoy is to place in a hot dog bun, add Asian slaw with some hoisin and sriracha (Thai hot sauce). Alternatively, instead of stuffing the meat mixture, you can saute it and use in such recipes as Asian-style lettuce wraps.

Add the butter; cook the carrots, onion, celery, and garlic for 10 minutes or until caramelized. Add tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes. De-glaze with red wine. Reduce down by half and add duck stock, canela, star anise, and bay leaves. Cook for 30 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by 2/3. At this point, add the thyme and the tamarind paste. Cook for 5 minutes then strain sauce through a fine mesh sieve. Heat a saute pan large enough to hold the two duck breasts. Season the duck breast with salt and pepper. Add it to the pan skin side down, and sear for 3 minutes. Place the pan in a preheated 400 degree oven for 5 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the duck is 145 degrees. Place 2 tablespoons of tamarind sauce on a plate. Slice the duck breasts on a bias and put on the plate, on top of the tamarind sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Rioja]&quot; 48320,&quot;Sugar Cookie Cut-Out 6 tablespoons soft unsalted butter 1/2 cup sugar 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 to 3 tablespoons just-boiled water 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted Food coloring, preferably pastes Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale and moving towards moussiness, then beat in the egg and vanilla. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the butter and eggs, and mix gently but surely. If you think the finished mixture is too sticky to be rolled out, add more flour, but do so sparingly as too much will make the dough tough. Form into a fat disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Sprinkle a suitable surface with flour, place disk of dough on it, and sprinkle a little more flour on top of that. Then roll it out to a thickness of about 1/4-inch. Cut into shapes, dipping the cutter into flour as you go, and place the cookies a little apart on 2 parchment or silpat lined baking sheets. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes; obviously it depends on the shape you&#39;re using and whether they are on the upper or lower shelf, though you can swap them around after about 5 minutes. When they&#39;re ready expect them to be tinged a pronounced gold around the edges; they&#39;ll be softish still in the middle, but set while they cool. Remove the cookies with a flat, preferably flexible, spatula to a wire rack. When they are fully cooled, you can get on with the icing. Put a couple of tablespoons of not-quite-boiling water into a large bowl, add the sieved confectioners sugar and mix together, adding more water as you need to form a thick paste. Color,as desired. I think pastes are much better than liquid, not just because the range of colors is better but because they don&#39;t dilute the icing as they tint. Ice cooled cookies, as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 48321,&quot;Caponata 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/3 cup black olives, pitted and chopped 1 medium eggplant, peeled and diced 1/2 cup chopped red onion 1/4 cup parsley 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 2 large tomatoes, diced Salt Pepper Instructions: Heat oil in large non-stick skillet over medium high heat.

Set aside. Make the basting sauce:<br> Combine the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, lemon juice, and pepper with 1 1/2 cups water in a nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Make the dipping sauce:<br> Combine the Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, brown sugar, pepper, coarse and onion salts, garlic powder, MSG, if using, allspice, and 2 cups water in a large nonreactive saucepan, bring to a boil over high heat, and cook until richly flavored and slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a nonreactive serving bowl to cool. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium-low. If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to medium, then toss 1 cup of the wood chips or chunks on the coals. If using a gas grill, place all of the wood chips or chunks in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and run the grill on high until you see smoke, then reduce the heat to medium.<br> When ready to cook, place the mutton, fat side up, in the center of the hot grate, over the drip pan and away from the heat, and cover the grill. Cook the mutton until it is fall-off-the-bone tender, 4 to 6 hours. To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the mutton but not touching the bone: The internal temperature should be about 190 degrees F. Baste the mutton with the basting sauce every half hour. If the mutton starts to burn, cover it loosely with aluminum foil. If using a charcoal grill, every hour you&#39;ll need to add 12 fresh coals and 1/2 cup of the wood chips or chunks to each side. Transfer the grilled mutton to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes. Slice the mutton thinly across the grain or finely chop it with a cleaver. Spoon half of the dipping sauce over the meat. Serve the mutton on toasted or grilled hamburger buns or slices of white bread or all by itself, passing the remaining dipping sauce on the side. Variation: You can substitute a 5- pound leg of lamb for the mutton. The cooking time will be closer to 4 hours. To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the leg but not touching the bone: The internal temperature should be about 190 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 48323,&quot;Orange Ginger Squash Soup with Sesame Crusted Crab Cake 3 large butternut squash, peeled, halved, seeded, cut into 2-inch cubes 2 tablespoons canola oil 3 medium onions, chopped 4 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 3 garlic cloves, sliced 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 2 quarts chicken stock plus water to cover Salt and pepper, to taste 1 orange, zested 3 pounds lump crabmeat, picked over 3 eggs, beaten 3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 3 small scallions, finely chopped 3 tablespoons dry sherry 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 1/3 cups mayonnaise Salt and pepper, to taste 3 cups lightly toasted sesame seeds 2 cups canola oil, for frying Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Put the rice flour on a plate and season it well with salt and pepper; dredge the fish pieces in the rice flour, shaking off any excess. In a deep pot or a wok large enough to hold the fish, heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees F. Carefully put in the fish and deep-fry until it is browned, crisp, and cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the fish pieces and drain them on paper towels; place them onto a platter. Carefully drain all but 3 tablespoons of oil from the wok. Stir-fry the scallions, ginger, garlic, and chiles for about 2 minutes. Add the black beans and fry for another minute. Pour in the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and simmer until the sauce begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water making sure to get out all the lumps. Pour this slurry into the black bean mixture (it will thicken immediately) and cook for another 2 minutes. Pour the sauce over the fish pieces, garnish with cilantro leaves, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 48329,&quot;Bone Marrow Panna Cotta 6 (6- to 7-inch) canoe-cut marrow bones 1 1/4 teaspoons (4 grams) powdered gelatin<br> 1 tablespoon (15 ml) cold water<br> 1 3/4 cups (414 ml) half-and-half<br> 3 tablespoons (45 grams) sugar<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons (5 grams) kosher salt<br> 1 cup (30 grams) cornflakes<br> Pinch smoked sea salt or additional kosher salt<br> 6 high-quality maraschino cherries Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and place a rack in the center position. Place the bones cut-side down on a half sheet pan. Cover with a generous layer of aluminum foil, then use your hands to mold the foil around the bones and sides of the pan. Place a second half sheet pan on top of the foil, then flip the whole apparatus over. Remove the sheet pan that is now on top to reveal the bones, cut-side up and nestled in foil. Bake until the marrow has just softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and rest until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Scoop the marrow out of the bones and into a 2-quart saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and cook, breaking up large pieces of marrow with a wooden spoon, until all of the marrow has rendered, 10 to 15 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a heat-proof jar or liquid measuring cup. Measure out 1/2 cup of the rendered marrow, reserving the remainder for another use, such as roasting potatoes. Clean the saucepan; you\u2019ll need it again. In a small bowl, stir together the gelatin and water and set aside to bloom for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, add the half-and-half, sugar, and kosher salt to the saucepan and place over medium-low heat until the mixture reaches between 160 to 170 degrees F, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender and add the gelatin. Blend on low speed until the gelatin is dissolved, about 30 seconds. Add 6 tablespoons of the reserved rendered marrow to the blender, saving the remaining 2 tablespoons for the topping. Blend on medium speed for 1 minute, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup or bowl. Divide the mixture between six 4-ounce silicone molds, small bowls, 4-ounce glass jars, or teacups. Cover and refrigerate until the panna cottas are set, at least 5 hours. For the topping: Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons marrow in a skillet over medium heat. When the marrow is shimmering, add the cornflakes and cook, stirring frequently, until they turn golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the smoked salt. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and cool. Transfer the cornflakes to a gallon-size zip-top bag and seal. Use a rolling pin to crush the flakes to form small flakes. Set aside for serving. When ready to serve, remove the panna cottas from the fridge and uncover. Top with the crushed cornflakes and a cherry. If you\u2019d like to turn the panna cotta out onto a plate, top with a small plate, flip over, then gently push on the bottom of the mold to dislodge. Top and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48330,&quot;Classic American Potato Salad 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 3 large eggs 1 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sour cream 1/3 cup chopped dill pickles, plus 2 tablespoons brine 2 tablespoons yellow mustard 1/2 teaspoon sugar 3 stalks celery, chopped 4 scallions, thinly sliced 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Paprika, for topping Instructions: Put the potatoes in a large saucepan; cover with cold water and season with 1 teaspoon salt.

Using a mandoline, slice the sunchokes into 1/8-inch-thin slices and place in the bowl of acidulated water immediately to prevent them from turning brown. Once they are all sliced, rinse thoroughly under cold running water, then drain and spread out on kitchen towels to dry. Place another towel on top and squeeze out any moisture. In a large cast-iron pan, add 1 inch oil along with the fresh herbs and sliced garlic. Place over medium heat and slowly bring the oil temp to 350 degrees F. (As the oil heats up, the herbs and garlic will fry and infuse the oil.) Cook until crispy and lightly golden, then use a slotted spoon to remove to a paper-towel lined tray. Working in small batches, fry the sunchoke chips until lightly golden and crispy, about 4 minutes per batch. Remove from the oil, then drain and season lightly with salt. When all the sunchokes are fried, sprinkle the fried herbs and garlic over the top. For the lemon pepper aioli: In a small skillet, lightly toast the pink and black peppercorns over medium heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place in a spice grinder and pulse until coarsely ground. In a bowl, combine the ground peppers with the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon zest and juice, then season with salt and stir well.

Soak the fish in a large bowl of water for 24 hours, changing the water 3 times. Drain the fish, remove any bones and set aside (see Cook&#39;s Note). Heat the oil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Then add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the adobo, oregano and black pepper and toss with the onions. Add the bell peppers, cover and cook just until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic paste, tomato sauce and vegetable broth. Cover and cook until the vegetables soften and absorb flavor from the broth, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the fish and nestle into the guisado. Decrease the heat to low, cover and cook until the fish is completely coated with the guisado and heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Flake the fish with a fork to incorporate it into the guisado without completely breaking apart the fish. Taste and season with salt, if necessary. Add the thyme, scallions and cilantro. Keep warm while you make the ?oqui. For the sweet plantain ?oqui: Bring a large pot with enough water to cover the plantains to a boil. Add the plantains, cover and cook over medium heat until fork tender but not falling apart, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the plantains to a wire rack to cool for 3 to 4 minutes. Halve each plantain lengthwise and, using a 1/4 teaspoon measure or small spoon, scoop out the seeds as best you can and discard them. Place the plantains, 3 tablespoons of the butter, the egg yolks, brown sugar, nutmeg, lemon zest and salt in a food processor. Pulse until thoroughly combined. Add 1/2 cup of the flour and process until a very loose but sticky dough forms. Transfer to a heavily floured work surface. If the dough feels too loose, fold in 1 to 2 more tablespoons of flour. Divide the dough into 1-tablespoon portions. Flour your hands or gloves and shape each portion into a ball. Place the remaining 1/2 cup flour in a small bowl, for dredging the ?oqui. Toss and roll each ball in the flour, shaking off the excess, then transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Fill the large pot with 2 quarts water and bring to a boil. Cook half of the ?oqui, stirring gently once added, until they float, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the wire rack with a slotted spoon and let drain for about 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining ?oqui. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a medium to large saut pan over low to medium heat. Add the first batch of boiled ?oqui and cook until browned and seared, lowering the heat as needed to avoid burning, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the second batch of boiled ?oqui. For serving: Nestle some of the ?oqui with its brown butter sauce into a bowl of salted fish guisado criollo. Sprinkle with some of the zest and drizzle with your favorite hot sauce, if you like it spicy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 48341,&quot;Quick and Healthy Tandoori Chicken 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds total) 2 cups plain low-fat yogurt 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon curry powder 2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger 1 clove garlic, finely grated Kosher salt 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro Rice and roasted cauliflower, for serving, optional Instructions: Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound them to just under 1/2 inch thick all over.

Next, dip your clean, dry fingers in the bowl of dark chocolate and use them to spread the chocolate over the drizzles, creating a marbled effect. Dipping your fingers in chocolate coats them and makes it easier to create the marble pattern. You can use a plastic glove if you prefer. When the sheet is marbleized, add a ladleful of dark chocolate to the sheet and, using an offset spatula, spread it to create a 1/4-inch layer. Be sure to spread it all the way to the edges. Lift the chocolate-covered paper by its corners and move it to a clean space on your work surface. Let the chocolate set slightly, 4 to 5 minutes, until firm but not hard. Using the tip of a sharp paring knife or X-Acto knife, cut 1 bottom piece and 2 side pieces. A box of any size can be made using this method, however, if you make a 5 1/2-by-8 1/2-inch base, cut 2 strips that are 1 1/2-by-8 1/2 inches long. Repeat the process a second time to create the top and 2 strips for the shorter sides that are 1 1/2-by-5-inches long. Remove the acetate from each piece of chocolate. The shiny side should face up or toward the outside. Place the base on the work surface in front of you. Use chocolate to \glue\ the sides of the box in place. Allow the chocolate to set then fill the box with bon-bons. Set the top of the box in place. For the Chocolate Ribbon: Mix the cocoa butter and the powdered food coloring together to make chocolate paints. Place a sheet of acetate lengthwise on the work surface in front of you. Using a paintbrush, cover the surface with a thin layer of your choice of paints. When the paint has set, use an offset spatula to spread some white chocolate over the color to create a very thin layer, about 1/16-inch. Use the back of a paring knife to score the chocolate in lengthwise strips that are approximately 2-inches wide. Score across the middle of the sheet horizontally. When the chocolate begins to set, fold each short side of the sheet to the center so that the ends meet but do not overlap. Tape this closed and allow the chocolate to set completely. When set, untape and remove acetate. Break the strips along the scored lines. Assemble the ribbon using chocolate to \glue\ the pieces in place on top of the box.; Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.

At 235 degrees F wash down the side of the pan with a brush soaked in water to remove sugar crystals. Pour the cooked batch into a mixing bowl and let it cool to 110 degrees F. If sugar crystals form on top of the batch as it is cooling, sprinkle the sugar crystals lightly with water to dissolve. Melt the butter. When the sugar mixture reaches 110 degrees F, start the mixer on slow speed and add the flour and butter. Continue mixing until batch becomes semi-firm. Pour batch onto a table (previously sprinkled with flour). Dip hands into flour and knead batch until it is soft and creamy. Take small sections of the batch and roll it into a 1-inch diameter tube. Cut the tube with a butter knife into bite size pieces. Roll each piece and place on waxed paper. Keep at room temperature (65 to 75 degrees F) for 4 to 24 hours. Coat the pieces with chocolate. The coated vanilla butter creams may be eaten after another 24 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 48348,&quot;Veal Scaloppini with Wine, Mushroom and Green Olive 3/4 pound linguini 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 4 turns of the pan, plus some for drizzling 3 slices pancetta or bacon, chopped 1 small onion, chopped 16 crimini mushrooms or button mushrooms, chopped 1 pound veal scaloppini, cut into 1-inch strips Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1 cup dry white wine 16 pitted, large green olives, coarsely chopped A handful chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley 1 tablespoon butter, cut into pieces 1/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano, a couple of handfuls Instructions: Place pasta water on to boil and cook linguini 8 minutes, to al dente in salted water.

Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar twice, making a cross, to moisten it. Over medium-high heat, bring to a boil without stirring. Reduce the heat to a fast simmer and cook without stirring until amber-caramel in color, 5 to 10 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat. Meanwhile, set a 9-inch cake pan nearby. When the caramel is cooked, quickly pour into the cake pan and swirl to coat the sides. Set aside to cool. In a saucepan, bring the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, additional egg yolks, and the remaining 1 cup sugar. Whisk about 1/2 cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture. Whisk the remaining hot milk into the egg mixture. Strain the mixture into a pitcher to smooth it and to remove the vanilla. Pour the mixture into the caramel-lined cake pan and place in a hot water bath. Bake in the center of the oven until dry and set in the center, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the water bath and let cool. Refrigerate at least 4 hours. (Or refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 24 hours.) Turn out onto a serving platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]</p><p>&quot; 48355,&quot;Grilled Halibut with Olive Bagna Cauda 1/4 cup olive oil 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 2 teaspoons anchovy paste<br> 2 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled<br> 1/3 cup pitted mixed olives, chopped 1/4 cup teardrop tomatoes, halved<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley Four 6-ounce skinless halibut fillets 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 teaspoons olive oil<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high.

Coat the chops generously with spice rub and let marinate for up to 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. Let refrigerated meat come to room temperature before cooking. Scrape off any excess rub and pat the chops dry. In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over high heat. When the pan is hot enough to sear the chops but not burn them, add the chops. They should make a gentle hissing sound when they hit the pan, not an explosive sputter. Adjust the heat if the pan seems too hot or remove the pan from the heat for 30 seconds or so (count this time as part of the overall cooking time). Sear the chops on one side for 1 to 2 minutes, or until beginning to brown lightly. Turn the chops over and sear for 1 minute more. Reduce the heat so that the chops continue to sizzle -- do not turn the heat so low that there are no more sizzling sounds (if the heat is too low, the chops will sweat and juices will exude from the meat and leave it dry. Cover the pan and cook for 3 to 4 more minutes more on the other side. The chops are done when the meat is firm but not hard when pressed with a finger. Better still, test them with an instant-read thermometer -- the meat should register 145 to 155 degrees and will still be acceptable at 160 degrees. For the juiciest results, remove the chops from the pan when they register 145 degrees, cover loosely with foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes or so before serving, to stabilize the juices. To make the pan sauce: pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan, leaving any meat juices. Adjust the heat to medium and add garlic. Stir, cook for 30 seconds, then add remaining ingredients, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring the sauce to a boil and reduce it over high heat until it just turns syrupy. Put the pork chops back into the pan and turn them several times in the sauce to transfer the flavors -- this should take no more than 30 seconds. Serve chops with sauce &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48362,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Easy Peanut Butter Cookie Waffle Ice Cream Sandwiches 2 1/2 cups \just add water\ pancake mix 2 large egg whites, whisked to medium peaks<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the waffle iron 2 cups chopped Do-si-dos? or Peanut Butter Sandwich cookies (about 16 cookies) 1 quart chocolate ice cream, softened<br> Chopped unsalted peanuts, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat a square waffle iron. In a large bowl, add the pancake mix and just enough water to make the batter slightly stiffer than pancake batter. Gently fold in the egg whites. Spray the bottom and top of the waffle iron with cooking spray and immediately pour half of the batter onto the iron, starting at the center and moving to the edges. Spread the batter to the edges and sprinkle on about half of the chopped cookies, then close the iron without pressing too hard. Cook until the top is golden and a peek beneath reveals a golden crust as well, about 7 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Spray the iron again and repeat with the remaining batter and cookies. When cooled, separate the waffle sections into 4 pieces. Make the sandwiches by scooping ice cream onto one waffle square, then pressing another waffle square on top. Cut the sandwiches in half and press each edge into the chopped peanuts. If the ice cream is too soft, freeze the sandwiches until set.

Toss the ceviche and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate. For the poblano shooter: Place the poblanos over a gas flame (or on a grill) and char until blistered on all sides, turning frequently, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, to a large pot, add the almond milk, potatoes, makrut lime leaves, bay leaves, achiote paste, curry paste, cumin, red pepper flakes, turmeric and some salt and pepper. Once the poblanos are charred, scrape away the skins, cut away the seeds and then add them to the pot. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender. Add a little more salt and pepper, then remove bay leaves and the makrut lime leaves. Transfer the contents of the pot to a blender; blend until smooth. Strain into a large bowl.

Crush with the pestle if using the mortar or a rolling pin or hammer if using the bag or paper. Transfer the crushed spices to a small saucepan. Add the bay leaves, cloves, salt, vinegar, wine, and onion slices and bring to a boil. Transfer the marinade to a large bowl and let cool to room temperature. (I prefer a glass or stainless steel bowl. Whatever you use, don&#39;t use plastic: the acidic marinade will absorb flavors from plastic.)<br> Tying and marinating the meat: Using kitchen string, tie the beef into a neat, compact shape. As soon as the marinade is cool, add the beef to the bowl and roll in the marinade to coat all sides. Cover, refrigerate and marinate for 2 to 3 days, turning the meat once or twice a day. (There is no special timing here for turning the beef in the marinade. You just want to make sure that over the course of the 48 or 72 hours, the meat is turned 3 or 4 times so it marinates evenly.) Heat the oven to 300 degrees F.<br> Browning the meat: With tongs, lift the meat out of the marinade, scraping any onion slices or spices that stick to the meat back into the marinade, and transfer it to a plate. Reserve the marinade. Pat the meat thoroughly dry all over with paper towels. Heat the butter and oil in a large Dutch oven or other braising pot over medium heat. Add the meat to the pot and brown well on all sides, 20 to 25 minutes total. (You may need 2 implements to turn the meat: try tongs and a large metal spatula. Lift the meat from the pan with the spatula, grab with the tongs, and turn.) Transfer the meat back to the plate. Pour off all the fat from the pan, and deglaze the pan with the reserved marinade, scraping any browned bits to loosen. Bring the marinade to a simmer and add the meat. Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so it nearly touches the meat and the edges of the paper hang over the sides of the pot by about 1-inch. Set the lid firmly in place, and transfer to the lower third of the oven.<br> The braise: Braise the meat at a gentle simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Check after about the first 10 minutes to see that the liquid is not simmering too energetically; if it is, lower the oven by 10 to 15 degrees. After 1 1/2 hours, turn the meat over, using the tongs, and metal spatula, and continue braising gently for another 1 1/2 hours, or until fork-tender.<br> The finish: With the tongs and metal spatula, transfer the meat to a cutting board with a moat and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Strain the cooking juices into a saucepan and let sit for a minute. Gently tilt the pan and skim off the fat with a large spoon. Whisk in the gingersnap crumbs and sugar, place the pan over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Gently boil the sauce for 5 minutes, whisking often, to reduce and thicken it slightly. Lower the heat to low and whisk in the sour cream until smooth. Heat through, but do not let the sauce boil, or the sour cream will curdle. Taste the sauce for salt.<br> Serving: Remove the strings from the meat, and pour any accumulated juices into the sauce. Carve the beef into thick slices.

Combine the onions, flour, panko and salt in a large mixing bowl and toss to combine. Coat a sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray and evenly spread the onions on the pan. Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes. Toss the onions 2 to 3 times during cooking. Once done, remove from the oven and set aside until ready to use. Turn the oven down to 400 degrees F. While the onions are cooking, prepare the beans. Bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil in an 8-quart saucepan. Add the beans and blanch for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately plunge the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside. Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to give up some of their liquid, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute.

Blend the cream cheese into the pudding, mixing thoroughly to remove any lumps. Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese-pudding mixture. Spread a third of the graham cracker crumbs into an even layer in a low-sided clear bowl. Pour half of the pudding over the crumbs and spread until it reaches the sides of the bowl using an offset spatula. Repeat this process once, setting the remaining third of the graham cracker crumbs aside. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the pudding and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Remove and discard the plastic wrap. Following the edge of the bowl, create a 1 1/2-inch border of blue sparkle gel around the edge of of the pudding. Use a small offset spatula to gently spread the blue sparkle gel, creating the look and texture of ocean waves. Cover the remaining exposed pudding by piling the reserved graham cracker crumbs on top, mounding in the center, to resemble an island in the ocean. Cut the sour candy belts into small rectangles to resemble beach towels and place them around the cake with the bear crackers on top of each one. Place a few bear crackers inside peach candy rings (to look like inner tubes) and place them in the blue sparkle gel so that they appear to be bobbing in the water. To make the palm trees: Insert a mint stem into each wafer cookie, pushing down until the leaves meet the top of the cookie. Gently press into the center of the graham cracker crumb island. To make the candy crab: Use scissors to snip a small triangle out of the rounded side of a cherry slice, positioning it close to the flat side, to look like a claw. Snip a small notch out of the opposite side along the curve, to fashion the arm that the claw is attached to. Repeat this process with a second cherry slice. Insert a toothpick lengthwise into each arm and set aside. Prepare the crab body by holding the rounded sides of 2 cherry slices together back to back. Secure together using 2 toothpicks, being sure to push the toothpicks deep enough so they are only exposed on top. To make the eyes, use a dab of blue sparkle gel to attach an eyeball to the bottom of each gumdrop. Secure the gumdrops on the toothpicks sticking out of the crab body. Push the claw toothpicks into the sides of the crab body. Bury the bottom half of the crab body in the graham cracker crumb sand. Sprinkle the island with sanding sugars where the ocean meets the graham cracker crumbs. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 48385,&quot;Peanut Butter-Banana English Muffin Sandwich 2 tablespoons natural, unsweetened peanut butter 1 light, whole-grain English muffin, toasted 1 strawberry, diced 1/2 banana, sliced 1 tablespoon honey Instructions: Spread the peanut butter onto the muffin and top with the strawberry and banana slices.

Slice the cloves in half lengthwise and then smash with the side of a chef&#39;s knife. Sprinkle the salt over the garlic and chop and smear the garlic against the cutting board until it makes a paste. (This can also be done using a mortar pestle; smash the garlic halves before placing them in the mortar.) Put the garlic paste in a small bowl and mix in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Put the meat in a baking pan and prick it all over with a fork or metal skewer. Evenly rub the garlic paste on the meat. Marinate at room temperature for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Scrape as much of the garlic paste off the meat as possible so it does not burn in the oven. Heat a large oven-safe skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Pour in 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and sear the beef until browned on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes total. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook the roast for about 35 minutes for medium and up to 45 minutes for medium-well. (remember that the roast will continue to cook while resting outside of the oven, so it&#39;s best to remove the roast from the oven when it&#39;s slightly underdone). Check the color of the roast by making a small slit in the thickest part to check the color (remember that the meat on the edges of the roast will be more well done) or use a digital thermometer to check its temperature (128 to 129 degrees F for medium-rare). Remove the roast from the oven, cover with foil, and set aside to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. While the roast rests, preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Alternately thread the cherry tomatoes and pearl onions onto wood or metal skewers. (If using an outdoor grill, soak the wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning.) Brush the tomatoes and onions with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Lay the vegetable skewers on the grill pan and char on both sides. Serve on a platter alongside the sliced beef. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 48391,&quot;Pink Sunrise Cocktails 2 shots Campari liqueur 1 quart red grapefruit juice 1 bottle dry Champagne Instructions: Add half a shot of Campari to a champagne flute.

Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat. Set aside to marinate while you prepare the vegetables (or marinate in the fridge for up to 1 day). Assemble the chicken and vegetables: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a half sheet pan or 2 quarter sheet pants with foil and coat with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Peel the potatoes if you wish and cut into approximately 3/4-inch chunks. Cut the cauliflower into about 1-inch florets. Cut the onion half into eight thin wedges. Spread the vegetables on the prepared sheet pan and, using your hands, toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil, the thyme, and plenty of salt and pepper. Scatter the olives over the vegetables and the chorizo, if using. Make spaces throughout the pan of vegetables and add the chicken pieces, skin-side up. Bake for 30 minutes, at which point check the tray and toss the potatoes and cauliflower to ensure they&#39;re cooking evenly, then return to the oven to bake for another 10 to 20 minutes, or until the chicken and vegetables are cooked through To finish: Toss the pepper strips together with the vinegar, salt, and sugar, and set aside to marinate until needed.

Pulse the shortbread cookies in a food processor until finely ground, then add the butter and 2 tablespoons sugar and pulse until combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan and freeze until solid, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, spray three 9-by-5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray and line with plastic wrap so that there is at least a 3-inch overhang on each side; spray the plastic wrap with cooking spray. Mix 2 packets gelatin into 1/2 cup cold water in a medium microwave-safe bowl until combined and let sit for 5 minutes to bloom; the mixture will get very stiff. Microwave on high power for 20 seconds, then stir to combine. Continue to heat and stir in 20-second intervals until the gelatin is completely dissolved, then stir in the red wine and 1/2 cup sugar until the gelatin is incorporated and the sugar is completely dissolved. Pour into one prepared pan. Repeat the process with the rose and white wines, respectively, then refrigerate all the pans until completely set, about 3 hours.<br> Meanwhile, mix the remaining 4 packets gelatin into 1 cup cold water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.

Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat, and cook the potatoes gently until they are just tender and can be pierced with a sharp knife. Drain immediately and let cool slightly. (Scrape the skin from the cooked potatoes, if you want, as soon as they can be handled. For a decorative look with fingerlings, scrape off only a band of skin, about 1/2 inch thick, all around the long sides of the potato.) Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a small saute pan. When hot, add the scallions and the onion, toss to coat well, and cook for about a minute over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, toss to mix, and cook for just a few moments, then remove the pan from the heat. Slice the potatoes while still warm, cutting them crosswise into 1/2-inch sections. Put the pieces in a large mixing bowl, pour the wine and 3 or 4 tablespoons of olive oil over them, and toss gently to distribute. Add the warm vegetables from the pan, mustard, chives, chopped herbs, salt, and pepper, and gently fold all together, mixing well but not crushing the potatoes. Taste the salad and add more seasonings as you like. Serve the potatoes warm (no colder than room temperature). Arrange the large radicchio leaves, if you have them, in a close circle on the serving platter, with their curved insides up, to form a rough bowl. Spoon the potato salad inside the leaves, sprinkle chopped egg around the edges, and parsley over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 48401,&quot;Shrimp, Potato, and Cheese Tortilla 2 slices smoked bacon 1 medium russet potato, scrubbed and diced 1 1 ?2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 ?2 teaspoon hot paprika 1/2 teaspoon dried basil 24 medium shrimp, peeled and de-veined 8 large eggs 1/4 cup milk Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup shredded Manchego or Parmesan (about 3 ounces) 1/4 cup jarred roasted red pepper Garnish with grated Parmesan and chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Position a rack about 6 inches from the broiler and preheat.

Spread the bread crumbs evenly on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Watch them carefully as they burn very quickly. Remove from the oven and cool. Raise the oven to 500 degrees F. Butterfly the shrimp by slicing from the tail to the front on the top of the shrimp, where the vein was. Slice as deep as possible without cutting all the way through. Turn the shrimp over and make 3 small shallow slits horizontally across the shrimp, being careful not to cut all the way through. These slits will prevent the shrimp from curling during cooking. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Mix together the oregano, thyme, parsley, basil and garlic. Add the garlic herb mixture to the bread crumbs and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Brush a large ovenproof skillet with some of the melted butter, coating the bottom well. Dip the shrimp in the butter, opened side down, and then dredge in the bread crumbs, pressing so they stick. Place the shrimp, bread crumb side up, in the skillet in 1 layer. When all of the shrimp are in the pan, drizzle the top with a little more of the melted butter. Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the shrimp are just cooked through and the bread crumbs are golden brown. Toss the arugula with the olive oil and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Divide the arugula among 4 plates. Place 4 shrimp around each pile of arugula. Drizzle with more butter, if desired, and serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 48425,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Red Velvet Trifle Parfait One 15.25-ounce box red velvet cake mix Melted butter, for the cake One 8-ounce container whipped topping<br> One 12-ounce container whipped cream cheese frosting<br> 1/4 cup candied pecans, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup candied walnuts, coarsely chopped<br> Instructions: Prepare the red velvet cake according to package instructions, substituting melted butter for the oil.

Place in the refrigerator to steep for 18 to 24 hours. Meanwhile, for the maple oat milk: Combine the oats, water, 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, vanilla and salt in a blender. Blend on high for 20 to 30 seconds, or until smooth and creamy. Do not process for over 30 seconds as that may cause the oats to give up too much starch, which will change the texture. Strain the oat milk once through a fine mesh sieve and then a second time through the same sieve lined with cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the milk to slowly strain through the towel, gently stirring if needed. Avoid pressing or squeezing the oat milk to maintain the proper texture. Adjust the sweetness of the oat milk with another 1 or 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, if desired. Transfer to a jar or bottle and place in the fridge until ready to use. When the coffee is brewed, strain it through a fine mesh sieve to remove most of the coffee grounds. Line the sieve with a few layers of cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel and pour the cold brew through the lined sieve one or two more times to remove any remaining grounds. Serve the cold brew over ice and pour over some maple oat milk to taste, leaving any oat milk sediment at the bottom of its container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 48431,&quot;Stuffed Catfish topped with Garlic Butter and Grilled Asparagus Spears and Sweet Potatoes 1 red onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, chopped Olive oil, for sauteing 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 2 tablespoons capers 4 catfish fillets Garlic Butter Sauce, recipe follows Grilled Asparagus Spears, recipe follows Sweet Potatoes, recipe follows 4 tablespoons butter 1 lemon, juiced 2 cloves garlic, minced 6 ounces dark wheat beer 1 cup chicken stock Salt and freshly ground pepper 10 to 12 asparagus spears, trimmed Vegetable oil, for sauteing Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 sweet potatoes, scrubbed Vegetable oil, for grilling Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a medium skillet, saute the onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat.

Season with salt, toss in the bay leaves and bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the baby octopus and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from the liquid and let cool. (This part can sooooooo be done ahead.) To prep the salad: Coat a large straight-sided saute pan with olive oil, toss in the onions, season with salt and crushed red pepper. Bring the pan to a medium heat and cook the onions until they start to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Toss in the beans, chicken stock and celery and cook until the stock has reduced by a little more than half. Turn off the heat and reserve the bean mixture. Preheat the grill. Cut the heads off the octopus and cut the legs into sections of 2 legs. Oil the legs and place them on the grill to slightly char and heat up the octopus. In a large bowl, toss the arugula and celery leaves with the lemon juice and olive oil and season with salt. Divide among 4 serving plates and spoon some of the warm bean mixture onto the arugula. Arrange the legs between the plates. Drizzle with big fat finishing oil. Drain the beans from the soaking water and place in a medium saucepan.

Add the lime peel, lemon peel, ginger root, green chiles, and the cilantro stems and roots. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer and cook until reduced to 3 cups. Press occasionally on the solids with a wooden spoon to release flavor. Working with a sharp knife, cut the chicken breasts into broad slices, as thin as possible. Salt lightly, and reserve in refrigerator. When broth is reduced, strain into a measuring cup. Press on the solids in the strainer with a wooden spoon. Place the coconut milk in the soup pot over medium heat. Slowly stir in the reduced broth. Warm rapidly but do not allow to boil (otherwise the coconut milk will separate). When the soup is just below the boiling point, add the chicken slices. Remove from heat after 30 seconds (or when the chicken is just cooked through). Just before serving, mix together the lime juice and sugar in a small bowl. Blend in the fish sauce. Pour mixture into hot soup, season to taste and garnish soup with a little bit of chopped scallion and cilantro leaves. Yield: 6 first-course servings. Optional step: If your soup has curdled a bit, or if you&#39;d like a fluffier texture in the soup, before you add the chicken, place the soup in a blender at high speed for 30 seconds. Then return to pot, add chicken and proceed as before. As an appetizer: Looks lovely served individually in six wide, shallow soup bowls. Great starter for many kinds of meals, not just Thai. As a main course: By doubling the amount of chicken and keeping the same amount of liquid, you convert this soup practically into a stew. The six wide, shallow bowls still work well; place a half-cup of steamed white rice to one side in each bowl, then divide the soup/stew among the bowls. Serve a tomato salad on the side that has been dressed with lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, and topped with chopped peanuts and minced cilantro. If you can get the Thai ingredients: for the lime and lemon peel, substitute 3/8 cup Keffir lime leaves, 2 lemon grass stalks chopped, 3 thick slices dried galanga root. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 48440,&quot;Simple Homemade Granola 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger Salt 3 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons maple syrup 2 tablespoons water 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 cups whole oats (not instant) 1/2 cup chopped pecans 1/2 cup crisped rice cereal 1/4 cup wheat germ or milled flax seed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Add to the salad 1/4 cup chopped olives, 1 tablespoon capers, and/or 2 minced anchovy fillets. For a one-dish meal, grill or broil some shrimp or boneless chicken alongside the bread, then add the chunks to the salad. Or add some leftover or canned tuna (the Italian kind, packed in olive oil) to the mix. Start a gas or charcoal grill or preheat the broiler; the rack should be 4 to 6 inches from the heat source. Cut the bread lengthwise into quarters. Grill or broil the bread, watching carefully and turning as each side browns and chars slightly; total time will be less than 10 minutes. While the bread cools, mix together the next five ingredients in a large bowl. Mash the tomatoes with the back of a fork to release all of their juices. Season to taste with salt and pepper to taste. Cut the bread into 1/2- to 1-inch cubes (no larger) and toss it with the dressing. Let the bread sit for 20 to 30 minutes, tossing occasionally and tasting a piece every now and then. The salad is at its peak when the bread is fairly soft but some edges remain crisp, but you can serve it before or after it reaches that state. When it&#39;s ready, stir in the herb and serve. With MINIMAL Effort: Bread salad is a way of making good use of stale bread. The bread is softened, usually with water, olive oil, lemon juice, or a combination, then tossed with tomatoes and a variety of seasonings. Like many old-fashioned preparations created as a way to salvage food before it goes bad (count pickles and jam among these), bread salad has an appeal of its own. This is especially true in the summer, when good tomatoes are plentiful and may lead to the rather unusual problem of waiting around for bread to become stale. Or, of course, making it stale. I&#39;d always solved this problem by drying bread in the oven until I realized that using the grill or broiler would not only dry the bread more quickly but, by charring the edges slightly, add another dimension of flavor to the salad. This procedure is really the same as making toast--exposing the bread to direct heat (rather than the indirect heat of the oven) to brown it as well as dry it. There&#39;s another benefit to grilling the bread in order to dry it out: The added flavor makes it possible to strip the salad to its bare minimum. This is a substantial salad, but it&#39;s still a side dish unless you&#39;re in the mood for a very light meal. Because it&#39;s juicy, almost saucy, and pleasantly acidic, this salad makes a nice accompaniment to simple grilled meat or poultry, and has a special affinity for dark fish such as tuna and swordfish. The only tricks here involve timing. You must watch the bread carefully as you grill or broil it; a slight char is good, but it&#39;s a short step from there to burned bread. And the time you allow the bread to soften after tossing it with the seasonings varies some; keep tasting until the texture pleases you. If your tomatoes are on the dry side, you might add a little extra liquid, in the form of more olive oil and lemon juice, or a light sprinkling of water. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 48461,&quot;Around the World Fries: Crispy Polenta Poutine 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Two 1-pound tubes prepared polenta<br> 2 tablespoons garlic-herb seasoning Kosher salt<br> 1 yellow onion, diced 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 pound ground turkey One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes 2 tablespoons drained and rinsed capers<br> 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 cups ricotta 1/2 cup fresh basil, thinly sliced into ribbons 1 lemon, zested<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Add the onions, bay leaves, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are very soft and light golden-brown, about 1 hour. (The onions will begin to stick to the bottom of the pan and turn brown after about 30 minutes; just keep scraping them up and stirring them into the rest of the onions. If they are browning to quickly, lower the heat.) Add the wine to the pot, bring to a simmer and cook until it has almost completely evaporated, about 4 minutes. Add the beef broth and 1 cup of water, bring to a simmer and cook until the flavors come together and the soup is rich, about 45 minutes. Remove the bay leaves. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Keep the soup warm on a low burner or cool completely and refrigerate to reheat later.

Zest of 1 lime Juice of 1/2 a lime 2 tablespoons shredded coconut (either fresh or the unsweetened desiccated kind) Coarse sea salt Instructions: Place an 8-inch square baking dish in the freezer to chill while you make the simple syrup. Combine the sugar and 1/2 cup of water in a small saucepan over low heat until the sugar is dissolved and syrup is at a gentle boil. Remove it from the heat, and allow it to cool.. Pull the chilled baking dish out of the freezer, and pour the coconut milk into the dish. You may need to whisk it to smooth out any lumps. Whisk in the simple syrup, lime zest, lime juice and fresh coconut until well combined. Place the dish in the freezer, and let it chill for 1 hour. Pull it out of the freezer, and using a fork, break up the ice crystals forming around the edge of the dish, by dragging them into the more molten center. Return to the freezer and repeat this process every hour or so, smoothing out the granita before you return it to the freezer. The whole process should take about 3 hours. When you&#39;re ready to serve, allow the granita to sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes so that it softens. Spoon the mixture into a small bowl or glass, and top with a little coarse sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Vinho Verde]&quot; 48465,&quot;30-Minute Spicy Pork and Sweet Potato Stew 1 cup canned unsalted diced tomatoes 1 medium white onion, quartered 2 cloves garlic 1/2 chipotle in adobo sauce, plus 1 tablespoon of the sauce 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 large pork tenderloin, trimmed and cut into 1-inch chunks (about 1 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chili powder One 8-ounce sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon pickled jalapenos 1 cup 2 percent Greek yogurt 1/4 medium head red cabbage 1 medium Haas avocado 1 lime 1/2 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro Eight 6-inch corn tortillas, warmed Instructions: Puree the tomatoes, onions, garlic, chipotle and adobo sauce in a food processor until completely smooth.

Cream the butter and sugar together until pale and moving towards moussiness, then beat in the egg and vanilla. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the butter and eggs, and mix gently but surely. If you think the finished mixture is too sticky to be rolled out, add more flour, but do so sparingly as too much will make the dough tough. Form into a fat disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Sprinkle a suitable surface with flour, place disk of dough on it, and sprinkle a little more flour on top of that. Then roll it out to a thickness of about 1/4-inch. Cut into shapes, dipping the cutter into flour as you go, and place the cookies a little apart on 2 parchment or silpat lined baking sheets. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes; obviously it depends on the shape you&#39;re using and whether they are on the upper or lower shelf, though you can swap them around after about 5 minutes. When they&#39;re ready expect them to be tinged a pronounced gold around the edges; they&#39;ll be softish still in the middle, but set while they cool. Remove the cookies with a flat, preferably flexible, spatula to a wire rack. When they are fully cooled, you can get on with the icing. Put a couple of tablespoons of not-quite-boiling water into a large bowl, add the sieved confectioners sugar and mix together, adding more water as you need to form a thick paste. Color,as desired. I think pastes are much better than liquid, not just because the range of colors is better but because they don&#39;t dilute the icing as they tint.

Pour 1 beer into the bottom of the pan and cover the pan with foil, trying not to have the foil touch the meat. Put the ribs in the preheated oven and roast for 2 hours. Check the ribs after 1 hour and turn them over. Add more beer, if needed. Rotate the pan. After 2 hours, remove the foil and roast for 30 minutes more. Remove from the oven and cool. Sauce: (This can be done while the ribs are roasting.) Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. The sauce will not be thick but it should be a homogeneous mixture and very well flavored. Turn off the heat and let cool. Preheat the grill to a medium-high heat. Arrange the ribs, meat side down, on the grill and grill until they start to get a little brown and charred, then brush with the sauce. Turn the ribs over, brush with the sauce and grill for 4 to 5 minutes. Brush with the sauce and again turn the ribs over. Grill for another 4 to 5 minutes. At this point the ribs should be nicely browned and really well flavored. Remove them from the grill to a cutting board. Cut the ribs apart and arrange on a serving platter.

Blend on medium speed for 15 seconds, until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Scrape down the sides of the blender and pour in the melted butter. Blend it again for a few seconds just to incorporate the butter. Refrigerate the batter for 1 hour to let it rest. Make the filling: In a small bowl combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, egg, confectioners&#39; sugar, and zest and blend until smooth. Chill until ready to use. Make the sauce: Combine the strawberries, sugar, water, cornstarch, and zest in a small pot over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and stir gently until the berries release their natural juices. The consistency should remain a bit chunky, it will thicken up when it cools down. Make the crepes: Put an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat and brush with a little melted butter. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the pan and swirl it around so it covers the bottom evenly; pour back any excess. Cook until the crepe batter sets and the bottom is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Use a heatproof rubber spatula to loosen the crepe and flip it. Cook it on the other side for about 1 minute. Slide them onto a plate and continue making the crepes until all the batter is used. Cover the stack with a towel to keep them from drying out. Makes about 10 crepes. Assembly: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spoon 1/4 cup of the cheese filling along the lower third of the crepe. Fold the bottom edge away from you to just cover the filling; then fold the 2 sides in to the center. Roll the crepe away from you a couple of times ending with the seam side down. Put an ovenproof skillet over medium heat and brush with melted butter. Pan-fry the blintzes top side down until crisp and golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip them over, transfer the pan to the oven, and bake for 10 minutes so the cheese mixture sets. Using a spatula, transfer the blintzes to serving plates.

Be sure your stove is well ventilated! Heat a large (10-inch) cast-iron skillet over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes. Pat the filets dry with paper towels and brush all over with the canola oil. Combine the fleur de sel and cracked pepper on a small plate and roll the filets on the top, bottom, and sides in the seasoning, pressing lightly to coat. When the skillet is very hot, add the filets and sear evenly on all sides (top, bottom, and sides) for about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the steaks from the skillet to a sheet pan (set the skillet aside) and place in the oven for 8 to 12 minutes, until the steaks register 120 degrees F on a meat thermometer for medium-rare. Remove from the oven, cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the butter in a medium (10-inch) saute pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 4 to 5 minutes, until they release their juices. Stir in the sherry and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until the mushrooms are cooked through. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and set aside. At the same time, add the olive oil to the skillet (don&#39;t wipe it out), add the shallots, and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the Cognac, stirring to deglaze the skillet, and cook for 2 minutes, until the Cognac evaporates and the shallots are tender. Stir in the cream and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes, until thickened. Stir in the two mustards and taste for seasonings. Remove the strings from the filets and place on 4 warm dinner plates. Spoon the mustard sauce around the filets. Spoon the mushrooms on top of the filets and sprinkle each plate with parsley. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 48507,&quot;Title 1 cup Instructions: ; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 48508,&quot;Chicken Florentine Pasta 1 pound penne Salt 4 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size chunks Ground pepper 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 cloves garlic, minced 3/4 cup low-sodium broth, more if needed 3/4 cup dry white wine 1 bag baby spinach 2 cups grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise 4 ounces Parmesan, shaved with a vegetable peeler, plus more for serving Instructions: Cook the pasta according to package directions in lightly salted water. Drain and set aside. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat the butter and olive oil over high heat in a large skillet. Add the chicken chunks in a single layer and do not stir for a minute or two in order to allow the chicken to brown on the first side. Flip the chicken and brown on the other side. Cook until done, and then remove the chicken from the skillet. Turn the heat to medium. Add the garlic and quickly stir to avoid burning. After about 30 seconds, pour in the broth and wine, stirring to deglaze the skillet. Allow the liquid to bubble up, and then continue cooking until it&#39;s reduced by at least half (most of the surface of the liquid should be bubbling at this point). Turn off the heat. Add the spinach, tomatoes, chicken, cooked pasta and Parmesan shavings to the skillet. Toss to combine; the spinach will wilt as you toss everything. Add more Parmesan shavings and serve immediately! Serve with extra Parmesan shavings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti]&quot; 48509,&quot;Penne Alla Betsy Salt 12 ounces penne pasta 8 ounces large shrimp 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 small onion, finely chopped 1/2 cup white wine, optional Two 14.5-ounce cans tomato sauce<br> 1 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 6 leaves fresh basil, cut in chiffonade Milk, for thinning Freshly ground black pepper Crusty French bread, for serving Instructions: Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the penne until al dente (firm yet tender). Drain and set aside. Begin by peeling and deveining the shrimp and rinsing them under cold water. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. When the pan is hot, add the shrimp. Stir and cook on both sides until just starting to turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Remove to a plate and allow to cool slightly. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the garlic and onion. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour the wine into the pan if using. Stir and allow it to evaporate, about 45 seconds. Pour in the tomato sauce and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low. Pour in the cream. Mmmm. Stir well to combine; reduce the heat to simmer. And now for the fun part: remove the tails from the shrimp, chop the shrimp into medium-size pieces and add them to the sauce. Stir gently to combine. Next, dump in the parsley and basil and stir. Add the cooked, drained pasta. Stir gently to coat. If the sauce is too thick, splash in a little milk to get it to the right consistency. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper. Be sure to taste the seasonings at the end, adjusting if necessary. Serve directly out of the skillet, or pour the contents of the skillet into a pretty serving bowl. Serve with crusty French bread - and more wine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 48510,&quot;Juice of a Few Flowers 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (2 oranges) 1/2 cup freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice (1 grapefruit) 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (1 lemon) 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (2 limes) 1 cup good vodka (recommended: Grey Goose or Finlandia), optional Extra lemon juice Granulated sugar Fresh mint sprigs Instructions: Combine the orange juice, grapefruit juice, lemon juice, lime juice, and vodka, if using, in a pitcher.

Fill rice cooker with water to about 1-inch over rice or use Mt Fuji method. I highly recommend a rice cooker -- there&#39;s a reason more than 2 billion people in Asia use them. Slowly heat vinegar, mirin and sugar until very hot but not boiling. Fold in &#39;su&#39; (vinegar and sugar) with the hot rice, add enough so that the rice has a tart/sweet taste. Rice should be shiny, not mushy. Carefully clean inside rim of bowl with damp cloth, cover and let rest for 30 minutes. In a bowl, whisk together honey, mustard, lemon juice and oil. Add crab, herbs and minced shallot. Season with salt and pepper and check flavor. Lay nori, shiny side down on sushi mat and lightly pat on rice on bottom half of nori, 1/4 inch thick. Place crab filling 2/3 up on rice. Roll, moisten end to seal and let rest. In a bowl, mix flour with togarashi, or chili powder, and whisk in club soda until a pancake batter thickness is achieved. Dip the shrimp and scallions in the tempura batter and fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Lay the nori vertically with the shiny side down. Using wet hands, lightly place a 1/4-inch thick layer of rice on the bottom half of the nori. Place one shrimp and scallion fan diagonally across the rice from the top left corner to the bottom right. Lay daikon sprouts on top and add a touch of wasabi oil. Roll a cone by bringing the bottom left corner of the nori to half way up the right side edge then roll over. Moisten the top edge to glue. Repeat process. In a stainless steel bowl, whisk together wasabi, mirin and sugar. Add water until a loose puree is achieved. Whisk in oil. For extra heat, use less oil. Combine all the ingredients and reduce at a simmer until a syrup consistency is achieved, about a 60 to 70 percent reduction. Let cool. PLATING On a huge white platter, drizzle soy syrup, wasabi oil, sesame seeds, gari and scallions all over. Slice maki-sushi using both bias and straight cuts. Place hand rolls leaning against sushi.

Mix well and add the beets and onions. Once it comes to a boil, stir to dissolve the sugar and salt then remove from the heat. Allow to cool then cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to overnight. For the grouper: In a small bowl, add the orange zest, juice, olive oil, ground achiote and cumin. Mix well to combine, then pour the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag. Add the grouper filets and seal the bag tightly, squeezing out any excess air from the bag. Gently mix around so the marinade coats the fish well. Refrigerate for 45 minutes. Clean the grill grates and preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Arrange 2 banana leaves to form a cross. Remove one piece of grouper from the marinade and place in the center of the leaves. Season with 4 to 5 turns freshly ground black pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Wrap the fish up tightly in the banana leaves by folding over one flap at a time, alternating each side so they overlap. Secure the last folds of the leaves together with toothpicks to hold in place. Place the banana leaf-wrapped grouper on the grill, and cook until the leaves turn bright green and begin to char around the edges, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and set aside. To serve, cut open the banana leaves to expose the fish, add a large spoonful of Spicy Grilled Corn Salsa and garnish with the pickled red onions, chopped scallions and cilantro.

Add to a large mixing bowl along with the anchovy, garlic, bocconcini, red peppers, parsley, a drizzle of olive oil and some salt and pepper, to taste. Stir together until well combined. Set the flank steak on a piece of plastic wrap. Make a deep horizontal slice along the steak almost all the way through and fan open like a book. Lay another piece of plastic wrap on top. Using the smooth side of a meat mallet, gently flatten the steak until about 1/2-inch thick; take care not to tear. Discard the top sheet of plastic wrap; rub the surface with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Spread the stuffing evenly over the meat, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Arrange the eggs lengthwise down the center of the meat and roll up like a jelly roll log, using the plastic wrap as support. Tie the roll with kitchen twine in 4 to 5 places to secure - this will help hold the shape and keep the filling from falling out. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put a roasting pan across 2 burners and heat over medium heat. Add a 3-count of olive oil and add the thyme and garlic. Cook for about a minute until fragrant. Carefully add the braciole and sear until evenly browned all over, approximately 2 minutes each side. Add the sliced onions and bay leaves, then stir in the beef broth to deglaze. Add the canned tomatoes over the top, then nestle in the whole vine tomatoes around the braciole. Bring to a simmer, then cover with foil and put in the oven to braise for 45 to 60 minutes. When done, remove the foil and remove the braciole to a carving board to rest. Carefully remove the whole vine tomatoes, with a slotted spoon, to a plate. Let the sauce cool for about 5 minutes. Discard the thyme stems and bay leaf, then add the sauce to a blender and puree. Pour the sauce back into the pan and set over medium heat to bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add the balsamic vinegar. Remove the kitchen twine from the beef and cut into 1-inch thick \pin-wheel\ slices. Arrange the slices on a platter and arrange the whole vine tomatoes around the beef.

Slowly add the beaten egg and ice water into the flour mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until smooth and evenly combined. Refrigerate batter for 20 minutes. Peel the apples and pear, cut into eighths, and cut away the cores. Cut each banana crosswise into 6 sections, about 1 inch thick. Squeeze the lemon juice over the fruit to prevent them from turning brown. Arrange the fruit, batter, oil, and caramel ingredients within easy reach. Set out a large bowl of iced water, and a large lightly greased serving platter. Heat a wok or large saucepan, add the oil, and heat to deep-fry temperature, 350 degrees F. Mix the honey and orange liqueur in a large bowl. Add the fruit slices and mix well to coat each piece. Drop some of the slices in the batter to coat, then lift out and let the excess batter drip away. Deep-fry a few slices at a time until batter crisps to pale golden, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with pear and banana slices, reheating the oil in between batches. When finished, reheat the oil to 425 degrees F. Place the 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan. Heat slowly, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar dissolves, do not stir. Continue cooking until light golden, brushing down the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in water. When ready, turn off the heat, and add the sesame seeds to the caramel. Quickly deep-fry all the fruit slices a second time until crisp and golden brown, about 1 minute. Remove the fruit with a slotted spoon, drain briefly on paper towels, then place in the caramel, tossing so the slices are evenly coated.

Fill a large shallow pan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and gently break the eggs into the boiling water. Cook the eggs until the yolks are set to the desired doneness, about 3 minutes. Remove the eggs from the heat. Warm the smoked trout in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 30 seconds or until heated through. Arrange the toasted English muffins on plates and top with the trout. Using a slotted spoon, place 1 poached egg on top of each English muffin. Spoon warm Hollandaise Sauce over the eggs and sprinkle with parsley and a dash of paprika, to garnish. Serve immediately. Melt the butter over medium heat in a heavy saucepan. While butter is melting, whisk together white wine, lemon juice, and hot sauce in a large metal bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks. Place the bowl over a skillet of simmering water and continue whisking over medium heat until a custard consistency develops. Slowly whisk in the melted butter. Continue whisking until the sauce is rich and smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48525,&quot;Herb Salt Crusted Prime Rib 3 1/2 pounds beef rib roast 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon seasoned pepper, salt free 1 (3-pound) box kosher salt 2 packets Italian dressing mix 2 large egg whites 1/2 cup water 1 (14-ounce) can low-sodium beef broth 1 packet onion soup mix Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil. Rinse the roast, pat it dry, and bring it to room temperature. Sprinkle with the Worcestershire sauce and seasoned pepper. In a bowl add the kosher salt, Italian dressing mix, and egg whites and stir to combine. Sprinkle water over the top of the salt mixture until it is well-moistened, but not wet. Place a 1/2-inch layer of the salt mixture in the middle of the roasting pan, slightly larger than the diameter of the roast. Place the roast, fat side up, on top of the salt. Insert a meat thermometer into the center of the roast. Carefully pack the remaining salt mixture onto the meat, covering it completely. Place the roast in the oven and reduce the temperature to 425 degrees F. Roast for 14 to 16 minutes per pound, or until the thermometer reads 5 degrees F less than desired temperature. Final temperature for rare will be 130 degrees F; 135 degrees F for medium rare; 140 degrees F for medium. Remove the roast from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes. For jus, in a small saucepan over medium heat, add the beef broth and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat, add the soup mix, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Remove the salt crust from the roast by breaking it and peeling it away. (You will probably need a hammer to do this.) Slice the meat to desired thickness and transfer slices to a platter. Ladle a small amount of jus over the top of the meat; serve remainder of jus on the side. Cook&#39;s note: Have your butcher remove the ribs from the roast. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 48526,&quot;Sheet Pan Holiday Ham and Biscuits\u202f 6 cups shredded red cabbage (about 10 ounces) 1/2 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced<br> 4 cups diced sweet potatoes (about 1 pound)<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon caraway seed<br> 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 3 tablespoons maple syrup 1/3 cup orange marmalade 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice<br> 2 teaspoons cornstarch<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 slices boneless smoked ham 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder\u202f\u202f<br> 1 teaspoon granulated sugar\u202f<br> 1 teaspoon fine salt\u202f<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda\u202f<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces\u202f<br> 2 tablespoons chopped chives<br> 1 cup buttermilk, plus more for brushing\u202f<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 tablespoons orange marmalade<br> Instructions: For the cabbage and sweet potatoes: Arrange 2 oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.

Whisk the sugar, cream of tartar and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the egg whites and 2 tablespoons water to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment. Beat on low speed until the whites are foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and slowly sprinkle in the sugar mixture (this should take about 3 minutes). Watching closely, continue beating until medium-soft peaks form, 5 to 7 minutes longer. (You want the mixture to droop when lifted out of the bowl. If the peaks stand straight up, you have taken it too far and the cake will sink during baking). Add the vanilla and mix until just combined. Remove the mixing bowl from the stand and working in three additions, very gently fold the flour into the egg whites until just incorporated. Spoon the batter into an ungreased 10-inch footed angel food cake pan and smooth the top. Bake until the top is golden and springs back when touched and a cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the cake upside-down on a wire rack to cool completely in the pan, about 3 hours. Run a knife or a small offset spatula around the edges of the pan and gently tap it on the counter until it releases from the pan. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice the cake -- a regular knife will smash it.

Bank the coals on 2 sides of the lower grate to prepare for the indirect cooking that follows. In a 12 by 9-inch, heavy-duty aluminum-foil pan (or something similar), combine the potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, garbanzo beans, and epazote. Position the pan in the center of the lower grate and surround with the coals. Pour water into the pan to about 1-inch from the top (it&#39;ll take about 5 cups). Position the cooking grate 8 inches above the coals and set an oven thermometer on it, if you have one. Grilling the meat: Sprinkle the lamb liberally with salt. Lay the roast in the center of the cooking grate directly over the soup, cover the grill, and cook, maintaining a moderately low temperature (between 250 and 300 degrees F), checking every 30 minutes and adding coals as needed. The lamb will be beautifully smoky-roasted, it&#39;ll register about 170 degrees F on a meat thermometer and be fall-apart tender in about 2 1/4 hours. Be sure to check the slow-simmering soup that&#39;s capturing all those lamb juices periodically, to ensure the liquid level remains more or less the same, adding more water if it&#39;s needed. Finishing the dish: With a couple of meat forks or spatulas, remove the roast to a platter. Sprinkle with salt and let rest, tented with foil, in a warm place for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, with the precision of a steady-handed circus performer, carefully remove the pan of soup from the bottom of the grill. Skim off the fat that is floating on the surface, then taste and season with salt, usually about 3/4 teaspoon. Stir in the cilantro and finely chopped chipotle and ladle into small, warm soup cups. Scrape the salsa into a serving dish and sprinkle with cheese. Remove the string from the lamb. Slice the lamb into good, thick slabs and arrange on a warm platter that&#39;s lined or decorated with parsley, banana leaves, or lemon leaves. Strew the olives around the platter and carry to the table with a flourish. Serve each guest a cup of soup, and pass the meat, salsa, and lots of warm tortillas for everyone to make delicious soft tacos. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 48536,&quot;Garden Salad with Orange-Dijon Vinaigrette 1/4 cup orange marmalade 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/3 to 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large or 3 small romaine hearts, chopped 3 to 4 celery ribs, chopped 1/2 seedless cucumber, sliced 1 small red onion, chopped or thinly sliced 2 ripe tomatoes, chopped 1/4 cup fresh herb or herbs: parsley, basil, dill, tarragon - whatever is on hand, optional Instructions: In a large serving bowl whisk together the marmalade, mustard, Worcestershire, red wine vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste.

Raise the flame under the pan to high heat and add the ground meats, breaking them up with a spoon as you incorporate them. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the juices have released and the meat begins to caramelize, about 12 minutes. You should hear a popping sound rather than a sizzle coming from the pot. Pour the wine into the pot and scrape the bottom of the pan releasing the brown bits that have formed on the bottom. Cook until the wine has reduced. Pour the tomatoes into a bowl and crush them with your hands or a potato masher into small pieces, and then stir into the pot to combine.

Turn out the dough onto a clean surface, divide in half and press into 2 disks. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight. Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine the cherries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest and juice and almond extract in a large bowl. Toss until the sugar is dissolved and the cherries are well coated; set aside. Roll out one disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate and trim, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Pour in the filling. Roll out the other disk of dough into a 12-inch round. Trim the edges, then cut the dough into 3/4-inch-wide strips using a fluted cutter or a knife. (You should have about 12 strips.) Lay half of the strips over the pie, about 3/4 inch apart. Fold back every other strip. Lay another strip of dough perpendicular to the existing strips, then fold the dough back over the new strip. Repeat, folding back every other strip and weaving in new ones, to form a lattice. Trim the strips, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhanging dough (strips and bottom crust) under itself, pressing to seal. Crimp the edges with your fingers or a fork, if desired. Brush the lattice and crust edges with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Refrigerate the pie until firm, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Prepare the meringue cake layer: Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until foamy. Make a French meringue by adding the granulated sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and whip to stiff but not dry peaks, about 7 minutes. Delicately fold in the powdered sugar with a rubber spatula. It is important to fold as gently as possible to avoid deflating the meringue. Place the meringue in a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch plain tip. Draw 2 (8-inch) circles on a sheet of parchment paper by tracing around the outside of an 8-inch cake pan with a pen. Turn the paper over so the drawing is face down (so that the ink does not bake into the meringue) and place on a baking sheet. To pipe the disks, hold the pastry bag at a slight angle about 1 1/2 inches above the parchment paper. This height and angle allows the piped meringue to hold the full shape of the 3/4-inch tip. Start at the center of the circle and pipe the meringue in a spiral to the edge of the outline. (I work counter-clockwise because I am right-handed.) If the meringue breaks while you are piping it, just continue where it broke. If any air bubbles appear on the disk, go back and fill them in with the extra meringue left in the piping bag. It takes practice to get the disks perfectly round. Don&#39;t worry if yours are slightly misshapen. You can gently scrape away the imperfections after the disks are baked. At this time, pipe additional swirls that are about 2-inches wide and the height of your cake mold. These will be used to decorate the outside of the cake. Bake the meringue disks until they are firm to the touch, about 1 hour. If the meringue begins to take on color while baking, lower the oven temperature by 50 degrees F (10 C). Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place on a wire rack until the meringue disks have completely cooled. If you have the time, turn off the oven and cool the meringue on the baking sheet in the oven. This will take about 1 hour and will allow the meringue to dry completely. While the meringue disks are baking, prepare the ice cream. Prepare the ice cream and allow enough time for them to harden in the freezer. Have the ice bath ready before you begin. To prepare an ice bath, fill a 4-quart bowl with ice cubes. Generously sprinkle salt over the ice and add water to cover the ice. Place a clean, dry 2-quart bowl over the ice bath. To prepare the chocolate ice cream base: Heat the milk and chopped chocolate together in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan (this will keep the milk from burning) over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edge of the pan. While the milk is heating, combine the sugar and egg yolks and whisk until thoroughly incorporated and thick. Temper the egg mixture by pouring about half of the hot milk into it and whisk well. Now pour the tempered egg mixture into the remaining hot milk and chocolate. Cook over medium-high heat until slightly thickened, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula. The mixture has finished cooking when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spatula, about 3 to 5 minutes. Use the following method to tell if it is finished: Quickly dip the spatula into the hot mixture and hold it horizontally in front of you. With the tip of your finger, wipe a clean line down the center of the spatula. If the mixture holds and does not fill in the line, it is ready to be removed from the heat. If the line fills with liquid, the mixture must be cooked a little longer. Repeat the test every 30 seconds until ready. At no time should the mixture begin to boil. If you see bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan, remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture thoroughly to cool it down. Once the mixture has finished cooking, pour it into a clean bowl and set aside to cool. If you want to reduce the cooling time, you can cool the chocolate ice cream base over an ice bath. When the mixture is cool, spin it according to the type of ice cream machine you are using. The ice cream is ready when it is creamy and smooth, like the consistency of soft-serve ice cream. Place the ice cream in an airtight container and store in the freezer until ready to use. While the chocolate ice cream base is cooling, prepare the vanilla ice cream base. The technique is the same as above; heat the milk, cream, honey and vanilla bean in a nonreactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edge. Before adding the vanilla bean, use a sharp paring knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the mixture. While the milk is heating, combine the sugar and egg yolks and whisk until thoroughly incorporated and thick. Temper the egg mixture, then pour the tempered egg mixture into the hot milk and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened enough to coat the back of the spatula. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture into the bowl placed over the ice bath. Remove the vanilla bean. Stir the mixture occasionally to distribute the cooler parts. When completely cooled, remove the bowl from the ice bath and puree the mixture until smooth with an immersion blender, food processor, or blender. Spin the ice cream in your ice cream machine and store in an airtight container in the freezer until ready to use. The next step is to mold the ice cream into the cake pan. Line a cake pan with parchment. You may need to slightly soften the ice cream. Make a 1 1/2?inch thick layer of the chocolate ice cream in the bottom of the cake pan. Make a 1 1/2?inch thick layer of the vanilla ice cream on top of the chocolate. Place the cake pan in the freezer and let harden. If you want to decorate the ice sculpture with ice cream balls, use an ice cream scoop to shape the remaining ice cream into ice cream balls of various sizes. Place the scoops on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and place in the freezer until hardened. Once the meringue disks are baked and the ice cream is molded, it is time to assemble the Vacherin. Remove the cake pan from the freezer. It may be necessary to dip the pan in warm water for a few seconds to unmold the ice cream. Once unmolded, place a meringue disk on top of the molded chocolate ice cream. Cover with a plate or cardboard cake circle and flip so the vanilla is now on top. Place a meringue disk on top of the vanilla and place the molded cake back in the freezer. To make the whipped cream: Use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Place the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla seeds in a medium-size bowl and whip to stiff peaks with an electric mixer on medium-high speed. Remove the Vacherin from the freezer. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch star tip with the whipped cream and use it to decorate the top and side. Using a turntable will make this task easier. Keep the Vacherin in the freezer until ready to serve. It is easiest to cut the cake with a hot serrated knife. To heat the knife, dip it in a tall container filled with hot water before each cut and wipe off the excess water. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48569,&quot;Fried Chicken Vegetable oil, for deep-frying 1 tablespoon granulated garlic<br> 1 tablespoon black pepper<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> One 2 1/2- to 3-pound whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces 2 large eggs, beaten 2 cups all-purpose flour Instructions: Fill a Dutch oven, cast-iron skillet or deep-fryer with enough oil for deep-frying.

In a medium bowl combine the ricotta, Parmesan, chopped rosemary, red pepper flakes and garlic; season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and set aside. Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal rounds (each round should be 4 ounces and about 3-inches in diameter). Divide each round into 2 circles, one 2-inches wide (for the body) and the other 1-inch wide (for the head). On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll each ball of dough out to 1/4-inch thick. (If a ball of dough becomes too stiff while rolling, cover it with plastic wrap and allow it to rest while working on the other balls of dough. After 4 or 5 minutes it will become more flexible, stretchier and easier to roll.) Line two baking sheets with parchment. Place two large circles of dough on each piece of parchment, and overlap each large circle with a smaller circle of dough to form heads. Brush the dough with the olive oil and pierce the dough with a fork to prevent bubbles from forming, then bake until the crust begins to brown and is almost completely cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.<br> Remove the pizzas from the oven and spread the ricotta mixture on top of the snowmen leaving a 1/4-inch border, then top with the torn mozzarella.

Grab the membrane with a paper towel, then pull it off and discard. Make the rub: Mix the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, mustard powder, cumin, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the rub for the sauce. Rub the rest all over both racks of ribs. Wrap well in plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Soak 2 cups wood chips (such as cherry, apple or pecan) in cool water, about 30 minutes. Preheat a grill to medium low (250? F) and prepare for indirect grilling: For a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side. For a gas grill, turn off half the burners. Cover the indirect side of the grill with foil (or position a drip pan underneath the grates). Drain the wood chips and scatter over the hot coals (for a charcoal grill), or place in a smoker box over direct heat (for a gas grill). Unwrap the ribs and place meat-side up on the indirect side of the grill. Close the lid and grill until the ribs are a rich brick red color, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. (For a charcoal grill, adjust the vents and add more coals as needed to maintain the temperature.) Meanwhile, make the sauce: Combine the ketchup, shallot, brown sugar, vinegar, 1/2 cup water and the reserved 2 tablespoons rub in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, 25 to 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool. Remove the ribs from the grill and wrap each rack in heavy-duty foil. Return the ribs to the indirect side of the grill, meat-side down, and continue to grill until the meat has pulled back a bit from the bones, 2 to 2 1/2 more hours. (For a charcoal grill, adjust the vents and add more coals as needed.) Carefully unwrap the ribs and return to the indirect side of the grill, meat-side up. Brush generously with about 2/3 cup of the sauce. Cover and grill until the sauce is cooked into the meat, 10 to 20 more minutes. Remove the ribs to a cutting board and let rest a few minutes, then cut into individual ribs.

Stir in the milk and oil. Combine the rosemary, salt, and flour and stir into the yeast mixture in 3 or 4 additions. Stir until the dough comes together. Knead on a floured surface until velvety, elastic, and smooth, 8 to 10 minutes. It should be somewhat moist and blistered. By Mixer: This recipe is slightly large for the mixer, so that you&#39;ll have to stop and push the dough down frequently while the mixer is kneading it. Stir the yeast into the water in a mixer bowl; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the milk and oil with the paddle. Combine the rosemary, salt, and flour and add to the yeast mixture. Mix until the flour is absorbed, 1 to 2 minutes. Change to the dough hook and knead on medium speed until velvety, elastic, smooth, and somewhat moist, about 3 minutes. Finish kneading briefly by hand on a lightly floured surface. First Rise: Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Shaping and Second Rise: Gently punch the dough down on a lightly floured surface, but don&#39;t knead it. Cut the dough in half and shape each half into a round ball. Place the loaves on a lightly floured peel or lightly oiled baking sheet, cover with a towel, and let rise 45 to 55 minutes (but not until truly doubled). Heat oven to 450 degrees F. If you are using a baking stone, turn the oven on 30 minutes before baking and sprinkle the stone with cornmeal just before sliding the loaves onto it. Just before you put the loaves in the oven, slash the top of each loaf in an asterisk with a razor blade and sprinkle half the sea salt into the cuts of each loaf. Bake 10 minutes, spraying 3 times with water. Reduce the heat to 400 degrees F and bake 30 to 35 minutes longer.

In a small pot, combine the kelp and the water, and bring the water rapidly to a boil. Remove the kelp, and season the broth with rice wine and salt. Poach the salmon pieces in the seasoned broth for only 30 seconds, or until the fish turns opaque. Remove the fish to a platter. Skim the froth from the poaching liquid, and set the broth aside. Wash the broccoli rabe well in cold water, trimming away any leaves that are not bright green. Tie the stalks together in several bunches. In a small pot of boiling water to cover, quickly blanch the broccoli rabe until it is bright green and just barely wilted, about 1 minute. Remove the bunches from the water with tongs or chopsticks, and transfer them immediately to a bowl of cold water. When the rabe is cool, remove it from the water and squeeze out all excess liquid. Cut off the tied stems, keeping the stalks in bundles. Cut the bundles in half lengthwise if they are more than 2 inches long. Stack these bundles of blanched rabe on the same platter as the poached fish pieces.<br> Cut the cabbage into 1 1/2-inch lengths, and stack these near the blanched rabe. Soak the noodles in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes; drain, and place them on the platter too. Remove the stems from the Shiitake mushrooms, and add the stems to the fish poaching liquid. Gently simmer the broth for 5 minutes, then pick out the stems and discard them. Skim any froth from the broth, and season with the syrupy rice wine. Wipe the caps of the mushrooms with a damp cloth to remove any soil that might be clinging to them. Slice the caps in half diagonally, and set them on the platter with the fish, noodles, and vegetables. Place the fermented bean paste on the platter with the other ingredients. Bring the platter of ingredients to the table if you have a portable cooking unit, and make the bubbling pot there. If not, prepare it in the kitchen and then bring it to the table. Either way, begin by simmering the poached fish and noodles in the broth for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Shiitake mushrooms, then the broccoli rabe, and simmer another minute or 2.

Add the salt, brown sugar, vinegar, peppercorns, pepper flakes, parsley, thyme, garlic, bay leaves, lemon peel and onions. Heat until the salt dissolves, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 4 cups ice cubes, stirring until the ice melts. Chill the brine for 15 to 20 minutes before using. (The brine keeps in the fridge for up to 2 days.) For the turkey picnic sandwich: Place the turkey breast in the chilled brine and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the brine and pat dry. In a small bowl, add the olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme and garlic and mix well to combine. Rub the turkey all over with the herb oil mixture. Roast in the center of the oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast (avoid touching bone) reaches 165 degrees F, about 1 hour. Remove the turkey from the oven and allow to rest for 20 minutes before carving into thin slices. For the sandwiches: Smear the bottoms of the pretzel rolls with mustard and mayonnaise. Working from the bottom up, layer the sandwich with a pile of sliced turkey (pile it high!), some Cranberry-Onion Jam, a pickle, a pile of romaine and radicchio, and finally a slice provolone and Swiss cheese. Place top half of the rolls on top and secure with sandwich picks. Set a medium saucepan over medium heat and add the oil and onions. Cook, stirring often, until soft and light brown, about 10 minutes. Add the cranberries, orange juice, sugar, salt, zest, pepper flakes, rosemary and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, remove the rosemary, and continue to cook until the liquid has reduced and you have a jam-like consistency, about 10 minutes more. Let cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48628,&quot;Rustic Onion Pie 4 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 to 1 1/4 cups warm water 1/4 cup olive oil 10 anchovy fillets, optional 4 pounds Spanish onions, peeled and thinly sliced 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper Instructions: To make the dough, put the flour in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and add the oil and salt. Stir together with a wooden spoon and slowly add the water until a dough begins to form. Turn out onto a well floured surface and knead until smooth. Divide the dough into 2 balls, flatten into disks, wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until ready to use. To make the filling, pour the olive oil into a large pot and place it over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the anchovies and cook, stirring until they dissolve. Add the onions, salt and pepper, stir and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 20 to 30 minutes. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature. Grease the baking sheet with olive oil and set aside. On a well floured work surface, roll out 1 of the disks to about 1/8-inch thick rectangle to fit the size of the sheet pan and line the pan with the dough. Spread the filling out over the dough, roll out the second disk a little larger than the sheet pan and place it over the onions. Crimp the edges, brush with olive oil and cut vent slits into the top. Transfer the pan into the top half of the oven and bake until the dough is golden brown, about 1 hour. Let cool, slice and serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 48629,&quot;Fig Shortcakes 3 1/4 cups flour 1/2 cups sugar 2 1/2 tablespoons baking powder 6 ounces very cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1 1/4 cups cold heavy cream Sugar in the raw 12 fresh figs, chopped Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients and cubed butter. Using the paddle attachment, blend the ingredients at low speed until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add the chilled heavy cream to the butter and flour mixture and mix until the dough just comes together. Allow the dough to rest for 5 minutes. Finish mixing the dough by hand until it forms a solid mass. Roll the dough until it is about 1-inch thick. Cut the dough into the desired shortcake shape. Place the shortcakes on a parchment lined baking sheet. Chill. Remove the shortcakes from the refrigerator. Brush tops with heavy cream and sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden. Garnish with figs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 48630,&quot;Spanish Rice Casserole: Paella 4 ounces chorizo, cut into brunoise 2 ounces olive oil 6 ounces Spanish onion, cut into brunoise<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced 10 chicken bone-in thighs, quartered<br> 8 ounces tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and cut 1/2 teaspoon Spanish paprika 1 3/4 pounds long-grained rice, soaked in cool water for 30 minutes, then drained 1 1/2 quarts chicken stock, heated to a boil Salt and ground pepper 1/2 teaspoon saffron, soaked in 1 cup stock for 20 minutes 3 (4-ounce) shell-on lobster tails, quartered 10 snails, cleaned 5 ounces squid, cleaned and sliced into thin rings 10 small clams, scrubbed, opened, and upper shell removed 5 ounces fresh pea pods, washed and trimmed Instructions: Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. In a large braising pan, render chorizo in oil over low heat, creating a flavored oil. Once rendered, heat the flavored oil to almost smoking and saute onions and garlic until translucent. Add chicken pieces to pan and cook until brown on all sides. Remove chicken from pan and hold at 200 degrees, in the oven. Add tomatoes to pan with paprika and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add drained rice and saute for 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Return chicken pieces to pan and add boiling stock. Season, to taste, and add saffron stock. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and place all seafood on top. Replace cover and continue to simmer until chicken and seafood are tender and liquid is absorbed by the rice. Add pea pods to the pan and cook, covered for an additional 2 minutes. Serve immediately. Plate onto preheated dinner plates being sure each portion has rice, chicken, lobster, snails, squid, and clams. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48631,&quot;Mini Ice Pop Macarons 70 grams superfine blanched almond flour (1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon) 63 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (1/2 cup) 55 grams aged egg whites (about 2 large egg whites; see Cook\u2019s Note) Pinch cream of tartar, optional 55 grams granulated sugar (1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon) 2 drops orange gel food coloring 56 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature (4 tablespoons) 4 grams artificial vanilla extract (1 teaspoon) 3 grams orange emulsion or orange extract (1/2 teaspoon) 2 grams table salt (1/4 teaspoon) 125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (1 cup), plus more if needed 10 grams heavy cream (2 teaspoons), plus more if needed Instructions: For the macarons: Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper and set aside. Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar into a large bowl and set aside. Pour the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and mix on a medium speed until the surface of the egg whites is covered in small bubbles, about 1 minute. Add the cream of tartar (if using) and continue to mix until the whites reach the soft peak stage, about 2 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and mix on medium speed for 30 seconds. Raise the speed to medium-high and continue to mix until stiff, glossy peaks form. Start folding the almond flour mixture into the meringue. Once it begins to incorporate, scoop about 1/4 cup of the batter into a small bowl and set aside. Add the food coloring to the remaining batter and continue to fold until thick ribbons of batter flow off your spatula when it&#39;s lifted. (I like to perform the figure-8 test to check the consistency: Lift your spatula and see if you can draw a figure 8 with the batter running off your spatula in one consistent stream. You should be able to draw a couple figure 8s if the batter is the proper consistency.)<br> Pour the orange batter into a large piping bag fitted with a small round piping tip (or, if using a disposable plastic bag, snip the end of the bag to make a 1/4-inch-wide opening) and set aside. Gently fold the uncolored batter with a mini rubber spatula until it is the proper consistency. Place the uncolored batter in a small piping bag fitted with a small round piping tip (or, if using a disposable plastic bag, snip the end of the bag to make a 1/4-inch-wide opening).<br> Using the bag with the orange batter, pipe sixty 1-inch-long ice pop-shaped macaron shells onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Square off two bottom corners on each macaron with a toothpick to give them that iconic ice pop shape. (If your baking mat contains printed circles, use them as a guide; you can also find downloadable macaron templates online). Pipe a thin line of the uncolored batter from corner to corner along the base of each macaron.<br> Bang the pans firmly on the counter a few times to release any air bubbles, then pop any remaining air bubbles that come to the surface with a toothpick. Let the macarons rest until they develop a skin, about 30 minutes. (The macarons should look matte once the skin has formed.)<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 315 degrees F with a rack in the middle position. When the macarons are ready, bake one sheet at a time on the middle rack until they don\u2019t move or wiggle when gently touched, 13 to 16 minutes, rotating halfway through. Cover the macarons with foil when you rotate the baking sheet to prevent browning. Remove from the oven and let the macarons cool for 15 minutes, then gently remove them from the silicone mat. Repeat with the remaining macarons.<br> For the orange buttercream frosting: Beat the butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until it becomes lighter in color and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in the vanilla extract, orange emulsion and salt on low speed. Slowly mix in the confectioners\u2019 sugar and heavy cream on low speed. Continue to mix on low until the frosting is smooth and pipeable, about 2 minutes. If the frosting is too thick, add additional heavy cream or milk (1 teaspoon at a time). If the frosting is too thin, add more confectioners\u2019 sugar (1 tablespoon at a time). Place the frosting in a small piping bag fitted with a small round tip tip (or, if using a disposable plastic bag, snip the end of the bag to make a 1/4-inch-wide opening). To assemble, pipe a dollop of the frosting onto the flat side of one macaron, then press an ice pop stick on top of the buttercream with the curved (not cut) end facing out. Gently press the flat side of a second macaron on top of the frosting to create a sandwich. Place the finished macarons in an airtight container and refrigerate overnight; this softens them (in a good way) and allows the flavors to develop. Before serving, let them warm to room temperature.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 48632,&quot;Roasted Halibut with Grapefruit Fennel Salsa 1 cup ruby red grapefruit segments (about 2 grapefruits) 1/4 cup grapefruit juice 1 teaspoon grapefruit zest 1 fennel bulb, trimmed 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons pitted nicoise olives, halved 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes 4 (6-ounce) pieces halibut 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Line a 13-by-5-inch loaf pan with a strip of aluminum foil. Spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the dark chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding mix, milk, sour cream, oil and eggs in a mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 52 to 58 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove and set on a cooling rack to cool completely. Cut the domed top off the cake and about 1/4 inch off each end. Slice the cake into 13 equal slices. Freeze slices for 1 hour. Remove the cake from the freezer, set on a cutting board, and cut using small 1 3/4-inch number cookie cutters. To remove the cake from the cookie cutters, use a wood dowel to gently push the pieces out. To make a Sweet 16 cake, cut a 1 and 6 out of each cake slice. Line a baking sheet or cutting board with a nonstick silicone mat, nonstick foil or parchment paper. Set the cake numbers on top, cover, and freeze for at least one hour. For the tie-dye cake: Once the cake numbers are frozen, make the colorful cake batter. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13-by-5-inch loaf pan with a strip of aluminum foil. Spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the white cake mix, white chocolate pudding mix, milk, sour cream, oil and egg whites in a mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium speed for 2 minutes. Equally divide the batter among 7 bowls. Color one bowl purple, one royal blue, one sky blue, one green, one yellow, one orange and one red using the food coloring. Pour each colored batter into a disposable pastry bag or large resealable plastic bag. Snip the tip off each bag. Pipe squiggles of purple batter into the bottom of the prepared pan, leaving room for other colors in between the squiggles. Pipe another color on top, then another and another. Pipe all 7 colors on the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Remove the cake numbers from the freezer. If any of the numbers have holes in them, pipe in 2 different batter colors, filling the hole two-thirds full. Pipe a very thin amount of batter up against one short side of the loaf pan. Press the cake numbers up against the batter. Press another cake number up against the first number and continue adding cake numbers until you have a row of them going down the length of the entire pan. If using more than 1 number, pipe squiggles of colored batter in between the numbers, alternating colors as you go. Pipe squiggles of colored batter around the outside of the numbers, alternating colors as you go. Pipe squiggles of colored batter on top of the numbers, alternating colors as you go. Smooth out the top of the cake. Do not swirl the colored batter in the pan. Tap the pan on the counter 5 times to help remove big air bubbles. Bake the cake until the top is deep brown and a long toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove and set on a cooling rack to cool completely. Cut the domed top off the cake and about 1/4 inch off each end. Trim off a thin layer from each long side of the cake. Optionally, freeze the cake until firm. Set the cake on a cake board that is cut 1/4 inch larger than the loaf on all 4 sides. Mark one end of the cake board. Set the cake so the numbers face forward on the marked end of the cake board. For the frosting: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar, shortening, whipping cream, vanilla and marshmallow creme until light and fluffy. Frost the cake. For the rainbow-colored glaze: Combine the finely chopped candy melts, whipping cream and corn syrup in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high in 15 second increments, stirring after each, until melted. Evenly divide the glaze among 6 small bowls. Color one purple, one royal blue, one sky blue, one green, one yellow, one orange and one red. Allow the glaze to thicken slightly. Create a melting rainbow by pouring colored glaze down the side of the cake, starting with the purple, then royal blue, sky blue, green, yellow, orange and red. Set the cake on a serving dish so you know which end has the numbers facing forward. Cut into the cake and reveal the surprise hiding inside. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros, Moscato]&quot; 48643,&quot;Seared Scallops Sushi 5 sea scallops Vegetable oil 1 cup sushi rice, recipe follows Wasabi Daikon sprouts, for garnish 5 cups short-grain sushi rice 6 cups water 1/2 cup rice vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Heat a saute pan over high heat. Add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add the sea scallops and sear until golden brown on both sides, about 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. Be careful not to overcook! Remove from the heat and slice the scallops in half horizontally. With moist hands, pick up a golf ball-sized ball of rice. Gently squeeze the rice in your right hand to form a rectangular block with rounded edges and sides. Apply some pressure to the rice while forming it into a sturdy base for the scallops. Top each formed piece of rice with a small bit of wasabi and top it off with half of a scallop. Garnish each piece with a few daikon sprouts and serve. Rinse the rice in cold water while stirring briskly to remove any dirt. Drain the rice completely. Place the rice and the 6 cups of water in a medium sized saucepan and cover it with a tight fitting lid. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Allow the water to boil for 3 minutes and then reduce the heat to low and continue cooking 15 minutes without removing the lid. Remove the rice from the heat and remove the lid (the water should no longer be visible). Turn the rice out evenly on a well-greased cookie sheet using a spatula or rice paddle. Sprinkle the rice with the vinegar, sugar, and salt while mixing with a spatula or rice paddle until the rice reaches body temperature. Keep the rice covered with damp paper towels or napkin until the rice is ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 48644,&quot;Fried Green Tomatoes 4 cups self-rising flour 1 cup fine cracker meal 1/3 cup sugar 1/4 cup salt 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 2 large eggs 4 cups whole milk 6 to 7 large green tomatoes Instructions: Combine all dry ingredients in large mixing bowl. Mix and sift at least twice before starting. In a separate bowl, combine eggs and milk to make egg wash mixture. Slice firm green tomatoes about a 1/2-inch thick. Put tomatoes in egg wash making sure tomatoes are coated well. Dredge tomatoes in dry batter coating well.

Bring water to boil, cook broccoli rabe for 2 minutes and drain. In a frying pan, heat oil, garlic, salt and hot pepper, add broccoli rabe and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Allow rabe to cool, and cut into 1-inch pieces. Begin to butterfly the pork tenderloin evenly. Lay flat on clean surface and top with 3 slices of prosciutto, then add chopped broccoli rabe. Start to roll the tenderloin from the bottom. Tie with 14-inches of butcher string making a knot. Grill on covered barbecue for approximately 25 to 35 minutes on medium to high flame. Drizzle with white wine and cook for additional 2 minutes. Turn occasionally to cook evenly. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 48646,&quot;Air Fryer Jalape?o Poppers 12 large jalape?o peppers (at least 4 inches in length) 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 5 ounces extra-sharp yellow Cheddar, grated 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs seasoned with Pecorino Romano 1/2 cup finely crushed kettle potato chips Nonstick cooking spray 2 tablespoons bacon bits or freshly cooked, crumbled bacon Instructions: Working with disposable rubber gloves to protect your skin, halve each jalape?o lengthwise, slicing through the stem. Remove the seeds and white ribs with a spoon or small melon baller. Arrange the halves on a baking sheet rounded sides down. If any of the halves tilt sideways instead of standing straight up, slice a sliver of skin off the rounded side, making sure not to cut through to the cavity, so they sit level. Add the cream cheese and Cheddar to a small bowl and mix together with a rubber spatula until combined. Stir together the breadcrumbs and potato chips in a medium bowl. Divide the cream cheese mixture among the jalape?o halves, smoothing it down with your finger or the back of a butter knife so the filling is level with the top of the jalapeno, not mounded. (You may have extra filling depending on how large your jalapenos are.) Firmly press the breadcrumb mixture over the cream cheese to fully coat. Spray the breadcrumbs with nonstick spray. Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F and set to cook for 4 minutes. Arrange the poppers in a single layer in the basket so they\u2019re not touching, working in batches if necessary. Air fry the poppers without opening the basket to check on them. When the air fryer turns off, let the poppers sit in the basket for another 4 minutes without opening the machine. (this will allow the poppers to cool slightly and the cheese to set so it doesn\u2019t slide out\u2014don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll still be gooey.) Carefully open the air fryer basket and remove each popper with a spatula. Serve the poppers sprinkled with the bacon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 48647,&quot;Bakla-Squares and Ice Cream 3 (13 by 17-inch) sheets phyllo dough 4 tablespoons melted butter 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cinnamon 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts 1 pint vanilla bean ice cream Honey, for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spread a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Top with a layer of phyllo and brush or using a spritz bottle, spray with butter. Combine sugar and cinnamon and cover the sheet of pastry 1/3 cup sugar. Repeat with 2 more layers of pastry, then top with the finely chopped walnuts. Cut pastry into 3-inch squares with sharp paring knife. Cover the pastry with another sheet of parchment paper and another cookie sheet. Place pastry in hot oven and bake 15 minutes or until golden.

Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside. Reserve the pan with the drippings. Separate 4 of the eggs and set the yolks aside. Discard the 4 whites. Crack the fifth egg and add it to the yolks. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 2/3 of the pancetta, the Parmigiano-Reggiano, black pepper and cayenne. Cook the pasta until al dente. Add the peas when the pasta is just about finished and strain both into the reserved pancetta drippings. Reserve about 3/4 cup pasta water to fortify the sauce. Add the egg mixture into the pasta and toss well with tongs for about 1 minute. Add the reserved pasta water to the bowl in 1/4 cup increments, combining and adding until desired sauce consistency is reached. Add the parsley and gently combine and place into a serving dish. Garnish with the reserved pancetta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 48649,&quot;Three-Flavor Diner Pie 36 chocolate wafer cookies 3 tablespoons sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 2 ounces white chocolate chips (about 1/3 cup) 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter 4 cups milk 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup cornstarch<br> Kosher salt 6 large egg yolks, beaten 4 ounces miniature semisweet chocolate chips (about 1/2 cup) 1/2 medium banana 1 1/2 cups whipped cream or frozen whipped topping, thawed 2 tablespoons salted roasted peanuts, roughly chopped<br> 2 tablespoons miniature semisweet chocolate chips<br> Instructions: For the crust: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Set aside 6 of the chocolate wafer cookies, then put the remaining cookies in a food processor with the sugar. Pulse until finely ground with a sandy texture. Add the butter and blend until combined. Press into a 9-inch deep-dish pie dish. Bake, rotating the pie plate halfway through the baking time, until firm, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool while you make the pudding. For the pudding: Put the white chocolate chips in a small bowl and the peanut butter in a medium bowl; set aside. Heat 3 1/2 cups of the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until steaming, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup cold milk. Whisk half of the hot milk into the egg mixture until smooth, then gradually whisk the egg and milk mixture into the remaining hot milk in the saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened to a pudding-like consistency, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat, then transfer 3/4 cup of the pudding to the bowl with the white chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cups to the bowl with the peanut butter. Add the miniature chocolate chips to the saucepan with the remaining pudding. Whisk the puddings separately until melted and smooth. Allow to cool for 10 minutes while you prepare the cookie walls. Cut the half banana in half. Unpeel one of the pieces and cut into 6 slices. Stack 2 slices in the center of the cookie crust. Halve the remaining slices and arrange 5 pieces around the stacked pieces cut-sides in like a flower. Arrange the 3 remaining pieces on top of the banana petals.<br> Carefully cut the remaining 6 chocolate wafer cookies in half. Dip 4 of the cookie halves almost all the way into the white chocolate pudding (leave just enough of each cookie exposed so you have a spot to hold onto), then arrange the cookies in a square around the bananas rounded-side up. The cookies should touch each other (the pudding will work as glue); if you need to, rearrange the bananas slightly to accommodate the cookies. Dip the remaining 8 cookie halves in the chocolate pudding. Leaving a 1-inch border around the first cookie wall, arrange the cookies rounded-side up in a circle around it, overlapping the cookies ever so slightly so they stand up straight.<br> Spoon half of the white chocolate pudding into the center of the pie on top of the bananas, spoon half of the peanut butter pudding into the second section of the pie and then spoon half of the chocolate pudding into the outermost section of the pie. If any cookie walls fall over during this process, simply stand the cookies back up and keep filling the pie. (Once all the pudding is in the pie, the cookie walls will stand on their own and help keep the flavors separate.) Use the back of a small spoon or an offset spatula to smooth out the pudding in the pie, then top each section with the other half of the corresponding pudding. The pudding might go slightly above the cookie walls; just smooth it, being careful to keep the different flavors separate. Alternatively, you can transfer the pudding to 3 piping bags or large resealable plastic storage bags and pipe into the pie. Put plastic wrap directly over the pie, pressing on the top slightly so the pie is mostly flat, and refrigerate until fully set, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.<br> For the toppings: Before serving, unwrap the pie and spoon the whipped topping over the center of the pie, leaving the chocolate pudding showing as a border. Peel and thinly slice the remaining banana piece and decorate the center of the pie with the slices. Create a ring of chopped peanuts around the banana slices, roughly over the peanut butter pudding layer. Sprinkle the mini chocolate chips over the chocolate pudding layer. Slice into 8 pieces and serve immediately.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48650,&quot;Greens &#39;n&#39; Beans 1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 large bunch kale, leaves stripped off stems 1 clove garlic, smashed 1/4 cup whole, skinned almonds 2 cups loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves and soft stems 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons water 1 (15-ounce) can great Northern beans, drained and rinsed Instructions: Warm 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Meanwhile, wash the kale but don&#39;t dry the leaves too much. Rip the leaves into smaller pieces if you wish, but I like leaving them whole. Add the kale to the skillet - watch out, it will splutter. Toss with tongs and immediately cover and lower the heat. Meanwhile, make the cilantro pesto. In a small food processor, whizz up the garlic, almonds, cilantro, salt, pepper, remaining 1/2 cup olive oil, and water until smooth. Remove the lid and check the kale; the leaves should be tender. Add the beans and cilantro pesto and toss. Taste and adjust seasonings, and then cook another 5 minutes until warmed through.

(I like Hawaiian&#39;s here) Cooking spray (optional) 10 strips cooked bacon, chopped 1/4 cup habanero nacho cheese sauce (I like Mrs. Renfro&#39;s Ghost Pepper Nacho Cheese Sauce here) 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar and pepper jack blend (regular Monterey Jack is fine), then chopped 12 medium eggs 4 tablespoons salted butter, melted 1 tablespoon everything bagel seasoning 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan Hot sauce, to serve (I like Texas Pete or chipotle flavored Tabasco here) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the rolls: Place the rolls on a nonstick-foil-lined baking sheet or in a baking dish with the sides and bottom coated with cooking spray. With a serrated paring knife, carve out a wide circle on the top of each, cutting down and leaving about 1/2-inch of bread at the bottom. (You need to keep the bottom sturdy, so you don&#39;t want to cut all the way to the bottom.) Get your fingers in there and pull out the plug of bread. Press down the bottom with your fingers, leaving room for your filling. For the filling: Evenly divide the bacon into the recesses in the bread. In a medium bowl, mix the nacho cheese sauce with the Cheddar-jack blend. Divide evenly and spoon or pipe into each recess above the bacon. Crack an egg into each cavity. For the topping: Brush the tops of the rolls with the butter, then sprinkle with the everything bagel seasoning and Parmesan. Bake until the eggs are done and the rolls are golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then cut apart and serve with a shake of hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 48652,&quot;Big Apple Crumb Cheesecake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 15 graham crackers (or 2 cups crushed graham cracker crumbs)<br> 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled<br> 1 tart apple, peeled, cored and diced<br> 1 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> Pinch kosher salt Three 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 1 cup sour cream<br> 3 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> Store-bought caramel sauce, for serving<br> Instructions: For the graham crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray and place on a baking sheet. Add the graham crackers to a food processor and pulse until fine, then add the brown sugar and salt and pulse until well combined. Drizzle in the melted butter and stir until the mixture resembles damp sand. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the prepared springform pan in an even layer. Bake the crust until firm, about 10 minutes, then let cool. For the apple crumb topping: Stir together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Drizzle in the butter and stir until the mixture resembles wet sand, using your hands to form some clumps. Fold in the diced apple. For the cheesecake filling: Stir together the granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in a small bowl. Pulse together the cream cheese and sour cream in a food processor until smooth. With the processor running, add the sugar mixture 1/2 cup at a time until the mixture is smooth. Add the eggs and yolk one at a time, pulsing until well combined, then add the vanilla, scraping down the sides of the processor and giving it another pulse to make sure everything is incorporated. Pour the cheesecake filling over the top of the graham cracker crust. Sprinkle the crumb topping over the filling. Bake the cheesecake until it is mostly set but still has a bit of a jiggle in the center, 60 to 70 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the oven door slightly open for 1 hour. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature, about another hour, then refrigerate for 1 hour more. Run a paring knife around the outside before unmolding and slicing.

Set aside for 30 minutes. Scoop the morels from the water with a slotted spoon, reserving the liquid. You should have 2 cups; if not, add water to make 2 cups. Drain the morels and rinse once more. If some of the mushrooms are large, cut into 2 or 3 pieces. Pour the mushroom liquid through a coffee filter or paper towel, discarding the gritty solids. Set the mushrooms and the liquid aside separately. Meanwhile, remove and discard the stems of the porcini and rub any dirt off the caps with a damp paper towel. Dont rinse them! Slice thickly and set aside. In a small saucepan, heat the chicken stock with the 2 cups of reserved mushroom liquid and bring to a simmer. In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter and saute the pancetta and shallots over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Add the morels and porcini and saute for another 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat the grains with butter. Add the wine and cook for 2 minutes. Add 2 full ladles of the chicken stock mixture to the rice plus the saffron, salt, and pepper. Stir and simmer over low heat until the stock is absorbed, 5 to 10 minutes. Continue to add the stock mixture, 2 ladles at a time, stirring every few minutes. Each time, cook until the mixture seems a little dry before adding more of the stock mixture. Continue until the rice is cooked through, but still al dente, about 25 to 30 minutes total. When done, the risotto should be thick and creamy and not at all dry. Off the heat, stir in the Parmesan cheese. Serve hot in bowls with extra cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 48656,&quot;Lizzie&#39;s Cranberry Cocktail 2 cups orange juice 2 cups fresh cranberries<br> Champagne, chilled, for serving<br> Frozen cranberries, for serving<br> Instructions: Bring the orange juice and cranberries to a boil in a large pot until the berries just begin to burst.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Beat the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment until foamy. Then add the white sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Continue to whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Then add the food coloring. Sift the powdered sugar and almond flour together in a separate medium bowl. This will make a fine powder mixture to create a smooth top. Fold the flour/sugar mixture into the egg white mixture \u2013 65 to 75 good strokes. Transfer the batter to a piping bag. Pipe out 1-inch rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Tap the pan hard on the counter at least 2 or 3 times to release the air bubbles. This will prevent the tops of your macarons from cracking. Let them sit out for 20 to 30 minutes (or up to an hour if you want). This will allow them time to dry out a bit before hitting the hot oven. They should be \tacky\ to the touch but not stick to your fingertips. This is another important step to assure your macarons develop feet! When they dry out they can&#39;t spread out in the oven and are forced to rise up. Bake for 20 minutes. DO NOT UNDER BAKE, even if they look done! Otherwise they will stick to your tray. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes on the pan before trying to remove. Either make the fillings at this time or store in an air-tight container until ready to use. Spread a little of the ganache or caramel on half the cookies. Sandwich the other half on top. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a bare simmer in a medium saucepan over low heat. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until smooth. Add the bourbon stir to combine. Allow to cool until thickened slightly (the room temperature ganache should be about the consistency of peanut butter). If it&#39;s too thick, you can add a little bit more hot cream and stir until smooth. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Scrape the beans from the vanilla bean pod and add to a saucepan with the cream, butter and salt. Heat on medium to melt the butter. Turn off the heat and let the vanilla bean seeds steep for 10 minutes. In a separate saucepan, boil the passion fruit pulp until it is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Once the passion fruit is reduced, remove it from the heat and stir in the sugars and vanilla/cream mixture. Put the pan back on medium heat and cook until a candy thermometer reads 252 degrees F. Remove the caramel from the heat and pour onto the prepared baking sheet. Let cool to warm room temperature before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 48658,&quot;Sauteed Mushrooms in a Hot Crusty Pita 3 ounces butter 2 portobello mushrooms or 1/2 pound button mushrooms, sliced 1/2 cup heavy cream 4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled Salt and pepper Packaged pita bread Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cook until the potatoes can just be pierced with a fork, 10 to 25 minutes depending on their size. Drain and let them sit to dry out until they&#39;re cool enough to handle. Slice the potatoes as thin as you can manage, at most 1/4-inch-thick; transfer the potato slices to a bowl and gently toss with the lemon juice and zest, 4 tablespoons oil, and lots of salt and pepper. Put the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it&#39;s hot, add some of the fennel in a single layer, taking care not to crowd (you&#39;ll probably have to work in batches) and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining fennel. Return all the fennel to the skillet and add the wine. Reduce the heat so the liquid bubbles gently and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until the fennel is quite tender and the pan is dry, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Heat the oven to 500 degrees F and put the rack in the lower third, with the pizza stone if you&#39;re using one. Prepare the pizza dough according to the recipe directions. Top each pizza with half the potato slices (it&#39;s okay if they overlap a bit), then scatter with half the braised fennel. Put one baking sheet into the oven or slide the pizza on its parchment onto the stone. Bake until the crust is crisp, anywhere from 5 to 12 minutes. Chop the fennel fronds, sprinkle half over the pizza, drizzle with olive oil, slice and serve. Bake the second pizza while you eat the first. Grease a large bowl with olive oil. Put all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, instant yeast, and salt in a food processor. With the machine running, gradually add olive oil and 1 cup water, taking care not to overmix. Continue to run the machine, slowly adding 1/2 cup more water, until the dough forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch, about 30 seconds. If it&#39;s still dry, add 1 tablespoon water and process for another 10 seconds, but make sure the dough stays only a little sticky. (Unlikely, but if the mixture is too sticky to handle, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time and process for 10 seconds.) Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead by hand until you have a smooth, round ball, just a few seconds. Put the dough in the prepared bowl, turn to coat in the oil and cover with plastic wrap; let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Cut the dough into 2 pieces. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a towel and let rest until it puffs slightly, 20 minutes or so. Cut 2 pieces of parchment the size of large rimmed baking sheets (or pizza stone if you have one). Line 2 baking sheets with the parchment and, using floured hands, transfer one piece of dough to the parchment with the help of a spatula or pastry blade; put the other piece of dough on the second sheet. Let the dough sit for a few minutes; this will relax the dough and make it easier to roll out. Lightly press or roll each dough ball into the pan to about 1/4-inch thickness, flouring the dough only as necessary to prevent sticking. (If you&#39;re using a pizza stone, roll or pat out the dough onto parchment, 1/4-inch-thick, then transfer to a peel.) Press gently on the dough to readjust and flatten before topping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 48729,&quot;Mini Pissaladiere 2 sheets frozen pre-rolled puff pastry, thawed 1/4 cup olive oil 1 1/2 pounds yellow (brown) onions, thinly sliced 2 ounces anchovy fillets 4 ounces pitted black olives 24 tiny whole basil leaves, for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Prepare the corn muffin mix with the egg and milk according to package directions and spoon in dollops on top of the bean mixture. Cover with the lid and be careful not swing the pot too much when transferring it to the fire to keep the batter on top (it will sink a bit though). Prepare a campfire or charcoal grill for cooking at medium-high heat (you&#39;ll know it&#39;s ready when you can hold your hand about 2 inches above the fire or grates for only 2 to 3 seconds). Arrange the coals so there is a hole in the center large enough to hold the Dutch oven without it touching any coals directly. Place the Dutch oven in the hole. With grilling tongs or a shovel, place a few coals on the lid of the Dutch oven. Cook for 20 minutes, rotating the pot occasionally. Remove the coals from the lid and take the Dutch oven off the fire.

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat the 2 cups of milk until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F). In another pan, melt the butter. Set aside 1/4 cup for brushing the pans. When the yeast is bubbly, fit the electric mixer with a dough hook or paddle. Add all of the flour, the brown sugar, warm milk, eggs, and the 1 1/4 cups melted butter and beat on low speed for 10 minutes. Oil a large bowl and place the dough in it, turning it in the bowl to coat on all sides. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Brush two 8-inch springform pans, 2 inches deep, with the reserved 1/4 cup of melted butter. Make the filling: In a bowl, stir together the brown sugar, currants, and cinnamon. Once the dough has doubled, punch it down with your hands. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. On a clean, dry, lightly floured surface, roll out each piece of dough into a rectangle 8 x 12 inches. Sprinkle half the filling over each piece of dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Starting with the long side of the dough closest to you, roll each piece of dough into a cylinder, pinching the seam closed. Cut each roll into 6 equal slices and place the slices, cut side up, with the sides touching, in the prepared springform pans. Brush the surface of the buns with the remaining 1/4 cup of milk. Let the buns rise in the pans until almost doubled in size, about 30 minutes. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the buns for about 45 minutes, until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the buns comes out clean. Cool in the pans 10 minutes. Serve warm. To store, wrap the buns well in plastic, then store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, remove the plastic wrap; then wrap the buns in aluminum foil.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, add the 1/2 cup softened butter, lemon zest and chopped chives. Halve the lemons and squeeze the juice of 1 lemon half into the butter. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Prepare the turkey: Remove the inner packet of giblets from the cavity and set aside. Run your fingers underneath the skin of the breast to make a little pocket between the skin and the flesh. Using your fingers, scoop up some of the lemon-chive butter and push the butter under the skin, filling up the pockets. Do the same thing on the legs. Once each pocket has been filled, take the rest of the butter and rub it all over the outside of the bird. Sprinkle about a tablespoon and a half of coarse salt on top. Insert the halved lemons, orange and grapefruit into the cavity of the turkey. Insert as much of the citrus as you can. Give each piece a little squeeze as you insert them to get the juices distributed. (You may have to leave some out depending on the size of the cavity. Use any extra citrus for garnish later.) Remove the giblets from the packet, rinse and pat dry. Place the giblets on the bottom of a large roasting pan. Place the turkey on top of the giblets. Tuck the wings under the turkey. Place the turkey in a preheated oven and cook for 30 minutes. Then, turn down the heat to 350 degrees F and roast for about another 2 hours, until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 175 to 180 degrees F. (The general rule is to cook a turkey about 15 minutes per pound.) Remove the bird from the pan onto a carving board or platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Allow it to rest for 15 minutes before carving. Place the roasting pan over low heat on the stovetop. Add white wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour in the chicken stock. Whisk the cornstarch into it. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and the Dijon mustard. Whisk well to combine. Strain the gravy into a small saucepan and simmer over low heat until thick and smooth, about 8 minutes. Bring your turkey to room temperature to ensure that the bird will cook evenly. Stuffing a turkey with fruit keep the bird moist and acts as a secondary cooking agent. As the juice of the fruit steams inside the cavity, it helps cook the bird from the inside. The juices also help to flavor the pan juices used for making the gravy. Stuffing butter between the skin and the flesh, keep the meat moist and flavorful. The butter and salt on the outside help create a tasty, crispy skin. I like to use the giblets as a platform for the bird. It stops the bottom of the bird from burning and adds flavor to the pan juices. A good rule for roasting times is to plan on roasting a turkey for about 15 minutes per pound.
