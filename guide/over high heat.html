Use your fingers to make sure that all of the ingredients are evenly distributed. Rub the outside of each steak generously with the rub. Let sit for a few minutes. Preheat a saute pan or cast iron skillet over high heat. Lightly oil the steaks. Place the steaks in a very hot pan and get a good sear on both sides. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove the steak from the pan and let rest in a warm spot for 7 to 8 minutes. For the mushroom sauce: Drain the fat from the pan. Add the shallots and bring the pan to a medium heat and season with salt. Cook the shallots for 3 to 4 minutes and add in the garlic. Cook the garlic and shallots together for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt, and stir to coat with oil. Cook the mushrooms until they look soft and wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the brandy and cook until it has reduced by half. Add the veal demi-glaze. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes; the consistency should be almost as thick as gravy. If it is still thin, let it simmer for another couple of minutes until it does thicken. Check the consistency by coating a spoon with the sauce, turn the spoon over and draw a line down the middle of the spoon with your finger. If your finger leaves a track down the spoon without moving, then it is ready! Taste and adjust the salt, if needed. Slice the steak on the bias across the grain leaving a few bites of meat on the bone. Serve slices and meat on the bone over Crispy Smashed Potatoes and top with mushroom sauce. Serve with Glazed Carrots on the side. Place the potatoes in a saucepan filled with cold water. Salt the water. Bring the potatoes to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes. Heat the olive oil in a pan with high sides over high heat. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the crushed red pepper. Add the potatoes and saute until beginning to brown. Lightly smash the potatoes and flip them to brown the other side. Season with salt and keep warm. Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of well-salted ice water. Blanch the carrots in the boiling water. When they are cooked but still have some crunch, plunge them immediately into the ice water. When cool, use a clean tea towel to rub the skin off the carrots. Reserve. To a large skillet add the butter, sugar, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, cayenne and about 1/2 cup water. Bring the pan to medium heat, swirling occasionally. When most of the water has reduced and the mixture seems homogenous, remove the garlic and add the carrots and stir until they are coated. Cook until the carrots are completely coated and hot, another 2 to 3 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 47487,&quot;Haeffekrunz (Hay-fa-kruns) 6 Cups Bread (High-Gluten) Flour (sift first, then measure) 1/2 Cup Warm Water 2 1/2 Teaspoons Active Dry Yeast (NOT QUIK RISE) 3 Tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces Zest of a large lemon 2/3 Cup Sugar 2 Teaspoons Kosher Salt 2 Large eggs, beaten 1 3/4 Cups warm whole milk 1 Cup melted butter, set aside Cinnamon/Sugar mixture 2 Cups Raisins (optional) Parchment Paper 2 Beaten Eggs (for egg wash) Instructions: Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Sprinkle a dash of sugar on top to feed it. Set aside to proof. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, add flour and make a well in the middle. On top of the flour, add sugar, salt, butter pieces and lemon zest. After yeast is bubbly, pour into the well and sprinkle a little flour on top. Add beaten eggs to yeast in center. Using a wooden spoon, start stirring in the eggs, adding/pulling in a little bit of flour from the sides. When you can&#39;t stir it anymore, begin to add the warm milk and keep stirring and adding milk until it&#39;s impossible to stir. Now, using your hands, keeping adding milk and blending in the flour until the dough is soft and barely tacky but not wet. You may or may not use all the milk (depends on the weather). Turn out the dough onto a very lightly floured surface. Knead for about 10 to 15 minutes to develop the gluten properly. Dough should spring back quickly from touch. Put into a lightly oiled bowl, turn once and cover with plastic wrap (touching the dough) and a towel. Place in a warm area to rise for at least one hour (should double in bulk). When fully risen, remove and divide dough in two. Set one aside under a warm towel. With the remaining piece, divide it into three equally-weighted pieces. Set two aside. Using a heavy rolling pin and your hands, begin to roll the dough into a rectangle. (Size doesn&#39;t matter, just so long as it isn&#39;t longer than a 1/2 sheet pan.) It should be very thin. Using a pastry brush, coat the whole piece in melted butter. Liberally sprinkle on the cinnamon/sugar mixture and spread some raisins (if you want) over the whole piece. Carefully roll up the dough lengthwise. Pinch the seam together and place on 1/2 sheet pan that is lined with parchment paper. Cover with a warm towel. Repeat the process with the other two pieces of dough. When all three are done, braid the \strands\ loosely together. Cover with a clean towel and place in a warm place to rise again for at least 30 minutes. Repeat the whole process with the other half of your dough batch. Paint the braids with the egg wash and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 25 to 35 minutes. Bread should be deep brown and slightly hollow when tapped. Slide the bread on the paper off the pan onto a cooling rack and allow to cool to the touch. Remove paper. If you want to pack it for a gift, allow it to cool completely. Then wrap tightly in good plastic wrap, then in foil. Cover with pretty cellophane and tie each end with curling ribbon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47488,&quot;Greek Salad 3 vine ripe tomatoes, cut into chunks 1 red onion, thinly sliced 1/2 European seedless cucumber, cut into bite-size chunks 1 small red bell pepper, seeded and chunked 1 small green bell pepper, seeded and chunked 1 cubanelle pepper, seeded and chunked 1 cup Kalamata black olives Several sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, about 1/2 cup 2 (1/4 pound) slices imported Greek feta 1/4 cup (a couple of glugs) extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons (3 splashes) red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed in palm of your hand Coarse salt and black pepper Pita breads Instructions: Combine vegetables, olives, and parsley in a large bowl. Rest sliced feta on the top of salad. Combine oil, vinegar, and oregano in a small plastic container with a lid. Shake vigorously to combine oil and vinegar and pour over salad and cheese. Season with salt and pepper and let the salad marinate until ready to serve. Serve salad with pita bread blistered and warmed on a hot griddle or grill pan. &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 47489,&quot;Curried Couscous Salad with Dried Sweet Cranberries 1 (5.8-ounce) box instant couscous 3/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries 1 tablespoon curry powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 orange, juiced 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 to 4 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced on an angle 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 1/2 lemon, juiced 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, toasted Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Stir the couscous, cranberries, curry powder, salt, and sugar together in a heatproof bowl. Bring water (amount will be listed on package directions) to a boil and pour it over the couscous. Add the orange juice. Give it a big stir, cover the bowl tightly and let it stand, giving it a big stir once or twice, until the water is absorbed and the couscous is tender, about 5 minutes. Fluff up the couscous with a fork. Add the olive oil, scallions, parsley, lemon juice, and walnuts. Stir around until everything is distributed evenly throughout the couscous. Make up to 2 hours ahead of time and keep at room temperature until you&#39;re ready to serve. Check the seasonings just before you serve the salad and add salt and pepper, to taste. Note: To toast the walnuts, spread them out on a baking sheet and bake in a 400 degree F oven until they turn a shade darker, about 8 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 47490,&quot;Fully Festive Ham 7 1/2 pounds gammon (ham) 8 cups cranberry juice 8 cups apple juice 2 cinnamon sticks, halved 2 onions, halved but not peeled 1 tablespoon allspice berries Approximately 30 cloves 4 tablespoons cranberry jelly, or 6 tablespoons cranberry sauce 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon English mustard powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: Put the ham into a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and then immediately drain and rinse it in a colander, to remove any excess saltiness. Alternatively, leave the ham soaking in cold water overnight. Rinse the saucepan and put the ham back in, and add all remaining ingredients. If the fruit juices do not cover the ham then add some water; it really depends on how snugly your ham fits into the saucepan. Bring the pan to a boil and then cook at a fast simmer for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Partially cover the ham with a lid if the liquid is boiling away too much and the top of the ham is getting dry. Once the ham is cooked, remove it from the hot and now salty juice, and sit it on a board. If you want, you can actually cook this far ahead of schedule and then let it get entirely cold before glazing and roasting it. If that&#39;s the case, then cook it for about 1/2 hour less and then just let it get cold in the cooking liquid. On the day of cooking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. When the ham is cool enough to touch then cut and peel the rind off the cooked ham, making sure to leave a thin coating of the white fat on the ham. Score the fat into a diamond pattern with a sharp knife, and stud the points of each diamond with a clove. Heat the remaining glaze ingredients together in a saucepan until the jelly or sauce melts into the honey, mustard, and cinnamon to make a smooth but syrupy glaze; it needs to be thick enough not to run off the ham completely as it cooks in the oven. Sit the ham on a piece of foil in a roasting tin, which will give you an easier time later washing up, as the sugary glaze will burn as bits of it do inevitably dribble down the ham. Pour the glaze over the clove studded ham so that all of the scored fat is covered. Cook the ham for 15 minutes or until the fat is colored and burnished by the sugary glaze. If the ham is completely cold prior to glazing, then cook for 40 minutes at 350 degrees F, and turn up the heat to 425 degrees F for another 15 minutes. These timings are based on the ham being cold at room temperature, not refrigerator cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 47491,&quot;Everything Bagel Stuffing 6 tablespoons butter or margarine 1 large red onion, thinly sliced<br> 5 stalks of scallions, sliced, white and green parts separated<br> Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped chives, plus 2 teaspoons for garnish<br> 3 garlic cloves, minced<br> 1 1/2 to 2 cups chicken broth (depending on how big and dry the bagels are)<br> 2 large eggs<br> 2 tablespoons capers, optional<br> 5 large day-old everything bagels, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 8 cups)<br> Instructions: Place an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a 3.5 quart braiser over medium heat, melt butter. Add the onions and scallion whites. Season with salt and pepper and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the chives, garlic and scallion greens and cook for 2 more minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and the chives and scallions are slightly wilted. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together chicken broth and eggs. Add the capers if using, bagels and onion/butter mixture and fold to combine. Add additional chicken broth as needed (the bread should be well-hydrated but not mushy). Pour into the pan and bake for 30 minutes, or longer if you\u2019d like it to be browned more on top. Remove from the oven. Garnish with remaining chives. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47492,&quot;Italian Sausage and Egg Bake 1/2 small loaf country-style bread, cut into 1/2 to1-inch cubes (about 1 1/2 cups) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, finely diced 1 pound sweet Italian turkey sausage, casings removed One 10 to12-ounce package fresh baby spinach, drained One 6.5-ounce jar oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus extra for seasoning 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra for seasoning One 5-ounce log goat cheese, coarsely crumbled (about 1 1/2 cups) 6 large eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the bread cubes with 1 tablespoon oil and spread evenly in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the cubes begin to turn light golden around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes (do not over-brown as the bread cubes will continue to brown when baked atop the sausage in the dish). Remove from the oven and set aside. Heat the remaining oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sausage. Break up the sausage with a wooden spoon and cook until the sausage has cooked through and the onion is soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the spinach and cook, stirring frequently, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and basil. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread the mixture evenly into a 13-by-9-by-2-inch glass baking dish or ceramic baking dish. Sprinkle the goat cheese on the mixture and arrange the bread cubes on top. Make 6 slight indentations in the mixture, spacing apart. Cover and chill. This can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Crack 1 egg into each indentation, making sure to keep the yolks intact. Sprinkle the eggs lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bake until the egg whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 15 minutes (or 18 minutes for a fully cooked yolk). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 47493,&quot;Grandma Moore&#39;s Creamed Corn 6 slices bacon 8 large ears corn (preferably white), husks and silk removed Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: In a large skillet (seasoned cast iron does well here), cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crisp. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; reserve the drippings in the pan. Cut the stalk ends of the corn to make a flat surface, then stand the ears up and shave the corn from the cobs with a chef&#39;s knife, leaving about half of each kernel on the ear. With the back of the knife, scrape the cobs over a shallow dish to extract as much liquid as possible. (You should have equal parts kernels and liquid; add water if necessary.) Return the skillet to medium-low heat and add the kernels and liquid. Season the corn mixture lightly with salt and pepper and cook until creamy, stirring often, 30 to 45 minutes (add water if the pan gets too dry). Serve warm or at room temperature. Crumble the bacon on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 47494,&quot;Warm Octopus and Sweet Onion Salad with Fresh Sage and Lemon Vinaigrette 3 cups fresh lemon juice 1 shallot, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tablespoon honey 1 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 3 sage leaves, chiffonade 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup sugar 2 sweet onions, finely sliced 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 pounds octopus, cleaned 3 cups water 2 tablespoons aged sherry vinegar 4 wine corks 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1 bay leaf 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 1/4 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper Chopped fresh sage and parsley, for garnish Instructions: Lemon-Sage Vinaigrette: Place lemon juice, shallot, garlic and honey in a medium saucepan and reduce to 1/2 cup.

Marinate for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Heat a skillet or a saute pan large enough to hold the shrimp in 1 layer, and spoon 1 tablespoon of the oil from the marinade into the skillet. Carefully arrange the shrimp in the skillet and, over high heat, saute just to color, 30 to 40 seconds per side. (Do not overcook, as it will continue to cook on top of the pizza dough.) Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Season lightly with salt before arranging on the pizza dough. Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the dough to 4 (8-inch) rounds, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. Brush each of the rounds with the chili oil. Layer the pizza: Start with the mozzarella, then the Fontina, tomato, onion, shrimp, goat cheese, and red and yellow peppers. Gently slide the pizza onto the baking stone and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the pizza onto a firm surface and cut into slices with a pizza cutter or a very sharp knife. Serve immediately. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball.) Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.

Sprinkle on both sides with salt and black pepper. Set aside. Add the all-purpose flour to a baking dish. In another baking dish, stir together the almond flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs with 2 tablespoons water. Dredge both sides of the chicken breasts first in the AP flour, then the egg mixture and finally the almond flour mixture. Place the coated chicken back on the baking sheet. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. (Depending on the size of the breasts, you may need two skillets.) Add the butter and 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet. Add the garlic and rosemary and cook to infuse the oil, about 1 minute. Remove the rosemary and garlic from the skillet. Make sure the oil is hot enough to be quivering in the skillet, then add the chicken by placing it in and releasing it away from you. Shake the skillet to ensure it doesn&#39;t stick. (You can add the rosemary sprig back to the skillet if you want to infuse more flavor.) Cook until the chicken begins to brown, 3 to 4 minutes, then flip the chicken and cook until the other side is browned, another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and drain on a half-sheet tray fitted with a rack. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, honey, poppy seeds and 2 tablespoons water. Set aside. Season the arugula with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper to taste and toss. Add the apple slices and toss to coat. Plate the chicken and serve with the arugula salad. Drizzle the salad with the poppy seed sour cream. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 47500,&quot;Cheesy Cereal Crackers 1 cup rice cereal squares 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 3 ounces Pecorino Romano cheese 3 ounces Parmesan<br> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream, or as needed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Soak until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside. Whisk the sugar with the fish sauce and vinegar in a small bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium heat until hot and add 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil. Pour in the eggs, tilting the skillet as you pour to make a thin, even coating of egg. Cook until just set, about 45 seconds. Invert the eggs onto a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside. Add another 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil to the same skillet and heat over high heat. Add the shrimp, 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper flakes, and salt, to taste. Stir-fry until the shrimp are pink and just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons peanut oil over high heat. Add the garlic, shallots, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes and stir-fry until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add the tofu and cook about 2 minutes more.

In an electric mixer on low speed, combine the sugar and butter until well mixed. Turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl whisk together the baking powder, salt, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. In a separate smaller bowl whisk together the vanilla extract and egg whites, mixing well. Stir the pumpkin puree into the whites just until incorporated. In the bowl with the creamed butter and sugar add the flour and pumpkin mixtures about 1/3 at a time, mixing until just incorporated, ending with the pumpkin. Scrape down the bowl and beater and remove the beaters. With a rubber spatula fold the batter until it is one even color. Fold in the mini chocolate chips. Fill the prepared cupcake tin filling until the cups are almost full. Dip your fingers in a little bit of water and use it to pat down the mixture in each cup. Put the tin in the preheated oven and bake until a toothpick inserted comes out clean, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the tin to a wire rack and allow to cool to room temperature. Divide the buttercream. Leave the majority white for the base frosting and color approximately a quarter of the white in 3 portions with red, blue, and red and blue mixed together coloring (to make a black portion) to pipe the eyes. Unmold the cupcakes onto a work surface. Frost the cupcakes with the white buttercream and smooth it out with a knife or a small offset spatula. Fill 3 pastry bags with the blue buttercream (fitted with a ribbon tip) and the black and red butter cream (both fitted with small plain tips). Pipe on the iris of the eyes with blue buttercream. Pipe in the pupil with the black buttercream, also add a couple of black lines to the iris, as well. Pipe on veins using the red buttercream. Make sure to have a completely clean and dry bowl when you start your process, any fat or liquid at all in the bowl will stunt the protein development of the albumen (egg white protein) and you will not have a proper meringue at the end, the results could be disastrous. Start whipping the egg whites slowly in the mixer by themselves (no sugar or butter yet) until the whites are foamy. Increase the speed of the mixer and slowly start adding the sugar until all the sugar is incorporated. Once all the sugar is combined, increase the speed of the mixer even further and whip until the mixture is shiny and stiff. You now have a meringue. You know when your meringue is done when you pull out the whip, hold it horizontally, and you have what looks a \sparrow&#39;s beak\ on the end of the whip. Replace the whip, turn the mixer on medium and start adding the butter a bit at a time, once all the butter is incorporated, turn the mixer on high and leave it for a while. Depending on the weather, the buttercream could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to form. You will know when it has formed when you hear the motor of the mixer starting to slow down and whine a little bit. Also when you first add the butter, your meringue will break down and look nasty, this is good and is what you want. When the buttercream is done, the mixture will be homogeneous and consistent...and tasty. Remove the buttercream from the bowl and put in an airtight container. Buttercream can be kept at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 weeks, but always use warm buttercream when icing a cake. To warm up the buttercream, put it back in the mixer using the whip or the paddle, and apply direct heat to the mixer bowl with a propane torch you can find at any hardware store.

While you want the mixture to be smooth, keeping the blender on low will help you avoid whipping unnecessary air into the melon and lightening the flavor along with the color. Add a little ice water if the blender has trouble blending the melon, and if you feel the melon lacks sweetness, add honey to taste. Refrigerate until ready to make the drinks.<br> Put half each of the melon puree and gin, and 1 more tablespoon lemon juice in a shaker (or any container with a fitted lid) with a few ice cubes and shake until blended and cold. Strain into 2 chilled glasses. Rub the rim of each glass with the lemon wedge for a little added acidity when sipping, and garnish with melon balls.

Stir together the dry ingredients with a wooden spoon then make a well in the center. Pour in the water and 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir for 1 to 2 minutes until a stretchy, wet dough forms. Grease a large clean bowl with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and transfer in the dough. Lift and stretch the dough onto itself, bringing the edges into the center to form a tight-skinned ball. Flip the dough over, seam side down, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Once the dough has doubled, grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Punch down the dough and turn it out into the prepared pan, stretching the dough so that it covers the bottom of the pan and reaches into the corners. Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and set aside in a warm spot to rise for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place your oven rack in the lowest position and preheat your oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Prepare the sauce by combining the tomatoes, garlic, parsley, oregano and Italian seasoning in a bowl and season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Prepare the cheese by grating half and cutting the rest into 1-centimeter (1/2-inch) cubes. When the dough has risen, evenly scatter any toppings you\u2019re using straight onto the crust followed by the grated cheese, making sure to coat the whole crust including the very edges. Scatter the cubed mozzarella over top, again, paying particular attention to the very edges of the crust. Finally, dot the sauce over the cheese in a 4-by-3 grid. (You can also spoon the sauce onto the pizza in three long lines \u2013 the main thing is that you don\u2019t cover all of the cheese or crust with the sauce.) Bake the pizza for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the cheese has melted, is golden brown all over and is super crispy around the edges. Allow the pizza to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before cutting into twelve squares and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 47518,&quot;Herb-Stuffed Whole Fish 4 branzino or dorade, scaled and gutted (look for 12- to 14-ounce fish) Kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper 2 lemons, cut crosswise into paper-thin rounds 1 bunch fresh thyme 1 bunch fresh oregano 1/2 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley 4 12-inch skewers 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Place a large oven-safe saute pan or baking sheet on the lower rack of the oven to preheat. Season the belly cavity of the fish with salt and pepper. Place 2 or 3 lemon slices and a few sprigs each of thyme, oregano and parsley into the cavity of each fish. Really, just fill the cavities with all the lemon and herbs that will fit. Now for the fun part! Close the cavity of each fish by \sewing\ a skewer through the skin: Hold the skin together, tucking in the herbs, and weave the skewer up and down through the skin to seal the cavity. The skewer stays in while the fish is cooking. Season the outside of the fish with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Divide the olive oil among the 4 fish and use your fingers to rub it on, coating them well on all sides. Carefully remove the preheated pan from the oven and gently place the fish in it. There should be a searing noise -- that means you&#39;re doing it right! Return the pan to the oven and roast the fish for 15 minutes. Remove the fish from the oven and let rest for 2 minutes. Carefully remove the skewers and place the fish (herbs and all) on large plates for serving. Since these are whole fish, be mindful of the bones as you eat, and advise your guests to be careful as well. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 47519,&quot;Sausage Stuffed Quail 4 slices bacon 1/2 cup dry port wine 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 3 cups baby arugula, washed and dried Pinch crushed red pepper<br> Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 fennel bulb, cut into 1/4-inch dice 1/4 onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice 1/2 pound bulk fennel sausage 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano 1 egg 1/2 bunch fresh Italian parsley, finely chopped 4 semi-boneless quail, wingtips removed<br> Instructions: Coat a large saute pan lightly with olive oil. Toss in the fennel, onions and crushed red pepper. Season with salt and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Cook the onions and fennel until they are soft and wilted but don&#39;t have any color, 7 to 8 minutes. Turn off the heat and let them cool. In a bowl, combine the sausage, breadcrumbs, Parmigiano, egg, parsley and cooked onions and fennel. Mix well to combine. Divide the stuffing among the 4 quail. Press each quail to lightly flatten and evenly disperse the stuffing. Wrap each quail with a bacon slice and secure the bacon with a toothpick. Tie the quail&#39;s legs together with butcher&#39;s twine (otherwise they will look like road kill). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Sprinkle the quail with salt and add it to the pan. Brown them really well on each side, 3 to 4 minutes. When the quail are brown on both sides, transfer the quail to a baking sheet and put them in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven, remove the toothpicks and reserve the quail. Meanwhile, ditch the fat from the pan and add the port wine. Cook the wine over medium heat until it has reduced by half. Add 3/4 cup chicken stock, season with salt and reduce by half. Add the remaining chicken stock and reduce it by about three-quarters, or until it seems a little bit thickened. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Divide the arugula among 4 serving plates. Place a quail on each pile of arugula and spoon some of the sauce on the quail and the arugula. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 47520,&quot;Christmas Chutney 1 pound 8 1/2 ounces (750 grams) Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored 9 ounces (250 ounces) dried cranberries 1 onion, finely chopped 12 fluid ounces (350 ml) apple cider vinegar 7 ounces (200 grams) sugar 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 2 teaspoons salt Instructions: Slice the apples into halves.

Let the berries sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, until they start to soften and release their juices. Transfer the mixture to a medium nonreactive saucepan, add the jam and cook over medium-high heat until slightly softened. Coarsely mash the berries using a potato masher or the back of a fork and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens to a jam-like consistency, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until cold and thickened further, at least 2 hours. For the milkshake: Combine the milk and 1/2 cup strawberry base in the blender and blend for 5 seconds. Add the ice cream and blend until smooth, about 10 seconds. Top with more strawberry base, the Sugar Biscuit and a strawberry for garnish, if using. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Using a dough cutter, combine until the ingredients are incorporated. Scatter the cold butter pieces over the top of the flour mixture and continue to combine until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the buttermilk and mix just until the dough begins to come together. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter. Pat the dough into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut out the biscuits. Press together the scraps of dough and repeat the process. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; brush the tops with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Bake the biscuits until lightly golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops with the remaining melted butter. Yield: 8 biscuits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 47522,&quot;Bacon Prawns with Cheese Dip 8 thin slices bacon 8 roasted jalapenos, split in 1/2 and seeded 16 large prawns, peeled and deveined Freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey jack cheese (Chihuahua cheese is great here too!) 3/4 cup cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut each piece of bacon in half and put them on a baking sheet. Bake until just half cooked, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and set aside until cool enough to handle. Hold 1 strip the roasted jalapeno in the belly of each prawn and wrap it with half a piece of bacon. Secure with a toothpick and season with pepper, to taste. Arrange the prawns on parchment lined baking sheet and bake until the prawns are just cooked, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile make the cheese sauce by adding the cheese and cream to a glass bowl. Put the bowl over a pot of simmering water, being sure that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Slowly stir until the cheese is melted into the cream and is fully blended. Transfer the prawns to a serving platter and serve the cheese sauce alongside.

Add the sugar and place the bowl over a double boiler. Melt until the gelatin and sugar are dissolved and the mixture is smooth and clear. Skim the top, if necessary, and discard.<br> To make the container in which you will create the gelatin bottle mold, you will need a piece of aluminum flashing that is at least 3 inches longer than the height of the bottle and wide enough to wrap around the bottle 1 1/2 times. Curve the flashing, creating a container the bottle can lay in with at least 1-inch of space on all sides. Seal the open sides completely with duct tape and tape a wooden spoon or spatula along the top of the flashing on each side to add extra rigidity to the mold. The final product should look like the template.<br> Pour a 1-inch thick layer of the hot gelatin liquid into the bottom of the mold. Place in the refrigerator and allow to set. When the gelatin is very firm, remove from the refrigerator. Heat the remaining gelatin so it is a liquid consistency if it has started to solidify. Place the champagne bottle on top of the firm gelatin. Pour the remaining gelatin liquid over the bottle, covering the top by about 1-inch. Let this sit until the gelatin begins to gel. Move it to the refrigerator and allow to set until the gelatin is very firm. When it is firm, remove it from the refrigerator cut the duct tape on the ends and peel away the aluminum flashing so you are left with only the bottle completely encased in gelatin. Using a sharp paring knife, slice the mold the long way into two identical halves. Remove the champagne bottle.<br> For the Chocolate Bottle: Fill one half of the mold with chocolate. Place a wire rack so it sits on top of (not inside) a deep roasting pan. Overturn the filled mold onto the wire rack. The excess chocolate will drain from the mold. Allow the chocolate to set slightly. This is important because once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat with the other half of the mold. Unmold both chocolate bottle halves by pulling the gelatin away from the chocolate. If you are not going to fill the bottle with candies or truffles, use tempered chocolate to glue the two halves together to create the bottle.<br> For the Decorated Label: You can either paint the label freehand or use a silk screen kit. Either way, start by using a rolling pin to roll the chocolate plastic about 1/8-inch thick. If you are going to paint freehand, use a paring knife to cut a square the size of the label you would like to make. Mix up your paints by combining the cocoa butter and the powdered food coloring in a 6-to-1 ratio, respectively. Add the cocoa butter slowly until you achieve a medium thickness. The best way to store and warm your paints while you are using them is in a yogurt machine. Use a paintbrush to paint the label.<br> If you are using a silk screen kit, start by melting the unsweetened chocolate over a double boiler. Hold the silk screen over the rolled out chocolate plastic. Using a plastic scraper with a straight edge, apply about a teaspoon of melted chocolate to the silkscreen, and gently pull it across the design. Carefully lift off the silk screen. It will dry almost immediately. Using a paring knife, cut out the label.<br> For the Gold Top: Combine the gold dust with the liqueur in a 6-to-1 ratio, respectively. Use the gold paint to coat the top of the bottle to represent the gold foil typically found on champagne bottles. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]&quot; 47524,&quot;Villa Maria&#39;s Lemon Tiramisu 5 egg whites 5 tablespoons/71 g sugar, plus extra if desired Juice of 1/2 lemon 2 cups/470 ml whipping cream 1 cup/235 ml limoncello liqueur (lemon-flavored), plus an extra splash Freshly grated zest of 1 lemon, plus more for sprinkling 1 cup/235 ml water 40 Italian &#39;Savoiardi&#39; lady finger cookies Lemon-infused white chocolate, chopped, for topping Instructions: In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites, sugar, and lemon juice together until you achieve white fluffy peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk the whipping cream until fluffy. Fold in the egg white mixture, a splash of limoncello, the lemon zest and carefully fold into the whipping cream. In another bowl, combine 1 cup limoncello with water. Add more water (to dilute the limoncello) and sugar, if desired. Lightly dip both sides of each lady finger cookie in the limoncello mixture. The exterior of the cookie should be wet while the interior should remain somewhat dry. Arrange the dipped cookies in one tightly packed layer on the bottom of a cake pan. Spread 1/2 of the cream mixture evenly over the cookies, making sure the cookies are completely covered. Add a second layer of dipped lady fingers, and then evenly spread the remaining cream mixture on top. Sprinkle the top with lemon zest and lemon-infused white chocolate. Unlike the traditional tiramisu, this version can be served immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 47525,&quot;Bowtie Pasta with Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper Sauce 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 3 large garlic cloves, minced 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil, drained and chopped 1/2 cup coarsely chopped jarred roasted red peppers 1 (28-ounce) can plum tomatoes 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to season Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup lightly packed fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces 1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves 12 ounces bow-ties pasta (farfalle) 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, optional Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Remove from the heat and cool the mixture to 120 degrees F. Grease a bowl with oil. In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the cooled milk mixture, 1 cup of the flour, the sugar, salt, egg and yeast. Mix with a dough hook on low for 3 minutes. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour and mix on low until the dough forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the speed of the mixer up to medium-high and knead the dough for 8 minutes. Transfer the dough to the greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap and kitchen towel. Place the dough in a warm place and allow it to proof for 2 hours. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and roll out to a 1/4-inch thick sheet. Spread the butter over the surface of the dough leaving about a 1/2-inch border around the edges uncovered. In a bowl combine the brown sugar, granulated sugar and cinnamon. Spread an even layer of the filling on top of the buttered dough. Roll up the sheet of dough into a log. With the seam-side down cut the log into 12 to 16 even portions. Place the portions in large muffin tins and allow them to proof again until the buns fill the muffin tin. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes. For the pecans: In a pan, combine the brown sugar and 2 tablespoons water, and cook until the water is cooked off and the sugar is melted. In a bowl, toss the pecan pieces with the melted sugar. Spread the coated pecans on a sheet pan and cool. Break up the candied pecans once they are cooled, and reserve for later use. For the caramel sauce: In a pot over medium heat, combine the sugar and corn syrup. Stir regularly until the sugar begins to melt, about 10 minutes. Once melted, stir the sugar until it reaches a golden-caramel color. Remove the caramel from the heat and slowly stir in the heavy cream. Stir in the butter and hold. In a saute pan, heat the oil. Add the apples and saute until tender. Add the rum and flambe. Add the apples to the caramel sauce and simmer to marry the flavors, 2 to 3 minutes. To serve, warm 6 of the cinnamon buns and place the one bun in the center of each plate. Spoon the apple-rum caramel sauce over the cinnamon buns. Sprinkle the candied pecans over the caramel sauce. Top the dressed cinnamon buns with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47555,&quot;Lefse Hot Dogs with Fennel Slaw 2 tablespoons sour cream 1 teaspoon cider vinegar<br> 1/4 teaspoon celery seeds<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 large bulb fennel, thinly sliced (about 2 cups), plus 1/4 cup fennel fronds<br> 1 small red onion, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 cup whole-grain mustard<br> 2 tablespoons lingonberry preserves<br> 6 hot dogs<br> Vegetable oil, as needed<br> Six 6-inch pieces lefse (or 6-inch flour tortillas), warmed Instructions: Combine the sour cream, cider vinegar, celery seeds, a pinch of salt and some pepper in a medium bowl.

Process until smooth and thick. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 47572,&quot;Chocolate and Vanilla Vacherin 5 large egg whites 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 1/3 cups powdered sugar For chocolate ice cream: 2 cups whole milk 3 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped 4 large egg yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 vanilla bean 2 cups whole milk 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 1/2 tablespoons honey 4 large egg yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar Instructions: 1 2/3 cups heavy cream 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/2 vanilla bean The process of baking meringue is a cross between baking it and drying it. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Prepare the meringue cake layer: Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until foamy. Make a French meringue by adding the granulated sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and whip to stiff but not dry peaks, about 7 minutes. Delicately fold in the powdered sugar with a rubber spatula. It is important to fold as gently as possible to avoid deflating the meringue. Place the meringue in a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch plain tip. Draw 2 (8-inch) circles on a sheet of parchment paper by tracing around the outside of an 8-inch cake pan with a pen. Turn the paper over so the drawing is face down (so that the ink does not bake into the meringue) and place on a baking sheet. To pipe the disks, hold the pastry bag at a slight angle about 1 1/2 inches above the parchment paper. This height and angle allows the piped meringue to hold the full shape of the 3/4-inch tip. Start at the center of the circle and pipe the meringue in a spiral to the edge of the outline. (I work counter-clockwise because I am right-handed.) If the meringue breaks while you are piping it, just continue where it broke. If any air bubbles appear on the disk, go back and fill them in with the extra meringue left in the piping bag. It takes practice to get the disks perfectly round. Don&#39;t worry if yours are slightly misshapen. You can gently scrape away the imperfections after the disks are baked. At this time, pipe additional swirls that are about 2-inches wide and the height of your cake mold. These will be used to decorate the outside of the cake. Bake the meringue disks until they are firm to the touch, about 1 hour. If the meringue begins to take on color while baking, lower the oven temperature by 50 degrees F (10 C). Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place on a wire rack until the meringue disks have completely cooled. If you have the time, turn off the oven and cool the meringue on the baking sheet in the oven. This will take about 1 hour and will allow the meringue to dry completely. While the meringue disks are baking, prepare the ice cream. Prepare the ice cream and allow enough time for them to harden in the freezer. Have the ice bath ready before you begin. To prepare an ice bath, fill a 4-quart bowl with ice cubes. Generously sprinkle salt over the ice and add water to cover the ice. Place a clean, dry 2-quart bowl over the ice bath. To prepare the chocolate ice cream base: Heat the milk and chopped chocolate together in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan (this will keep the milk from burning) over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edge of the pan. While the milk is heating, combine the sugar and egg yolks and whisk until thoroughly incorporated and thick. Temper the egg mixture by pouring about half of the hot milk into it and whisk well. Now pour the tempered egg mixture into the remaining hot milk and chocolate. Cook over medium-high heat until slightly thickened, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula. The mixture has finished cooking when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spatula, about 3 to 5 minutes. Use the following method to tell if it is finished: Quickly dip the spatula into the hot mixture and hold it horizontally in front of you. With the tip of your finger, wipe a clean line down the center of the spatula. If the mixture holds and does not fill in the line, it is ready to be removed from the heat. If the line fills with liquid, the mixture must be cooked a little longer. Repeat the test every 30 seconds until ready. At no time should the mixture begin to boil. If you see bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan, remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture thoroughly to cool it down. Once the mixture has finished cooking, pour it into a clean bowl and set aside to cool. If you want to reduce the cooling time, you can cool the chocolate ice cream base over an ice bath. When the mixture is cool, spin it according to the type of ice cream machine you are using. The ice cream is ready when it is creamy and smooth, like the consistency of soft-serve ice cream. Place the ice cream in an airtight container and store in the freezer until ready to use. While the chocolate ice cream base is cooling, prepare the vanilla ice cream base. The technique is the same as above; heat the milk, cream, honey and vanilla bean in a nonreactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edge. Before adding the vanilla bean, use a sharp paring knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the mixture. While the milk is heating, combine the sugar and egg yolks and whisk until thoroughly incorporated and thick. Temper the egg mixture, then pour the tempered egg mixture into the hot milk and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened enough to coat the back of the spatula. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture into the bowl placed over the ice bath. Remove the vanilla bean. Stir the mixture occasionally to distribute the cooler parts. When completely cooled, remove the bowl from the ice bath and puree the mixture until smooth with an immersion blender, food processor, or blender. Spin the ice cream in your ice cream machine and store in an airtight container in the freezer until ready to use. The next step is to mold the ice cream into the cake pan. Line a cake pan with parchment. You may need to slightly soften the ice cream. Make a 1 1/2?inch thick layer of the chocolate ice cream in the bottom of the cake pan. Make a 1 1/2?inch thick layer of the vanilla ice cream on top of the chocolate. Place the cake pan in the freezer and let harden. If you want to decorate the ice sculpture with ice cream balls, use an ice cream scoop to shape the remaining ice cream into ice cream balls of various sizes. Place the scoops on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and place in the freezer until hardened. Once the meringue disks are baked and the ice cream is molded, it is time to assemble the Vacherin. Remove the cake pan from the freezer. It may be necessary to dip the pan in warm water for a few seconds to unmold the ice cream. Once unmolded, place a meringue disk on top of the molded chocolate ice cream. Cover with a plate or cardboard cake circle and flip so the vanilla is now on top. Place a meringue disk on top of the vanilla and place the molded cake back in the freezer. To make the whipped cream: Use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Place the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla seeds in a medium-size bowl and whip to stiff peaks with an electric mixer on medium-high speed. Remove the Vacherin from the freezer. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch star tip with the whipped cream and use it to decorate the top and side. Using a turntable will make this task easier. Keep the Vacherin in the freezer until ready to serve. It is easiest to cut the cake with a hot serrated knife. To heat the knife, dip it in a tall container filled with hot water before each cut and wipe off the excess water. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 47573,&quot;Blueberry Focaccia 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil All-purpose flour, for dusting One 1-pound loaf frozen bread dough, such as Bridgford, thawed 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon<br> 1 cup blueberries<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> Instructions: Brush a 9-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.

In a large mixing bowl, combine granulated sugar and oil until blended. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and cloves. Add to egg mixture alternating with pumpkin, beating well after each addition.\u202f<br> Evenly coat a 10-inch fluted tube pan with nonstick cooking spray. Fill pan three-quarters full with cake batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack. Remove pan and let cake cool completely. For the top cake: When the tube pan has completely cooled, repeat making the cake batter, baking and cooling a second cake. Trim the bottom of each cake flat.<br> For the green buttercream: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar. Mix on low speed until crumbly. Add milk or cream a little at a time while mixing on low speed until mixture is of spreading consistency.\u202fIncrease speed to high and whip until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla extract and food color. Beat until the buttercream is consistently green with no white streaks remaining.\u202f Place a bundt cake cut-side up on a cake board or serving plate. Place 1 cup of green buttercream on top of the cake and spread evenly. Top with the second cake cut-side down. Press gently to adhere. Cover remaining green buttercream with a damp towel so it doesn&#39;t dry out. For the black chocolate buttercream: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and dark cocoa powder. Mix on low speed until crumbly. Add milk or cream a little at a time while mixing on low speed until mixture is of spreading consistency. Increase speed to high and whip until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla extract and food color. Beat until the buttercream is consistently black with no white streaks remaining. Frost the entire cake with dark chocolate buttercream. Spread as evenly as possible. Use a folded 6-inch square piece of parchment paper to smooth the buttercream on the sides of the cake. Hold the paper with both hands and place the edge at the bottom of the cake and smooth upward into a round shape. Use fresh parchment squares as needed. Transfer to the refrigerator and let chill until firm, about 20 minutes. Transfer the remaining black buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a small star tip (#14). Set aside for later use.<br> For the decorations: Remove the cake from the refrigerator and fill the middle with green buttercream. Add additional green buttercream to the top of the cake and spread some over one side, as if the buttercream is cascading off the side of the cauldron. Immediately cover the green buttercream with the green ball-shaped candies. Add the green sugar pearls and allow them to fall into the cracks between the larger ball-shaped candies. Transfer the cake to the refrigerator and chill until firm, about 20 minutes. To make the witch legs: Melt the purple candy wafers and orange candy wafers in separate bowls according to the package directions. Using a serrated knife, gently trim away 1/8 inch from one end of two pretzel rods. Place toothpicks in the ends of the pretzels; press in firmly to secure. Hold one pretzel rod by the toothpick end and dip it into the orange melted candy. Use a spoon to help cover it completely. Allow excess to drip back into the bowl. Insert the toothpick end upright into Styrofoam and let stand until set. Repeat process with the purple melted candy. Use leftover orange melted candy to adhere black confetti sprinkles on the orange leg to create \polka dots.\ Wind the licorice lace around the purple pretzel rod; adhere at each end using leftover purple melted candy. Let stand until set.<br> Knead together five chocolate candy chews using the heat of your hands to soften the candy (stale chews will be tough, and can be microwaved for 5 seconds to make pliable). Using your fingers, manipulate the chocolate mass into a witch shoe shape with curled toes. Repeat with the remaining chocolate candy chews to make a second shoe.<br> Trim away the ends of the toothpicks in the dipped pretzel rods to approximately 1/2 inch. Place a dot of leftover melted candy on each toothpick stub; press a shaped chocolate shoe onto each toothpick. Chill until the candy is set, about 10 minutes. Heat the black candy melting wafers until melted and smooth, according to the package directions. Dip the shoe ends of the witch legs in the black candy; remove to a parchment-lined sheet pan. Allow the candy to stand until set, about 20 minutes. To make the witch hat: Use a small paring knife or a kitchen-dedicated X-Acto knife to trim away the pointed end of the sugar cone; cut diagonally using sawing motions until the end can be snapped off. Dip the pointed end in leftover melted candy and attach angled downward to the cone (creating the \crook\ in the witch hat). Let stand until set. Dip the large end of the cone in leftover melted candy and center on the pizzelle cookie; let stand until set. When the two pieces are well adhered together, dip it in black melted candy, using a spoon to coat entirely. Allow the candy to set, about 15 minutes. To make the witch broom: Gather together the yellow fruity sour laces and trim them to approximately 4 to 5 inches in length using a pair of kitchen-dedicated scissors. Lay the pieces on a parchment-lined baking sheet.<br> Melt the yellow candy wafers according to the package directions. Dip the end of the remaining pretzel rod into the yellow candy and place the dipped end onto the fruit laces. Use extra yellow melted candy to adhere the strands together. Wind an orange fruit lace around the yellow fruit laces toward the pretzel end of the broomstick.<br> To decorate: Remove the cauldron cake from the refrigerator and use the reserved black chocolate buttercream to pipe witchy swirls along the bottom edge of the cauldron. Insert the leg pieces upright into the top of the cake near one edge of the cake. Place the broom into the cake slightly off center with the bristles pointing upright. Pipe leftover buttercream on the bottom of the witch hat and adhere to the top edge of the cake, opposite of the legs and broom.<br> Allow the cake to come to room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47595,&quot;Blue Ribbon Almond Roca Cookies 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup dark brown sugar 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup butter, room temperature 2 eggs, room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 package toffee bits 1 cup coarsely ground almonds 4 ounces milk chocolate 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.

For the carnitas: After you&#39;ve made the carnitas rub, apply it to the 5 portioned pieces of pork shoulder. Refrigerate overnight. Preheat the convection oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a heavy-bottomed large braising pot and add the oil. Just before the oil reaches the smoking point, carefully add in the pork shoulder pieces, one piece at a time. Careful not to crowd the meat -- you want it to cook evenly brown all around and get a good caramelization on the meat, turning it as little as possible. If your braising pot is too small for all 5 pieces at once, do it in small batches, eventually transferring everything into another pot which will go into the oven. Once the pork is browned evenly, remove and set aside on a baking sheet. While the pan is still hot, add the onions into the same pan and sweat down. Then add in your garlic and bay leaves and cook for about 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the beer, using a wooden spoon to scrape and release all the tasty browned bits of porky goodness. Reduce the beer by half, and then add in the orange juice. Bring to a boil, return the pork to the braising pot followed by the orange halves, cover the pot and place into the oven. Cook until the pork is tender and pulls apart easily, about 3 1/2 hours. Reserve the pork braising liquid which you can use to heat the pulled pork back up before you add the BBQ sauce to it. For the house-made ketchup: Mix the water and vinegar together in a large bowl. Mix the tomato paste with the honey, sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, cayenne and garlic powder in a large heavy-bottomed non-reactive saucepot. Mix in the liquids. Whisk everything together over medium heat on your stove top. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat and allow to simmer 1 1/2 hours. Taste for salt balance, then strain through a fine mesh strainer. This is the first part of the Calafia BBQ sauce. For the Calafia hot sauce: Combine the tomato paste, water, tamarind paste, orange juice, pinot noir, vinegar, fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce, carrots, celery, onions habaneros, jalapenos, chipotles, ginger, brown sugar, coriander and cumin in a large heavy-bottomed non-reactive saucepot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Transfer the mixture to a high-powered blender and puree until ultra-smooth. Pass the hot sauce through a fine mesh strainer and taste for salt balance. To make the Calafia BBQ sauce you combine 2/3 of the Calafia house-made ketchup to 1/3 of the Calafia hot sauce. If you like your sauce spicier, you can always add more hot sauce to the ketchup. Once you&#39;ve blended your sauces together well, introduce the sauce to the braised and pulled pork. Mix small amounts of pork to sauce until you&#39;ve achieved the saucy desired delicious porky consistency. Now your pork is sauced and ready serve over steamed organic brown rice, sauteed organic baby spinach and roasted yams. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 47602,&quot;Nuts About Fruit Cake 3 tablespoons butter or margarine 1 package (10 oz., about 40) regular marshmallows</p><ul><li>OR - 4 cups miniature marshmallows 5 1/2 cups KELLOGG&#39;S?

Prepare the bottom and sides of the baking dish with the butter. In a large bowl, add the croissant and bread chunks along with the chocolate chips sprinkled over the top. Toss gently and pour into the prepared dish making sure all the chocolate chips don&#39;t settle on the bottom. In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, chocolate syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg and eggs. Pour the chocolate custard over the bread in the baking dish and press the bread down into the custard to soak it up. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Then press down a bit again. For the topping: In a medium bowl, toss the butter with the flour to coat all sides of the butter. Then add the pecans, brown sugar, salt and cinnamon. Mix together with your hands to get the butter to blend into all the ingredients. Sprinkle evenly over the top of the baking dish. Bake uncovered until the edges are golden brown and the center springs back a bit when touched, 45 to 50 minutes.

Using a paring knife, make an incision the length of each jalapeno (don&#39;t cut the peppers in half). Remove the seeds then carefully fill each pepper with cheese. Dip the stuffed peppers in buttermilk then roll them in flour. (If you prefer a thicker crust, repeat the process.) Fill a large frying pan with about 3 inches of oil and heat over medium-high until a thermometer registers a temperature of 350 degrees F. (The oil temperature can also be tested by dripping a little water into the oil. If the oil sizzles immediately, the oil is hot enough.) Working in batches, fry the peppers, turning them once or twice, until they are crisp and golden. Drain the peppers on paper towels. Let them cool for about 10 minutes then serve them on a bed of shredded lettuce topped with sour cream. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 47606,&quot;Grilled Bread Pudding with Fresh Fruit 2 ripe peaches, pitted and sliced 1 pint raspberries 2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed 1/2 loaf brioche (about 8 ounces bread) 2 cups half-and-half 2 cups heavy cream 1 pinch salt 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 6 eggs 1 cup granulated sugar Confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Toss together the peaches, raspberries and brown sugar. Set aside to macerate. Preheat the grill. Slice the bread. Arrange on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully to make sure they do not brown too much; set aside to cool. In a saucepan, heat the half-and-half, cream, salt and vanilla bean over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse 10 to 15 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and granulated sugar together. Whisking constantly, gradually add the hot cream mixture. Strain into a large shallow bowl to smooth the mixture and remove the vanilla bean. Dip the toasted bread slices into the custard, and let soak until absorbed. Fold the mixture occasionally to ensure even soaking. Transfer the slices to the grill and cook about 5 minutes on each side.

Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the macaroni until al dente according to the package instructions. Drain, rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process and set aside. Carefully cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Drizzle half of the squash with olive oil and place it on a rimmed baking sheet cut-side up (reserve the other half of the squash in the fridge for another use). Roast, watching to make sure the surface doesn&#39;t get burned (it should have some brown areas, however), until fork-tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Scrape out the flesh into a bowl and mash with a potato masher. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside. While the squash is roasting, add the onions and 2 tablespoons of the butter to a large, ovenproof skillet over low to medium-low heat. Cook the onions, stirring occasionally, until they&#39;re deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove them to a plate. In the same skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat. Sprinkle over the flour and whisk it to make a thin paste. Cook it for 2 minutes, then whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking gently, until slightly thick, a couple of minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings. You&#39;ll probably want to add more salt! Turn the heat to low and stir in the mashed butternut squash. When it is warm, stir in the cheese. If the sauce is overly thick when the cheese is melted, add a splash of milk. Keep stirring until the sauce is nice and hot, then stir in the macaroni. Taste and add more salt if needed. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a pan and combine it with the breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the macaroni and bake (I do it straight in the skillet) until the crumbs are golden and the edges bubbly, about 15 minutes.

When quite hot, add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the corn and cook for a minute or two longer, then scrape the mixture into a bowl. Return the skillet to the heat without washing it and add the damp spinach. Cook, stirring constantly, until just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Scoop into a colander set in the sink and use a spoon to gently press out excess moisture. Let the vegetables cool, then scoop the spinach in with the mushrooms and corn and season with the salt. Pour a little of the remaining oil into a small skillet to lightly coat the bottom and set over medium heat until hot. One at a time, quick-fry the tortillas for a few seconds per side just to soften them. As the oil is used up, add a little more, let it heat a moment, then continue frying tortillas. Drain the tortillas in a single layer on paper towels, blotting them dry with additional towels. Cut the tortillas in half. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a 13 x 9-inch baking dish. In a medium-size bowl, mix the salsa with the cream or yogurt. Spread a thin layer of the salsa mixture over the bottom of the baking dish, then cover with 8 tortilla halves. Evenly top with half of the vegetables, a scant 11/2 cups of the remaining salsa mixture and 1 cup of the shredded cheese. Add another layer of 8 tortilla halves. Spread with the ricotta and another scant 11/2 cups of the salsa mixture. Top that second layer with a third round of 8 tortilla halves, the remaining vegetables, another portion of salsa mixture and 1 cup of the shredded cheese. For the final layer, evenly lay out the remaining tortillas, spread with the remaining salsa mixture (making sure to completely cover the tortillas) and evenly sprinkle on the remaining 1 cup shredded cheese. Cover lightly with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until bubbling and lightly browned.

Tear off 2 pieces of foil about 12 inches longer than the baguette and stack on top of each other. Cut the chicken crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Set up a breading station with 3 shallow dishes: Stir together the flour and 1 teaspoon salt in the first dish; beat the egg and 3 tablespoons of the hot sauce in the second dish and add the breadcrumbs to the third dish. Coat each strip of chicken first in the flour, then dip in the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off. Then press into the breadcrumbs. Transfer to a plate.<br> Line a second plate with a paper towel. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until a piece of the breading sizzles when added. Add the breaded chicken to the oil, making sure the pieces don&#39;t touch. Fry until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove to the lined plate.<br> Cut the baguette into 4 equal pieces (about the same length as the chicken pieces). Use a paring knife to hollow out the insides of each piece of baguette.<br> Lay a piece of chicken on top of a slice of mozzarella and dash with a little more hot sauce if desired. Wrap the cheese around the chicken and stuff inside one of the baguette pieces. Repeat with the remaining chicken, cheese, hot sauce (if using) and bread pieces. Slice each stuffed baguette piece into thirds and arrange them together tightly on top of the foil.<br> Put the butter, garlic and remaining 1 tablespoon hot sauce in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until the butter is melted. Pour the mixture over the top of the baguette pieces and fold the foil over to enclose the baguette.<br> Bake until the chicken is cooked through, the cheese is melted and the top of the bread is starting to turn brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer the foil pack to a cutting board and unwrap.

Blanch the spinach leaves for 2 minutes in boiling water and let cool. Butterfly the shrimp (split them down the center, cutting almost but not completely through) and open them flat to resemble a butterfly shape. Dip the shrimp in cornstarch between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound the shrimp to a 1/16-inch thickness. Place 1 spinach leaf on each shrimp. Pipe a 2-inch strip of cream cheese from head to tail down the center of the spinach. Arrange a strip of bell pepper along one side of the cream cheese. Roll the flattened shrimp and refrigerate. A few minutes before serving time, dredge the shrimp rolls lightly in the seasoned flour, then in the egg whites, and then in the bread crumbs. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a nonstick ovenproof frying pan, heat the olive oil until hot. Brown the breaded shrimp rolls until golden brown. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Slice on the diagonal. Serve with the Tequila-Lime Relish. Mix all the ingredients and let stand for 1 hour. For garnish, use carrot peels and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 47616,&quot;Creamy Pistachio Pops One 12-ounce can evaporated milk 4 Earl Grey tea bags 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk 1 cup heavy cream Handful finely chopped pistachios, plus extra for garnish Instructions: In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the evaporated milk to a simmer until small bubbles form around the circumference of the pot. Meanwhile, snip the tops of the tea bags and add to the evaporated milk. Whisk in the cardamom. Once the milk is simmering, turn the heat off, cover and let sit and steep for 30 minutes. Strain the evaporated milk into a large bowl. Whisk in the condensed milk, heavy cream and pistachios. Pour the mixture into ice pop molds, small bowls or a large bowl. Cover the bowls with a piece of plastic wrap to avoid freezer burn and the formation of a \skin.\ Pop them into the freezer and freeze overnight.

Line 3 baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment. Measure the confectioners&#39; sugar and almond flour by spooning them into measuring cups and leveling with a knife. Transfer to a bowl; whisk to combine. Sift the sugar-almond flour mixture, a little at a time, through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing with a rubber spatula to pass through as much as possible. It will take a while, and up to 2 tablespoons of coarse almond flour may be left; save for another use. Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt with a mixer on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to medium high; gradually add the superfine sugar and beat until stiff and shiny, about 5 more minutes. Transfer the beaten egg whites to the bowl with the almond flour mixture. Fold in the egg whites by drawing a rubber spatula halfway through the mixture and folding until incorporated, giving the bowl a quarter turn with each fold. Add the desired food coloring and extract (see below). Continue folding and turning, scraping down the bowl, until the batter is smooth and falls off the spatula in a thin flat ribbon, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. Holding the bag vertically and close to the baking sheet, pipe 1 1/4-inch circles (24 per sheet). Firmly tap the baking sheets twice against the counter to release any air bubbles. Let the cookies sit at room temperature until the tops are no longer sticky to the touch, 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the humidity. Slip another baking sheet under the first batch (a double baking sheet protects the cookies from the heat). Bake the first batch until the cookies are shiny and rise 1/8 inch to form a \foot,\ 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat, using a double sheet for each batch. Peel the cookies off the mats and sandwich with a thin layer of filling (see below). Almond-Raspberry: Tint the batter with 2 drops neon pink gel food coloring; flavor with almond extract. Fill with seedless raspberry jam (you&#39;ll need about 3/4 cup). Mint-White Chocolate: Tint the batter with 2 drops mint green gel food coloring; flavor with mint extract. For the filling, microwave 3 ounces chopped white chocolate, 2 tablespoons heavy cream and 1 tablespoon butter in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon mint extract and 1 drop mint green gel food coloring. Blueberry Cheesecake: Tint the batter with 3 drops royal blue gel food coloring; flavor with vanilla extract. For the filling, mix 4 ounces softened cream cheese and 3 tablespoons blueberry jam. Lavender-Honey: Tint the batter with 2 drops violet gel food coloring; flavor with almond or vanilla extract. For the filling, mix 3/4 cup mascarpone cheese, 2 tablespoons honey and 1 teaspoon ground dried lavender. Pineapple: Tint the batter with 2 drops lemon yellow gel food coloring; flavor with vanilla extract. For the filling, press 3/4 cup pineapple jam through a sieve, discarding any large pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 47619,&quot;White Kiwi Sangria 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup water 1 (750 ml) bottle white wine 1 cup orange liqueur, see Cook&#39;s Note* 1/2 cup lemon juice 4 kiwis, peeled and cut in thin slices (save a few slices for garnish) 2 green apples with skin, cored and cut in 1/2-inch cubes 1 1/2 cups green seedless grapes 1 bottle soda water (1 liter) Ice cubes Instructions: A small saucepan, heat the water, add the sugar and stir to dissolve to make a simple syrup. In a large pitcher, combine the white wine, the Triple Sec the lemon juice, the kiwis, the apples and the grapes. Add the simple syrup, the soda water and the ice.

Whisk together the milk, sour cream and egg yolks in another medium bowl. Whisk the yolk mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (the batter will be lumpy). Allow the batter to rest while you whip the egg whites.<br> Beat the egg whites in a separate medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.<br> Heat an ebelskiver pan over medium heat for 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low and brush 4 of the wells generously with melted butter so there is some butter pooling at the bottom of each (the butter should barely sizzle when it hits the pan). Fill each buttered well with about 1 tablespoon batter. Repeat with the butter and batter in the remaining 4 wells. (You are working in batches to prevent the butter from burning.) Allow the batter to cook slightly around the edges, about 30 seconds.<br> Meanwhile, carefully spread about 1/2 teaspoon of the chocolate-hazelnut spread into the center and over the top of 8 of the raspberries. Press each raspberry chocolate-side down into the batter of one of the wells. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of additional batter on top of each raspberry so the wells are very full. Cook until the bottom crusts are golden brown, an additional 2 1/2 minutes.<br> Push a wooden skewer through the raw batter and into the bottom crust of each ebelskiver to turn it slowly. Allow the raw batter to flow back into each well and create a new bottom crust. (If an ebelskiver does not slide up easily or hold its shape, slide it back to its original position and give it more time to cook and set.) Cook until the new undersides are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Check all sides of the ebelskivers: If there are pale spots on some, turn them pale-side down so they brown against the bottom of the pan for a few seconds. When they are done, the ebelskivers should be deep golden brown all over and a skewer inserted deep into the pancakes, avoiding the filling, should come out clean. If you find that some are cooking much more quickly than others, rotate the pan occasionally to even out the heat. Remove the ebelskivers from the pan.<br> Repeat the process with the remaining melted butter, batter, chocolate-hazelnut spread and raspberries to make 6 more ebelskivers. By the second batch, the pan will be significantly hotter, so you may need to reduce the heat or remove the pan from the heat occasionally to ensure even cooking. Dust the ebelskivers with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah]&quot; 47622,&quot;Pan-Fried Partridge with a Delicate Pearl Barley, Pea and Lettuce Stew 4 ounces pearl barley Olive oil 1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces frozen peas 2 cups good chicken or vegetable stock 1 heaping tablespoon all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons butter 2 partridges, washed and patted dry, broken into legs and breasts 4 ounces thick bacon or pancetta, rind removed, cut into pieces A few sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked and chopped A handful romaine lettuce leaves, washed and spun dry A handful arugula, washed and spun dry Instructions: Cook the pearl barley in boiling, salted water for about 50 minutes, or until tender but still with a little bite, then drain and leave to steam dry. Next, heat a glug of olive oil in a frying pan and add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook slowly on a low heat for about 10 minutes, without coloring too much. Add the barley and the peas. Cover with the stock and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring every now and then. On a board, mash the flour and butter together with a fork until you have a paste. This is called a \beurre manie\ and it&#39;s a great way of thickening stews or sauces without having to stir the flour in directly, which could give you lumps. Stir half of the paste into the peas and barley and continue to simmer until the liquid begins to thicken. If, after 5 minutes, it&#39;s not thick enough, add some more of your beurre manie. What you want to achieve is a silky smooth broth. Continue to simmer for another 10 minutes, adding a little extra stock if it gets too dry, while you cook your partridges. Put some olive oil into another frying pan. Season the partridge legs with salt and pepper and add them to the pan. (The legs go in first because they&#39;re tougher than the breasts and need longer to cook.) Shake them about and, after a few minutes, when they&#39;re lightly golden, add the bacon bits and stir gently to stop them catching on the bottom. Meanwhile, lay the partridge breasts out, sprinkle over the chopped thyme and press onto both sides with a good pinch of seasoning. When the bacon is lightly golden, push it to 1 side of the pan with the partridge legs and lay the breasts in, skin side down. Cook for 4 minutes, then turn and cook on the other side for a minute to give you crispy skin and moist meat. You can cook them for longer if you like your meat well done. When the breasts are done, taste the barley broth and adjust the seasoning, then stir in the lettuce and arugula - they only need a minute or so to cook. Serve the barley, peas and lettuce with the partridge breasts and legs on top and sprinkle with the bacon pieces. Spoon the broth juices over the top.

Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving the rendered fat in the pan. To the pan, whisk in the mustard, white wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, and black pepper, to taste. Remove the pan from the heat. Fill a medium saucepan 2/3 with water. Add the distilled white vinegar and bring to just barely a simmer. Cook&#39;s Note: like very active club soda. Crack an egg and place it into a small ramekin. Very slowly and gently place the egg into the water by placing the ramekin right next to the water and letting the egg slide out of the dish and directly into the water. The ramekin should be touching the water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Each egg should cook for 3 1/2 minutes, exactly. In a large bowl, toss the greens with the tomatoes in the bacon dressing and divide the mixture among 4 salad plates. When the eggs are ready, carefully remove with a slotted utensil, and blot briefly on a paper towel to remove the excess vinegary water. Gently place an egg on top of each salad.

Grill the mushroom caps 5 to 6 minutes. Turn them, hole down, and cook another minute. Put in a bowl. Mince 3 of the 4 garlic cloves. Zest 1 lemon and squeeze its juice. In a small saucepan, heat the oil, minced garlic, lemon juice and zest with the pepperoncini, bay leaves and thyme. Cook 5 minutes, pour over the mushrooms, and let cool in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate overnight, turning once. To serve, grate over the zest of the remaining lemon, and the remaining garlic. Add the parsley and toss. Season with fleur de sel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 47632,&quot;BBQ Soft-Shell Crabs with Grilled Vidalia Onions 4 soft-shell crabs, rinsed and cleaned 2 sticks margarine or butter (margarine will cause less flaring) 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 4 teaspoons hot sauce 2 small lemons, juiced 4 slices crisp bacon, crumbled Grilled Vidalia Onions, recipe follows 4 small Vidalia onions 4 tablespoons dry vegetable seasoning 4 cups extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Melt margarine over low-medium heat and add olive oil, salt, pepper, hot sauce, lemon juice, and bacon. Simmer for 2 minutes. Allow to cool. Place the cleaned crabs on plate. Liberally coat the crabs with the sauce, making sure to lift the sides of the shell to coat the meat inside. Save remaining sauce for basting. Cover the crabs and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Heat grill to medium-low. Place crabs on grill topside down. Baste with remaining sauce while they cook. Cook crabs about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. The crab will crisp on the outside and the meat inside will turn white. Remove from grill and serve topped with Grilled Vidalia Onions. Heat griddle or nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Peel onions and cut into thin rings. Toss rings with seasoning and olive oil. Cook until onions turn clear and start to caramelize. Serve over grilled crab. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47633,&quot;Pickled Red Cabbage with Cranberries and Apple 1/2 cup olive oil 1 red onion, sliced 1 medium apple, sliced (I like to use a Pink Lady or Fuji) 1 small red cabbage, sliced Salt 2 cups fresh cranberries 2 cups sugar 1/2 cup cider vinegar Instructions: In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil and saute the red onions with the apples until they are slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add the red cabbage, season with salt and saute until the cabbage begins to wilt, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the cranberries, sugar and vinegar and cook until the juices reduce and the cabbage looks glossy, about 15 minutes. Chill the cabbage and cranberry mixture overnight. It can be served both warm or cool, according to one&#39;s taste. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 47634,&quot;Pickle Schnitzel-Pickle-Brined Pork Chops with Sweet and Spicy Peppers 1 cup dill pickle juice (preferably leftover from a jar of pickles) 1 cup whole sweet piquante peppers from a deli olive bar, such as Peppadews, plus 1/4 cup of the pepper juice Four 1-inch-thick bone-in pork chops 2 orange bell peppers, sliced 1/2 inch thick 1 medium yellow onion, sliced<br> 1/4 cup olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 large eggs, whisked<br> 2 cups panko breadcrumbs 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 8 lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: Combine the pickle juice, pepper juice and pork chops in a large zipper-top bag. Brine at least overnight and at most 24 hours, flipping the bag halfway through. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the piquante peppers, bell peppers and onions with the olive oil in a bowl. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking sheet and roast until slightly charred and soft, about 20 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 200 degrees F and keep warm until ready to serve. Take the chops out of the bag (discard the brine) and dry them off with paper towels. Place a chop between plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until 1/2 inch thick. Make sure you pound around the bone but keep the bone intact; this adds flavor and plating dramatics. Repeat with the remaining chops. Set up an F. E. B. station with flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate shallow containers; season the breadcrumbs with salt and pepper. Season each chop with salt and pepper, then dredge in the flour, coat with the egg and then coat in the breadcrumbs, ensuring the breadcrumbs adhere to all the nooks and crannies. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, add the vegetable oil and heat until very hot. Working in 2 batches, fry the chops 2 at a time until golden on each side, 4 to 5 minutes a side. Keep the chops warm on a wire-racked baking sheet in the oven while you repeat with the remaining chops. Plate each chop over a serving of the peppers and onions and serve with 2 lemon wedges to squeeze on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 47635,&quot;Pasta Rags and Warmed Salmon 1 cup fresh, ripe tomato 1/2 pound fresh salmon fillet, all skins and bones removed 6 quarts water 2 tablespoons salt 1 pound fresh pasta sheets 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped Salt and ground black pepper to taste Instructions: Seed and dice the tomato and set aside. Cut the salmon into slivers that are paper thin and almost transparent and set aside. Bring the water to a boil and add the salt. When the water returns to the boil add the pasta and cook for between 4 to 6 minutes or until fully cooked but still with a toothy bite. Drain the pasta but reserve 1 cup of the cooking water. Do not rinse the pasta. Toss the pasta in a bowl with the olive oil, add the tomato, salmon and dill and toss again. The heat of the hot pasta will cook the thin pieces of salmon to a delicate finish. Season with salt and plenty of black pepper. If you a prefer a more liquid sauce, some of the hot pasta water may be added to moisten the dish or some whole butter may be added as well. Serve immediately.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47636,&quot;Mulled Wine 2 bottles Cabernet Sauvignon 3 lemons, juiced 1/2 cup superfine sugar or more to taste 4 sticks cinnamon 1 tablespoon whole cloves or more, to taste 1 tablespoon whole allspice berries or freshly grated nutmeg 1 orange, sliced 1 lemon, sliced Instructions: In a large saucepan, combine the wine, lemon juice, and sugar.

Using a small knife, trim the stems off the figs and cut the figs in half lengthwise. Place the figs and the wine in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, and simmer about 20 minutes until figs have absorbed most of the wine and they are tender and fat. Remove figs with a slotted spoon to a bowl and reserve for later. Some reduced wine should remain for sauce; return wine to medium heat and simmer again until reduced by half and a syrupy liquid remains. Let cool slightly. Slice demi-baguette into 1/2-inch slices. Lay the bread slices on a baking sheet and toast lightly in the oven, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. Spread a tablespoon of ricotta on each crostini then lay a small piece of prosciutto on top of the cheese. Place fig halves on top of the meat and finish by drizzling the remaining reduced wine on top of the figs.

Submerge the flank steak in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. For the bun dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the all-purpose flour, cake flour, sugar, yeast and salt and whisk to combine. Add the water and shortening and mix for 10 minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl and let sit until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Cut eight 3-inch squares of parchment paper. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a flat oval, about 6 inches by 3 inches. Brush with sesame oil, fold in half and place on a parchment square. Set the buns in a bamboo steamer 1 inch apart, cover and allow the buns to proof in the steamer in a warm place (or just on the countertop), until doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes. For the peanut sauce: Meanwhile, combine the reserved coconut milk, peanut butter, sambal, jalapeno and soy sauce and whisk until smooth. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water. Reserve at room temperature until serving. (If you make it ahead of time, refrigerate the sauce but take out in time for it to come to room temperature before serving, or it will be very thick.) Heat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the meat from the marinade and brush off any excess. When the grill is very hot, grill the meat to desired doneness, 4 to 8 minutes on each side is good for medium rare, depending on thickness. Let rest for at least 10 minutes so the juices can settle. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Steam the buns over the boiling water until puffy and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Slice the meat thinly against the grain. Serve the buns right out of the steamer with the sliced meat, peanut sauce, pickles, extra sambal, cilantro and salt to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 47646,&quot;Dinner in a Flash (Cod in Parchment) 2 sheets parchment paper - or 2 by 2 foot length aluminum foil 1/2 bunch kale - roughly chopped 1/2 small spaghetti squash, coooked 1 cup leftover ric, cooked 2 (6-ounce) cod fillets 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup white wine (or water) Instructions: Lay out two sheets of parchment or foil.

Mix together the mushrooms, kimchi, panko and scallions in a bowl and set aside. Remove the steak from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and pat dry. Spread the filling over the steak, leaving a 1 inch border around the edge. Lay the eggs end to end at the edge of the filling closest to you. Pick up the end of the steak with the eggs and roll up to the other side, enclosing the eggs and filling. Lay half the bacon strips next to one another on a work surface so they overlap slightly. Make a second row with the remaining bacon strips, overlapping the ends to make an extra-long rectangle. Place the steak, seam-side down, perpendicular on one edge of the bacon strips and roll the steak with the bacon. Tie a piece of butcher&#39;s twine around each strip of bacon to secure it to the steak, then tie a piece lengthwise around the roll. (This can be done a day ahead, covered and refrigerated.)

Coat a large Dutch oven generously with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Season the shanks generously with salt and add them to the pan. Brown well on all sides. This is an incredibly important step; do not rush it. Meanwhile, puree the onions, carrots, celery and garlic in a food processor until it becomes a coarse paste. Remove and set aside. Remove the shanks from the pan to a sheet tray. Discard the excess fat from the pan. Add a little more oil to coat the bottom of the pan and add the pureed veggies. Season with salt, to taste. Saute the veggies until they are very brown and aromatic, about 20 minutes. The brown veggies should form a sort of crust on the bottom of the pan, do not let this burn; it is where a lot of the flavor is! Don&#39;t rush this step either, since this is where you will develop the brown color and flavor. Add the tomato paste and brown for 5 minutes. Stir in the wine, chopped rosemary and thyme bundle. Stir frequently and cook until the wine has reduced by about half. Add the shanks back to the pot and pour in 3 to 4 cups of water. The shanks should be submersed, if they are not, add more water. Add the bay leaves to the pan, cover and put in the preheated oven. The cooking time will be about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Turn the shanks over about halfway through the cooking time. Check the shanks every 45 minutes or so. If the liquid has reduced too much add more water. Defat as you go. Remove the lid during the last 30 minutes of cooking time for maximum browning. When the shanks are done the meat should be incredibly tender and flavorful. Transfer to serving plates and garnish with Gremolata.

Add the leeks and cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and saute briefly to release its fragrance. Add the squash and apples, raise the heat to high, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Stir in the Toasted Spice Rub and cook briefly to toast it, about 1 minute. Add the stock or broth-water mixture, bring to a simmer, and partially cover. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the squash and apples are tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer in batches to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Return to the pot, reheat to serving temperature, and season with salt. Divide the soup among warmed bowls and garnish each portion with some of the walnuts, if using. Serve immediately. In a small heavy pan over medium heat, combine the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Yield: about 1 cup In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat about 1-inch of oil to 350 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add walnuts and blanch for 30 seconds. Drain and transfer nuts to a medium bowl. While nuts are still hot and slightly wet, add confectioners&#39; sugar and toss to coat nuts. Stir and toss until all the sugar has melted into the nuts; if bits of unmelted sugar remain on the nuts, they will not fry properly. Stir the nuts again before frying. Using a large slotted spoon, transfer a few nuts to the hot oil, allowing the foam to subside before adding another spoonful. (Otherwise, the oil could foam over and burn you.) Fry in small batches until the nuts are medium brown, about 45 seconds per batch; be careful not to overcook. Scatter on an unlined baking sheet to cool slightly. In a small bowl, stir together cayenne, cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and the pepper. While the nuts are still warm, transfer them to a bowl and sprinkle evenly with about half of the spice mix. Toss well to distribute the spices and then taste a nut. Add more spice mix, to taste, and toss well after each addition. When cool, pack in an airtight jar. They will keep at room temperature for at least 2 weeks.

Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the mixer on low and add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium; stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: if it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour - 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, this should take about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times; kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e. over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Once the dough is domed and spongy, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter. Roll and stretch the dough into a cylinder and divide into 3 equal pieces. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes so it will be easier to roll out. In the meantime, make the pizza topping. For the topping: Coat a saute pan with the olive oil and place over medium heat. When the oil gets hazy, add the onion and garlic, cook and stir for 5 minutes to soften. Stir in 1/2 bunch torn basil leaves. Carefully add the tomatoes (nothing splashes like tomatoes), cook and stir until the liquid is cooked down and the sauce is thick, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper and then take it off the stove. Preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep the sausages from sticking. Grill the sausages until cooked through, turning with tongs. Set aside. Keep the grill hot to make the pizza. Roll or pat out a piece of dough into a rustic, oblong shape, about 1/4-inch thick \u2013 do this directly on a lightly floured pizza paddle for ease. Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and lay oil-side down onto the hot grill. Once the dough looks set, in about 2 minutes, turn the crust over. Spread the tomato sauce evenly on the crust with a ladle. Rip the mozzarella into pieces with your hands and distribute them on top; crumble the grilled sausage all over the pizza. Close the grill cover and cook until the cheese is melted and bubbling and the crust is golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the pizza from grill and sprinkle with some fresh basil leaves and a good dusting of Parmesan. Repeat with the remaining dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 47720,&quot;Grilled Tofu with Asiago and Walnut Pesto 1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1/4 cup chopped walnuts 1 tablespoon (about 5 leaves), chopped fresh sage 1 garlic clove, roughly chopped 5 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 14 ounces firm tofu, drained and patted dry with paper towels 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the Asiago and Walnut Pesto: Place all the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor.

Mix until no streaks of white meringue remain. In a separate large bowl, fold the remaining meringue into the green egg yolk batter. Pour the sky blue batter into the bottom of an ungreased 2-piece 9-inch aluminum chiffon pan. Use a damp paper towel to remove any splatters of batter on the sides of the pan that may result from pouring batter in the pan. Pour the green layer on top of the blue layer. Rap the bottom of the pan on a work surface 2 to 3 times to remove any large air pockets.<br> Bake for 15 minutes, and then decrease the oven temperature to 280 degrees F and bake for 20 minutes more. Decrease the temperature again to 260 degrees F and bake for 10 more minutes. The cake is done when a toothpick tester inserted near the center comes out clean. Turn the cake upside down on a wire rack to cool completely. When the cake is cool, gently push the cake away from the pan&#39;s edges using your hands. When the edges are free, remove the cake with the center tube piece attached. Run a small knife around the top edge of the cake to loosen it from the tube. Set the cake aside, uncovered. For the cake assembly: Level the cakes if needed. Place the 9-inch layer with the green side down onto a cake stand or serving plate. Center the 6-inch cake on the top center of the 9-inch cake. Place white sprinkles vertically on the sides of the top tier to create a rain shower effect. The sides of the cake should be naturally sticky and the sprinkles will adhere easily. If the sprinkles do not adhere naturally, lightly mist the cake with water using a kitchen-dedicated spray bottle. Let stand 5 minutes or until the sides of the cake are tacky when touched. Proceed with decorating. Use a 1.5-inch flower-shaped cookie cutter or fondant plunger cutter to stamp 16 to 18 shapes from the pink chiffon cake sheet. Place the marshmallow cream or frosting in a squeeze bottle or piping bag with a tiny hole cut in the end. Pipe a small amount into the center of each flower and place a yellow confetti sprinkle on top. Pipe dots on the outside of the bottom cake and attach the chiffon flowers. Serve the cake immediately, or cover loosely with plastic wrap and store at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47722,&quot;Ginger-Scallion Lo Mein 1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons rice vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar Kosher salt 2 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced 4 radishes, thinly sliced 1 small turnip, peeled and cut into thin wedges 1 small red jalape?o pepper, thinly sliced (remove seeds for less heat) 3 bunches scallions, thinly sliced 1/2 cup minced peeled fresh ginger (from about three 2-inch pieces) 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 pound fresh lo mein noodles, cut into thirds with kitchen shears 1/4 cup oyster sauce Instructions: Combine 1/2 cup rice vinegar, the sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan.

Fry the tortillas, 1 by 1, in the hot oil until they are soft, about 10 seconds and drain on paper towels. Reserve, covered, in a warm spot. Heat wire \potato nest\ baskets in the hot oil for several seconds, or until they are very hot. Fit a soft tortilla into the bottom basket and place the smaller basket on top of the tortilla. Immerse the baskets in the hot oil and cook until the tortilla is crispy and golden brown. Remove the tortilla cup from the basket and invert on paper towels to drain. Repeat the procedure with the other tortillas. (If you don&#39;t have a potato nest basket, you can also lay the tortillas 1 by 1 on the surface of the hot oil, then immediately push the center to the bottom with a small, empty tin can, thus creating a free form cup. Be sure to use tongs and heat resistant gloves to protect yourself.) Cut the shrimp into piece the same size as the bay scallops. Refrigerate the shrimp, ahi, and scallops separately. In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, lime juice, cilantro, red onion, and tomato and add salt and pepper, to taste. Add the seafood to this mixture and marinate, in the refrigerator, for 15 minutes to 45 minutes. Place the tortilla cups on plates.

Add the red onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until soft and deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside and let cool slightly. For the hummus: Meanwhile, combine the chickpeas, tahini, cumin, garlic, lemon juice and some salt in a blender. Pulse until the mixture becomes somewhat smooth and combined, but do not overmix. Add 1/2 to 1 cup cold water as needed to facilitate blending and reach the desired consistency. Add the olive oil and pulse a few more times just to incorporate. Taste and add more cumin, salt or garlic if needed. Pour the hummus into a bowl and stir to ensure it&#39;s combined. Serve immediately, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. For the balsamic vinaigrette: Shake together the oil, vinegar and some salt and pepper in a Mason jar. This makes more than you&#39;ll need for 1 wrap; store the rest in the fridge and use for another salad. For the wrap: Grill the tortilla on a grill pan over medium heat just until it has grill marks on the outside, 1 minute. (If you don&#39;t have a grill pan, just use a skillet.) The tortilla should still be soft and pliable, with just a little bit of color! Let the tortilla cool slightly. To assemble the wrap, spread about 1/4 cup of the hummus down the middle third of the tortilla. Arrange the cooked onions and roasted red peppers all over the hummus. Add the artichoke heart halves. Toss the salad greens in 1 tablespoon of the balsamic vinaigrette, then lay them on the wrap. Finally, sprinkle the crumbled feta all over the greens. Carefully wrap up the tortilla, tucking in the ends. Slice the wrap down the middle, share with a friend and chow down! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 47742,&quot;Plantain Fritters (Aranitas) Vegetable oil, for frying 4 garlic cloves Pinch kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 3 green plantains, peeled and grated on the large holes of a box grater Freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves Instructions: Heat 2-inches of oil to 350 degrees F in a heavy skillet or deep pot over medium-high heat.

Microwave for 30 seconds. Remove and stir, and repeat this process 1 more time. Set aside. Heat the heavy cream and corn syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat until simmering. Remove from the heat and pour the mixture over the melted chocolate mixture; let stand for 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, stir gently, starting in the middle of bowl and working in concentric circles until all chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth and creamy. Gently stir in the brandy. Pour the mixture into an 8 by 8-inch glass baking dish and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Using a melon baller, scoop chocolate onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and return to the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Place the cocoa powder, nuts, and/or toasted coconut each in its own pie pan and set aside. In the meantime, place the 8 ounces of chocolate into a medium mixing bowl which is sitting on top of a heating pad lined bowl, with the heating pad set to medium. Depending on the heating pad, you may need to adjust the heat up or down. Stirring the chocolate occasionally, test the temperature of the chocolate and continue heating until it reaches 90 to 92 degrees F; do not allow the chocolate to go above 94 degrees F. If you do, the coating will not have a nice snap to it when you bite into the chocolate. Once you have reached the optimal temperature, adjust the heat to maintain it. Remove the truffles from the refrigerator and shape into balls by rolling between the palms of your hands. Use powder-free vinyl or latex gloves, if desired. Dip an ice cream scoop into the chocolate and turn upside down to remove excess chocolate. Place truffles 1 at time into the scoop and roll around until coated. Then place the truffle into the dish with either the cocoa powder, nuts or coconut. Move the truffle around to coat; leave truffle in the coating for 10 to 15 seconds before removing. In the meantime, continue placing the chocolate-coated truffles in the cocoa or other secondary coating. After 10 to 15 seconds, remove the truffle to a parchment lined sheet pan. Repeat until all truffles are coated. Allow to set in a cool dry place for at least 1 hour; or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Truffles are best when served at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 47751,&quot;Sweet &amp; Sour BBQ Sauce 2 tablespoons peanut oil 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 tablespoons finely grated peeled fresh ginger 1/2 cup dry sherry 1/2 cup hoisin sauce 1/2 cup ketchup 1 1/2 teaspoons Vietnamese chili-garlic sauce 2 teaspoons soy sauce 2 teaspoons dark sesame oil Instructions: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over high heat.

Remove the top piece of plastic and put 3 tablespoons of the pulled chicken onto the center of the circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Using the plastic wrap, fold the dough over to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle. Press the edges together. Using the rim of a small saucer, trim off the edge of the empanada. Repeat to make the rest. Put about 1/2-inch of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Dip the end of a wooden spoon into the oil: when bubbles form around it the oil is hot enough for frying. Fry the empanadas, a few at a time, until they are golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm. Note: Mozzarella cheese and a mixture of diced pear and crumbled gorgonzola cheese also make great fillings for these empanadas. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 47760,&quot;Lemon Meringue Tartlets 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup blanched almonds 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus more for the pans 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest (from 2 lemons) 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 4 lemons) 1/3 cup fresh orange juice (from 1 orange) 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 large egg plus 3 egg yolks 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces 3 tablespoons limoncello or other lemon-flavored liqueur 3 large egg whites 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 7 tablespoons sugar Instructions: Make the crusts: Pulse the flour, almonds, sugar and salt in a food processor until the nuts are finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add 3 tablespoons ice water and pulse until the dough starts coming together. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap, pat into a disk and wrap in the plastic. Refrigerate until cold but still malleable, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly butter four 4-inch tart pans with removable bottoms. Divide the prepared dough into 4 pieces, then press into the bottom and up the side of each prepared pan. Freeze until firm, about 10 minutes, then use a paring knife to trim the excess pastry. Place the tart shells on a baking sheet, line each with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until golden around the edges, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue baking until the crusts are golden brown all over, 5 to 10 more minutes. Let cool, then carefully loosen the crusts but leave in the pans on the baking sheet. Meanwhile, make the filling: Whisk the sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, orange juice, cornstarch and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan until smooth. Whisk in the whole egg and egg yolks. Cook over medium heat, whisking, until the mixture simmers, about 5 minutes. Add the butter and limoncello and continue whisking over medium heat until thick like pudding, 4 to 6 more minutes. Spoon the curd into the prepared crusts. Make the meringue: Beat the egg whites in a medium bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Gradually beat in the sugar and beat until stiff shiny peaks form, 4 to 5 more minutes. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bagfitted with a star tip and pipe onto the tarts. Bake at 375 degrees F until the meringue is set and golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely before unmolding. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47761,&quot;Stewed Chicken 3 1/2 pounds chicken parts Lemon juice 4 scallions, cut in 1/2-inch pieces 4 tomatoes, diced 1 onion, thinly sliced 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced 1/2 cup ketchup 1/4 cup cider vinegar 3 tablespoons sesame oil 3 tablespoons ground cumin 1 tablespoon West Indian curry powder 1 tablespoon Daddy&#39;s Herb Blend (blend of dried and ground oregano, thyme, rosemary, black pepper, and basil) 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar 3 tablespoons garlic powder 3 tablespoons onion powder 1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 tablespoons sugar Rice or mashed potatoes, for serving Instructions: Wash chicken parts. In a large bowl, combine lemon juice, scallions, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, ketchup, vinegar, sesame oil, cumin, curry powder, Daddy&#39;s herb blend, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder and 3 tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Add chicken to marinade and refrigerate overnight. In a medium Dutch oven, combine 1/3 olive oil and the sugar. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and brush off the vegetables from the chicken pieces, reserving the vegetables. Turn the heat to medium and stir the sugar and allow it to caramelize as the pot gets hot. (It may smoke some so watch for your smoke detector) Carefully, but quickly add the chicken to the pot and let the chicken brown in the caramelized sugar, turning the pieces as you go. Once all the chicken has browned, add the vegetables and marinade juices, cover, reduce heat to medium-low and let stew until the chicken is cooked through and tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Half way through, season with salt and pepper. Serve over rice or with mashed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 47762,&quot;Portuguese Cornbread: Broa 2 packages active dry yeast 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 cup warm water 1 1/2 cups stone-ground cornmeal, plus additional for sprinkling 2 teaspoons salt 1 cup boiling water 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing 1 tablespoon coarse salt Instructions: In a small bowl combine the yeast, sugar, and the warm water in a large bowl until the yeast is dissolved and foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal and salt with the boiling water. Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon to blend. Add the melted butter and mix to incorporate. Now, pour the yeast mixture into the cornmeal mixture, stirring to combine. Gradually add the flour, mixing well after each addition. Add a couple of tablespoons of water if the dough feels dry and doesn&#39;t come together easily. Continue to mix until a dough forms into a ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 10 minutes. Grease a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough to the bowl, brush the top with more oil so it is completely coated. Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 11/2 hours. Turn the dough out onto the floured surface and knead briefly, 3 or 4 times, to punch out the air. Gather the dough into a ball and shape it into a round loaf. Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let rise again until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. and place a pizza stone in the oven to heat up. Put the dough round on the pizza stone and brush the top with oil. Sprinkle the top of the bread with coarse salt. Bake in middle of the oven for 40 to 50 minutes until the bread is golden brown and bottom sounds hollow when tapped. *To recreate the steam effect from authentic Portuguese brick ovens, spray the bread and oven walls with cold water every 10 minutes. Transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 47763,&quot;Moussaka on the Grill 1 1/2 pounds eggplant, peeled and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1 pound ground beef (or 8 ounces ground beef and 8 ounces ground lamb) 1 large yellow or red onion, peeled and diced 5 cloves garlic, sliced 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 cup red wine 2 fresh bay leaves 1 cinnamon stick Small bunch fresh oregano One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 1/2 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 cup grated pecorino 2 large egg yolks Zest of 1 lemon Pecorino, for serving Fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish Instructions: Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. For the eggplant and meat sauce: Season the eggplant slices on both sides with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Turn to coat. Grill the eggplant slices straight over direct heat, flipping once, until tender and lightly golden brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes. You can move them from direct to indirect heat as needed. Transfer the eggplant slices to a baking sheet or a plate and set aside. Place a 6-quart heavy bottomed saucepan over direct heat. Add a few tablespoons of olive oil along with the ground meat to the saucepot and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring to break up the meat, until well browned and caramelized, about 5 minutes. Then add the onions and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook until rust colored, another minute. Add the wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Using butcher&#39;s twine, tie the bay leaves, cinnamon stick and oregano into a bundle. Add the crushed tomatoes and the spice bundle to the pot. Move the pot over indirect heat and simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the spice bundle. For the bechamel sauce: In a heavy bottomed saucepot over direct heat, melt the butter. When butter has melted, whisk in the flour and cook until it forms a smooth paste, 3 to 4 minutes. Slowly whisk in half of the milk and once the mixture is smooth with no lumps, whisk in the remaining half and the nutmeg. Bring to a gentle boil and cook, stirring often, until thick and velvety, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the pecorino. Set aside to cool slightly, then whisk in the egg yolks and lemon zest. To assemble: Place the eggplant slices on the bottom of an enameled dish or cast-iron and cover with the meat sauce. Pour the bechamel all over the top, spreading it out into an even layer. Place over indirect heat, cover the grill and cook until light golden brown and bubbly on top, about 40 minutes. Remove from the grill and let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Grate pecorino over the top and sprinkle with chopped parsley. (Alternatively, you can bake the moussaka in a 400 degrees F oven for 45 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, GSM Blend, Barbera]&quot; 47764,&quot;Baked Fudge 2 whole eggs<br> 1 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons (heaping) cocoa<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 stick butter, melted<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Serving suggestions: sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Let the yeast stand until foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the salt. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated and the dough gathers into a ball; this should take about 4 minutes. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise until double in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Place a large pizza stone on the lower oven rack, preheat the oven (and stone) to 500 degrees F. Punch the dough down, divide it into 8 pieces, and gather each piece into a ball; keeping all of them lightly floured and covered while you work. Allow the balls of dough to rest, covered, for 15 minutes so they will be easier to roll out. Using a rolling pin, roll each dough ball into a circle that is about 8-inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick. Make sure the circle is totally smooth, with no creases or seams in the dough, which can prevent the pitas from puffing up properly. Cover the disks as you roll them out, but do not stack them up. Put 2 pita rounds at a time on the hot pizza stone and bake for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the bread puffs up like a balloon and is pale golden. Watch closely; they bake fast. Remove the bread from the oven and place on a rack to cool for 5 minutes; they will naturally deflate, leaving a pocket in the center. Wrap the pitas in a large kitchen towel to keep them soft. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 47775,&quot;The Turducken: Boneless Turkey Stuffed with a Boneless Duck and Boneless Chicken \One Big Bird<br> 3 pounds coarsely ground pork 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped garlic 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper Pinch cayenne pepper, optional Pinch chili pepper flakes Pinch ground mace Pinch ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 teaspoon paprika Pinch ground bay leaf Pinch ground sage 2 1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke 3 teaspoons bacon fat 4 pounds frozen chopped spinach, thaw and remove excess liquid or 3 pounds freshly chopped spinach 1/2 pound butter 2 cups sauteed onion 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon white pepper 1 teaspoon ground fennel seed 1 (6-pound) fresh whole duck 1 (4-pound) fresh whole chicken 1 cup olive oil, divided About 5 tablespoons blackening spice, divided 1 (25-pound) fresh whole turkey 2 tablespoons freshly chopped garlic 5 pounds favorite cornbread dressing Spinach stuffing 3 whole roasted red bell peppers, cut into strips 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 quarts of your favorite turkey gravy Large roasting pan and rack Parchment paper Aluminum foil 20 feet butcher&#39;s twine Large sewing needle Instructions: ; &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 47776,&quot;Campfire Cupcake 3 tablespoons white frosting Green gel food coloring 1 unfrosted chocolate cupcake<br> 2 chocolate-covered malt balls<br> 1 miniature chocolate chew, such as Tootsie Roll Midgees 1 red gummy bear 1 orange gummy bear 1 yellow gummy bear 1 pink gummy bear 3 mini marshmallows<br> 3 pretzel sticks Instructions: In a small bowl, mix the frosting with green gel food coloring.

Coarsely chop the kale into 1-inch pieces. It will look like you have a lot of kale, but it will cook down considerably. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, thyme, garlic, shallots and red pepper flakes, if using. Saute until the tomatoes and shallots soften, about 4 minutes. Add the kale and sprinkle with the salt. Toss with 2 wooden spoons until the kale wilts but is still bright green, about 2 minutes. Stir in the basil. Remove from the heat. Fill a wide shallow pan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a gentle simmer, barely a bubble really. Meanwhile, using tongs, toast each tortilla directly over high heat until beginning to blacken in spots, about 15 seconds per side. Put the warm tortillas on plates. Spoon 1 tablespoon of hummus on each tortilla and spread to cover, leaving a 1-inch border. Divide the kale mixture over the hummus. Add the lemon juice to the barely simmering water. With a wooden spoon, stir the water briskly to create a vortex in the middle of the pan. Crack an egg on the counter and break it directly into the center of the vortex. Stir the water gently again around the outside of the egg to help the white fold up around itself. Cook until the white is just set and the yolk is still very soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the egg from the water and dab on a towel to remove excess water before moving it to one of the wraps. Continue with the remaining eggs. Slit the yolks and press on the eggs a bit so the yolks begin to run (this will make them easier to eat). Fold up the bottom of each tortilla and then fold in the sides, leaving the wraps open at the top.

Combine the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor, 2 to 3 pulses. With the food processor running, drizzle in the egg mixture and process until the dough forms into small pebbles that resemble couscous and doesn\u2019t stick to your fingers when pinched, 2 to 3 minutes. If the dough is too dry, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it comes together. If the dough is too wet, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until a smooth ball forms, 4 to 5 times. Place in a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes (see Cook\u2019s Note). Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the celery and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.

Slice the sunchoke as thinly as possible with a mandolin into a bowl. (You should get enough pieces to make a thin layer that covers the whole pie.) Toss together the rosemary, Parmigiano-Reggiano, kale, a generous dash of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt, coating everything evenly and massaging the kale to soften it up. Taste for salt and adjust if necessary. Stretch out the dough into a 12-inch round, first pinching a hearty edge for the crust, then gently stretching to reach 12 inches. Generously flour a pizza peel and lay down the round. Quickly lay down the mozzarella, then an even layer of the sunchokes, followed by the kale. The kale should not cover the pie evenly like the sunchokes, but add an accent of color and crunchiness. Top the pie with the fontina and slide onto the pizza stone. Cook until the pie is evenly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Pull the pie onto a flat metal pie pan or the underside of a baking sheet so it&#39;s easy to slide off onto a cutting board.

Make approximately 25 sticks. Soften remaining chocolate slightly and use a vegetable peeler to form medium size curls. Place chocolate stick and shavings on a tray in the refrigerator until ready to assemble cake To assemble: Place white chocolate cake layer on 9-inch plate. Using a serrated knife, level tops of cake by trimming off the dome. Discard excess cake. Spread 3/4 cup of butter cream over top of cake. Repeat next 3 layers starting with devils food cake and ending with white. Frost tops and sides of cake evenly with remaining buttercream. Coat sides and top of cake evenly with white chocolate shavings. Arrange the chocolate sticks into the tops of the cake sticking in from edges to center on 45 degree angle. Sprinkle additional shavings over sticks to fill in voids. Cut into 12 equal pieces and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47829,&quot;Asian Shrimp and Asparagus Soup 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 tablespoons minced shallots 6 cups water Bouquet garni including: the stems and roots of a bunch of cilantro, bay leaf, smashed peeled garlic clove, 2 red chili 1 pound asparagus, peeled, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch rounds 1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup canned straw mushrooms or fresh enoki mushrooms or sliced domestic mushroom caps 3 to 4 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/2 cup (packed) cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped Salt and crushed red pepper Instructions: Heat the oil and add the shallots and saute.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Set aside. In a small bowl, toss together the almonds, granulated sugar and orange zest. Add the almond extract and stir together until the mixture is barely damp. Cut the piece of phyllo in half lengthwise, then cut each of the 2 strips in half crosswise so you have a total of 4 pieces. Brush a piece of phyllo with the butter and sprinkle with the almond filling. Fold the piece of phyllo into thirds using a business letter fold, brushing each fold with butter and sprinkling with additional filling as you go. Then fold one corner over into a triangle and continue folding down the length, buttering and sprinkling as you go until it is folded into a triangular shape, similar to a paper football. Repeat with the rest of the cut phyllo pieces and filling. Brush the outside of each triangle with butter and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Transfer the triangles to the prepared baking sheet and bake until crisp and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. For the chocolate mousse: Reserve a medium heat-safe bowl for the chocolate. Fill a second bowl that&#39;s slightly larger than the chocolate bowl with ice and set aside. Combine the chocolate and espresso powder in the reserved bowl. Pour over the hot water. Allow to sit a few minutes to melt the chocolate, then whisk until the chocolate is completely combined with the liquid. Sit the bowl of chocolate in the bowl with the ice bath and continue whisking the mixture until the mixture lightens and thickens, about 5 minutes. Use a hand mixer if needed. Divide the mixture among 4 serving dishes. The mixture may look as if it&#39;s still jiggly even when it&#39;s set. Don&#39;t worry! Refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Serve each dish of mousse topped with a crisp.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the water, oil and egg. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and using a wooden spoon or a Danish whisk, stir the mixture until a shaggy dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until the dough is a bit smoother. Then \slap\ the dough and turn it over and knead it until smooth; this could take between 5 to 10 minutes. You can also mix the dough in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. This takes about 10 minutes. Cover the dough in plastic wrap and allow to rest a room temperature for 2 hours. Cover a table (at least 36 inches square) with a clean tablecloth. Sprinkle the cloth all over with flour. Gently press the dough into a rough 12-by-12-inch square and then gently pull the dough into a large square, about 36 inches. Use a pair of clean kitchen scissors to cut the thicker edges off the perimeter and discard them. Allow the dough to rest to dry out just a bit, about 5 minutes.

Remove from the pot with a slotted spoon to leave all of the shrimpy flavor and reserve. Add the remaining 10 tablespoons butter and the shallots to the same pot and cook until softened, without browning, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in the tomato paste, cooking 1 minute. Stir in the flour and continue cooking until the flour has cooked out but does not brown, 2 minutes. Deglaze the pot with the sherry, scraping up any flour from the bottom of the pan. Slowly whisk in the hot shrimp stock in stages to avoid lumps. Then add in the heavy cream and thyme and continue simmering until thick and creamy, 15 to 20 minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm on the stovetop until ready to use, adding the shrimp back in just before serving. For the fries: Add oil to a Dutch oven and heat to 340 degrees F (temperature will lower when you add the first batch and that&#39;s ok). Working in batches, fry the potatoes 2 minutes and transfer to a wire rack on a baking sheet. Let them cool slightly while increasing the temperature of the oil to 375 degrees F. Return the fries to the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. (The double fry is the secret to crispy fries.) Transfer to another baking sheet with a wire rack and season with salt and pepper. Plate the fries in a shallow bowl and top with the cheese curds. Pour the shrimp gravy over the top, garnish with thyme and lemon wedges and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47833,&quot;Southwestern Pinto Bean and Veggie Burgers with Slaw 3/4 cup frozen corn 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 red bell pepper, diced 1 medium shallot, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 large clove garlic, minced One 15-ounce can pinto beans, drained, rinsed and patted dry 1 large egg 1/2 cup finely diced Cheddar (about 2 ounces) 6 tablespoons cornmeal 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro 2 tablespoons mayonnaise Juice of 1 lime 1 small serrano cl, seeded if desired and minced, optional Kosher salt 2 cups packaged coleslaw mix 1 ripe avocado, cut into 8 to 12 slices, for serving Instructions: For the burgers: Cook the corn according to the package directions; set aside.

Combine the salt, pepper, oregano and cumin, and mix well. Rub the pork all over with the spice mix. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or saute pan over high heat until smoking. Add the oil and sear the pork on all sides until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a deep baking dish. Deglaze the skillet with the chicken stock, then pour enough stock over the pork to cover by two-thirds. Cover tightly with parchment paper and then with foil. Place in the oven and cook until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove from the oven and allow the pork to cool in its cooking liquid for about 30 minutes. When cool, slice the pork thin and against the grain. For the Cuban sandwich: Heat a flat top grill or panini press to medium-high. Cut the bread in half horizontally and spread 1/2 tablespoon of butter on each cut-side. Toast the bread, cut-side down. (If using a panini press, do not close the press.) Cut the swiss cheese slices in half; place two halves on bottom halves of the bread. Layer with 6 ounces of sliced pork shoulder, 4 ounces of sliced ham, 2 pickle slices and 2 half slices of swiss cheese. Spread 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard on the top piece of bread, and top the sandwich.

Bring to a medium-high heat. When the garlic cloves have begun to brown and are very aromatic remove and discard them. Add the assorted fresh mushrooms to the pan and season with salt. Saute the mushrooms until they are soft and pliable. Turn off the heat and reserve. Using your hand, carefully scoop the porcini mushrooms out of the hot water. (At this point the water should have cooled off significantly. If it is still too hot for your hand, use a slotted spoon.) Pour the top 2/3 of the mushroom water into another container and reserve for use while making the risotto. Discard the bottom third. It contains a lot of sand and dirt from the mushrooms. Puree the rehydrated mushrooms with a little of the reserved mushroom water to make a smooth mushroom paste. This will not look good but it will certainly taste good! Reserve. Coat a large saucepot abundantly with olive oil. Add the onions and season generously with salt. Bring the pot to a medium-high heat. Cook the onions, stirring frequently until they are very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the rice and stir to coat with the olive oil. Cook the rice for 2 to 3 minutes to toast, stirring frequently. Add wine to cover the surface of the rice and stir frequently until it has completely absorbed. Add the reserved mushroom water and then add chicken stock until the liquid has covered the surface of the rice. Stir frequently until the stock has absorbed into the rice. Repeat this process 2 more times. Check for seasoning, you probably will need to add salt. During the third addition of stock, add the reserved sauteed mushrooms and 2 tablespoons of the pureed porcini mushrooms. When the stock has absorbed into the rice and the rice is cooked but still \al dente, remove the pot from the heat. Add the butter and cheese and whip until well combined. This will set the perfect consistency of the rice. The rice should flow and not be able to hold its shape and look very creamy.

Repeat with the remaining gin and vermouth to make 2 more martinis. &quot;,&quot;[Gin, Vermouth]&quot; 47842,&quot;Grilled Cauliflower Steaks 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon smoked paprika<br> 1 tablespoon ground coriander<br> 1 tablespoon dry mustard<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> Pinch cayenne<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 large head cauliflower (about 2 1/2 pounds) 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/2 cup Greek yogurt<br> 2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano 2 teaspoons chopped fresh mint, plus more leaves for garnish<br> 1 teaspoon honey<br> Juice of 1 lemon<br> 1 clove garlic, finely grated<br> Instructions: For the rub: Combine the cumin, paprika, coriander, dry mustard, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne and some salt and pepper in a small bowl. For the cauliflower: Preheat a grill pan or grill over medium heat. Place the stem side of the cauliflower on the counter and slice vertically into four 1-inch-thick \u201cplanks\u201d or steaks. The pieces from the center with the core in them work best for this as the core holds them together. Save any excess cauliflower or florets that fall off when cutting for another recipe. Drizzle the cauliflower pieces on both sides with the olive oil, then sprinkle them generously with the spice rub, ensuring they are coated well. Place the cauliflower steaks on the grill, cover with a sheet pan or similar cover to help retain heat and steam and cook until well-marked and just starting to lightly char in places, 7 to 8 minutes. Flip and cook until the cauliflower is crisp-tender, 7 to 8 more minutes. Meanwhile, combine the Greek yogurt, oregano, mint, honey, lemon juice, garlic and salt and pepper to taste and mix well. Drizzle the cauliflower steaks generously with the yogurt sauce.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish with olive oil. Set aside. To cook the bacon: Arrange the bacon in an even layer in a large skillet or Dutch oven. Heat the pan over medium heat and cook the bacon for 4 to 5 minutes per side until crispy. Remove the bacon (leave the fat in the pan for the chard) to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Crumble or chop the bacon into bite-sized pieces and set aside. To cook the chard: Remove all but a thin layer of bacon fat from the pan and heat over medium heat. When hot, add the onions. Season with a couple pinches of salt. Cook until the onions are softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the chard in batches, letting each batch wilt before adding the next. Once all the chard is added, season with salt and nutmeg. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the chard is wilted and no liquid remains in the bottom of the pan, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a strainer in the sink to drain. For the sauce: In a large mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin, chicken broth, cream and chipotle. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and whisk until smooth. In a separate, large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, parsley, egg and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan. To assemble the lasagna: Press out excess liquid from the chard with the back of a wooden spoon. Spread 1 cup of the pumpkin sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay 3 noodles side-by-side on top of the sauce. Dollop with a third of the ricotta mixture and spread evenly on top of the noodles with the back of a spoon. Top with a third of the chard mixture and then a third of the crispy bacon followed by 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with another layer of 3 noodles, and then 1 cup of sauce. Repeat layering with another third of the ricotta, a third of the chard, a third of bacon, 1 cup of mozzarella and another layer of noodles. Make a final layer of sauce, ricotta, chard, 1 cup mozzarella and noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over top. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella and the remaining 1/2 cup grated Parmesan. Cover the baking dish with foil, tenting it slightly so it doesn\u2019t stick to the cheese, and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until the edges are bubbly and the top is browned and crusty, 15 to 20 minutes more. Season with crushed red pepper flakes and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes before cutting into squares to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 47844,&quot;Chocolate Stout Cakes 1 1/2 cups Stout beer 1/2 cup 35 percent cream 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips 4 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 4 cups French bread with crust, cut into 1-inch cubes Whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Drain any juices from the turkey cavity and place the turkey on a rack in a large, shallow roasting pan, breast side up. Pat dry with paper towels.<br> Working from the large cavity end, gently run your fingers between the skin and the meat to loosen the skin, taking care not to tear it. (Don&#39;t do this with rings on your fingers!) Place the softened truffle butter under the skin and gently massage the skin to spread the butter evenly over the whole breast.<br> Sprinkle the cavity generously with salt and pepper. Place the onion, garlic, and half of the thyme sprigs in the cavity. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tie one length of string around the bird and the wings to keep the wings close to the body.<br> Brush the turkey all over with olive oil and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Remove 1 tablespoon of leaves from the remaining thyme sprigs, chop them, and sprinkle on the turkey. Roast the turkey for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until a meat thermometer placed in the center of the breast registers 160 degrees. Don&#39;t baste the turkey at all! About halfway through, when the breast is golden brown, cover the breast loosely with aluminum foil to prevent the skin from burning.<br> Remove the turkey from the oven, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes.

Make a well in the center and add the whole eggs, egg yolks and olive oil to the well. Whisk the wet ingredients with a fork, then slowly start to mix some flour into the wet ingredients, pulling from the inner edge of the well. Continue, mixing in just enough of the flour until the wet ingredients have turned into a soft dough. Push about one-quarter of the remaining flour to the side, then knead in the rest of the flour with your hands until the dough is very smooth and soft, 3 to 5 minutes. As you knead, bring in some of the reserved flour if the dough is too sticky or sprinkle the dough lightly with a few drops of water if it\u2019s too dry. The finished dough should be firm and a little dense. Wrap in plastic wrap, then let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Dust a baking sheet with all-purpose flour. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 of the pieces and set aside. Put the remaining piece on a floured surface, dust the top with more flour and gently flatten. Feed the dough through a pasta maker on the widest setting, then fold into thirds like a letter and feed through again. Fold and feed through again, dusting the pasta with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Move to the next setting and feed the dough through again, dusting with more flour as needed. Continue to feed the dough through each setting once until you reach the second-to-last setting and the dough is very thin. Remove to a work surface. Cut the dough in half crosswise if needed to fit on your surface. Measure the width of your dough: If it\u2019s less than 2 1/2 inches wide, leave it. If it\u2019s wider, halve the dough lengthwise to form 2 long rectangles. Trim the long sides of the dough so you\u2019re left with a long strip (or 2 long strips) that are 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches wide. Cut into 1-inch rectangles. To shape the farfalle, hold a dough rectangle with your thumb and index finger in the middle of the long sides. Gently fold them toward each other, then press on the curved part with your other index finger to make an accordion-style fold in the middle, pinching to seal. Place on the floured baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel. Continue shaping the farfalle, dusting them with flour if they seem sticky. Repeat the rolling and shaping process with the remaining pieces of dough. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in 2 batches, add the farfalle and cook, gently stirring occasionally, until al dente in the pinched center, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and toss with your sauce, adding pasta-cooking water as needed to loosen. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 47863,&quot;Crawfish Etouffee 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 8 crawfish tails, thawed, rinsed and drained 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 3 cups Etouffee Sauce, recipe follows Hot pepper sauce, as desired Rice Pilaf, recipe follows 2 bunches sliced green onions, for garnish 1 2/3 cups vegetable oil (soybean or cotton seed) 1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups medium dice onion, yellow or white 1 1/2 cups medium dice green pepper 1 cup medium dice celery, no leaves 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 3/4 teaspoons cayenne pepper 1 3/4 teaspoons ground white pepper 1 3/4 teaspoons whole thyme leaves 10 1/2 cups chicken stock or broth 1 2/3 cups diced tomatoes, with juice Salt 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/2 cup small dice red pepper 1/2 cup small dice yellow pepper 2 teaspoons chopped garlic 1 3/4 teaspoons cayenne pepper 1 3/4 teaspoons ground white pepper 1 3/4 teaspoons whole thyme leaves 1 3/4 teaspoons salt* 5 1/4 cups chicken stock or broth, heated 2 2/3 cups parboiled rice Instructions: In a large saute pan, melt butter over high heat.

Remove the skillet from the heat and let cool briefly. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and the capers, and then add the sauteed onion and garlic to the bowl. Stir the mixture together until thoroughly combined. If necessary, flatten the catfish fillets by placing them between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and gently pounding with a mallet or by rolling out with a rolling pin. Generously spread the bread crumb mixture on top of each fillet. Roll the fillets up, securing with a toothpick if desired. Heat a medium or large skillet over medium heat. Add enough olive oil to the pan for sauteing, about 1/4-inch up the side of the skillet, and let heat for 1 minute. Carefully place the rolled catfish fillets into the skillet, and cook until evenly browned on all sides, turning the fillets with tongs as needed.<br> Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive saucepan. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat until the sauce is reduced by half. Drizzle the sauce over the Stuffed Catfish. Coat the asparagus spears with vegetable oil, salt, and pepper. Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Saute the asparagus for a couple minutes until tender, rotating them with tongs, if necessary. Slice the sweet potatoes lengthwise. Heat a grill pan over medium heat and add just enough vegetable oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add the sliced sweet potatoes to the hot pan in a single layer, and grill until they turn slightly crispy. Turn each slice with tongs and continue grilling until the second side is slightly crispy and the sweet potatoes are fully heated through. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 47869,&quot;Apple and Pear Fruit Salad with Honey-Lime Vinaigrette 3 apples, chopped 3 pears, chopped<br> 2 peaches, pitted and chopped<br> Juice of 2 limes<br> 1/4 cup honey<br> 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, torn<br> Instructions: Add the apples, pears and pieces to a large bowl.

Preheat your oven to 200 degrees so you can hold the finished waffles until serving time. Melt the butter and reserve. In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pepper to combine. In a large bowl, beat the ricotta for 1 minute with a mixer until the mixer leaves tracks. Don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s not completely smooth. Add the eggs and beat for another minute. When the combination is smooth and shiny, add the milk. Turn the dry ingredients into the bowl with the ricotta mixture and whisk gently to combine. Stir in the melted butter. Lightly butter or spray the grids of your waffle iron, if needed. Brush or spray the grids again only if subsequent waffles stick. Spoon out 1 cup of batter for a Belgian waffle maker (or the amount recommended by your waffle maker&#39;s instructions) onto hot iron. Spread the batter evenly over the grids with a metal spatula or wooden spoon, stopping right before the edge. Close the lid and bake until pale golden and lightly crisped. Put finished waffles in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep in the preheated oven while you make the rest of the batch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 47872,&quot;Pizza Dough 1 1/2 teaspoons dry yeast 1/2 teaspoon sugar<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for coating bowl Instructions: In a small bowl, add 1/2 cup warm water (if the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate). Add the dry yeast and sugar, stir to combine and let sit for 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty; this is what you want. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water mix. Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth, clean work surface dusted with flour and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency. Lightly coat the mixing bowl with oil, return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour. When the dough is ready, portion it into six golf-ball-size pieces. (If you&#39;re not using the dough right away, wrap each ball individually in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.) Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like; I like irregular shapes). Top the pizzas as desired.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 47873,&quot;Emince Zurichoise 1 pound white mushrooms, sliced 4 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil<br> 1 1/2 cups demi-glace brown sauce<br> 1 1/4 pounds pork sirloin, sliced into thin 1-by-2-inch strips 2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon white pepper<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 cup finely minced onions<br> 1/4 cup white wine<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped curly parsley<br> Serving suggestion: potato rosti Instructions: Saute the mushrooms in 1 tablespoon of the oil until slightly brown, 3 to 5 minutes.

Toss gently to evenly coat. Heat a large saute pan over high heat and add the remaining three tablespoons oil. Once the oil is hot, add the seasoned pork strips and saute until cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. Add the onions and mushrooms to the pan and saute for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the white wine, brown sauce and heavy cream; cook for about 1 minute more, or until the sauce is boiling. Return the pork to the sauce, let simmer for 30 seconds, then turn off the heat to avoid overcooking.<br> Garnish with chopped parsley.

In a small bowl, sift together the flour and cocoa powder. Add the flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture in intervals, mixing well; don&#39;t overmix or the dough will become dry. Roll out the dough between two sheets of parchment until it&#39;s 1/8-inch thick. Gently melt the chocolates and butter together in a mixing bowl set over a pan of hot water. Stir in the salt, praline paste, and lemon zest. Gently fold in the feuilletine. Roll the mixture between two sheets of parchment paper until it&#39;s 1/8-inch thick. Heat the cream and apple puree in a small saucepan to just below a boil. In a small saucepan, mix together the yolks and sugar. Stir in the cream mixture very gradually to temper the yolks. Cook over medium heat until the mixture thickens, being careful not to overheat; it should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Let cool slightly. Add the bloomed gelatin. Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl. Stir in the Apfel Korn and salt. Cool on ice, stirring often, until cold but not set. Heat the apple puree in a saucepan. Add the bloomed gelatin and stir until dissolved. Stir in the liqueur and salt. Let cool. In a small saucepan, heat the sugar to 244 degrees F. Meanwhile, beat the egg whites to soft peaks in a bowl. When the sugar syrup reaches temperature, beat the whites to stiff peaks, and then reduce the mixer speed and carefully pour the sugar syrup over the whites. Beat until the meringue is stiff but still slightly warm. Add the meringue to the apple puree and fold in the whipped creme fraiche. In a saucepan, heat the honey, wine, water, sugar, and vanilla bean and bring up to a boil. Strain. Let cool until just warm. Add the lemon juice and Apfel Korn to the honey mixture. Preheat the oven to 175 to 200 degrees F. Put the apples and 4 cups of the Apfel Korn-honey syrup in a baking dish and cover. Bake until fully cooked but still firm. Let cool. Cut the apples into small dice. Bring the simple syrup, cream, milk, and glucose to a boil in a saucepan. Add the lemon zest, cover, and let steep for 10 minutes. Bring back up to just below a boil, let cool just slightly, and add the bloomed gelatin. Strain. Put the chocolate and pate a glace in a bowl and pour the syrup mixture on top. Buzz with a hand blender. Cool the glaze over a bowl filled with ice. In a large saucepan, combine the chestnut puree, milk, cream, 1 1/4 cups of the sugar, trimoline, and stabilizer. Bring to a boil and then strain. In a bowl, mix together the remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar and the yolks. Add the chestnut liquid gradually to the yolk mixture to temper it. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat until it reaches 175 degrees F. Strain again. Put immediately over ice to cool. Add the salt and lemon juice and freeze in an ice cream machine.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Brachetto]&quot; 47892,&quot;Prosciutto-Wrapped Shrimp and Melon Kosher salt 16 large shrimp, peeled and deveined (about 1 pound) 16 small thin slices melon (honeydew, cantaloupe and/or watermelon) 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon honey Freshly ground pepper 8 thin slices prosciutto, halved lengthwise 1/2 cup fresh basil 1/2 cup fresh parsley Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the shrimp and simmer until cooked through, about 2 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water; pat dry and transfer to a large bowl. Add the melon, 4 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons vinegar, the honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper; gently stir. Let marinate 15 minutes. Wrap 1 melon slice and 1 shrimp in a piece of prosciutto; secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Transfer the remaining marinade to a blender. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar and the herbs; puree. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the prosciutto-shrimp bundles with the dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 47893,&quot;Gluten-Free Apple Pie 350 grams (2 1/2 cups) gluten-free all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 175 grams (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes 75 grams (about 4 tablespoons) cold cream cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes 4 to 10 tablespoons ice-cold water 5 cups peeled and sliced apples 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg Instructions: For the dough: Put the flour and salt into the bowl of a food processor and whirl it up until the flour is fully aerated and fluffy. Add the butter and cream cheese and pulse several times, until the butter and cream cheese are roughly broken down into pieces the size of lima beans. (They won&#39;t all be the same size.) Add 4 tablespoons cold water to the flour mixture and pulse several times again. The flour should be starting to clump up with the butter and cream cheese, which will look more distinct in the mixture now. Pinch a bit of the flour and fats together in your fingers. If they stick together, the dough is ready. Most of the time, it might take a couple more tablespoons of water to make the dough cohere. (The mixture should look like cheese curds. Don&#39;t add so much water that the dough comes together in one clump.) Dump the dough onto a piece of parchment paper, taking care to remove the blade of the food processor. Using the heel of your hand, press the curds of dough together to form a coherent pie dough. Fold the dough onto itself several times, like turning the pages of a book. This will make the final dough flakier. Shape the dough into one large ball, then cut it into 2 pieces and flatten each piece into a small disc. Wrap the discs of dough in plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. For the pie: Meanwhile, put the apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg into a large bowl and toss them together. Let the filling sit while the pie dough is chilling. Pull one of the discs of dough out of the refrigerator and put it on a piece of parchment paper. Gently flatten it just a touch. Put another piece of parchment paper on top and roll out the dough, moving the rolling pin in small increments, like moving around the face of a clock. When the dough is large enough to be just bigger than a 9-inch pie pan, peel off the top piece of parchment paper and flip the dough onto a pie pan. Peel off the parchment paper. If any pieces stick to the paper, don&#39;t worry; simply peel them off and pat them in place. Tumble the apple filling into the pie shell. Roll out the remaining disc of dough the same way and put it on top of the pie. Tuck the edges together and crimp them. Make 3 slits in the top of the pie for steam vents. Put the pie into the freezer, 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the pie onto the prepared baking sheet and bake 15 minutes, then drop the temperature to 375 degrees F and bake until the crust is warm and browned and the juices from the apples are oozing out of the pie, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow the pie to cool to room temperature before slicing into it, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47894,&quot;Kids Can Make: Taco Cheeseburger 3 tablespoons chili powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds ground round beef 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 slices American cheese, halved 8 corn tortillas or hard taco shells 1 cup shredded iceberg lettuce 1 tomato, halved and thinly sliced 1/4 cup salsa or taco sauce Sour cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, cumin and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir until well mixed. Divide the ground beef into 4 equal sections, about 6 ounces each. Gently form the meat into thick disks, then place on a piece of wax paper. Press the patties until they&#39;re about 1/2-inch thick and 6 inches in diameter. Sprinkle each patty on both sides with the spice mix, using about 1/2 tablespoon per burger. Cut each patty in half, giving you 8 pieces. Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes. When the skillet is hot, add 1 tablespoon of the oil and 4 of the patties. Cook until the meat is browned half of the way up the side, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side. Place a half-slice of cheese (torn into a few pieces so it fits on the burger) to cover the patty and melt over the top. Cook until the patty is well-browned on the bottom, another 2 1/2 minutes. Remove the burgers to a plate, tent with foil, to allow the juices to redistribute, at least 5 minutes. Scrape out any crusty bits on the bottom of the skillet and pour off the extra grease. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and repeat the process for the remaining 4 patties. If using hard taco shells, place them on a baking sheet and warm in the oven for about 5 minutes. If using soft tortillas, wrap the stack of 8 in foil and warm for 5 minutes. Line the center of each taco with some lettuce, insert a patty and 2 tomato slices, then top with 1 teaspoon salsa and some sour cream, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 47895,&quot;Grilled Potatoes with Crabmeat-Green Onion Dressing 6 russet potatoes Kosher salt 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil 8 ounces jumbo lump crabmeat 4 green onions (green and pale green parts), thinly sliced 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> Canola oil, for brushing Cayenne powder Instructions: Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water by 2 inches and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Cook the beef, stirring to break it up into the smallest pieces possible, until browned and dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, pepper and onion and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, chili powder, dry mustard, paprika and 1/2 cup water and cook, stirring, until the sauce is reduced slightly, about 3 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Coat a 24-cup mini muffin tin with nonstick spray. Spoon 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of the sloppy joe filling into each of the muffin cups. Freeze until the filling is firm, at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Working with one tube of biscuits at a time (so they stay cold), open and separate out the biscuit rounds. (You will need only 12 of the biscuit rounds for this recipe; reserve any remaining rounds for another use.) Using your fingers, gently split a round apart horizontally so you have 2 thinner rounds of dough. Lightly press each thin round into a 3 1/2-inch-wide circle, concentrating on the edge so that it is thinner than the middle. Place a frozen puck of sloppy joe meat filling in the center of each thin round and then fold the edges of the dough over the filling, pinching the dough together to cover completely. (If the meat begins to thaw too much, freeze it along with the dough for 15 minutes and then continue wrapping.) Repeat with the remaining frozen meat filling and 11 more biscuit dough pieces.<br> Transfer the stuffed rounds seam-side down to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush each with the beaten egg and sprinkle with a pinch of paprika.

Mix together the brown sugar, dry mustard, cayenne, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Massage the rub into the ribs and let sit for 1 hour or up to overnight. If cooking on the grill, place the ribs meat-side down next to medium-hot coals that are about 225 degrees F. The indirect heat will cook them slower, making them tender. Allow to cook for 1 hour. Turn ribs every half hour and baste with the Kansas City Barbeque Sauce. Cook until the ribs are tender, about 3 to 4 hours. If cooking indoors, place in a roasting pan with a rack. Slather the ribs with the Kansas City Barbeque Sauce and tent a piece of aluminum foil over them. In a preheated 350 degrees F. oven, place the ribs, basting with the sauce every 30 minutes and removing the foil for the last 30 minutes and cooking until fork tender, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. In a small sauce pot on medium-high heat, heat the oil and add the onion, cooking until translucent. Add the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix together. Add to sauce pan and let simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Use to baste the pork spare ribs. 3 cups &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 47930,&quot;Chocolate Cheesecake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 2 cups thin pretzel sticks, finely crushed<br> 4 tablespoons butter, melted<br> 2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> 15 chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Oreos, finely crushed<br> 10 ounces semisweet chocolate Four 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br> 4 large eggs<br> 4 ounces dark chocolate chips 1 tablespoon coconut oil<br> Extra toppings, such as Cookie Pretzel Bark, recipe follows 8 ounces good-quality dark chocolate, chopped 1/2 cup thin pretzel sticks, broken into pieces<br> 5 chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Oreos, broken into pieces<br> Instructions: For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch nonstick springform pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with parchment, separately on the bottom and a collar around the sides. Mix together the pretzels, butter, sugar and cookie crumbs in a large bowl. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake the crust for 8 minutes. Set aside while you make the cheesecake. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. For the cheesecake: Melt the chocolate in the microwave or using a double boiler until smooth. Set aside. Beat the cream cheese and sugar in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed until very smooth, about 1 minute, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Turn the mixer to low, add the sour cream and cocoa powder and mix until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the melted chocolate and then the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until mixed; do not overmix. Pour the filling over the crust and spread into an even layer. Double-wrap the bottom of the springform pan with foil, sealing it tightly to prevent water from getting into the pan. Place the springform pan into a larger pan and pour very hot water into the pan until it is about 3/4 inch deep, being careful to make sure the water level doesn&#39;t come up higher than the foil. Bake until the center is almost set, 60 to 70 minutes. The center will still jiggle, while the edges will be set. Crack the oven door and allow the cake to cool in the oven for 1 to 2 hours. Remove the cake from the oven and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and preferably overnight. For the chocolate topping: Add the dark chocolate and coconut oil to a double boiler and heat until melted. Let cool slightly, then pour over the cheesecake, spreading so that the sauce drips slightly over the side. The chocolate will harden quickly, so immediately decorate the top of the cake with any additional toppings such as Cookie Pretzel Bark. Cut into wedges and serve chilled. Line a small baking sheet with parchment. Place a large glass bowl over a pot of simmering water so that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water and add the chocolate. Heat until melted. Spread the chocolate into a thin layer on the parchment. Sprinkle the crushed pretzels and cookies on the melted chocolate and place in the freezer until completely hardened, 10 to 15 minutes. Break into pieces and use to decorate the top of the cheesecake. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 47931,&quot;Chocolate Cloud Cake 9 ounces bittersweet chocolate, minimum 70 percent cocoa solids 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 6 eggs, 2 whole, 4 separated 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons orange-flavored liqueur, optional (recommended: Cointreau) 1 orange, zested 2 cups heavy cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon orange-flavored liqueur, optional (recommended: Cointreau) 1/2 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder, for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of the cake pan with baking parchment. Melt the chocolate either in a double boiler or a microwave, add the butter and let melt in the warm chocolate. Beat the 2 whole eggs and 4 egg yolks with 1/3 cup of the sugar, then gently add the chocolate mixture, the orange-flavored liqueur and the orange zest. In another bowl, whisk the 4 egg whites until foamy, then gradually add the remaining sugar and whisk until the whites hold their shape but are not too stiff. Lighten the chocolate mixture with a dollop of egg whites, and then fold in the rest of the whites. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the cake is risen and cracked and the center is no long wobbly. Cool the cake in its pan on a wire rack; the middle will sink as it cools. When you are ready to eat, place the still pan-bound cake on a cake stand or plate for serving and carefully remove the sides of the pan from the cake. Don&#39;t worry about cracks or rough edges, it&#39;s the crater look we&#39;re going for here. Whip the cream until it&#39;s soft and then add the vanilla and orange-flavored liqueur and continue whisking until the cream is firm but not stiff. Fill the crater of the cake with the whipped cream, easing it out gently towards the edges of the cake, and dust the top lightly with cocoa powder pushed through a tea-strainer. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 47932,&quot;Grilled Marlin 4 (6 to 8-ounce) marlin steaks Vegetable oil 1 large carrot, julienned 1 cup red cabbage, shredded 1 cup bok choy, thinly sliced 1 cup Chinese cabbage, shredded 1/2 Vidalia onion, thinly sliced 1/2 lemon, juiced 1/4 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons honey mustard 3 tablespoons poppyseed dressing Salt and pepper 1/2 to 1/3 cup olive oil Instructions: Season marlin with salt and pepper, rub with olive oil.

Gently dry the bread under the broiler, just until dry and with no browning. In a small bowl, toss the cheese with the white wine and allow to sit. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together the sour cream, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper. On a baking sheet, lay out the bread slices. Take less than one-quarter of the sour cream mixture and divide evenly among the bread slices, spreading thinly to coat 1 side of each slice. Next, evenly distribute the ham on top of the bread. Divide the rest of the sour cream mixture over the ham. Spoon the cheese on top of the sour cream mixture, blotting lightly before adding to remove any excess wine. Preheat a large, nonstick saute pan over medium heat and melt the butter. Crack the eggs into the pan and fry, either over-easy or sunny-side up, according to your preference. While the eggs are cooking, place the open-faced sandwiches under the broiler until very bubbly and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Watch closely and don&#39;t let the topping burn. Place each sandwich on a plate. Season the fried eggs with salt and pepper and place 1 egg on each sandwich.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon fat has rendered and the onions soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the bacon is crispy and the onions take on some color, about 6 minutes more. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. To assemble the pizzas, lay the bread rounds on the prepared baking sheets. Divide the sour cream over each piece of bread, leaving a small rim exposed to serve as a crust. Divide the cheese and the bacon mixture over each piece. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until crispy around the edges and the cheese melts, 8 to 10 minutes. For the magic eggs: Place the shredded cabbage in a microwave-safe bowl with about 1 1/2 cups water. Cover with a damp paper towel and microwave for 2 to 3 minutes so the cabbage steams and releases its juice into the water, turning it purple. Place 4 egg whites into 4 small bowls. Pour 1 tablespoon colored water into each egg white. Whisk vigorously (using a whisk, not a fork) to fully incorporate the water into the egg white. Watch the color change before your eyes! Place the saute pan used to cook the bacon over medium heat. Add the egg whites, keeping them separate, and cook until almost firm, about 2 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to release the sides of the egg whites from the pan. Place 1 egg yolk in the center of each egg white. Cook to desired doneness, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining egg. Place 1 egg on top of each pizza. Sprinkle with the arugula and flakey sea salt. Slice into quarters and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 47994,&quot;Fried Chicken 1 fryer chicken, cut into 10 pieces 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 cup hot sauce<br> 1/2 cup buttermilk<br> 3 large eggs<br> Peanut oil, for frying<br> 2 1/2 cups self-rising flour<br> Instructions: Season the chicken on both sides with the salt, pepper and garlic powder. In a large bowl big enough to accommodate all of the chicken, whisk together the hot sauce, buttermilk and eggs. Add the chicken and toss to combine.<br> Cover and marinate, refrigerated, at least 2 hours and up to 4. In a large Dutch oven, heat a couple inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Dredge the chicken in the flour, taking care to evenly coat each piece. Transfer in batches to the hot oil, cover and let cook 5 minutes. Remove the cover and turn the chicken. Let cook, uncovered, an additional 5 minutes.<br> Transfer the chicken to a baking sheet. When all of the pieces are fried, bake the chicken an additional 10 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Zinfandel]&quot; 47995,&quot;Lattice Crust Apple Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 14 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced 1 large egg, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 3 pounds baking apples like Golden Delicious, Cortland or Mutsu 2/3 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling on the pie 1/2 stick unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Generous pinch of ground nutmeg 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions: To make the dough by hand: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture.<br> To make the dough in a food processor: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor fitted with the metal blade until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry, add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade and bring the dough together by hand.<br> Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.<br> For the filling: Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apple with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and toss to combine evenly.<br> Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes.<br> Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice. Shake the colander to get as much liquid as possible. Return the juices to the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes.<br> Toss the apples with the reduced juice and spices in a medium bowl. Set aside to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up to 6 months.)<br> To assemble the pie: Cut the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a disc 11 to 12 inches wide. Layer the dough between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.<br> Place a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one of the discs of dough, and trim it so it lays about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Add the apple filling to the pan. Use a chef&#39;s knife or a pizza cutter and cut the second round into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lay strips of dough, evenly spaced, across the entire pie. Weave more strips of dough perpendicular through the previous strips to make a lattice or basket weave design across the entire pie. Trim the excess ends from the strips of dough. Pinch the bottom crust edge and lattice edge together, and flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a rack for at least 3 hours before serving. The pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 47996,&quot;Raviolo al Uovo 1 cup dried porcinis 4 ounces chanterelles, halved Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Four 1/8-inch slices guanciale, finely diced 10 leaves fresh sage, plus 2 sprigs for the sauce 2 cups ricotta cheese 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano, plus more for garnish 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 10 large eggs, all heirloom or organic All-purpose flour, as needed 1/2 recipe Chef Anne&#39;s All-Purpose Pasta Dough, rolled into sheets for ravioli, recipe follows Semolina flour, as needed 1 stick unsalted butter 1/2 cup chicken stock 1 pound all-purpose flour 4 large eggs plus 1 yolk, all heirloom or organic 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 to 2 tablespoons water, or more if needed Kosher salt Instructions: Cover the porcinis with hot or room temp water and allow to sit for 30 minutes. Remove from the liquid with a slotted spoon before dicing into small pieces. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Toss the chanterelles with olive oil and season with salt. Put on a sheet tray and roast in the oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Reserve for garnish. To a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the guanciale and render until crispy. Transfer the guanciale with a slotted spoon onto a paper towel-lined plate. To the guanciale fat in the pan, add the sage leaves and fry until crispy, about 30 seconds. Season the sage leaves with salt. Crumble the sage and set aside. Reserve the guanciale and sage for garnish. In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmigiano, parsley, 2 whole eggs and the diced porcinis; mix well and season with salt. Dust a clean work surface lightly with all-purpose flour and lay out 2 sheets (at least 12 inches long) of the rolled Chef Anne&#39;s All-Purpose Pasta Dough; brush them lightly with water. Equally space 4 dollops of the ricotta mixture on each pasta sheet, then use a spoon to make a \nest\ or small hole in the center of each dollop. Carefully separate the remaining 8 eggs one at a time and put a yolk in each ricotta \nest\ the ricotta should lovingly nestle each yolk (if a yolk breaks, scoop it out with a spoon and don&#39;t use it). Cover each sheet of ricotta \nests\ and egg yolks with another sheet of pasta. Use your index fingers to press around each ricotta nest to seal the edges, then use a fluted ring cutter or dough roller to cut around each ravioli (they should be 3 to 4 inches in diameter). Reserve the ravioli on a tray generously dusted with semolina. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. In a large saute pan, melt 1/2 stick of the butter and add 1/4 cup of the chicken stock (you&#39;re going to use the remainder for your next batch); add a sage sprig and season with salt. Bring this to boil and reduce to a simmer. Add 4 of the ravioli to the boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes, no more. Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully transfer the ravioli from the water to the pan with the butter and chicken stock and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. If the sauce reduces too much, add a few drops of the pasta cooking water. The sauce should cling to the ravioli in a buttery hug. Repeat with the remaining 4 ravioli, using the remaining 1/2 stick butter, 1/4 cup chicken stock and 1 sprig sage to make the sauce. Transfer the ravioli to serving plates, 1 per plate. Spoon a little extra sauce over each one and finish with a sprinkey-dink of the grated Parm, guanciale, chanterelles and fried sage. Put the flour on a clean dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, water and salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water and salt. Using the fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture; be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading, it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately after that, do not refrigerate. Roll and cut the pasta into the desired shape. How smooth and supple! &quot;,&quot;[Barbaresco, Barolo, Dolcetto, Gaja]&quot; 47997,&quot;Chipotle Chuck Steak Burrito with Habanero Hot Sauce and Guacamole Olive oil, for frying 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced 1 heaping teaspoon ground cumin 1 heaping teaspoon hot smoked paprika 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon or 1 cinnamon stick 1 pound chuck steak, cubed into 1-inch chunks 1 cup chipotles in adobo sauce 2 tablespoons dried oregano Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1.8 ounces dark chocolate Six 12-inch flour tortillas Monterey Jack cheese, grated 2 cups long-grain rice, cooked until fluffy (not wet) 2 1/2 cups black beans Fresh cilantro, roughly chopped, for sprinkling Guacamole, recipe follows Habanero Hot Sauce, recipe follows Tomato Salsa, recipe follows Iceberg lettuce, shredded, for serving Sour cream, for serving 4 Hass avocados 6 sprigs fresh cilantro, roughly chopped Juice of 1 lime 1/2 clove garlic, crushed 1/2 red onion, finely chopped 1/2 tomato, finely chopped 1/4 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped Olive oil, for drizzling Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 habanero chiles Juice of 1/2 lime Pinch caster sugar Olive oil, for drizzling 4 ripe tomatoes, finely diced 1 birds eye cl, optional Juice of 1 lime 1/2 red onion, finely diced 1/2 Spanish onion, finely diced Handful chopped fresh cilantro 2 pinches caster sugar Pinch sea salt Drizzle olive oil Instructions: For the chipotle steak: Add some olive oil to a large saucepan and fry the onions slowly until soft.

Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the rice is fully cooked and not much water remains, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Add 4 1/2 cups milk to the rice and stir to combine. Stir in the sugar and vanilla extract. Mix the cornstarch with 1/2 cup water and the remaining 1/2 cup milk in a small bowl or measuring cup. Stir the mixture into the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring often to prevent the bottom from scorching, until the mixture has thickened slightly and the rice is very tender, about 30 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). Remove from the heat. Place six 6- to 8-ounce ramekins or small oven-safe clay bowls in a large baking dish or roasting pan. Using a ladle, divide the rice pudding among the ramekins, filling them almost to the rim. Fill the baking dish halfway with warm water. Carefully transfer the baking dish to the middle rack in the oven and bake until the tops of the stla? start to caramelize and brown, about 15 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F and continue to bake until the tops are nicely caramelized and browned in spots, 5 to 10 minutes more. Keep an eye on them since they brown easily. Remove the ramekins to a cooling rack and let them cool completely. Then refrigerate the stla? for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Before serving, top each ramekin with pistachios. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 48045,&quot;Fregolata: Crumb Cookie (Italy) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened 2/3 cup whole unblanched almonds, toasted (about 3 ounces) 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 large egg yolks 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 1 to 2 tablespoons whole milk Confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment. Pulse the nuts in a food processor to finely chop, allowing some larger pieces of nuts to remain. In a large bowl, combine butter, almonds, flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of the milk. Add the extract. Drizzle yolk mixture over almond mixture and toss with fingers to combine and get everything moistened. (If needed add up to 1 more tablespoon of milk.) Mixture should still be crumbly, but not dry, like a crisp topping. Sprinkle 1 cup (about half of the crumbs) on the prepared baking sheet and press lightly to create a thin, even 8-inch round. Sprinkle remaining crumbs over the top to give the cookie some texture. Bake until golden brown and crisp, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking, about 30 minutes. For an extra crispy cookie, turn oven off at this point and let the pan rest in oven for 10 minutes. Cool on a rack until easy to handle. Slip the fregolata on the paper onto a rack to cool completely. When cool, sift confectioners&#39; sugar over top. To serve, place a whole almond or overturned demitasse spoon under the center of the fregolata and rap the top with a spoon or the side of a knife to crack into serving pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 48046,&quot;Juice of a Few Flowers 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (2 oranges) 1/2 cup freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice (1 grapefruit) 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (1 lemon) 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (2 limes) 1 cup good vodka, such as Grey Goose or Finlandia (optional) Extra lemon juice Granulated sugar Fresh mint sprigs Instructions: Combine the orange juice, grapefruit juice, lemon juice, lime juice, and vodka, if using, in a pitcher.

Add the egg white, vinegar, and water, and pulse 1 or 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add a couple of teaspoons of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Lightly spray a 9-inch pie pan with oil. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a thin disk, about 13 inches in diameter. Transfer the dough to the prepared pie pan and trim the edges, leaving about one inch hanging over the edge. Tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to form an edge even with the rim. Flute the edge as desired. Freeze the crust for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line the crust with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake on the center rack until firm and just cooked, about 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.

For added sparkle, unbaked cookies may be rolled in coarse bakery sugar crystals before being placed on cookie sheet to chill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 48059,&quot;Make-Ahead Paella Casserole 5 tablespoons butter, softened 1/2 cup broken thin spaghetti or orzo pasta 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice Generous pinch saffron threads 3 to 3 1/2 cups chicken stock All-purpose flour or instant flour, such as Wondra, for dredging 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked sweet paprika 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 5 tablespoons EVOO 8 ounces Spanish chorizo, chopped 3 to 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 onion, chopped 1/2 cup plus a splash dry sherry One 1-pound, thick center-cut fillet sustainable cod or black cod 1 cup frozen peas, thawed 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 2 roasted red bell peppers, chopped Seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 lemon 1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Cook&#39;s Note: To roast bell peppers, arrange them on a baking sheet and broil, turning occasionally, until the skins are blackened. Transfer the peppers to a bowl, cover and let cool. Peel and seed the peppers. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a casserole dish with 2 tablespoons butter. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the pasta and toast until golden. Stir in the rice and saffron. Add 3 cups stock and bring to boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook until al dente, about 17 minutes. Add an extra 1/2 cup water if the liquid evaporates before the rice is tender. Meanwhile, season some flour with the paprika in a shallow dish. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper, then dredge in the flour and shake off the excess. Heat 3 tablespoons EVOO in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned and crisp on both sides, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to rest. Add 1 tablespoon EVOO to the skillet, then add the chorizo and cook until the fat begins to render, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Deglaze with a splash of sherry, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Stir in the peas, thyme and roasted peppers and immediately remove from the heat. Slice the chicken and combine with the rice mixture and chorizo-pepper mixture. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Bake until heated through and the bottom is crisp, 30 to 40 minutes. Add a splash of stock, about 1/2 cup, if the top of the casserole dries out too much. Meanwhile, cover the fish with about 1/2 cup kosher salt and let stand for 10 minutes. Rinse and pat dry. Season some flour with seafood seasoning in a small dish. Lightly dredge the fish in the flour and shake off the excess. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon EVOO in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fish and cook until firm and opaque, 5 to 6 minutes, turning once. Transfer the fish to a plate. Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook until pink, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and 1/2 cup sherry, then swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter until melted. Add the parsley. Flake the fish into pieces. Top the casserole with the fish, shrimp and sherry sauce. Divide among plates. Cook&#39;s Notes: Always buy seafood within 24 hours of serving. Quick-salting cod with salt is a technique of NYC chef George Mendez. It gives the fish a firmer texture and more pronounced flavor. The casserole can be covered and refrigerated before baking for a make-ahead meal. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Rioja, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48060,&quot;Muchos Tacos 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound (net) cleaned squid and cut into 1/4inch rounds 1 peeled clove garlic, passed through a press 2 to 3 tablespoons Tequila or fresh lime juice 1/2 cup black olives Salt and dried red pepper flakes Mesclun, arugula or watercress salad dressed with cumin vinaigrette citrus salsa, optional: 1 red grapefruit or 2 navel oranges, peeled and cut into supremes mixed with 1/4 cup finely minced red onion and a little bit of olive oil to taste 2 tablespoons oil 8 ounces ground chuck beef 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 cup thawed frozen corn kernels 4 to 6 tablespoons prepared tomato sauce, ketchup or barbecue sauce Salt Sour cream and chopped fresh tomatoes for topping Instructions: Heat the oil in a skillet.

Line a baking sheet with two layers of parchment paper. Set aside.<br> In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt until evenly combined. Rub 2 tablespoons of the butter into the flour with your fingertips, until it is completely absorbed. Work the remaining butter into the flour until it is in even pieces about the size of a pea. Gently stir the milk into the flour mixture with a fork to make a loose dough.<br> Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface. Pat the dough by hand into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Fold the dough in thirds like a business letter. (For a flakier biscuit repeat this folding a second time.) Pat the dough into a 5 by 8-inch rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Use a 2- to 3-inch round cutter to make 6 biscuits, and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Press together the scraps of dough, cut 2 more biscuits, and place them on the baking sheet.<br> Make a glaze by mixing the cream and melted butter together in a small bowl.

Pat the ribs dry, then season with the salt.<br> Pour some water in the drip pan and place some presoaked wood chunks or a packet of presoaked wood chips directly on the hot coals. Oil the hot grate and place the ribs in your grill or smoker, meat side up. Cover and smoke for a total of 6 hours. After about 5 hours, begin to baste the ribs with the BBQ Sauce about every 20 minutes. The ribs are done when the meat cracks when picked up (with tongs) and they reach an internal temperature of 170 to 180 degrees F.<br> To finish the ribs, throw them on the grill over direct medium heat to let the sauce caramelize. Baste between turns, and you&#39;re done. This is our core sauce based on the western North Carolina style. It&#39;s a good idea to keep extra in the fridge because it goes well with everything from fries to chicken fingers.

Place them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap to cool (this will make peeling them easier). When cool; peel, seed and dice the poblano peppers. Dice the onions and bell pepper. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or kettle. Add onions, yellow bell pepper, poblano peppers, pressed garlic, chili powder and ancho chili powder. Saute this mixture until the onions are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the diced chicken breast and continue to cook until chicken is fully cooked, 10 to 15 minutes depending on the size of your dice. Wash and stem the tomatillos then run them through a food processor until they are pulverized, but still have some texture (you could dice them by hand, but this will leave the tomatillo skins floating around in your finished product). Add the tomatillos and the broth to the chicken and pepper mixture. After this is heated through (about 10 minutes), check the spiciness and, if necessary, add either a finely chopped jalapeno or serrano pepper for more heat (we&#39;re looking for a slow, sustained burn, not fire).

Let marinate at room temperature for 2 hours.<br> Crack the eggs into a medium glass bowl, and beat them until they turn pale yellow. Heat a heavy-bottomed nonstick saute pan over medium-low heat; add the butter, and let it melt. Sprinkle the eggs with some salt and white pepper, then grab your whisk and whisk like crazy. When the butter in the pan is hot enough to make a drop of water hiss, pour in the eggs. Let the eggs cook for up to a minute-don&#39;t stir!-or until the bottom starts to set.<br> With a heat-resistant rubber spatula, gently push 1 edge of the eggs into the center of the pan while tilting the pan to allow the still-liquid eggs to flow in underneath. Repeat with the other edges until there&#39;s no liquid left. Your eggs should now resemble a bright yellow pancake, which should easily slide around on the nonstick surface. If it sticks at all, loosen it with your spatula.<br> Gently flip the egg pancake over, using your spatula to ease it over if necessary. Cook for another few seconds, or until there is no uncooked egg left. With your spatula, lift 1 edge of the egg and fold it across and over, so the edges line up; don&#39;t overcook or allow the egg to turn brown. If necessary, you can flip the entire omelet over to cook the top for 30 seconds or so. Just don&#39;t let it get brown.<br> Gently transfer the finished omelet to a plate. Serve with the marinated vegetables, and top with pickled vegetables. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 48083,&quot;Root Vegetable Hash with Horseradish Cream 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Pinch freshly ground pepper 4 tablespoons butter, diced 1 onion, sliced thinly, 1 cup (4 ounces) 2 springs fresh rosemary 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 pound Yukon gold or other waxy potatoes, skin on 1 large carrot (2 to 3 ounces) 1 large beet, peeled (4 ounces) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the horseradish cream, whisk the horseradish into the sour cream and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large (10-inch) nonstick skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and rosemary and cook, stirring occasionally until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic to the onion and cook another minute. Meanwhile, with the shredding blade of a food processor, or with a box grater, grate the potatoes into a colander. Rinse and pat very dry. (Giving them a turn in a salad spinner helps, too.) Stir the potatoes into the vegetables in the skillet. Cook the potatoes, undisturbed until they get crusty on the bottom. Then, stir the crispy bottom into the tender potato, and continue to cook to re-crisp the bottom. Continue this browning and periodic stirring until the potatoes are almost cooked through, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, shred the carrot and beet. Remove the rosemary sprigs. Stir the carrot and beets into the potato hash, and cook until slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Press the hash into an even cake. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in bits along the sides of the skillet, and then brown the hash over high heat. Turn the hash in large sections with a spatula to brown the other sides, another minute. Divide the vegetable hash among 4 plates and serve warm with the horseradish cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 48084,&quot;Daffodil Driver 1 part apricot nectar 1 shot peach vodka 1/2 shot apricot brandy 1/2 shot orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) Orange wheel, for garnish Lemon wheel, for garnish Instructions: To a cocktail shaker filled with ice, add peach vodka, apricot brandy, and Grand Marnier.

Line 18 cups of two 12-cup muffin tins with cupcake liners. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, cayenne, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the granulated sugar and butter until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. Combine the milk and bourbon in a small bowl. Add the flour mixture to the butter-sugar mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the milk-bourbon mixture in 2 additions. Beat the batter until smooth. Using an ice cream scoop, fill each muffin cup two-thirds full with batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. For the buttercream frosting: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium high and mix until smooth. Adjust the consistency with milk as desired. Add a drop or two of blue food coloring to the frosting and mix until the desired color is achieved, adding more drops if needed. For decorating: Roll the yellow gum paste very thin (about 1/8 inch thick or thinner). Using a 1 1/2-inch round cutter, cut 12 rounds from the gum paste. Elevate a wooden dowel or thin-handled wooden spoon on 2 cans or paper cups with notches cut to hold in place. Drape the gum paste rounds over the dowel to dry and form taco shells, about 30 minutes. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a leaf tip (no. 113) with the blue buttercream frosting. Starting in the center of each of 12 cupcakes, while spinning the cupcake, pipe the frosting on a flat angle to the top of the cupcake, moving the bag slightly up and down to form a ruffle. Cover the top of each cupcake completely with frosting. Add the coconut to a small bowl with a few drops of green food coloring. Stir with a fork to distribute the food coloring, adding additional coloring until the desired lettuce color is reached. Snip the red gummy candy into small pieces using kitchen shears to form the tomato salsa. Crumble one of the remaining cupcakes to fine crumbs to form the taco meat. Assemble the tacos by layering each taco shell with some cupcake crumbs, green coconut and red gummy tomatoes. Finish by grating white chocolate over the top of each for a cheese effect. Place one taco on top of each frosted cupcake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48086,&quot;Apple Oatmeal Crisp Cookies 1 cup prepared apple pie filling One 17.5-ounce oatmeal cookie baking mix<br> Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium speed until well mixed, about 1 minute, then beat in the vanilla. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating smooth after each addition. Scrape the bowl and beater well and beat in the flour mixture followed immediately by the almonds. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and shape and squeeze it into two rough cylinders, each about 10 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Roll a piece of parchment or waxed paper around each piece of dough and tighten by pressing it in with the side of a cookie sheet or a piece of stiff cardboard. Chill the dough until firm. Or, at this stage, it can be double-wrapped in plastic, frozen, and kept for up to several weeks. When you are ready to bake the cookies, set the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Slice the cookies 1/4-inch thick, rotating the roll of dough often as you slice so it doesn&#39;t become squashed from the weight of the knife. Arrange the cookies on the prepared pans about 1-inch apart in all directions and bake them for about 12 to 15 minutes, until they have puffed somewhat and have become dull and are firm to the touch. Slide the papers from the pans onto racks. After the cookies have cooled, store them between sheets of parchment or waxed paper in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting cover. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48091,&quot;The Best Focaccia 6 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)<br> 2 teaspoons sugar<br> 2 1/2 cups warm water (80 to 85 degrees F)<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt Nonstick cooking spray, for the plastic wrap<br> Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Instructions: For the dough: Whisk together the flour, yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook on low speed, stir in the warm water and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, mixing until the flour is completely moistened. Let stand 5 minutes. Add the salt and knead on medium speed for 5 minutes. (The dough will tighten up, then begin to relax. After 5 minutes it will be very wet and stick to the bottom of the mixer but not the sides.)<br> Rub 2 tablespoons olive oil around the bottom and sides of a large mixing bowl (big enough to hold at least double the volume of the dough). Using a scraper or spatula, transfer the dough to the bowl, flipping once to coat completely with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit until doubled in size, about 2 hours.<br> Pour the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil into the bottom of an 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Use your hands to evenly distribute the oil along the bottom and up the sides. Scrape the dough into the baking sheet, flattening it slightly with your hands. Flip the dough once and gently stretch it to fit into an even layer in the baking sheet. (The dough may not stretch to the edges at this point. If it starts to pull back, let rest 10 minutes and re-stretch, making sure to pull from the center as well as the edges to get an even thickness.) Use your fingertips to make dimples over the surface of the focaccia, pressing firmly but not so hard you make holes in the dough.<br> For the brine and finish: Dissolve the kosher salt in 1/3 cup warm water. Drizzle over the surface of the focaccia, letting it pool in the dimples. Cover loosely with plastic wrap that has been lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Let sit in a warm place for 45 minutes to relax and rise again.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> Remove the plastic wrap from the dough and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake, rotating the baking sheet once halfway through, until the focaccia is deep golden brown on the top and bottom, 30 to 35 minutes. Drizzle with the olive oil and let sit for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to remove the focaccia to a wire rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 48092,&quot;Beet and Potato Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing and Dill 2 pounds new potatoes, quartered 3 tablespoons coconut oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 pound beets, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice<br> 2/3 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/3 cup buttermilk<br> 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard<br> 1 cup chopped celery (about 2 stalks) 1/4 cup chopped green onions (just the greens) 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill<br> 4 ounces blue cheese, crumbled (I like Smokey Blue best)<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Sift the dry ingredients onto a piece of parchment or waxed paper and set aside. Beat the butter and sugar together in an electric mixer set at medium speed. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating smooth after each addition. Lower mixer speed to low and beat in half the dry ingredients. Scrape bowl and beaters well. Add the sour cream and scrape again, then beat in the remainder of the dry ingredients. Scrape batter into prepared pans and bake cake 30 to 35 minutes, or until well risen and a toothpick or knife inserted into the center of the cake emerges clean. Cool in pans on a rack for 5 minutes, then turn out of pans. Turn cake over again so it stands right side up to finish cooling. Line 2 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment. For the cookie dough, in a mixing bowl beat butter with an electric mixer set at medium speed until soft and light. Beat in 1 cup sugar and continue beating until sugar is completely incorporated. Beat in yolks, one at a time, beating smooth between each addition, scraping bowl and beaters occasionally. Beat in ground almonds. Sift flour over butter and egg mixture and fold in with a rubber spatula, making sure flour is completely absorbed. Stretch a piece of plastic wrap on a plate or cookie sheet and scrape dough onto wrap. Cover with another piece of plastic wrap and press dough into a 10-inch square, about 1/2-inch thick. Chill dough until firm, about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide dough in quarters and remove one quarter at a time from refrigerator to roll. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and lightly flour dough. Pound dough gently with rolling pin to soften it and roll dough to an 8-inch square about 3 1/6-inch thick. Cut dough into rounds with a plain 1 3/4- to 2-inch cutter. Arrange rounds on pans, about 1-inch apart, as they are cut. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough, refrigerating scraps between each rolling. After all the dough has been rolled and cut, press scraps together and re-roll them to make more cookie bases. Count bases and make a 1/2-inch hole in half the bases, using a small pastry tube. Place pans of cookies in oven and immediately lower temperature to 325 degrees. Bake the cookies about 20 minutes, until they are pale golden and firm. Cool on pans on racks. To finish cookies, lightly dust the pierced cookie bases with confectioners&#39; sugar. Arrange unpierced bases, upside down, on a clean pan. Bring jam to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat and allow jam to reduce for a minute or two, until slightly thickened. Gently spoon about 1/4 teaspoon of jam on each unpierced base, spreading it to within 1/8 of an inch of the edge. Top with pierced cookies. Place remaining jam in a small plastic bag and force it into one corner. Snip a small hole in the corner and squeeze a drop of jam into each opening in tops of cookies. Allow jam to dry. To store, arrange cookies in layers with waxed or parchment paper between in an airtight container. Garnish each with a raspberry before serving, if desired. Line 2 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment. For the dough, combine all the dry ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to mix. Cut butter into 12 pieces and add; pulse to mix in finely. Add eggs and pulse to form a ball. Form the dough into a rectangle and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until needed, up to 2 days. For the filling, rinse, halve and pit the apricots. Sprinkle the cut edge of each with a little sugar. When ready to form the pastries, preheat oven to 350 degrees and set racks in upper and lower thirds. Divide dough in half and roll each half to a 8 by14-inch rectangle. Cut each into 4-inch squares, reserving the left-over pieces of dough. Place the squares of dough on the baking pans and center an apricot, cut side down on each. Make a cut in the corner of each square of dough, through the corner and up to the apricot. Fold over every other slashed corner of dough to meet in the center over the apricot. Egg wash the top of each pastry and cut a 1 1/2-inch disk from the leftover dough to top each pastry. Egg wash the disks on the pastries. Bake the pastries about 20 to 25 minutes, turning them back to front and switching pan positions several times so that they bake evenly. Cool on the pans on racks. To finish the pastries, bring jam and rum to a boil in a saucepan and strain into another pan. Bring to a boil and simmer about 5 minutes, until no longer watery. Paint the top of each cooled pastry with the glaze and sprinkle with the almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48097,&quot;Fettuccine with Walnuts and Parsley 12 ounces (3/4 box) whole-wheat fettuccine 2/3 cup chopped toasted walnuts, 2 tablespoons reserved for garnish 1/4 cup olive oil 5 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken stock 1/2 cup chopped parsley leaves, plus more for garnish 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 1 ounce grated Parmesan (about 3/4 cup) 2 cups arugula leaves, gently packed Instructions: Cook the pasta al dente according to package directions, then drain in a colander.
