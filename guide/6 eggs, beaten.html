In a roasting pan, fitted with a rack, add the turkey drumsticks, making sure there is room between each for even cooking. Roast for 90 minutes. Remove from the oven to a serving platter and serve hot or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 64367,&quot;Roasted Prime Rib with Thyme and Marsala 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 tablespoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons arrowroot 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 cloves garlic, minced One 6-pound bone-in beef prime rib roast, trussed 2 cups low-sodium beef broth 1 cup sweet marsala 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the beef: Allow the beef to stand at room temperature before roasting, 30 minutes. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Mix together the thyme, salt, pepper and garlic in a small bowl. Make 1-inch-long, 1/2-inch-deep slits all over the meat using a paring knife. Rub the garlic mixture into the slits and onto the rest of the meat. Place the meat, fat-side up, in a shallow roasting pan. Roast for 45 minutes. Cover the meat with foil and continue to roast until a meat thermometer inserted straight down into the center of the meat registers 145 degrees F for medium-rare, 65 to 75 minutes. Place the roast on a baking sheet and tent with foil. Allow to rest for 20 minutes. For the sauce: Combine any juices from the rested meat with the broth, marsala, arrowroot and thyme in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat and simmer until thick, 20 minutes. Whisk in the butter until smooth and season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce into a serving pitcher. Slice the roast into 1/2-inch-thick slices and arrange on a platter. Serve the sauce alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 64368,&quot;Apple Cranberry Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 4 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 14 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter, diced 1 large egg, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water 2 1/2 pounds baking apples like Golden Delicious, Cortland or Mutsu 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 cups (about 8 ounces) frozen cranberries, thawed and drained 3/4 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions: For the crust: Whisk the flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of cold butter. (If the butter gets too soft, refrigerate the mixture for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Use a fork to stir in the egg and water mixture until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more cold water.) Divide the dough into two equal-sized disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. For the filling: Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges and place in a bowl with the lemon juice and cranberries, tossing to combine. Add the sugar and toss again to combine evenly. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apple mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low, cooking until the apples soften and release most of their juices and the cranberries have burst, about 7 minutes. Strain the apple mixture into a colander set over the bowl, shaking it to collect as much of the juice as possible. Pour the liquid back into the skillet, add the cinnamon and ginger, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Return the reduced juice and the apple mixture to the bowl and toss to recombine. Chill the filling until it cools completely, at least an hour and up to 2 days. To assemble the pie: On a lightly floured surface, roll each disk into an 11- to 12-inch circle. Lay each dough circle between two pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Place a baking sheet on a rack positioned in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish with one of the dough discs and trim it to leave a 1/2-inch overhang on all sides. Stir the cornstarch into the filling and add it to the pan. Use a chef&#39;s knife, pizza cutter or fluted dough cutter to cut the second round into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lay strips of dough, evenly spaced, across the entire pie. Weave more strips of dough perpendicular through the previous strips to make a lattice or basket weave design across the entire pie. Trim the excess ends from the strips of dough. Pinch the bottom crust edge and lattice edge together, and flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes. If the edges begin to brown too fast, cover them with strips of aluminum foil. Let the pie cool 1 hour before serving. Once completely cooled, the pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64369,&quot;Gluten-Free Vanilla Cupcakes 3/4 cup brown rice flour 1/2 cup amaranth flour 1/4 cup tapioca flour 1 1/2 teaspoons gluten-free baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position a rack in the middle of the oven.

F. Butter the bottom and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper and butter the parchment. Flour the pans and tap out the excess. Mix the coconut milk, water, vanilla bean paste and coconut extract in a liquid measuring cup. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and 1 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in two batches, alternating with the coconut milk mixture. Increase the speed to medium high; beat until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Beat the egg whites in a clean bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until foamy. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/3 cup granulated sugar until stiff glossy peaks form, 5 minutes. Fold half the egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and smooth the tops, then tap the pans against the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake the cakes until the centers spring back when gently pressed, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 15 minutes in the pans. Loosen the edges with a knife and turn out the cakes onto the rack; remove the parchment and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Beat the cream cheese, butter and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; beat in half of the confectioners&#39; sugar until combined. Beat in the remaining confectioners&#39; sugar and the coconut extract. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Remove 1 cup frosting to a separate bowl; mix in the shredded coconut. Put one cake on an 8-inch cardboard round. Spread the shredded coconut frosting on top, then top with the second cake. Spread a thin layer of the regular frosting over the top and sides of the cake (some crumbs are fine). Refrigerate 30 minutes, then cover with the remaining frosting, making it as smooth as possible. Refrigerate overnight or freeze for 2 hours.<br> Make the mirror glaze: Sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup water in a small bowl; stir and set aside 5 minutes. Combine 3/4 cup water, the granulated sugar and condensed milk in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve. Remove from the heat, add the gelatin mixture and stir to dissolve.<br> Pour the hot gelatin mixture over the white chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl; let stand 5 minutes, then whisk until melted. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Divide between two small bowls; tint one white and one blue. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until thickened and a thermometer registers 90? F. Pour half of the white glaze into a medium bowl, then pour one-third of the blue glaze into the center. Pour half of the remaining white glaze into the center of the blue to create a bull\u2019s-eye. Set aside the remaining glazes for touch-ups.<br> Position the cake (on the cardboard) on a small upside-down bowl set on a rimmed baking sheet. Starting along the outer edge, slowly pour the glaze in circles around the cake, working your way toward the center, until the cake is covered, letting the excess drip down the sides. Touch up any bare spots with the remaining glazes; sprinkle with edible glitter. Let stand until the dripping stops, about 30 minutes.

Break up the starter well with a wooden spoon and stir until it loosens and the mixture is slightly frothy. Add the rye flour and stir until well combined. Add the whole wheat flour, salt, caraway seeds, and just enough of the bran flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir. Turn out onto a well-floured surface and knead, adding remaining flour when needed, until dough is soft and smooth, 15 to 17 minutes, or make in a heavy-duty mixer. All finished rye doughs will remain slightly sticky. Be cautious about adding too much flour when kneading. The dough is ready when a little pulled from the mass springs back quickly. Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly floured surface while you scrape, clean, and lightly oil the large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn once to coat with oil. Take the dough&#39;s temperature (ideal temperature is 78 degrees). Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and place in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees) draft free place until doubled in volume. Deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling up on the sides. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly. Cut into 2 equal pieces. Flatten each with the heel of your hand. Shape each piece into a 12-inch log for long loaves. Using 2 well-floured towels and wood blocks, make a couche* in a moderately warm draft-free place. Place the loaves seam side up the couche. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and let proof until almost doubled in volume, or until a slight indentation remains when the dough is pressed with the fingertip. Preheat the oven and baking stone on the center rack of the oven to 450 degrees, 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking. The oven rack must be in the center of the oven. If it is in the lower 1/3 of the oven the bottom of the breads may burn, and if it is in the upper 1/3, the top crusts may burn. Gently slip the loaves from the couche onto a well-floured peel so that they are right side up. Using a very sharp, serrated knife or a single-edged razor blade, score the loaves by making quick shallow cuts 1/4 to 1/2-inch deep along the surface. Using the peel, slide the loaves onto the hearth. Quickly spray the inner walls and floor of the oven with cold water from a spritzer bottle. If there&#39;s an electric light bulb in the oven, avoid spraying it directly?it may burst. Spray for several seconds until steam has filled the oven. Quickly close the door to trap the steam and bake 3 minutes. Spray again in the same way, closing the door immediately so that steam doesn&#39;t escape. Bake until loaves begin to color, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake until loaves are a rich caramel color and the crusts are firm, another 15 to 20 minutes. To test the loaves for doneness, remove and hold the loaves upside down. Strike the bottoms firmly with your finger. If the sound is hollow, the breads are done. If it doesn&#39;t sound hollow, bake 5 minutes longer. Cool completely on wire racks. Note: If the dough temperature is higher than 78 degrees, put it in a cooler than (78 degree) place like the refrigerator, until the dough cools to 78 degrees. If it is lower than 78 degrees, put in it a warmer than 78 degree place until the dough warms to 78 degrees. The point is to try to keep the dough at 78 degrees during its fermentation. If you do have to move the dough, be gentle and don&#39;t jostle it, or the dough may deflate. *Couche?French for \couch\ or \resting place. This is a simple holding device you make yourself for proofing long loaves like logs, torpedo shapes, and baguettes. Using well-floured canvas or linen towels create folds to separate loaves while hold them securely next to each other during proofing. Use a length of fabric at least a yard long. Place 12 to 16-inch wooden blocks cut from 2 by 4&#39;s at either long end to contain the loaves. Or substitute large books to contain the loaves. Place the chef in a tall 2 to 3-quart flat bottomed, round, clear plastic container with a tight fitting lid. Add the rye flour and spring water, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture becomes thick and pasty. Mark the level of the mixture on the side of the container with a black marking pen. Scrape down, cover tightly, and let stand in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degree) draft-free place until almost doubled in volume, 8 to 10 hours. The mixture will look light and spongy. You can observe the level of sourdough by using the black mark on the side of the container as an indicator. Do not let the sourdough ferment for longer than 10 hours, or the yeast may exhaust itself and the dough may not rise properly. The ripe chef has now produced 18 ounces of ripe sourdough, which you can use in any rye sourdough recipe. The Rye Chef: Day 1 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water 2/3 cup (3 ounces) organic stone-ground rye flour, preferably medium ground In a tall 2 to 3-quart clear plastic container with a tight-fitting lid, stir together the water and flour. Scrape down the sides of the container with a rubber spatula. Cover tightly and put in moderate (74 to 80 degree) place for 24 hours. Day 2 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water 2/3 cup (3 ounces) organic stone-ground rye flour, preferably medium ground Open the container. The young chef will probably show few signs of activity; the mixture will look like cardboard pulp. Don&#39;t worry! It&#39;s still a young chef. It will, however, have a sweet and musty smell and the beginnings of a tangy taste. Continue building the chef by adding the water and rye flour. Stir vigorously to bring fresh oxygen into the chef and distribute the fresh flour and water. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly and put in a moderate (74 to 80 degrees) place for another 24 hours. Day 3 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water 2/3 cup (3 ounces) organic stone-ground rye flour, preferably medium ground The chef should have expanded noticeably. There should be bubbles on the surface. Taste it; it will have a pronounced sour taste and smell. Hold the container up and observe the large and small holes formed beneath the surface. Stir it with a wooden spoon; you should hear the faint crackle of gas bubbles popping. The chef is very much alive and maturing. Insert the spoon again and lift it up slowly. Short glutinous strands will stick to the spoon. Once again, nourish the chef by vigorously stirring in another addition of the spring water and rye flour. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly again, and return to its moderate-temperature place. Let stand for another 24 hours. Day 4 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water 2/3 cup (3 ounces) organic stone-ground rye flour, preferably medium ground The chef is almost mature and ripe. It has expanded a great deal; maybe almost doubled in volume from Day 3, and it is very lively with bubbles and a well-developed cellular structure. You will see a honeycomb of large and small holes through the clear plastic container. Taste and smell the chef; it is pungent and unmistakably tangy, sour but not bitter. Nourish again with the last addition of spring water and rye flour, stirring vigorously. Using a black marker pen, mark the level of the chef on the side of the clear plastic container. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly, and let stand again in the same place for only 8 hours. If your chef was ripe, the mixture should almost double in volume. You can check its growth by comparing the height of the risen chef against the mark you made on the side of the container before the last rising. The chef is now ready to use to create your sourdough starter. If you are not going to make the starter immediately, refrigerate the chef in its tightly covered container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]</p><p>These wines pair well with the flavors and textures of the roasted vegetables in the recipe.

Chill the martini glasses in the freezer, if there is room, or refrigerate 1 hour ahead of serving. (A freezer gives a heavy frost.) Place 1 slice of green tomato in each glass. Halve or quarter the bocconcini if they are larger than 1 inch in diameter. Thread a bocconccini, and a cherry tomato onto each of 4 wooden skewers 4 to 5 inches long. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with basil oil, if desired. Working quickly, divide the tomato liquid among the chilled martini glasses. Balance the skewers on top of the glasses, then take a leaf of basil per glass, and rub it around the glass rim, before placing on top of each glass, near skewer. Serve immediately. *Cook&#39;s Note: It is impossible to give a specific amount for the tomatoes because how much \water\ a tomato releases depends on many factors, including the growing season and the variety. Do not let the tomato pulp go to waste. Use this recipe as an excuse to start your quick tomato sauce season. You can freeze or can your sauce and then have it on hand for quick meals. Bring 2 large pots of water to a boil. Lower the tomatoes into the water, blanch for 45 seconds to 1 minute. Place blanched tomatoes on a baking sheet, and peel the loosened skins. With a colander over a bowl, squeeze the seeds and innards out of each tomato. Set aside and refrigerate the clear strained liquid for other uses. Slice the peeled tomatoes into 1-inch chunks, and place chunks into blender. Puree thoroughly. Pour into bowl.

In a large bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, parsley, eggs, milk, cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Add the turkey and gently stir to combine, being careful not to overwork the meat. On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, lay out the pancetta, overlapping the slices, into a large rectangle shape. In the middle of the rectangle, place the turkey mixture, shaping into a loaf. Using the parchment paper, wrap the pancetta up and around the turkey loaf to cover completely. Squeeze the parchment-covered loaf with your hands to secure the pancetta and solidify the shape of the loaf. While still covered in parchment, bake the loaf until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. In a blender, combine the arugula and the mayonnaise and process until smooth. Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. To make the sandwiches, slice the rolls and spread with the arugula mayonnaise. Slice the turkey meatloaf and place on the rolls to make sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]</p><p>&quot; 64409,&quot;Susan&#39;s Coulibiac of Salmon 5 1/2 cups flour 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 pound plus 2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces 2 eggs 1/2 cup sour cream 2 salmon fillets, skin on 2 cups court bouillon Salt Freshly ground white pepper 2 teaspoons paprika 3 large red bell peppers, roasted, skinned, seeded and julienned 1 1/2 pounds assorted exotic mushrooms, finely chopped 4 shallots, minced 6 tablespoons butter 1 large onion, minced 3/4 cup long grain white rice 1/2 cup sour cream 2 eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons water For the garnish: 1 bunch fresh watercress, cleaned and patted dry 2 cups Hollandaise Sauce Instructions: In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour, cornstarch and salt. Cut in the butter and mix until it resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and sour cream together. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture, stirring about 1 minute, until incorporated. This dough will be crumbly. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and sprinkle it liberally with iced water. Work the dough with a pastry scraper until the dough is moist. Dust with flour and knead a few times until smooth. Cut off 1/4 of the dough and shape into a smooth cake. Divide the remaining dough in half and shape into rectangles. Wrap all three pieces with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the salmon in a saute pan, over medium-high heat and cover with the court bouillon, add water if necessary. Bring to a boil and skim away the fat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the salmon from the liquid, reserving and set aside to cool. Remove the skin and flake the salmon. Season the salmon with salt, pepper and the paprika. Cover the salmon and refrigerate. In another saute pan, over medium-high heat, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the mushrooms and shallots. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes or until the mushrooms wilt and most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and set aside. Wipe out the saute pan, and place back over the heat and melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the onions. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 2 to3 minutes or until wilted. Add the rice and continue to saute for 1 minute. Stir in the reserved court bouillon. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook for about 15 minutes or until tender. Remove from the heat and cool completely. Stir in the sour cream. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble, on a floured surface, roll out one piece of the dough into a rectangle, (15 by 9 by 1/8-inch thick) Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Place the rolled dough on the baking sheet. Using the tip of the knife, mark an area 12 by 7 to center your filling. Spread in layers: rice, mushrooms, 1/2 of the salmon, peppers, and remaining salmon. Roll out the other dough and place on top pressing down to form a rectangular loaf. Seal the ends of the dough completely and egg wash the entire dough. Roll out the remaining dough and cut into strips and leaves. Use these to cover seams and decorate the loaf. Brush again with the egg wash. Using a sharp knife, make a couple of cuts at the top of the loaf. Place in the refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and bake for 1 hour, brushing halfway through the baking process with the egg wash. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with watercress and Hollandaise Sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64410,&quot;Chicago Italian Beef (Pot Roast Style) 1 boneless beef chuck eye roast (about 3 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper 6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 1/2 cup dry red wine 3 cups beef stock 2 sprigs fresh thyme 4 green bell peppers, seeded and cut into strips 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon granulated garlic Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 soft, hinged sub or hoagie rolls Homemade Hot Giardiniera, recipe follows 1/4 cup table salt 1 cup small-diced carrots 1 cup tiny cauliflower florets 4 to 8 serrano peppers, sliced 1/4 inch (depending on heat level desired) 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 stalk celery, diced small 1 red bell pepper, diced small 2 cups canola oil 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the pot roast: Position a rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Liberally sprinkle the entire roast with salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides until golden and caramelized; reduce the heat if the fat begins to smoke. Transfer the roast to a plate and reduce the heat to medium. Add in the onions and saute, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper and saute until fragrant, another minute. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Deglaze with the red wine and cook until reduced by half. Add in the stock and thyme and bring to a simmer. Adjust the seasoning of the jus. Place the roast back into the pot with any accumulated juices and place in the oven. Cook the roast, turning every 30 minutes, until very tender, 3 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Increase the oven heat to 350 degrees F. Transfer the roast to a cutting board and tent with foil. Strain the jus through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl and return back to the pot. Bring to a simmer and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Once cooled a bit, pull the meat into smaller chunks, return to the reduced jus and reserve until ready to build the sandwiches. For the sweet peppers: Toss the pepper strips with the olive oil, granulated garlic and some salt and pepper on a baking sheet. Bake, stirring halfway through, until lighter in color and soft, about 20 minutes. For the sandwich build: Place some beef on a roll, then some sweet peppers and then some Homemade Hot Giardiniera. Pour a small dish of reduced jus. Take the whole sandwich and quickly dunk in hot jus. Using two hands, go the hell to town.

In a small container, cover the bread with the remaining milk and soak for a minimum of 30 minutes. Drain, dry, salt and pepper the livers. Preheat a saute pan to the point where oil smokes slightly on contact. Add the canola oil and livers to the pan and brown both sides lightly. Remove to drain and cool. Let the pan cool slightly, and then add the shallots and garlic. Gently sweat until translucent. Add the brandy, cook off the alcohol set aside. Squeeze the bread to remove excess milk. Place the bread in a food processor. Add the livers, shallots and garlic, any liquid and scrapings from the pan and the eggs. Pulse until the contents are still chunky, but relatively consistent. In large mixing bowl, combine the venison, veal, dried cherries, pistachios, ginger powder, allspice, pink salt, kosher salt and pepper, as well as the contents of the food processor. Mix well with hands. Place a small amount of the mixture in plastic wrap, twisting to form a water-tight ball. Drop in simmering water until cooked through. Cool in ice water, and taste for seasoning. Adjust seasoning as necessary. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a pate mold (or small bread pan) with plastic wrap.

Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant and cooked through. Add the sugar, red wine vinegar, rice wine vinegar, red pepper powder, Creole seasoning, black pepper, salt and 1 cup water and cook until the flavors to meld and develop, about 10 minutes. Add the collard greens in batches if necessary, waiting a few minutes for the collard greens to begin to break down in the pot likker (the liquid in the pot) before adding the rest. Allow to cook over low to medium heat until you achieve the desired texture and the greens have an agreeable amount of salt, spice and acid, 2 to 3 hours. Let the collards cool in their pot likker and reserve until ready to prepare your sandwich. (This can be done a day or more ahead of time.) For the coleslaw: Add the cabbage, mayonnaise, onion, vinegar, pepper and some salt to a large mixing bowl. Wearing gloves, mix with your hands, massaging the cabbage to break it down in the mayonnaise. (It should yield less than a quarter of the original volume when it&#39;s all said and done.) Taste to make sure you have enough salt and vinegar. Reserve in the refrigerator, as it tastes best on the sandwich as a cold component. (This can be done up to a day ahead of time.) For the pickled cherry pepper Russian dressing: Mix up the mayonnaise, cherry peppers, ketchup, red pepper powder, hot sauce, paprika, black pepper and some salt in a bowl. For the sandwich: Brush some butter on both sides of each slice of rye bread and toast on both sides on a nonstick griddle or in a large nonstick saute pan. On two slices of bread, place a slice of Swiss cheese and allow to melt fully (covering the pan or putting a dome over the bread on the flattop will facilitate the melting process). Meanwhile, heat some greens in a saute pan. Place a handful of coleslaw on a cheesy slice of rye bread. Place the other cheesy slice of rye on top of that. Spoon your collard greens on top of that slice, being careful not to bring too much of the pot likker with them as this will make for a soggy end product. Dress the third slice of rye with a liberal slather of the Russian dressing and place it face-down on top of the collards.

Remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon and rinse under cold water to remove excess oil and starch for a crisper fry later. Reserve the pot of oil. Cover a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and lay the fries on top. Chill completely in the refrigerator. The potatoes can be prepared this way up to 1 day in advance of cooking them. Heat the oil to 360 degrees F. Add the fries, in batches if necessary, to the oil and cook, stirring gently, until the fries are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove them from the oil to a large paper-towel-lined bowl and season them with the rosemary and salt, shaking the bowl to distribute the seasonings evenly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Vermentino]&quot; 64423,&quot;Moroccan Chicken and Couscous 2 carrots, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 large onion, chopped 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 cup couscous 1 15-ounce can no-salt-added chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1/4 cup chopped dried apricots or prunes Grated zest of 1/2 lemon, plus juice of 1 lemon 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Combine the carrots and 1 cup water in a saucepan over medium-high heat.

Heat oil in a medium saucepan and saute the seasoned steaks until they are cooked to medium-well done, with a small strip of pink on the inside. Remove the strip steaks and set aside. Wipe away the excess oil from the pan. Over medium heat, sweat the minced shallots in the same saute pan until they become translucent. Add the red wine and reduce by 1/2. Add stock to the pan and reduce the mixture again by 1/2. Slowly add the green peppercorns and season lightly with salt and pepper. Continuously stir the sauce while adding in the heavy cream. Finish by adding butter to the sauce and reduce the temperature to low. Do not strain. Serve with Sauteed Asparagus and Red-skinned Mashed Potatoes. In a large pot, bring just enough water to cover the asparagus stalks, to a boil. Add the asparagus to the pot and cook for approximately 1 minute, just long enough to blanch the vegetables. Drain and set aside. In a saute pan, cook the sliced mushrooms in butter and season them with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the asparagus to the pan and saute until tender. In a large pot, bring just enough water to cover the potatoes to a rapid boil. Lightly add salt to the water. Add the potatoes, with the skin still intact, to the water and cook them until they are fork-tender. Drain the water from the pot, leaving only the potatoes. Add butter, milk, and salt and pepper to the boiled potatoes and mash all of the ingredients together. Add the smoked salmon and the scallions to the potatoes and stir them throughout the mixture. Finish the potatoes with chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 64425,&quot;Guy&#39;s Gumbo Shack - Red Beans and Rice 2 tablespoons butter 2 cups diced green pepper 2 cups chopped onion 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 tablespoon salt 2 tablespoons oregano 2 tablespoons black pepper 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons dried basil 1 tablespoon dried thyme 2 bay leaves 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1 to 2 pounds smoked sausage (we use Conecuh Sausage) Six 14-ounce cans dark red kidney beans Cooked white rice, for serving Instructions: In a large saucepan, melt butter.

Prepare the charcoal grill to medium-high heat on one side of your grill, and medium-low heat on the other. You will need just a few briquettes on the cooler side of the grill to maintain the low heat. (If using a gas grill, heat one side of the grill to medium-high heat and the other to low.) When the grill is hot and ready to go, brush the grill grates with some olive oil. Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper. Place the steaks on the hot side of the grill for 3 to 4 minutes, then flip and grill for another 4 minutes. Once the steaks have a nice caramelized crust, move them to the cooler part of the grill, and continue cooking for 6 to 7 minutes for medium rare, or 8 to 9 minutes for medium. Remove the steaks from grill, and tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Let the steaks rest for 5 minutes, so the juices can redistribute throughout the meat. Spread steaks with the roasted shallot and herb butter. GINA: Roasting the shallot gives it a deep, sweet flavor, and the lemon zest lightens the whole thing up. This butter would also be an excellent topping for fish or chicken. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the shallot on a square of foil, drizzle lightly with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Fold up the foil into a little packet, and place in the oven for 1 hour. Let cool completely. Pulse the roasted shallot and remaining ingredients in a food processor until combined but still coarse. Scrape the butter onto a piece of plastic wrap, spread it across lengthwise, and roll into a log. Twist the ends to seal. Place in the fridge to firm up for at least 35 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 64427,&quot;Melted Snowman Cookies About 8 ounces vanilla candy melting wafers 12 round peanut butter cookies (or sugar cookies) 4 marshmallows, cut crosswise into thirds<br> 24 mini chocolate chips<br> 12 orange sprinkles<br> 6 mini peanut butter cups, halved and trimmed to look like brimmed hats Assorted other sprinkles for decorating, if desired<br> Instructions: Melt the candy melting wafers according to the package directions. Spoon some of the melted candy on top of a cookie and spread it so it covers most of the cookie but has an irregular border. Place a slice of marshmallow toward the top edge and spoon some more melted candy on top, smoothing it to fully cover the marshmallow and blend it into the candy on the cookie. Decorate the face of the snowman with mini chocolate chips for eyes and an orange sprinkle as a carrot nose. Place a peanut butter cup half on top of the snowman&#39;s head like a hat. Use other sprinkles to add a mouth or buttons if desired. Repeat with the remaining candy, cookies and decorations (rewarming the candy melts if necessary).

Slice chicken thinly, cut the baguette into 1/2-inch rounds, and cut the sausage links up into chunks, alternating cuts at 45 degree angles for nice triangular shapes. Now prepare the kebabs. Take the skewers 1 at a time and begin threading the components alternately. Start with a piece of bread, then chicken, bay leaf, sausage, and bread; repeat this 3 times to fill the skewers, ending with bread. Lay the prepared kebabs out on your board and drizzle liberally with extra-virgin olive oil. Squeeze the lemon juice all over and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the prepared kebabs onto preheated grill and cook for about 7 to 10 minutes per side, or until cooked through. While kebabs are roasting you can prepare the salad. In a blender combine the anchovies, garlic, lemon juice, egg yolks and grated Parmesan. Pulse a couple of times to combine, then add the water and blend again. With the motor running, gradually pour the oil through the feed tube and continue to blend until emulsified. Season, to taste, with salt and some freshly ground black pepper. In a large mixing bowl add the chopped romaine. When the kebabs are done, remove from the oven and slide the kebab components off the skewers directly into the bowl.

This recipe is nice and simple and will help you achieve brilliant results for your Christmas meal. Take your turkey out of the refrigerator about an hour before you&#39;re ready to cook it so it comes up to room temperature before roasting. Give it a good rinse then pat it dry with some kitchen paper, making sure you soak up any water in the cavity. Drizzle the meat with a good lug of olive oil, add a few good sprinkles of salt and pepper and then rub this seasoning all over the bird, making sure you get in to all the nooks and crannies. Preheat your oven to full whack then get started on your stuffing. For the stuffing: Pour a lug or 2 of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and fry off your chopped onion, for about 10 minutes, or until softened. Stir in a good pinch of salt and pepper, the ground nutmeg and your chopped sage leaves, then continue to fry and stir for another 1 minute or 2. Spoon the onion mixture into a large bowl and let it cool completely. Once cooled, add your pork mince and breadcrumbs and use your hands to really scrunch everything together. Once it&#39;s mixed really well, bring the stuffing together into a ball, then cover and chill until you&#39;re ready to stuff your turkey. Pull the skin at the neck-end back so you can see a cavity and push about 1/2 of your stuffing inside your turkey. Not too much: you don&#39;t want to pack it so tightly it slows down the cooking. Once done, pull and fold the skin over the opening and tuck it under the bird so it looks nice. Turn the turkey around and drop a few small pieces of stuffing into the larger cavity along with your clementine halves and a few sprigs rosemary. Place your roughly chopped onion, celery, and carrots in the bottom of a roasting pan and lay your turkey on top. Cover the turkey with tin foil then put it in the hot oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 350 degrees F/ 180 degrees C/ Gas 4. Cook for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilo/ 2 pounds 2 ounces. The 11 pound/ 5 kg bird in this recipe will take about 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Check on your turkey every 20 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan. After 2 1/2 hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy. When the time is up, take your turkey out of the oven and stick a small sharp knife into the fattest part of the thigh. If the juices run clear and the meat pulls apart easily, it&#39;s ready. If not, pop the turkey back in the oven to cook for a bit longer, then check again. Once ready, cover the turkey with tin foil and a few clean tea towels for 30 minutes and let it rest while you get your vegetables and gravy ready.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64436,&quot;Kahlua Tiramisu 12 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons Kahlua 18 soft lady fingers (available in the packaged-baked-goods section) 1 (8-ounce) container mascarpone cheese, softened 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 3 (4-ounce) containers refrigerated prepared vanilla pudding 6 teaspoons frozen non-dairy whipped topping, thawed Cocoa powder Instructions: Line 6 (1-cup) glass custard cups with plastic wrap.

Line mini cupcake pans with 48 mini cupcake liners. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition. Add the vanilla and almond extracts. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Alternate folding the milk and flour mixture into the butter mixture. Fill the cupcake liners halfway and bake for 12 minutes. Cool. To assemble: Dip the top of each cupcake into the Raspberry Glaze, making sure to cover the entire top of the cake to the rim of the paper. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip, pipe a generous dollop of the pale lavender Swiss Meringue in the center of the cake, keeping a rim of the Raspberry Glaze visible. Top the Swiss Meringue with the stacked Peach and Green Almond Cake. Using a small pastry brush, glaze each raspberry with raspberry jam and sit on top of the cake. Lightly dust the top of each cupcake with zested bittersweet dark chocolate. Place the jam in a small saucepan. Dissolve the jam to liquid over low heat, 1 to 2 minutes. Combine the egg whites, sugar, and salt in a heatproof bowl of a standing mixer set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar has dissolved. (The mixture should feel completely smooth when rubbed between your fingertips.) Attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Starting on low and gradually increasing to medium-high speed, whisk until stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Continue mixing until the mixture is fluffy and glossy and completely cool. Add a few drops of purple vegetable dye and mix well until a light lavender color. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 half-sheet trays with silicone mats. Sift together the flour and salt in a small bowl and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the almond paste and sugar together until small crumbs form. Add the butter and beat on high speed until the mixture is combined. Scrape down the bowls and add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating until each is incorporated. Add the flour mixture in 3 parts, beating on low speed after each addition. Divide the batters between 2 small mixing bowls. In the first bowl, add a few drops of the peach vegetable dye to the batter and mix well until a pale peach color. In the second bowl, add a few drops of the green vegetable dye and mix well until a pale green color. Spread each batter on prepared sheet trays. Bake for 10 minutes. When cooled, cut the peach cake using a 1-inch round fluted pastry cutter, and cut the green cake using a 1/2-inch round fluted pastry cutter. Stack the green cakes on top of the peach cakes and set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 64438,&quot;Gingerbread Affogato 1 cup water 1 1/2 cups sugar 1-inch piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced 2 cinnamon sticks 3 whole cloves 1/2 cup boiling water 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder 1 to 2 tablespoons hazelnut liqueur (recommended: Frangelico), optional 1 pint vanilla gelato or ice cream Instructions: For the syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the water, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves over medium heat.

Arrange the shrimp so they lay flat and are evenly spaced. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper. Add the butter to the skillet. When the foaming subsides, raise the heat to high and invert the plate of shrimp over the skillet so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook the shrimp, without moving them, for 1 minute. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Turn the shrimp over and cook for 2 minutes more. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl. Return the skillet to the heat and pour in the vermouth and lemon juice. Boil the liquid until slightly thickened, about 30 seconds. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir the lemon zest and parsley into the sauce. Pour the sauce over the shrimp, season with salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine.

Yield: 1 pound pecans &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64517,&quot;Beef Crostini with Red Pepper Mayonnaise 36 slices (1/2-inch thick) baguette bread 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2/3 cup roasted red peppers, preserved in water, drained well and patted dry 1/3 cup mayonnaise Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (1 1/2-pound) piece beef tenderloin, trimmed 3 tablespoons drained capers, chopped Coarse sea salt, to serve Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange the bread slices on 2 heavy large baking sheets. Drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over the bread slices. Bake until the crostini are pale golden and crisp, about 15 minutes. Blend the bell peppers and mayonnaise in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Season the bell pepper mayonnaise, to taste, with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate. Tie the beef with kitchen string to help maintain its shape. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add the beef to the skillet and cook until brown and cooked to desired doneness, about 8 minutes for rare. Freeze the beef until it is just frozen (this will make it easier to slice), about 3 hours. Using a large sharp carving knife, cut the beef into thin slices. Spread the bell pepper mayonnaise over the crostini and top with the sliced beef. Arrange the crostini on a platter. Scatter over the capers, sprinkle with the coarse sea salt, and serve. Do-Ahead Tip: The bell pepper mayonnaise and sliced beef can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate. Alternative: If desired, the beef tenderloin can be substituted with 1 pound freshly sliced roast beef. Since the roast beef is already cooked and can be used as is, it makes a great time-saving alternative. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 64518,&quot;Puttanesca with Tuna Polpette and Penne 1 pound penne (recommended: Barilla or de Cecco fine) Salt 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for tuna 5 to 6 anchovies, in jars with red pepper, if plain anchovies add 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 4 large cloves garlic, grated or finely chopped 1 (28-ounce) can tomatoes (recommended: San Marzano) 1 cup chicken or seafood stock Freshly ground black pepper A few tablespoons capers, drained A handful pitted black olives, oil cured or kalamata, chopped 1 pound tuna steak 1 large egg 1/2 cup bread crumbs A handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 1/2 cup basil leaves, shredded Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and cook to al dente. Drain and keep warm. Heat extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add anchovies and stir into oil until melted. Add the garlic, turn heat to low and saute for a couple of minutes. Stir in the tomatoes crushing them up, then stir in stock. Season with a little black pepper, add capers and olives and simmer a few minutes. While sauce simmers, cut tuna into chunks and grind in food processor into coarse mixture. Pulse in the egg, bread crumbs and parsley and season with a little salt and black pepper. Remove tuna mixture from the processor to a bowl and add a drizzle of olive oil. Stir to combine. (Adding the oil will prevent mixture from sticking to your hands as you roll the balls.) Roll the tuna into small balls and drop into the sauce. Cover the pot and simmer the tuna balls in the sauce, about 4 to 5 minutes. Place the pasta into a serving bowl. Add the tuna and sauce, toss to coat and garnish with shredded basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 64519,&quot;Melon Agua Fresca 3 cups fresh melon (watermelon or cantaloupe), seeds removed and roughly chopped 1 1/2 cups water 6 tablespoons granulated sugar Instructions: Place all ingredients in a blender and process until smooth.

Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until combined. Add the flour and mix on low until the dough comes together in a ball, about 2 minutes. Divide the dough into two even pieces, form into discs and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. For the filling: In a large bowl, whisk together the tapioca flour, sugar, cardamom and salt. Add the nectarines, lemon juice, brandy and vanilla paste. Toss gently to combine. To assemble: Position a rack in the center of the oven; preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove one disk of dough from the refrigerator and leave to soften until pliable, 10 to 15 minutes; reserve the other disk for another use. Roll the softened dough between two sheets of lightly floured parchment paper into a 14-inch round. While still between the parchment, transfer the dough to a large, rimmed baking sheet. Gently peel away the top sheet of parchment. Spoon the filling into the center of the pastry and spread it toward the edges, leaving a 2- to 2 1/2-inch margin all the way around. Gently lift the edges of the parchment to help fold the dough up and over the edges of the filling--allow the dough to fold over itself, creating a blanket effect, with crimps and ruffles. Peel away the parchment to leave a border of pastry around the exposed center of the filling. Whisk together the egg and milk, and brush the mixture over the crust. Sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Bake the galette, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until the crust is golden brown, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool. For the coconut whipped cream: Open the can of coconut cream and spoon out the thick, hardened cream into a medium bowl; reserve the watery liquid for another purpose. Add the powdered sugar and almond extract to the coconut cream and beat, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, until fluffy like whipped cream, 2 to 3 minutes. To serve, spoon a dollop of the whipped cream onto a slice of the galette and garnish with a pinch or two of the toasted sliced almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64522,&quot;Smashed Potatoes: Food Network 1 pound small red bliss potatoes 6 tablespoons garlic-infused olive oil, divided Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 cup sliced scallions Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Adjust the oven racks to the top and bottom positions. Place the potatoes on a sheet pan, pour 3/4 cup water over the potatoes and cover tightly with foil. Bake on the bottom rack until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, drain any remaining water and let rest 8 minutes. Drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over the potatoes, making sure they are evenly coasted. Space the potatoes evenly on the sheet pan and, using a potato masher, flatten the potatoes to about 1/2 inch thick (about 1/2 the length of your thumb to the first joint). Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil over the potatoes and roast on the top rack for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the cheese. Roast on the bottom rack until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the sour cream and scallions. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64523,&quot;Lobster Brie Phyllo Packets 8 sheets phyllo dough (based on 18 by 14-inch sheets which are often sold in packs of 18 to 20) 1/2 cup melted butter 2 lobster tails, poached and finely chopped 1 small wheel (about 8-ounces) brie cheese, cut into small pieces 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. If phyllo was frozen, make sure it is completely defrosted before handling it. Once removed from package, you will need to cover phyllo with waxed paper and a damp towel to prevent it from drying out. Lay out each dough sheet and brush on butter. Fold in half, brush again, fold in half, cut in half. (Each dough sheet should yield 2 rectangles, roughly 4 by 4 inches, so you will have 16 squares.) In mixing bowl, combine lobster, cheese, parsley and chives and season with salt and pepper. Place mixture on each square of dough. Bring up corners into smaller square packet and brush more butter on top.

In a pint jar or other container with a tight-fitting lid, stir together the sugar and 3 tablespoons water until the sugar dissolves a bit. Add the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard powder, paprika and 1/2 teaspoon salt, put on the lid and shake vigorously until completely combined. Stir the dressing into the coleslaw, then set aside for 10 minutes to marinate and soften, stirring a few times. Add more salt, if needed. The coleslaw will keep, covered in the refrigerator, for up to 1 day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64551,&quot;Grilled Corn Salsa 10 large ears corn, husked 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing Salt and freshly ground pepper 8 vine-ripened tomatoes, about 1 pound total 1 cup diced red onion, 1/4-inch dice 4 tablespoons red wine vinegar, or more to taste 1/2 cup julienne fresh basil leaves Instructions: Brush the corn liberally with olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Grill, turning every few minutes, until light gold all over and cooked, about 12 minutes. Let cool and cut off the kernels. Discard the cobs. Core the tomatoes and cut a small X on the bottom of each. Brush with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and place on the grill, X side down, away from direct heat. Cover the grill and cook until the tomatoes begin to soften but are not cooked all the way through (or they will melt through the grate!), about 15 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then peel. Cut the tomatoes in half crosswise and squeeze out the juice and the seeds through a sieve into a bowl. Reserve the juices and chop the flesh. Put the onions in the non-reactive medium bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of the vinegar. Let marinate until the color changes, about 10 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes, reserved tomato juice, onions, basil, and 1/3 cup olive oil to the corn. Toss well. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt, pepper, and remaining vinegar. The salsa is best eaten the same day but will keep, covered and refrigerated, a day or so. Serve with tortilla chips or as a topping for tacos. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 64552,&quot;Not Your Usual Lemon Meringue Pie 4 large eggs 1 cup sugar 2/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 lemon, zested and grated 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces Meringue, recipe follows Phyllo triangles, recipe follows 8 mint sprigs Confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup pureed fresh or frozen raspberries (optional) 1 cup egg whites (from about 8 eggs), at room temperature 3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed 6 sheets thawed phyllo dough 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted 3/4 cup sugar Instructions: Bring about 1-inch of water to a simmer in a large saucepan. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk the eggs and sugar together until very light yellow and fluffy. Whisk in the lemon juice and lemon zest. Rest the mixing bowl in the saucepan with the bowl&#39;s base above the simmering water (pour out some of the water if necessary.) Cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is thick and custard like, about 15 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the butter. Let cool, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Squeeze a dab of meringue on each of 8 plates and press one phyllo triangle down on it. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of lemon curd in the center, then pipe on some meringue. If possible, brown the meringue with a blowtorch. Place another phyllo triangle on top and repeat, topping off with a final phyllo triangle. Garnish with a mint sprig, a dusting of powdered sugar, and raspberry puree, if desired. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer) and a clean dry bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the brown sugar and continue whipping until stiff and glossy, about 30 seconds more. Gently spoon meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on the pan and brush with melted butter. Sprinkle evenly with 2 tablespoons of the sugar and then place another sheet of phyllo on top. Brush with melted butter, sprinkle with sugar, lay another sheet of phyllo on top, and brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with sugar. Repeat on another sheet pan with remaining 3 sheets of phyllo, butter, and sugar. You should have 2 stacks of phyllo dough, each 3 sheets thick. With the tip of a sharp knife, cut each stack into 12 triangles. Cover both stacks with parchment paper. Place one of the pans on top of the other to weight it down. Then place another empty sheet pan on the very top (this is to keep the phyllo from buckling during baking). Bake 10 to 12 minutes, until the phyllo is golden brown. Remove the whole stack of sheet pans and let cool (do not unstack the pans). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 64553,&quot;Caesar Salad 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1 cup bread, cut in 1/2-inch cubes 3 hearts romaine lettuce 1/2 cup Caesar Dressing, recipe follows 1/2 cup shaved Parmesan 3 anchovy fillets, finely chopped 1 tablespoon finely chopped capers 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 egg yolk 1 teaspoon minced garlic 3/4 cup vegetable oil 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/4 cup heavy cream Kosher salt Instructions: In a large skillet heat the olive oil over medium heat.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes. Cook the chateaubriand: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Let the beef rest at room temperature for 15 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large, oven-safe skillet over high heat until it shimmers, about 2 minutes. Set the meat in the pan and sear it on all sides until browned, about 8 minutes total. Reduce the heat to low and add 2 tablespoons of the butter, the mushrooms, garlic and the thyme. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook the roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 125 to 130 degrees F., 6 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. Remove the skillet from the oven, transfer the roast to a cutting board, loosely tent with foil and let it rest for 10 minutes. Make the red wine reduction: Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the pan (discard the garlic and thyme). Set the skillet over medium-high heat, add the shallot and red wine, and cook, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until the pan is almost dry, about 2 minutes. Add the broth and cream, bring to a boil, and simmer until the sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Return the mushrooms to the pan, adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed. Make the pomme puree: Place a colander over a large bowl. Pour the hot potatoes into the colander. Shake the potatoes to drain off the excess liquid. Press the potatoes through a ricer (or mash them with a fork for a chunkier texture) and into a medium bowl, occasionally clearing the sides of the ricer with a spoon. Pour the reserved and still-hot cream over the potatoes in small increments, folding in to combine, until you get your desired consistency. Season with olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt and serve immediately, or keep warm in a covered oven-safe casserole dish in a 250 degree F. oven. To serve, remove the twine from the roast and slice the roast crosswise into 2 equal portions. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spoon the potato puree onto 2 warm plates. Place a slice of chateaubriand on each plate and spoon the red wine-mushroom reduction over the top. Garnish with fresh thyme leaves and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Barolo]&quot; 64563,&quot;Steamed Clams with Chorizo, Citrus and Saffron Aioli 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 garlic cloves, peeled 1 large chorizo 2 pounds clams, cleaned 1/2 cup Albareino Spanish white wine 1/2 orange Saffron Aioli, recipe follows 1/4 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves chopped 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads 1/4 cup hot water 2 garlic cloves *2 egg yolks (See Disclaimer) 1 cup blanched slivered almonds Kosher salt 1/2 orange, juiced 3 cups extra-virgin olive oil Water as needed, to thin Instructions: Heat olive oil.

Using the back of a spoon, make a well in the middle deep enough to hold an egg yolk. One by one, separate 8 eggs and put a yolk in each well. (Reserve the whites for another use.) Crack the remaining egg into a small bowl and beat lightly with a fork. Brush the edges of the pasta pieces with the egg, and then top with the remaining squares of pasta. Working from the edge of the filling outward, firmly press the dough together, making sure there are no air bubbles. Trim the edges of each ravioli with a sharp knife or a fluted pasta cutter. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a small skillet with the sage leaves over medium heat and cook, swirling often, until the butter is golden brown and the sage is fried and crisp, about 3 minutes. Set aside. Gently drop the ravioli into the water and cook until the pasta is tender and the egg is still runny, about 6 minutes. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon or handheld strainer and place each ravioli in an individual bowl. Top each with a sage leaf and evenly spoon the butter over.

Set aside. Place a layer of cake, jam side up, in the bottom of a 2 1/2-to 3-quart glass serving bowl, cutting the pieces to fit. Sprinkle with Framboise. Top with a layer of raspberries and strawberries and Cognac Cream. Repeat the layers of cake sprinkled with Framboise, raspberries, strawberries and Cognac Cream, ending with a third layer of cake jam side down and raspberries and strawberries. Whip the heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When it starts to thicken, add the sugar and vanilla and continue to whip until it forms stiff peaks. Decorate the trifle with whipped cream. The trifle can sit for a while at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour 2 (8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 1/2-inch) loaf pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper. Cream the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. With the mixer on medium speed, beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl, combine the buttermilk and vanilla. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean. When the cakes are done, let them cool for 10 minutes. Take them out of the pans, place them on a baking rack and allow them to cool completely. Wrap well, and store in the refrigerator. Heat the milk in a medium stainless-steel saucepan over medium heat and bring almost to a boil. Remove from the heat. Beat the egg yolks and sugar on medium-high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, sprinkle on the cornstarch. Beat on medium-low speed until combined, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture back into the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. (Pay attention because it will thicken and then quickly become scrambled eggs!) Immediately, pour the mixture through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Stir in the vanilla, Cognac, butter, and heavy cream. Place plastic wrap directly on the custard and refrigerate until cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64603,&quot;Instant Pot Pasta Marinara 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced<br> Pinch red pepper flakes<br> 28 ounces whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 pound penne pasta<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> Instructions: Turn an Instant Pot? multi-cooker to the high saute setting.

Unfold. If pastry does not unfold easily, thaw for an additional 5 to 10 minutes and retry. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out pastry to a 10 by 12-inch rectangle. Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet. With a dry pastry brush, brush away any excess flour. In a small bowl, lightly beat together egg and 1 tablespoon water to create an egg wash. With the pastry brush, brush entirety of dough sheet surface with egg wash. Along all 4 sides, fold over a 1/2-inch of the edge to create a ridged border around pastry. Brush top of this rim with egg wash as well. Prick pastry (inside the rim) all over with a fork (this ensures that the dough inside the border does not puff up like the outer rim will). Arrange thinly sliced pears on pastry, covering all of surface area, but in a single layer. Sprinkle pears with sugar, pear liqueur, and dot with cubes of butter. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. While tart is baking, combine peach preserves and peach nectar in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir to combine. Heat on high for 15 seconds at a time until preserves have melted, stirring each time. Once mixture has completely melted, push through a fine mesh strainer to remove any lumps or pieces of fruit.

Add the egg mixture and beat until the batter is combined, about 3 minutes.<br> Spoon 4 cups of the batter into a large resealable plastic bag. Add the cocoa powder to the bowl with the remaining batter and beat on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Spoon the chocolate batter into a second large resealable plastic bag. Snip the corners off the bags. Working in alternating colors, pipe strips of batter into the ridges of the pan (the pan has an odd number of ridges so you will have two of the same batters next to each other). Use a long wooden skewer to spread the strips of batter in the ridges, taking care not to let batter spill over into the neighboring color. Pipe the rest of the batter into the pan in large dollops, alternating flavors as you go. Gently smooth the top of the batter with an offset spatula.<br> Bake until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean and the top springs back when lightly pressed, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool the cake on a rack for 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto the rack to cool completely, about 2 hours.<br> For the glaze: Meanwhile, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk in a medium bowl to make a thick but pourable glaze, adding a little more milk or sugar to get the right consistency.

Lightly butter two 9-inch-round cake pans; line the bottoms with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, allspice and salt in a large bowl; set aside. Combine the pumpkin, sugar, orange zest and vanilla in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until each one is incorporated. With the mixer running, add the vegetable oil in a steady stream. Add the flour mixture and mix just until incorporated. Divide the batter between the 2 prepared pans; lightly tap the pans on the counter to distribute the batter. Transfer the pans to the oven and bake until the cakes begin pulling away from the pans and the centers spring back when lightly pressed, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then unmold onto the rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a large deep saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer and cook, without stirring, until deep amber, about 8 minutes. Carefully whisk in the cream and cook, whisking, until smooth. Add the corn syrup and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and cook, whisking occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove from the heat; whisk in the butter, chocolate, vanilla and salt until smooth. Let cool completely, then fold in the pecans. Cover and refrigerate until firm but spreadable, about 1 hour. Assemble the cake: Cut each cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife to make 4 layers. Put 1 layer on a platter; spread one-third of the pecan filling on top. Layer the remaining cakes and filling on top, ending with cake. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Make the glaze: Combine the chocolate, cocoa powder, butter and honey in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave 1 minute; uncover and whisk until smooth. Let cool to room temperature, then spread on the cake, letting the excess drip down the sides.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender yet firm (as they say in Italian \al dente.) Drain the pasta well, reserving 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water to use in the sauce if you wish. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium flame. Add the pancetta and saute for about 3 minutes, until the bacon is crisp and the fat is rendered. Toss the garlic into the fat and saute for less than 1 minute to soften. Add the hot, drained spaghetti to the pan and toss for 2 minutes to coat the strands in the bacon fat. Beat the eggs and Parmesan together in a mixing bowl, stirring well to prevent lumps. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the egg/cheese mixture into the pasta, whisking quickly until the eggs thicken, but do not scramble (this is done off the heat to ensure this does not happen.) Thin out the sauce with a bit of the reserved pasta water, until it reaches desired consistency. Season the carbonara with several turns of freshly ground black pepper and taste for salt. Mound the spaghetti carbonara into warm serving bowls and garnish with chopped parsley. Pass more cheese around the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 64612,&quot;Giant Brownie Snack Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter<br> 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 4 large eggs<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1/4 cup rainbow candy-coated chocolate chips, such as Wilton Rainbow Chip Crunch Sprinkles<br> Instructions: For the brownie cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Mix until smooth. Cover and chill for 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a thin tip. For the sauce: Combine the blueberries, granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat so the mixture just simmers, and cook until the berries break down and the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Add the lemon juice, transfer to a bowl and let cool while you make the doughnuts. For the doughnuts: Heat the oil in a Dutch oven until it registers 360 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Put a rack on a baking sheet. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Cut in the butter using your fingers or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the buttermilk and mix gently until a dough just begins to come together. Roll the dough into a square about 1/2-inch thick. Cut the dough into 1-inch pieces and roll into balls. Working in batches (so the doughnuts have plenty of space to float in), fry the dough balls until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider to transfer the doughnuts to the rack. Let cool slightly. Pipe some lemon cream into each doughnut and then roll in confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve immediately with blueberry sauce on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 64621,&quot;Chug a Lug Kiwi Berry Cooler 2 kiwis, peeled, 1 muddled, 1 cut into small pieces for garnish 1 cup fresh strawberry, 1/2 cup muddled, 1/2 cup cut into small pieces for garnish 1/2 cup blackberries 4 cups ice 1 1/2 cups white wine (recommended: Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc) 3 ounces orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Cointreau) 1-ounce fresh lemon juice 3 ounces simple syrup (plus more depending on sugar level of berries) Instructions: In a large mixing glass muddle 1 kiwi, 1/2 cup muddled strawberries and 1/2 cup blackberries.

Sift together the flour and baking soda and set aside. In a mixer fitted with a whip attachment, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Then add both sugars and continue mixing to cream them together. Add the eggs gradually and let them thoroughly mix in. Add the melted unsweetened chocolate and mix in well. Add the vanilla and 1/3 of the yogurt and mix, then add half the dry ingredients, and mix in well. Repeat alternating wet and dry, ending with wet. Pour batter into a muffin tins, lined with cupcake papers, filling them 3/4 full. Bake until firm to the touch on the cap of the cupcakes, about 20 minutes. Let cool in the pan, then decorate. To make the cupcakes into spiders, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting glue 2 flat chocolate buttons on the top of the cupcake as eyes. Pipe a large white dot on lower half of each button then stick on the chocolate chips, then pipe a tiny white dot on the tip of the chip. In red, pipe a smile and to make them tarantulas, pipe a red hourglass shape on its back. Cut black liquorice into 3-inch long pieces and tuck 8 of them into the rim of the cupcake cap to make legs. To serve the cupcakes, with black frosting pipe a spider web onto a middle of a large white plate and place the spiders around the edge. Notes about the recipe: I always buy the large tub of plain yogurt because it&#39;s so much cheaper than buying all those small ones, and the next thing I know, it&#39;s gone moldy for lack of attention. So this is a good place to use a large quantity of it up. You can use sour milk instead or sour your own by squeezing a good amount of lemon juice into whole milk and letting it stand 2 minutes to curdle and sour. Here&#39;s proof that there is something even cuter than a cupcake. Princess Diana&#39;s butler, Paul Burrell, taught me how to turn cupcakes into spiders. He made these on the Princes&#39; birthdays, as part of a complete bug theme party with a big ladybug cake and cheese pastries coiled up like snails, with antennae made of chives. I make them for my prince&#39;s birthdays; my son Gio loves them. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 64624,&quot;Prosecco-Pear Sparkler 2 ounces pear nectar 1 ounce vodka 1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice 3 ounces chilled prosecco<br> Pear slice and lemon zest, for garnish Instructions: Combine the pear nectar, vodka and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker with ice.

Flip the tenderloin and freeze for another hour. Use a very sharp knife to slice the meat as thinly as possible. Roast the poblano directly over an open flame, turning regularly, until blistered and blackened all over, about 5 minutes. Put in a bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and let cool for at least 10 minutes. Rub off the blackened skin, remove the stem and seeds and slice into 1/4-inch strips. Heat a cast-iron griddle over medium-high heat on one side and medium-low heat on the other side. On the cooler side, drizzle with olive oil, add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and beginning to char, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the roasted poblano to the onions and cook for another 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Drizzle the hot side of the grill pan with olive oil, then lay the meat in a single layer, in batches if necessary. Cook very quickly on the first side, about 1 minute. Flip and cook on the other side, another minute or so. Repeat the process until all the meat is cooked. Reserve in a bowl along with the onions and pepper until you are ready to serve. Heat both sides of the griddle over medium-high heat and oil lightly. Arrange the tortillas in a single layer on the griddle and heat about 30 seconds per side, then wrap in a clean kitchen towel to keep warm. To build the tacos: In a warm tortilla, layer some meat, spoon on a couple of tablespoons of Cheese Sauce, add a few of the pepper and onions and top with the pickled cherry peppers. Set a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the evaporated milk and Dijon and whisk together until uniform and smooth. Toss the Cheddar, pepper jack and blue cheese with the cornstarch in a bowl until totally coated. Whisk the cheese mixture into the milk mixture and heat, stirring constantly, until all the cheese is melted and the sauce is silky and smooth, about 5 minutes. Keep warm over low heat until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 64626,&quot;Mediterranean Grilled Whole Snapper with Fennel and a Pernod Butter Sauce 1 whole red snapper, about 3 pounds, gills, gut and scales removed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 heads fennel 6 sprigs thyme 2 sprigs oregano 1 lemon, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup water 1 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon Pernod Reserved fennel leaves, from above 6 tablespoons butter, in pieces Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the grill to high. Rinse the snapper in clean water. Pat dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Remove any large fins with sharp kitchen shears. Season the inside of the fish with salt and pepper. Remove the leafy green tops from the fennel heads. Using the greens from 1 of the fennel heads, stuff the inside of the fish. Reserve the fennel bulbs and the remaining greens. Add the thyme and oregano and press closed. Make 3 diagonal slices on each side of the fillet. Cut down to the bone. Insert 1 lemon slice into each slit. Brush the whole fish with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Clean the surface of the grill with a grill brush. Brush the surface of the hot grill with olive oil. Place the stuffed red snapper on the preheated grill at a 45 degree angle and cook for about 10 minutes or until the fish easily lifts off the grill. With 2 spatulas, carefully turn 90 degrees and continue to cook another 5 minutes. Turn fish and cook the other side to desired doneness, at least another 10 minutes. Do not overcook. Meanwhile, cut the reserved fennel bulbs into 1/4-inch slices. Drizzle with olive oil and place on the grill. Grill until tender and golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a platter and keep warm. For the sauce: Place a small saucepan on the grill or on a burner over medium heat. Add the water and bring to a simmer. Add the lemon juice and Pernod and reduce by 1/3. With the remaining reserved fennel leaves, remove the tender inner leaves and chop finely. You should have about 1/4 cup chopped fennel. Set aside. Remove the water/lemon mixture from the heat and whisk in the butter, a few pieces at a time. When the butter is incorporated, add the chopped fennel leaves and whisk well. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. When the fish is cooked and the flesh is opaque and lifts easily from the bone, carefully remove using 2 sturdy metal spatulas and place on a platter. Serve the fish with some of the Pernod butter sauce and grilled fennel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 64627,&quot;Tuscany Individual Pizzas 1/4-ounce active dry yeast (1 package) 3/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 1 3/4 cups unbleached flour 1/2 cup semolina (durum wheat) 1 teaspoon sugar. 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil Instructions: Place a pizza stone on the bottom rack of oven and preheat to 500 degrees F. for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 10 minutes. Traditional method: Put 1 1/2 cups of the flour, semolina sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir to combine. While stirring with a wooden spoon slowly add the yeast mixture until combined. Add the olive oil and continue stirring until the mixture forms a loose ball, adding the remaining 1/4 cup of flour if necessary to form a ball that is not sticky. On a lightly floured board knead the dough for 3 to 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and consistent in texture. Food Processor method: With the metal blade inserted, put the flour, semolina, sugar and salt into the work bowl. With the motor running, pour the yeast mixture through the feed tube and process for 30 to 45 seconds or until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Add the olive oil through the feed tube and continue to process for 1 minute. The dough should have formed a ball. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly with flour until it is not sticky. Both methods continue: Form the dough into a ball and put in a bowl that has been lightly coated with olive oil. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and put it in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a cylinder and cut into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a lightly floured platter. Cover with a damp towel. Using a rolling pin, roll one ball into a circle. Garnish the pizza as desired. Place directly on pizza stone and bake for approximately 4 minutes (Check after 3 minutes) until ready. Continue creating individual pizzas. La Margherita Pizza toppings: Top the pizza with a tomato puree made up of peeled tomatoes (use canned tomatoes when good quality fresh are unavailable), olive oil, oregano and a pinch of salt. Sprinkle with grated Mozzarella cheese and lightly drizzle olive oil over the pizza. Add salt and pepper for taste. La Napoletana Pizza toppings: Top the pizza with tomato puree and sprinkle with capers, mozzarella cheese and top with anchovies. Lightly drizzle olive oil over the pizza.

In a large bowl, combine garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, green onions, white wine, and lime juice to make a marinade. Place shrimp in the marinade and marinate for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove shrimp from marinade and thread onto skewers. See Cook&#39;s Note* Place shrimp on a hot grill for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they turn pink. Do not overcook. Remove from the grill and remove the shrimp from the skewers. For Taro chip: Place a 10-inch straight-sided saute pan over medium high heat. Add the oil and heat until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees F. Slice taro root thinly, a little thicker than a potato chip. It is easiest to do this on a mandoline. Once oil is up to temperature, fry the sliced taro root until lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel, salt, and set them side. For Salsa: Combine tomatoes, avocado, cilantro, and lemon juice in a bowl. Gently fold together. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. To assemble, place 1 shrimp on top of a taro chip and garnish with 1/4 teaspoon of salsa.

Wash and drain the rice. Place in a large saucepan with plenty of water to cover. Stir, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 5 minutes, to blanch the rice. Drain rice in a colander, rinse with warm water, drain again and set aside. While rice is cooking, place 3 cups milk in a medium heavy bottomed saucepan, add cinnamon sticks, lemon zest, and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off heat and let infuse until rice is ready. Place rice in another medium heavy bottomed saucepan, and ladle in 1 cup warm milk. Stir well with a wooden spoon, then turn on the lowest possible heat and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until milk is absorbed. Ladle in 1/2 cup warm milk, stir, and cook until absorbed. Continue in this manner until you have used up all the milk (remove and discard the cinnamon sticks). With the last 1/2 cup of milk, stir in also the sugar, butter, ground cinnamon, and the plumped currants in Port. When the last addition of milk has been absorbed, turn off the heat and evaluate the consistency against your personal rice pudding preferences, bearing in mind it will be thicker when chilled. Add 1/4 cup to 1 cup additional milk (cold is fine) as desired. Turn pudding out into a medium serving dish or divide between six individual serving dishes and decorate top with ground cinnamon. Portuguese rice pudding is cooked entirely on top of the stove in a risotto like manner. It traditionally is thickened and enriched further with egg yolks, but has a voluptuous texture even without them, and is lower in fat. Stir the rice frequently but NOT constantly because it can become too gummy. The classic Portuguese seasonings are lemon and cinnamon, but not vanilla. Use ground cinnamon to decorate the top; easiest way is sifting through a doily. Port, or Porto, comes from Portugal and is considered one of the great dessert wines of the world. It is a fortified wine, meaning that brandy is added. Most Port is made from red grapes and is served after the meal. Ruby Port is full, fruity and young; tawny ports have been aged in casks and are mellower. One can also find white Port, which is made from white grapes, and is drunk before the meal. &quot;,&quot;[Porto, Tawny Port, Moscato, Vin Santo]</p><p>&quot; 64632,&quot;Black Pepper and Ginger Chicken Taco with Red Curry-Peanut Sauce and Peanut Relish 1 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons peanut oil 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper 4 boneless chicken breasts Salt 2 tablespoons peanut oil 1 tablespoon red curry paste 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 cup coconut milk 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter Salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup chopped peanuts 1/4 cup chopped pistachios Salt and pepper 8 blue corn tortillas, (6-inches each) 1/2 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese 1/2 cup grated white cheddar cheese 1/2 red onion, finely sliced 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro Cilantro, for garnish Instructions: For Chicken Marinade: Whisk together soy sauce, oil, ginger, garlic and black pepper in a medium shallow baking dish. Add the chicken breast and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Heat a large grill pan over high heat until smoking. Remove chicken from marinade and season with salt to taste. Grill for 4 to 5 minutes on each side until just cooked through. Let rest 5 minutes, slice each breast on the bias into 6 slices. For the Red Curry Peanut Sauce: Heat peanut oil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the curry paste and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the soy sauce, coconut milk and lime juice and bring to a simmer. Whisk in the peanut butter and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. For the Peanut Relish: Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. To Assemble: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lay tortillas out on a flat surface. Divide both of the cheeses among the tortillas. Top the cheese with 3 slices of the chicken, some of the red onion and cilantro. Fold the tortillas over to form a half moon and brush the tops with peanut oil. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until the cheese melts.

To serve, release the sides of the springform pan, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar using the strainer, and cut into wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 64634,&quot;Healthy Guacamole 3 avocados Salt Pico de Gallo, recipe follows Tortilla chips, for serving 3 yellow or red onions 12 Roma tomatoes (slightly under ripe is fine) 2 cups fresh cilantro leaves 2 to 3 jalapenos 1 lime Salt Instructions: Halve the avocados lengthwise. Remove the pit and dice the flesh inside the shell. Squeeze the diced avocado into a bowl. Next, sprinkle on some salt and mash away with a fork until you get the avocado to the consistency you want. Now throw on a big pile of Pico de Gallo and stir together gently. Always test the guacamole with tortilla chips so you&#39;ll get a more accurate gauge of the salt content. Dice up equal quantities of onion and tomato. Roughly chop the cilantro. Now, slice 1 or 2 jalapenos in half. With a spoon, scrape out the seeds. (If you like things spicy, leave in some of the white membranes.) Dice the jalapenos very finely; you want a hint of heat and jalapeno flavor, but you don&#39;t want to cause any fires. Now dump the four ingredients into a bowl. Slice the lime in half and squeeze the juice from half a lime the bowl. Sprinkle with salt, and stir together until combined. Be sure to taste the pico de gallo and adjust the seasonings, adding salt or more diced jalapeno if needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 64635,&quot;Wok Fried Ahi Poke Salad 1 pound Ahi (tuna), cubed 1 tablespoon red Hawaiian salt (or substitute kosher salt) 1 tablespoon kukui nuts (or substitute macadamia nuts), chopped 1/2 cup fresh ogo (seaweed), chopped fine 1/4 cup green onions, chopped 3/8 cup Roma tomatoes, diced 1 tablespoon Shoyu (Japanese soy sauce) 2 tablespoons miso paste 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 2 tablepsoons Mirin (rice wine) 2 tablespoons Shoyu (Japanese soy sauce) 1 teaspoon garlic, grated 3/8 teaspoon ginger, grated 2 tablespoons salad oil, such as canola Salad garnish: butterhead lettuce, bean sprouts, and julienne red peppers Instructions: Combine all Ahi Poke ingredients and set aside.

Gradually whisk in the oil. Whisk in the herbs. Use immediately or store, covered, in the refrigerator for 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64638,&quot;Mixed Herb Pesto Penne 1 cup fresh basil leaves 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 1/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves 1/4 cup pine nuts About 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves 2 cloves garlic, grated or made into a paste Juice of 1/2 lemon Salt and freshly ground pepper About 1/2 cup EVOO 1 pound penne pasta 1 small russet potato, peeled and diced into 1/4-inch cubes 1/3 pound haricots verts, trimmed and cut into thirds Instructions: Place the basil, parsley, cheese, mint, pine nuts, thyme, garlic and lemon juice in a food processor and season with salt and pepper. Turn the processor on and add the EVOO in a slow stream, blending until a thick sauce forms. Transfer to a large bowl. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 6 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook for 1 more minute. Add the haricots verts and cook until the pasta is al dente, 2 to 3 more minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water and add it to the pesto. Drain the pasta, then add it to the bowl with the pesto and toss to coat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64639,&quot;Mushroom Empanadas 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 onion, diced 1 garlic clove, minced 1 pound white or oyster mushrooms, cleaned and roughly chopped 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 chiles de arbol, stemmed, seeded and finely ground, or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 bunch epazote or parsley, leaves only, roughly chopped 1 recipe Corn Tortilla Dough, recipe follows 1 cup grated cheese mix (see Note) 4 cups vegetable oil, for frying Salsa 1 cup shredded cabbage 1 cup crema, recipe above, creme fraiche or sour cream 4 cups finely ground deep yellow masa harina 2 3/4 cups cold water 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Saute the onions until they just begin to brown. Then stir in the garlic and cook until the aroma is released, about 1 minute longer. Add the mushrooms, salt, pepper and arbol chiles. Continue cooking until the mushrooms soften, 5 minutes. Stir in the epazote or parsley and briefly cook just to release its flavor, about a minute. Set aside to cool. Divide the corn tortilla dough into 16 equal balls and flatten to 1/4-inch thick, 3-inch circles Divide the cooled mushroom mixture into 16 portions. Lightly coat one side of each tortilla with the remaining softened butter. Place the mushroom mixture in the center and top with 1 tablespoon of the grated cheese mixture. Fold over to enclose and pinch the edges together tightly to seal. Refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap, a minimum of 30 minutes or up to 2 days. Pour the oil into a medium saucepan and place over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, fry the empanadas, a few at a time, until they color slightly and rise to the surface, about 7 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. To serve, split each empanada open along the seam and garnish with 1 tablespoon each salsa, cabbage, crema, creme fraiche or sour cream. Serve hot. Note: Use a mixture of equal parts of the following cheeses: Mexican Manchego (substitute Monterey Jack or Muenster if unavailable), Anejo (substitute Romano or dried feta), and Panela (substitute ricotta or dry cottage cheese). Combine the masa harina, water and salt in a large mixing bowl, and stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small ball of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64640,&quot;Chocolate Filled Almond Macarons 2 ounces finely chopped milk chocolate 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Pinch kosher salt 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup whole blanched almonds, very finely ground 2 to 4 drops liquid neon food coloring, such as McCormick, optional 2 large egg whites, at room temperature Pinch kosher salt 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract Instructions: For the ganache: Combine the chopped chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a pot with 1-inch of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Stir in the cream, vanilla and salt, and then remove from the heat. Set aside until cooled and thickened, stirring occasionally, 30 to 45 minutes.<br> For the cookies: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a small glass or cookie cutter (1 1/4 to 1 1/2-inch wide), trace 15 circles on each piece of parchment paper, leaving about 2 inches between each round. Flip the parchment over; the lines will be visible through the paper but you will not have to pipe directly onto the ink. Fit a pastry bag with a round tip about 1/4-inch wide.<br> Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar and ground almonds into a bowl and discard any larger nut chunks. (If you have more than a tablespoon of bigger chunks, grind those until powdery and then resift.) Combine the egg whites and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with the whisk attachment of a hand-held electric mixer). Whip on medium-low speed until frothy, and then add the granulated sugar. Increase the speed to medium-high and whip until very soft peaks form. Add the almond extract and a few drops of food coloring if using. Whip until stiff peaks form. Fold about one-third of the sugar-nut mixture into the egg whites until blended, and then fold in the remaining two-thirds. The batter should be a bit fluid but not runny. It should slowly drip off the spatula and sit on top of the batter in the bowl for a bit before eventually oozing back into it. If it seems a bit stiff at this point, fold once or twice more until it relaxes, although be careful not to over fold. This correct texture is the key to the macaron and it is better to have a stiffer batter than a looser one.<br> Transfer the batter to the prepared pastry bag. Holding the bag perpendicular over the baking sheet, squeeze until the batter fills a circle drawn on the paper. Release the pressure on the bag and pull towards you to prevent a pointy tip on the center of the cookie. Repeat with the remaining circles. Gently flatten any points on the cookies with a damp fingertip.<br> Firmly rap the baking sheets against the counter to release any air bubbles and let stand at room temperature until the tops of the cookies no longer feel wet, 10 to 15 minutes. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the macarons are slightly crisp and the bottoms release from the parchment paper, about 15 minutes, rotating the sheet halfway through the baking time. Cool on the sheet 5 minutes, and then peel off the cookies and cool completely on a wire rack.<br> To assemble the cookies, spread a thin layer of the chocolate ganache on the bottoms of half of the cookies, about 1/4 teaspoon per cookie. Top with a second cookie, gently pressing to squeeze the ganache to the rims.<br> TIP: The weight of the batter in the pastry bag will force some of the batter out. To stop this, you can stick a mini marshmallow at the end of your pastry tip to block to the batter from running out the end. TIP: You can use store-bought almond meal in place of the whole almonds. Sift 2/3 cup with the confectioners&#39; sugar and, if necessary, grind the larger chunks and sift until a tablespoon or less of larger chunks remain in the sifter.<br> TIP: You can also spoon the batter onto the parchment lined baking sheets. The cookies may not be as perfectly round but will still taste great. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 64641,&quot;Hot Apple-Ginger Toddy 6 oz. ginger-infused apple cider Thin slice of fresh ginger or one piece of crystallized, candied ginger 1 tsp. honey 2 oz. bourbon (Maker&#39;s Mark or Jim Beam are preferred) Slice of lemon Instructions: First - Ginger-infuse the cider: Peel and chop the ginger.

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat and add the garlic. Throw in the mushrooms, wine, salt and pepper, and cook them, stirring occasionally, until the liquid reduces by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle the flour all over, then stir to combine. Pour in the broth, stir and continue to cook until the sauce is nice and thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cream cheese and stir until it mixes in. (Don&#39;t worry if it seems a little lumpy at first. That will go away!) Add the turkey, peas, Monterey Jack, olives, Parmesan and bacon. Stir until everything is well combined, then add salt and pepper to taste. Add the spaghetti and stir to combine. If the mixture is too thick, splash in 1/2 cup of broth. Pour the whole shebang into a large casserole dish and even out the surface.

Put the ribs meat-side down on a cutting board. Insert a paring knife between the membrane and the bones on one end of each rack, then loosen the membrane and pull it off. Rub the ribs with the lemon juice and sprinkle evenly with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Place the ribs bone-side down in a large roasting pan, then add the beer. Cover tightly with foil, transfer to the oven and roast until the meat pulls away from the bone, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly golden, about 2 minutes. Add the cl powder and cook 1 minute. Stir in the cl sauce, brown sugar, vinegar and 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened and reduced by half, about 40 minutes. Remove the ribs from the oven; increase the temperature to 400 degrees F. Uncover the pan; carefully pour out the cooking liquid. Stir 1/4 cup cooking liquid into the sauce, then discard the rest of the liquid. Generously brush the ribs with the sauce. Return the pan to the oven and continue roasting, uncovered, until the ribs are golden brown and tender, about 35 minutes. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and slice, then return to the roasting pan. Pour the remaining sauce on top and toss.

Set it aside. Cut the loaf of bread in 1/2 lengthwise and spread tapenade mayonnaise over the cut sides of both pieces. Arrange the sliced lamb on the bottom piece of the bread and season it with salt and pepper. Scatter the arugula over the lamb, and set the top half of the bread on top of the lamb and press down gently. Cut crosswise into individual servings and either serve immediately or refrigerate, tightly wrapped in wax paper, until ready to serve. To Drink: A Russian River Valley pinot noir, such as Moshin or Gary Farrell Allen Vineyard, is the best choice. In a small bowl, toss together the olives and garlic. Add the parsley, basil, anchovy, capers, and lemon zest, mix together, season generously with black pepper, thin with olive oil, and set aside for 30 minutes before serving. The tapenade will keep in the refrigerator for a day or two, after which time its flavors will deteriorate. You can make this tapenade using almost any olive, including the mixed olives sold at the olive bars common in upscale markets these days. If you select the olives yourself, try a mix of kalamatas, picholines, cracked green, and California black. Salted capers are available in good delis and markets.

Add the onion, season generously with salt and cook until soft but not browned, 6 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill (or puree in a food processor) and add to the pot. Fill one of the empty tomato cans with about 2 1/2 cups water, add to the pot and season generously with salt. Simmer 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Taste frequently and season with salt as the sauce simmers-tomatoes take a lot of salt. Make the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil (the water should taste like the ocean). Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes. Fill a bowl with salted ice water. Remove the pasta from the boiling water and transfer to the ice water to stop the cooking. Mix the ricotta, pecorino, 1/4 cup parmesan, 1 1/2 cups mozzarella, eggs, thyme and 2 teaspoons salt in a bowl. Drain the pasta and place on a clean towel in a single layer. Coat the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with a ladle or two of sauce. Spread 3 heaping tablespoonfuls of the cheese filling down the center of each lasagna sheet; roll up the sheet (but not too tightly or the filling might ooze out). Place seam-side down in the baking dish, leaving a little room between each roll. Cover with 3 to 4 cups sauce and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup parmesan and 1 1/2 cups mozzarella. Bake, uncovered, until the lasagna bubbles around the edges and the cheese melts, about 1 hour. Let rest 10 minutes, then serve with extra sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 64656,&quot;Decadent Brownie Pops 2 (11 1/2-ounce) bags milk chocolate morsels (recommended: Nestle or Hershey&#39;s) 1 recipe Decedent Brownies, at room temperature, recipe follows Various toppings: chopped peanuts, coconut flakes, mini chocolate chips, sprinkles, etc. 1 1/4 sticks unsalted butter, plus more, softened, for pan 1 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 1/3 cup sugar 1 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Dip 1 candy/lollipop stick into the melted chocolate (this will help the brownie adhere better to the stick). With clean hands, or wearing rubber gloves, scoop out 1 heaping tablespoon of brownie. Mold the brownie onto the stick, making sure the brownie is somewhat secure. Carefully dip/paint each stick individually with melted chocolate with the help of a spoon, allowing some of the chocolate to get onto the stick. This will act as glue and keep the pop from falling apart when you bite into it. Dip into different toppings, as desired. Place onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Once all the pops are finished, place into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to set. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. For your brownie batter, melt your butter in a medium (or large) heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. While the butter is melting, whisk the cocoa powder, sea salt and sugar in a separate bowl. (The sugar and salt will work as abrasive agents to get any lumps out of the cocoa.) Whisk the cocoa/sugar/salt combo into the melted butter until the sugar has dissolved fully. The mixture should look like fudge and pull away from the bowl into a ball. Take off the stove and set the pan on a dishtowel on your counter. Allow the fudgy mixture to cool down until it&#39;s warm, but not hot anymore. While that is cooling, line the bottom and sides of your 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper or foil. You want to leave about 4 inches of overhang on the 2 opposite sides. These serve as your handles to remove the brownies from the pan in 1 piece, so make sure that there is enough of the overhang for you to have a solid grip. Grease the parchment or foil well. Stir in the vanilla into the cooled fudge mixture to loosen it up. Add the eggs into the mixture 1 at a time, adding the second egg after the first egg is fully incorporated. The batter should look shiny and well blended. Add in your flour and stir it until it&#39;s fully incorporated. Once it looks fully blended, beat the batter vigorously for at least 45 strokes. This&#39;ll not only get out any pent up stress, but it will make the brownies chewy. Fold in your chocolate chips. Spread the very thick and fudgy brownie batter evenly in the lined pan with an offset spatula or your greased hands. Pop the brownies in the oven and bake until they get a nice crust and your house smells like brownies, 20 to 25 minutes. Let them cool completely on a rack or a dishtowel on your counter. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Zinfandel]&quot; 64657,&quot;Orange-Ginger Fried Wontons Vegetable oil, for shallow frying 1 generous tablespoon orange marmalade 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger 2 ounces cream cheese, softened 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 12 wonton wrappers Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: In a heavy-bottomed, straight-sided, medium saute pan, add enough oil to reach at least 1-inch up the sides. Heat over medium-high heat. In a small bowl, mix together the orange marmalade, ginger, cream cheese, cinnamon, and salt until very well blended. Fill each wonton with a rounded teaspoon of filling and brush a little water along the edges of the wonton dough. Fold in half diagonally and pinch the wontons shut, making triangles. (Make all the wontons before frying.) Working in batches, carefully fry the wontons 3 or 4 at a time, just until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, turning once. Remove the wontons and any blot excess oil on a paper towel. Allow to cool a few minutes before serving, as the filling will be extremely hot. Lightly dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 64658,&quot;Clams with Chorizo 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 8 ounces Spanish-style dried chorizo, sliced into thin rounds 1 small Spanish onion, diced Pinch of red pepper flakes 1 clove garlic, minced 24 cockles or other small clams, cleaned 1/4 cup bottled clam juice 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Crusty bread, for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan (preferably one that can also be used for serving) over high heat.

Add the garlic, cockles, clam juice and wine. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the cockles are open and warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes. (Discard any cockles that do not open.) Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with bread. &quot;,&quot;[Verdejo, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 64659,&quot;Apple Cupcakes with Marshmallow Frosting 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 3 large eggs 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup sour cream 1 large crisp sweet apple, such as Gala, peeled, cored, and finely chopped (about 1 cup) 10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 5 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup marshmallow cream 1/4 cup milk 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Pinch fine salt Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 muffin tins with paper liners. Whisk the flour, baking soda, nutmeg and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time and then the vanilla, beating until smooth. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in half the flour mixture until just combined. Then add the sour cream, and then the rest of the flour. Beat until well combined, taking care not to over mix. Stir in the chopped apples. Divide the batter between prepared muffin tin, filling them 1/2 way full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the tops spring back when pressed gently, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the tin on a rack for 10 minutes then remove and cool completely on the rack. For the frosting: Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally. Add the marshmallow cream, milk, vanilla and salt and beat on low speed until blended. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until fluffy and thick, 1 to 2 minutes. Pipe or spread the frosting on the tops of the cupcakes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 64660,&quot;Pineapple Buns (Bo Lo Bao) 2 cups (240 g) plus 2 tablespoons (18 g) bread flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup (57 g) cold whole milk 4 tablespoons (50 g) sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons (5 g) active dry yeast 4 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 large egg, straight from the refrigerator 3 tablespoons (21 g) dry milk powder 1/4 cup (28 g) cake flour 1 teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt 5 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 5 tablespoons (62 g) sugar 1 large egg yolk 2 tablespoons (14 g) dry milk powder 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or vanilla paste 2/3 cup (80 g) all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon (3 g) baking soda 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) baking powder Nonstick cooking spray 1 large egg yolk Instructions: Start the bread dough: Whisk the 2 tablespoons (18 g) bread flour with 1/2 cup cold water in a medium saucepan until no lumps remain. Cook, whisking constantly, over medium heat until thickened and opaque, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a stand mixer bowl and let cool slightly. Add the milk and 1 tablespoon of the sugar and whisk by hand until smooth and the mixture reaches 100 to 110 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 seconds. Whisk in the yeast just until combined. Let sit until foamy on the surface, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, grease a large bowl with 1/2 tablespoon of the butter and set aside. Top the yeast mixture with the following ingredients in this order: the egg, milk powder, remaining 2 cups (240 g) bread flour, the cake flour, remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and the salt. Fit the stand mixer with the dough hook attachment and mix on low speed until all the flour is moistened, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth and passes the window pane test, about 10 minutes (see Cook\u2019s Note); scrape down the bowl halfway through. Mix in 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter on medium-low speed until absorbed. Repeat, adding 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter at a time, and mix after each addition until the dough is smooth, about 6 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and form into a tight ball by pulling the edges of the dough toward the center. Toss in the prepared bowl to coat with butter, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Start the topping: Cream the butter with the sugar in the stand mixer (no need to wash the bowl first) fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth and thoroughly combined but not fluffy, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl and mix in the egg yolk, milk powder and vanilla until combined. Sift in the flour, baking soda and baking powder and mix on low speed until no dry spots remain. Transfer to a large sheet of plastic wrap or a reusable plastic bag and flatten into a 4-inch disk. Wrap the dough and chill in the freezer until ready to use. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Finish the bread dough: Knead the bread dough in the bowl until it becomes a tight ball. Divide into 8 equal pieces, each about 80 grams. Flatten 1 piece into a 3-inch disk and gather all the edges to meet at the center. Flip over and roll into a ball on a work surface, cupping the top of the dough with one hand, until the ball is completely smooth. Repeat with the remaining pieces and place 4 balls on each prepared baking sheet. Cover each baking sheet with a sheet of plastic wrap greased with nonstick cooking spray. Let proof near a warm area until each ball puffs to about 4 inches, about 1 hour. Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Finish the topping: Meanwhile, divide the cookie dough disk into 8 portions, each about 32 g, and roll each portion into a ball. Place 4 of the balls on a large sheet of plastic wrap and cover with another sheet of plastic wrap. Gently flatten each ball into a 2-inch disk, then roll with a rolling pin between the sheets of plastic wrap until each is a 4-inch round \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be a perfect round. Stack the rounds on a plate, using the plastic wrap to separate each one. Refrigerate until ready to use. Repeat the rolling and stacking process with the remaining cookie dough and 2 more sheets of plastic. Refrigerate on top of the first batch of rounds until the buns are proofed. For the egg wash: Whisk the egg yolk in a small bowl until smooth and set aside. Remove the plastic wrap from the proofed buns. Drape 1 cookie dough round over each bun and brush with a thin coating of egg wash. Score a shallow crosshatch pattern (1 inch between each line) onto each using the dull side of a small knife. Bake, switching and rotating the baking sheets halfway through, until the tops of the buns are golden brown and the edges are light golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes then gently transfer each bun to a wire rack.

Grease 2 9-inch round cake pans and line the bases with parchment paper. Set the prepared pans aside. Combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add the eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla and whisk together. Add the boiling water to the bowl and whisk to incorporate well. Divide the batter equally between the 2 prepared pans.<br> Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, and then turn the cake out onto a wire rack. Remove the parchment from both layers. Turn one of the cakes right side up to be the top layer. Allow the cakes to cool completely, about 1 hour. Once cool, place the first cake layer, with the bottom of the cake facing up, on a cooling rack set over a baking pan or on a cake plate and spread the jam on top of the cake, leaving a 1/2-inch border of cake. Top the jam with the second cake layer, that has been turned right side up. Pour the ganache over the cake, if using.<br> For trifle toppings: Put the strawberries in a small bowl and sprinkle with sugar to the desired sweetness. Set the bowl aside. In another bowl, add the cream and softly whip with a hand whisk or electric mixer, and set aside until needed. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until little bubbles appear around the edges. Remove the saucepan from the heat and immediately add the chocolate. Shake the pan to submerge the chocolate and leave it to melt for a couple of minutes. Stir gently to mix the chocolate to a smooth cream. Set the mixture aside for 20 to 30 minutes to thicken to a spreadable consistency. Stir through a few times as it&#39;s cooking over low heat to keep the ganache smooth.<br> Pour the thickened ganache in a wide ribbon around the circumference of the cake and with a spatula gently push the ganache over the edges. It should fall in thick waves. Fill in the middle with more ganache and swirl the ganache into luscious billows.<br> Cook Time: 10 minutes<br> Inactive Prep Time: 20 to 30 minutes<br> Ease of preparation: easy &quot;,&quot;[Reds such as Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 64699,&quot;Pizza with Prosciutto, Spinach, Truffle Oil, and Egg 8 ounces water 1/8-ounce yeast 1/4-ounce salt 1 pound bread flour 1/8 cup olive oil 1/8 cup cornmeal 4 cups tomato sauce 4 cups shredded spinach 2 cups grated Parmesan 12 slices Canadian bacon or regular bacon, cooked until crispy 2 tablespoons truffle oil 2 eggs Instructions: Place the water in a large bowl or mixer with a dough hook.

In a medium saucepan, cook butter over high heat until browned. Reduce temperature to cool slightly then add sugar, walnut puree and salt. Increase heat again so that the mixture comes to a boil. Place chocolate in a large stainless steel bowl. Pour boiling mixture over chocolate. Whisk the new mixture until smooth and emulsified. Whisk in eggs and egg yolks. Pour mixture into individual (2 1/2 inch) ramekins. Place the ramekins in a large pan filled with enough water to come up to a third of the side of ramekins. Bake for approximately 30 minutes until the custard is set. Let cool to room temperature, cover and reserve in refrigerator.<br> To plate:<br> After custard is cooled, remove from ramekin. On an oblong plate place the custard on the left side of the plate and the strawberry sphere on the right hand side of the plate. At Moto, Chef Cantu added bright green shiso foam to the custard and some strawberry pastry cream under the sphere, so you can feel free to dress your plate to your taste. Puree strawberries in a blender. Strain strawberries through a fine mesh sieve and season with remaining ingredients.<br> Using the syringe, fill balloons with 60 cc of strawberry puree. Then inflate the balloons with nitrogen gas to the size of one&#39;s fist. Securely tie the balloon. Pour liquid nitrogen into a Styrofoam container, enough to roll the balloons in. Roll each balloon in a circular motion on all sides until completely frozen (1 to 2 minutes). Then hang the frozen balloons freely on a hanger or warm in your hands until the balloon is able to pull away from the ice. Using scissors cut a small incision on one side of the balloon and peel it away from the sphere. Discard the balloon. Refreeze the resulting sphere in liquid nitrogen using the same rolling technique.

On the stovetop, bring the chicken stock, onion, garlic and wine to a simmer in a saucepan. Place the peppers in a roasting pan and roast in the oven, checking every 15 minutes, and turning them with tongs until the skin is fully wrinkled and charred black. When the peppers are done, use tongs to put them in a ziptop bag which (for safety reasons) you have resting on a plate - (Remember, they&#39;re volcanically hot!). Carefully zip the bag shut, and allow them to sweat for 5 minutes. Use oven mitts to prevent getting burned while you handle the bag in the next step of sliding the peppers from the bag into a bowl filled with a couple of inches of ice water. You can then use your fingers to work quickly to slip off and discard the skins of the peppers while they are in the water. You will be left with beautifully cooked red peppers with a wonderful color. Remove stem and seeds. Chop the peppers and add them to the simmering chicken stock mixture, and continue simmering until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Create a slurry of cornstarch in a small amount of water and add to the red pepper sauce. Process coulis in a blender until a smooth consistency is achieved. Then season with salt and pepper, to taste. For the grits: Bring water for grits to a boil. Add grits and chopped shrimp, reduce heat and cook until grits are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter, scallions, tomatoes, cilantro, bacon and cheese, and keep covered in a warm place. For the fish: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat both sides of red snapper with salt and pepper and Cajun spice. Then on the stovetop, heat some grapeseed oil in a large nonstick saute pan, and when it begins to shimmer, saute the shrimp only until they turn pink, and then remove shrimp to a utility platter. In the same pan, sear each side of the fish. (When you place the fillet into the pan, leave it undisturbed for a couple of minutes to allow the seasoning to cook into the surface of the fish.) Cook until golden brown, then finish in the oven for a further 2 to 3 minutes and remove it to rest for 5 to 8 minutes. (Please take care to avoid overcooking the fish, as it will continue to cook even after you remove it from the oven.) Place some of the grits in the middle of serving plate, then position a fish fillet on top, and drizzle the coulis around the fish. Top with a shrimp. Garnish liberally with scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 64703,&quot;Shrimp Fried Rice with Sun Dried Tomatoes 5 cups Cooked Rice 3 large eggs, beaten with a pinch of white pepper and salt 1 teaspoon peanut oil 1 1/2 teaspoons oyster sauce 1 tablespoon Chicken Stock 2 teaspoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon white wine 3/4 teaspoon sugar Pinch white pepper 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 1 1/2 teaspoons minced ginger 2 cups broccoli stems, peeled, cut into l/4inch dice 1/4 pound medium shrimp, shelled, deveined, and cut into 1/2inch pieces 1/4 cup sundried tomatoes, washed in warm water, cut 1/2 by 1/4inch pieces 1/2 cup scallions, finely sliced 3 tablespoons minced fresh coriander (cilantro Instructions: Prepare Basic Rice recipe.

Add the chopped chocolate. Set your ramekins/cocottes/teacups/glasses on a baking sheet. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the milk, heavy cream, sugar, salt and egg yolks over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, 8 to 10 minutes; I like to use a flat-bottomed wooden spatula so that I can make sure the eggs aren&#39;t catching on the bottom and cooking. Cook until the custard thickens, resembling something like very thick paint. It should register between 175 and 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Another test: the custard should coat the back of the spatula, and when you draw a line across the back of the spatula with your (clean!) finger, the line should hold and maintain its edges without running. Remove from the heat immediately. Now, pour the warm custard through a strainer into the blender. Let it sit 5 minutes to melt the chocolate. Add the Sriracha, espresso powder if using and vanilla extract. Then, put the lid on the blender, hold down with a thick kitchen towel, and blend on low, then high, until smooth and combined, scraping down the sides if necessary. Taste for seasoning. Pour the custard into your containers, tapping them against the rim of the baking sheet to remove air bubbles. Pop them in the fridge and chill until the custards are set, 2 to 3 hours.

Rinse the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels. Place the turkey on a rack set inside a large roasting pan. Place the orange and lemon wedges, onion, and 2 sprigs of each fresh herb in the main turkey cavity. Tie the legs together to hold the shape of the turkey. Stir 2 tablespoons of butter, the herbes de Provence, oil, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of each the salt and pepper in a small saucepan over medium heat just until the butter melts. Rub the butter mixture all over the turkey and between the turkey breast meat and skin. Place the turkey neck and giblets in roasting pan. (Recipe can be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before roasting.) Cover the turkey breast with foil. Roast for 20 minutes. Pour 3 cups of broth into the pan and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining sprigs of fresh herbs to the pan. Roast the turkey for 40 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Remove the foil from the turkey; pour 1 more cup of broth into the pan. Continue roasting the turkey until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F to 175 degrees F or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with a skewer, basting occasionally with pan juices, about 1 hour and 30 minutes longer. Transfer the turkey to a platter and tent with foil. Let stand 30 minutes while preparing the gravy. To make the gravy: Strain the turkey pan juices from the roasting pan through a sieve and into a 4-cup glass measuring cup; discard the solids. Spoon off the fat from atop the pan juices. Add enough chicken broth, about 1 to 2 cups, to the pan juices to measure 4 cups total. Melt the remaining butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the broth. Simmer until the gravy thickens slightly, whisking often, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Using a towel, grasp an oyster in the palm of your hand. Press the oyster, rounded side down, on a firm surface, still holding it with the towel. Shuck the oyster by wedging the tip of an oyster knife (regular knives are too thinbladed) between the halves of the shell, at the shell&#39;s narrowest end. When the knife tip is securely wedged, rotate the blade to pry open the shell. Slide the knife blade along the length of the shell to open completely. Remove the oyster from the shell and reserve, along with its juice. From each pair of oyster shells, save the one that is most concave on the inside, and discard the one that is flatter. Place the concave shells in a pan of cold water and scrub inside and out. Place the clean oyster shells on a cookie sheet and set aside. Dip the tomatoes briefly in boiling water to loosen the skins, then in ice water. Peel, cut in half, remove and discard the seeds and dice. Lay out the phyllo dough one sheet at a time on a clean work surface.

Mash the bananas in a bowl with a fork until a few small lumps are left. Fold in 1 teaspoon of the baking soda. Measure out 1/2 cup of this mixture and set aside. Sift the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon baking soda into a large bowl and mix well. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the soy milk, vegetable oil, vanilla and mashed bananas. Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry; don&#39;t over-mix or you&#39;ll get tough cupcakes (small lumps are fine). Fold in the dark chocolate. Divide the batter among the cupcake liners and bake until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool completely before frosting. For the frosting: Using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, mix together the vegan butter and shortening until well combined, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the peanut butter and mix for another minute. With the mixer on low, slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar. Add the soy milk and vanilla and mix on medium for 2 minutes. If the peanut butter flavor is too subtle, add 2 more tablespoons to the frosting and rewhip; you want to try to avoid a heavy, dense or gritty frosting, so adding a little at a time and then whipping it into the frosting will avoid that! For the ganache: Using a double boiler (or in the microwave), heat up the soy milk until it reaches a boil. Pour over the dark chocolate and wait a minute before stirring. To assemble: Put the frosting in a piping bag and apply to the top of each cupcake. Drizzle with the ganache. Dip the banana chips in the ganache, and then dip into the popping sugar.

Turn a gas burner on high. Char the chiles on the burner grate, turning with tongs (Marcela is a pro and uses her hands!), until blackened all over. Or char the chiles under the broiler. Let them soften. Transfer the charred chiles to a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag and close. Let stand 10 minutes. The chiles will steam in the bag, making them soft and easy to peel. Remove the skin. Gently rub the chiles with paper towels to remove as much skin as possible. It&#39;s okay if a few flecks remain-they&#39;ll add flavor, so don&#39;t rinse them off. Open the chiles. Using a paring knife, make a slit across the top of a cl just below the stem, leaving the stem intact. Starting from the middle of the slit, slice lengthwise down to the tip of the pepper (cut through only one layer). Open the cl like a book and pull out the seeds and inner membranes. You may need to use a paring knife to loosen the top of the seedpod. Repeat with the remaining chiles. Prepare the sauce. Puree the tomatoes, onion and garlic in a blender until smooth. Warm the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the tomato puree and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally; the sauce will be broth-y. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm. Make the filling. Place the cheese in a bowl, then add the oregano, crumbling and rubbing it with your fingers to release its flavor. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Stuff the chiles. Fill each cl with about 1/4 cup cheese mixture. Fold in the sides to cover the filling, then thread 2 toothpicks across the seam to form an X. You will probably need to make a second toothpick X to secure each cl so the filling doesn&#39;t leak out when you fry. Mix the batter. Beat the egg whites with a mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the egg yolk and beat 3 more minutes. Batter and fry. Heat about 1 inch vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F. Dredge: Pour flour into a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. One at a time, coat the stuffed chiles with the flour. Batter: Holding each cl by the stem, lower it into the egg batter to cover completely. Let any excess batter drip off. Fry: Add the chiles to the hot oil, 1 or 2 at a time; fry, flipping once with tongs, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Eat! Place a fried cl on each plate and pour the warm sauce over it.

In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot with a lid, warm the oil over medium heat, then stir in the popcorn kernels. Cover the pot and shake periodically until the kernels start to pop, then shake more until the popping slows. This should take a total of 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the lid, then spread the popcorn evenly on a baking sheet and sprinkle with the peanuts if using, and set aside. In a small saucepan set over medium heat, melt the butter, then stir in the sugar and cook until the mixture starts to bubble and the sugar dissolves, 4 to 5 minutes.

Saute the onion in a small pan in 2 tablespoons of butter until translucent and set aside. Boil the potatoes until tender. While the potatoes are boiling, begin the dough. Whisk together the eggs, 1/4 cup water and sour cream and pour into a small pitcher (or you can actually whisk them right in a container such as a 2-cup glass measuring vessel). Mound the flour in the center of a clean room-temperature work surface like a large wooden cutting board. Create a crater in the center of the mound. Pour enough of the egg mixture into the center to fill the crater. With a fork, gently begin to scramble the mixture within the confines of the crater, whilst integrating the flour from the sides of the crater as you carefully beat the egg mixture. Once this first amount of the egg mixture is mostly mixed in, shore up the sides of the mound again with flour, maintaining the crater shape. Repeat the process with a second pour of egg mixture into the crater, and again until you have combined all the egg mixture. (Remember that making pasta is not an exact science. Depending on the flour, you may need more moisture to make the dough come together, in which case use a little extra milk or water. Conversely, if the dough is too wet, add a little more flour - but just enough to make it the right consistency. This is an acquired skill so be patient with yourself.) Start kneading the dough with your palms, allowing the warmth of your hands to impart elasticity to the dough. Knead for a count of about 400 strokes or until you feel you have created a cohesive mass. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow it to rest for about 30 minutes. Return to the potatoes, drain, and mash them with the sauteed onion, chives, butter, milk, and salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside. Work with 1/3 of the pasta dough at a time - keeping the balance wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Use a pasta machine to gradually roll each section of the pasta down, successively reducing the setting on the machine until it is at a thickness of 1/16th of an inch. Cut 3-inch circles of pasta, spoon some of the mashed potatoes into the center and fold the filled circles into half moons, sealing the edges with egg wash and pressing shut with your fingers or carefully with the times of a fork. Bring a large shallow saute pan of water to a boil, and gently boil the pierogi in batches for 2 or 3 minutes, removing carefully to a utility platter with a wooden spoon. The final step is to melt the butter in a large fry pan and saute the garlic for a few minutes until it is tender and imparts its flavor to the butter in the pan. Be careful not to burn either the butter or the garlic. Saute the pierogi in this garlic butter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64784,&quot;Old Fashioned Vanilla Ice Cream 5 egg yolks 2/3 cup sugar 1 cup half-and-half 1 cup whipping cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions: Beat egg yolks and sugar until well blended.

Watermelon One 12-ounce container frozen whipped topping, such as Cool Whip, thawed<br> Instructions: For the cupcakes: Prepare the cake mix according to the package directions to make 24 cupcakes. Bake and let cool 15 minutes in the pan on a rack, then transfer the cupcakes to a rack to cool completely. Hull and chop about 8 strawberries (for about 1 cup chopped). Stir together the chopped strawberries, sugar and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Let stand at room temperature, tossing a few times, until the strawberries are juicy, about 15 minutes.<br> For the remaining 24 strawberries, put a strawberry stem-side down on a cutting board. Make 2 crisscross slices down and almost all the way through the strawberry, stopping just before the stem to keep the stem end intact. Gently pull the 4 sections apart to form a butterfly. Repeat with the remaining strawberries.<br> Make the antennae by cutting 2 thin strips of green taffy, about 1 inch long and 1 millimeter wide each. Roll the taffy strips between your hands to make ropes, and curl up one end of each rope slightly. Repeat, making a pair of antennae for the remaining 23 butterflies.<br> To assemble the cupcakes: Transfer the whipped topping to a pastry bag fitted with a medium open star tip. Core the cupcakes from their tops with a small melon baller, spoon or paring knife. Fill each with some macerated strawberries and pipe a swirl of whipped topping on top to cover. Decorate each cupcake with a strawberry butterfly. Tuck a pair of antennae into the whipped topping behind each strawberry butterfly with the curled ends up and facing outward.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 64787,&quot;Monte Cristo Frittata, Grilled Pineapple Spears with Crystallized Ginger and Pumpernickel Bread with Honey-Rosemary Ricotta 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for drizzling, divided 1/2 pound ham steak, 1/2-inch thick, chopped 1/2 pound sliced, thick-deli-cut or rotisserie turkey breast, chopped 4 scallions, chopped, whites and greens 12 large eggs 1/4 cup milk or half-and-half A few dashes hot sauce Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons butter 4 cups frozen shredded hash brown potatoes 1 medium yellow onion, peeled and grated 1 (8-ounce) block Emmentaler Swiss cheese 1 fresh pineapple, cut into spears 4 to 5 pieces crystallized ginger, grated or very thinly sliced 8 slices pumpernickel bread, with raisins if available 2 cups ricotta cheese 4 to 5 small or 2 to 3 large sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves finely chopped 3 tablespoons honey Instructions: Heat oven to 375 degrees F.

Set eight 4-inch baking rings onto a sheet tray lined with a silicone baking mat. Fill each ring mold with 2 tablespoons of the graham cracker crust and pat firmly to create a crust on the bottom. Pour the cheesecake mixture into the ring molds and fill two-thirds of the way to the top. Place into the oven and bake until no longer jiggly and the center is set, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Place into the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes. Run an offset spatula around the inner edges of the cheesecake to release the cheesecake from the mold. Add the blueberries, water, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, the star anise and the remaining Meyer lemon juice and zest into a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the mixture has thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. For the almond tuile: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the butter, sugar, almonds, flour, vanilla and salt to a small saucepan. Stir until the butter is melted and starts to bubble, then add the heavy cream. Turn off the heat and allow to cool down. Line a sheet tray with a silicone baking mat. Spoon 1-tablespoon mounds onto the baking mat, spaced at least 2 inches apart. Place into the oven and bake until they just begin to turn golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. To remove the tuiles, carefully lift with an offset spatula. For the whipped lemonade: Whip the heavy cream to soft peaks. Add the ice, mint, lemon juice and sweetened condensed milk to a blender. Blend on high until smooth.

Add the egg yolks and mix well. In a medium bowl, stir together the granulated sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt. Add to the butter/egg yolk mixture and mix just until incorporated and the dough starts to come together. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and form into 2 balls. Wrap each ball in plastic wrap and freeze at least 2 hours or overnight, or as long as a month. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove 1 ball of dough from the freezer and coarsely grate the frozen dough into the bottom of a 9 by 12-inch baking pan or a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Make sure the surface is covered evenly with shreds of dough. With a spoon or spatula, spread the jam over the surface, to within 1/2-inch of the edge all the way around. Remove the remaining dough from the freezer and coarsely grate it over the entire surface. Bake until light golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. As soon as the shortbread comes out of the oven, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar.

Remove ham from bag, rinse and drain thoroughly. Place ham, cut side down, in a roasting pan. Using a small paring knife or clean utility knife set to the smallest blade setting, score the ham from bottom to top, spiraling clockwise as you cut. (If you&#39;re using a paring knife, be careful to only cut through the skin and first few layers of fat). Rotate the ham after each cut so that the scores are no more than 2-inches across. Once you&#39;ve made it all the way around, move the knife to the other hand and repeat, spiraling counter clockwise. The aim is to create a diamond pattern all over the ham. (Don&#39;t worry too much about precision here.) Tent the ham with heavy duty foil, insert a thermometer, and cook for 3 to 4 hours or until the internal temperature at the deepest part of the meat registers 130 degrees F. Remove and use tongs to pull away the diamonds of skin and any sheets of fat that come off with them. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Dab dry with paper towels, then brush on a liberal coat of mustard, using either a basting brush or a clean paint brush (clean as in never-touched paint). Sprinkle on brown sugar, packing loosely as you go until the ham is coated. Spritz this layer lightly with bourbon, then loosely pack on as much of the crushed cookies as you can. Insert the thermometer (don&#39;t use the old hole) and return to the oven (uncovered). Cook until interior temperature reaches 140 degrees F, approximately 1 hour. Let the roast rest for 1/2 hour before carving. *Cook&#39;s note: A city ham is basically any brined ham that&#39;s packed in a plastic bag, held in a refrigerated case and marked \ready to cook, \partially cooked\ or \ready to serve.

Choose 4 bowls or shallow small casseroles to serve in and use one of them as a template to cut out 4 pastry pieces the size and shape of your serving dishes. Use a sharp paring knife to work around your dish. Arrange the pastry on a nonstick baking sheet or on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Beat the egg with a splash of water and brush the dough with egg wash. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until deeply golden and puffed. Meanwhile, season the fish with a little salt and pepper. Place the salmon in a small skillet with the wine, just enough to come up to the top of the fillets. Add the bay leaf and lemon slices. Bring the fish to gentle boil, lower the heat, and then simmer for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until opaque. While the fish poaches, in a medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat the extra-virgin olive oil. Add the onion, celery, and potatoes. Season with salt, pepper, and crab boil seasoning. Cover and sweat the vegetables for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat under the salmon. Remove the salmon to a dish and flake it up. Strain the broth and reserve about 1 to 1 1/2 cups. Add the chicken stock, reserved fish stock, and cream to the vegetables. While it comes to a boil, make a roux in small skillet. Melt the butter, and then whisk in the flour. Add the stock and whisk for 1 minute. Stir in the Dijon. Add the roux to the soup and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes to thicken the chowder to the consistency of loose gravy. Add in the peas, flaked salmon, and dill and heat through.

Scrape the condensed milk into an 8-inch baking dish and cover the top tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place the dish inside a roasting pan and fill the pan with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the baking dish. Bake in the oven until the milk turns a deep golden brown, stirring a few times, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Check after 45 minutes and add more water, if needed, to the roasting pan. Remove the dulce from the oven and let cool, covered, about 15 minutes before serving. For the crepes: Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until it turns a nutty brown color. Remove from the heat, whisk in the cinnamon and let cool slightly. Put the flour and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the milk, water and eggs until combined. Add the egg mixture to the flour and whisk until just combined. Whisk in 4 tablespoons of the brown butter and reserve the remaining 2 tablespoons for the crepe pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Mash the remaining 6 tablespoons butter and the vanilla seeds with a mortar and pestle. In a saute pan over medium heat, add the vanilla butter, mangoes and papaya and cook until softened and slightly caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes. Whip the heavy cream, sour cream and vanilla extract in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Cover and keep chilled until ready to use. Heat an 8-inch or 10-inch nonstick pan over medium heat. Brush with some of the remaining brown butter. Add a scant 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan and swirl the pan to cover the bottom with a very thin coating. If there is excess batter, pour it back into the bowl. Cook until the crepe bubbles and the bottom is lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip the crepe over and cook for about 20 seconds. Slide the crepe onto a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter. Put a line of fruit down the center of each crepe. Spread a little of the warm dulce de leche on top of the fruit and fold or roll the sides of the crepe over. Top with a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkle with cinnamon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</li></ul><p>&quot; 64810,&quot;Herb Vinaigrette 1/4 cup white wine or champagne 1 to 3 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper to taste 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons minced herbs, such as tarragon, chives, and/or parsley Instructions: In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper.

Tie a piece of butcher&#39;s twine tautly from one handle to the other across the center of the pot. Bring the water to a boil. Meanwhile, combine the ricotta, Parmesan, nutmeg, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Add the chickpea flour and mix until just combined. The dough should be slightly sticky. Do not add any more flour or overwork the dough, as this will make it tough.<br> Fit a large pastry bag with a large round tip, about 3/4 inch wide. Alternatively, snip one corner of a large resealable plastic bag with scissors to create a 3/4-inch-wide opening. Fill the pastry bag with the gnocchi dough; set aside.<br> Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium-low heat until foamy, 2 to 4 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling the pan often, until the butter is light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the sage and cook until the butter is toasty brown (similar in color to graham cracker crumbs) and the sage is crisp, about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat.<br> Holding the pastry bag over the boiling water, lightly squeeze the bag to release a 3/4- to 1-inch piece of dough, then rub it across the string to \cut\ it off. Continue until you have made about 15 gnocchi. Cook until they float to the top and are warmed through, 60 to 90 seconds. Do not walk away from the pot or overcook them; the lack of gluten in the chickpea flour makes them very tender, and they will fall apart if boiled for too long. Transfer to a serving bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Continue with the remaining gnocchi dough (you will have about 4 servings).<br> Spoon some of the butter and sage mixture over each bowl and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 64844,&quot;Creamy Cranberry Bread Pudding 2 (2 pound) loaves Brioche challah 6 cups half-and-half 6 cups heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 vanilla beans, split lengthwise 18 eggs 3 cups granulated sugar 3 cups cranberries 1/2 cup orange marmalade Confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the crusts off the bread and cut into 1-inch cubes. You should have about 10 1/2 cups of cubes. Arrange on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully to make sure they do not brown too much; set aside to cool. Leave the oven on. In a saucepan, heat the half-and-half, cream, salt, and vanilla bean over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse 10 to 15 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together. Whisking constantly, gradually add the hot cream mixture. Strain into a large bowl to smooth the mixture and remove the vanilla bean. Add the bread cubes, toss well, and let soak until absorbed. Fold the mixture occasionally to ensure even soaking. In a food processor pulse the berries to roughly chop them. Fold them into the soaked bread cubes carefully. Divide half the bread mixture among 20 ramekins, custard cups, or dessert cups, reserving the rest, filling them half way. Place a teaspoon of orange marmalade in each ramekin then top off with the remaining soaked bread mixture. Arrange the puddings in a hot water bath.

Close the rolls and wrap individually or together in aluminum foil, then place directly on the oven rack to warm while preparing the burgers, no longer than 20 minutes. For the burgers: Add the ground chuck, bacon, paprika, salt and a few grinds of pepper to a large bowl. Gently mix with your non-dominant hand, using your fingers like a pitchfork so you don&#39;t squish the meat. Mound the mixture into a ball and divide in half, then divide each half in half again to make 4 even portions. Add a drizzle of olive oil to a griddle pan over high heat. Gently roll each portion of meat into a ball and place on the pan. Using the back of a plate, a flat lid or a spatula (with no holes), press each ball into a flat patty, slightly larger than the rolls. Cook the patties until they easily release from the griddle, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, then top each with a slice of cheese and continue to cook until the patties are cooked through and the cheese is melted, another 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, add the jalape?o to the griddle and char on all sides, then remove and finely chop, removing the seeds if you would like less heat. Build the burgers: Whisk the hot sauce and maple syrup together in a small bowl. Remove the rolls from the oven and unwrap. Put a patty on each roll, then drizzle each with the maple hot sauce.

Rice the potatoes and set aside. Add 1/2 cup cool water to the bowl with the hot cooking water; the temperature of the water should even out to warm (105 to 110 degrees F). If it&#39;s too cold, microwave it a little; if it&#39;s too hot, let it sit for a few minutes to cool. Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the brown sugar, give it a little swirl and let it sit until foamy on top, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, salt and remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Add the mashed potato, yeast mixture and 4 1/2 teaspoons of the barley malt and mix to form a stiff dough. Knead in the stand mixer until smooth and slightly sticky, adding additional flour if the dough is sticking to the bowl or too sticky to handle, about 5 minutes (or turn out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for 7 to 10 minutes). Transfer to a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. When ready to bake, let the dough sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide into 12 or 16 equal parts, depending on whether you want larger or smaller bagels. Stretch each part into a smooth ball, making sure to seal any dough seams well. Shape the bagels by sticking your thumb through the center of each ball and using your fingers to gently stretch a 2-inch hole. Cover the bagels with a towel and let rise for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F; line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and grease them well with cooking spray. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add the baking soda and remaining 3 teaspoons barley malt. Working with 3 or 4 bagels at a time so as not to crowd the pot, boil them for 1 minute on each side (use a timer for this). With a slotted spoon or spatula, lift them out of the water, allowing excess water to drip off, and then transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. (If making 16 bagels, you will likely need to bake a third pan of bagels, which you can do after the first 2 pans come out of the oven.) With a serrated knife, make 3 cuts in a triangular shape on top of the bagels and dust them lightly with flour. Bake the bagels for 10 minutes, then switch racks, rotate the baking sheets 180 degrees and bake until golden brown, 5 to 8 more minutes. Let cool slightly. Set aside 9 of the bagels for making the breakfast sandwiches. Cool the remaining bagels fully, then transfer to plastic bags and freeze (slice them before freezing if you&#39;d like, so you can put them directly from the freezer into the toaster). Reheat in the toaster. For the baked eggs: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with cooking spray and line with parchment paper so that wings come up 1 inch off 2 sides. Sprinkle the hash browns in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the Swiss cheese in an even layer on top of the hash browns. Whisk together the milk, paprika, salt, eggs, some black pepper and a few shakes of hot sauce if using in a medium bowl. Gently pour the egg mixture over the cheese and hash browns. Bake until the eggs are set, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes to allow the eggs to set further. Slice into 9 squares. For the sandwiches: Slice the reserved 9 bagels in half. Sandwich one egg square between each bagel with a slice each of cheese and Canadian bacon. If not eating right away, wrap in parchment paper and freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat in the microwave for 1 minute, flip and heat for an additional 1 to 2 minutes until heated through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 64850,&quot;Corn and Zucchini Fritters 1 1/2 cups corn kernels (about 3 ears) 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 1 cup loosely packed parsley sprigs 3 small zucchini, cut into 3/4inch fine julienne 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons sparkling soda water Vegetable oil for deep frying Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the corn, onion, parsley, and zucchini and toss to mix. Add the flour and toss with your hands, separating all the ingredients to be sure they are all coated evenly with the flour. Add the salt, pepper, and sparkling water and mix all together. The mixture should be airy and light, but not wet; do not over mix. In a large heavy saucepan or deep fryer, heat about 4 inches of vegetable oil to 375 degrees. Gather the batter into loose, very freeform fritters about 3 inches in diameter (when you gather them together, compact just slightly to hold in a mass, but there will still be lots of stray bits of vegetable sticking out and some will fall off and separate from the main clump). Fry them, 2 at a time, until they are golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, turning over halfway through. Stand back and watch out for splattering oil for the first minute or two. With a skimmer or kitchen tongs, gently remove them to paper towels, drain and keep warm in a low oven while you finish cooking the other fritters. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 64851,&quot;Ginger Sweet and Sour Chicken 1 fresh lime 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 red cl pepper, stem and seeds removed and diced 2 large cloves garlic, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade and quartered 1 teaspoon peeled fresh ginger root, diced small 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/4 cup sugar 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 liter canola oil, or enough as needed to deep fry 1 cup rice flour or all-purpose flour (or enough as needed for dredging) Salt and freshly round black pepper 1 pound boneless chicken breasts cut into \chicken-finger-sized strips Instructions: Microwave the lime in a small bowl and set aside until it is just cool enough to handle. In a small bowl, create a slurry by gradually whisking 2 tablespoons water into the cornstarch. Through the feed tube of a running blender add, 1 at a time, the vinegar, cl pepper, garlic, ginger, salt, black pepper, and sugar. Then squeeze the lime from the micro-waved lime through the feed tube into the mixture. Then, leaving the blender running, add the slurry to the sauce, and pour the olive oil in a slow thin stream. Heat the oil in the deep-fryer to 375 degrees F, or as directed by the manufacturer&#39;s instructions for similar foods. Season the flour with salt and pepper and dredge the chicken strips, allowing any excess flour to fall away. Deep-fry the chicken and drain on paper towels. Serve with sweet and sour sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]</p><p>&quot; 64852,&quot;Warmed Blue Cheese and Apricot Crostini with an Arugula Drizzle 3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped 2 tablespoons walnuts 1 cup arugula, washed Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil 1/3 cup apricot jam 1/3 cup blue cheese 1/4 cup walnuts, roughly chopped 8-10 slices of French Baguette 1/4 inches thick I Can&#39;t Believe It&#39;s Not Butter!?

Scrape the bottom white side to remove any scales and remove the sharp fins with scissors. (Or ask your fishmonger to do all of this.) Rinse the fish in cold water. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a 4-quart pot, bring the wine to a simmer with the shallots. Add the mussels or clams, cover, and steam until they open - about 7 minutes for mussels, 12 minutes for clams. Take the mussels or clams out of their shells, discard the shells, and reserve the meats. If the shellfish-steaming liquid is sandy, pour it slowly and carefully into a bowl, leaving the sand behind. Arrange the flatfish- dark skin side up- in a buttered or oiled dish that closely fits it and pour on the shellfish- cooking liquid. There should be enough liquid to come halfway up the sides of the fish. If there isn&#39;t, add some water or fish broth. Place the containers with the fish on the stove over medium heat until the liquid comes to a simmer. Loosely cover with aluminum foil and slide the fish into the oven . Braise for 5 to 12 minutes per inch of thickness. Carefully transfer the fish to individual platters or plates using a large spatula. Keep the fish warm while you&#39;re preparing the sauce. Strain the cooking liquid into a 2- quart saucepan and cook it down over high heat until 1/2 cup remains. Thicken the sauce by whisking in any optional thickeners and bringing it to a quick simmer. Once the sauce is thickened, add the lemon juice and parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Gently reheat the mussels or clams in the sauce - don&#39;t let it boil - and spoon the sauce and the mussels or clams over each fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 64869,&quot;Garlic Aioli 3 garlic cloves, chopped *1 large egg 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 turns freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil Instructions: Combine the garlic, egg, lemon juice, parsley, salt and pepper in a food processor or blender and puree.

Cook the sausage until golden, about 2 minutes. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then toss with the flour in a bowl; add to the skillet and cook until browned but not cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add the onion, peppers, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste and cook 3 minutes. Add the wine, scraping up any browned bits; bring to a boil and cook until slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Add the broth and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook until the sausage and chicken are cooked through, about 5 minutes.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. If either of the sausage meats is coarsely ground, place the meat in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pulse until the meat is finely ground. Heat 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large (12-inch) saut pan, add the onion and cook for 4 to 6 minutes over medium heat, until tender but not browned. Add all the sausage meat and mash with a fork, breaking it up and browning it, for 5 to 7 minutes, until no longer pink. Meanwhile, prep the mushrooms. Without washing the mushrooms, wipe the caps with a slightly damp paper towel or sponge to remove any dirt. Trim the stems, then roughly chop the caps and stems. Add the mushrooms, fennel seeds, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper to the sausage and cook for 10 minutes, until the mushrooms give off their liquid and the liquid evaporates. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the mascarpone and the fresh bread crumbs and season to taste. The seasoning will depend on how highly seasoned the sausage meat is. Melt the remaining 12 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan. Unfold the phyllo dough and keep it covered with a slightly damp (not wet!) kitchen towel. Transfer one sheet of phyllo to a board, brush it lightly with melted butter and sprinkle with a teaspoon of dry bread crumbs. Place a second sheet of phyllo directly on top, brush with butter and sprinkle with dry bread crumbs; repeat until you have 5 sheets piled up. With the long edge of the stack of phyllo facing you, make a 1-inch strip of sausage filling (about 1/3 of the filling) near the bottom edge. Fold up the sides and roll the phyllo firmly up and over, rolling the log away from you. Transfer the log, seam side down, to the prepared sheet pan. Brush with butter and score diagonally at 1-inch intervals. Make two more strudel logs and place them on the sheet pan. Bake the strudels for 20 to 30 minutes, rotating the pan once to cook evenly, until browned. Cool slightly, cut in pieces through the scored lines and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64879,&quot;Pan Roasted Frenched Pork Rib Chop with Five-Spice, Caramelized Onion Chutney and Orange Dusted Merlot Demi 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 large red onion, sliced thin 1/4 cup golden raisins 3 tablespoons sugar 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 cup red wine 1/4 cup beef stock 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Salt and pepper 2 (10-ounce) frenched pork rib chops 1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/4 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/4 cup Merlot 2 tablespoons orange zest 1/3 cup beef stock Roasted root vegetables, to serve Rosemary sprigs, for garnish Instructions: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add the onions, and cook until slightly browned.

Cut each 1/2 rack into 9 chops, yielding 18 chops (3 chops per person). Rub chops with the marinade. Let marinate for 1 hour at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours. Heat a saute pan and pour oil into the pan when it is hot. Saute the lamb chops. For the Hibiscus Glaze: In a non-reactive saucepan combine all ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook for 1/2 hour. Strain. Return liquid to a simmer and reduce until syrupy consistency. For the Soft Polenta: Bring water and salt to a boil. Whisk in the polenta. Heat to a very low simmer and cook for 1/2 hour, stirring occasionally. Add the cheeses, butter, and nutmeg and season as needed with salt and pepper. Take the polenta off the heat, wrap well with plastic wrap, and store it in a warm place. The polenta will hold its heat for quite a while. For the Sauteed Mushrooms: Clean the mushrooms as needed. Some can be brushed off, while others may have to be quickly rinsed in water and well drained. Never soak mushrooms, as they will absorb too much water and become soggy when cooked. Cook each variety of mushroom individually because they all cook at different rates. Heat a saute pan 2 for minutes over a medium flame. When it is hot, add 1/3 of the vegetable oil. Add the mushrooms and saute until they begin to brown. Add 1/3 of the shallots and 1/3 of the butter. Keep the mushrooms moving in the pan until they are just tender. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

On the stovetop, bring the chicken stock, onion, garlic and wine to a simmer in a saucepan. Place the peppers in a roasting pan and roast in the oven, checking every 15 minutes, and turning them with tongs until the skin is fully wrinkled and charred black. When the peppers are done, use tongs to put them in a resealable bag which (for safety reasons) you have resting on a plate - (remember, they&#39;re volcanically hot!). Carefully close the bag shut, and allow them to sweat for 5 minutes. Use oven mitts to prevent getting burned while you handle the bag in the next step of sliding the peppers from the bag into a bowl filled with a couple of inches of ice water. You can then use your fingers to work quickly to slip off and discard the skins of the peppers while they are in the water. You will be left with beautifully cooked red peppers with a wonderful color. Chop the peppers and add them to the simmering chicken stock mixture, and continue simmering until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Create a slurry of cornstarch in a small amount of water and add to the red pepper sauce. Process coulis in a blender until a smooth consistency is achieved. Then season with salt and pepper, to taste. For the grits: Bring the water for the grits to a boil. Add grits and chopped shrimp, reduce heat and cook until grits are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in scallions, tomatoes, cilantro, bacon and cheese, and keep covered in a warm place.; For the fish: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat both sides of red snapper with salt and pepper and Cajun spice. Then on the stovetop, heat some grapeseed oil in a large non-stick saute pan, and when it begins to shimmer, saute the shrimp only until they turn pink, and then remove shrimp to a utility platter. In the same pan, sear each side of the fish. (When you place the fillet into the pan, leave it undisturbed for a couple of minutes to allow the seasoning to cook into the surface of the fish.) Cook until golden brown, then finish in the oven for a further 2 to 3 minutes and remove it to rest for 5 to 8 minutes. (Please take care to avoid overcooking the fish, as it will continue to cook even after you remove it from the oven.) Place some of the grits in the middle of serving plate, then position a fish fillet on top, and drizzle the coulis around the fish. Top with a shrimp. Garnish liberally with the scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 64907,&quot;Coconut Syrup 1 (14.5-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 3/4 cup packed brown sugar Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a small heavy saucepan.

Coconut syrup can be stored in the refrigerator 2 weeks and reheated. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 64908,&quot;Shaker Fresh Cranberry Bean Chowder 2 pounds fresh cranberry beans (shell beans) in the pod 4-ounce slab (unsliced) bacon, rind removed and cut into 1/3-inch dice 1 clove garlic, finely chopped (1 teaspoon) 1 large onion (12 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 to 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed and chopped (1 teaspoon) 1 dried bay leaf 5 cups chicken stock, chicken broth, or water 1 pound ripe tomatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice, with their juice, or 1 1/2 cups diced (1/2-inch) canned tomatoes with their juices 2 tablespoons dark molasses Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish Instructions: Shuck the beans and discard any that are soft or blemished. You should have about 3 cups. Heat a 3 to 4-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the diced bacon. Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the bacon is crisp and golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the onion, thyme, and bay leaf and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 8 minutes, until the onion is tender but not browned. Add the beans and stock. Partially cover the pot and bring to a simmer. Cook the beans at a steady simmer over medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes, until they are tender. Reduce the heat to low. Remove 2 cups of the chowder from the pot and puree in a food mill held over the pot so it falls directly back into the chowder, or puree in a food processor and return to the chowder. Add the tomatoes and their juices, along with the molasses, and let the chowder simmer slowly for another 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely. Otherwise, let it sit at room temperature for up to an hour, allowing the flavors to meld. When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat, stirring occasionally so it doesn&#39;t stick. Ladle the chowder into cups and sprinkle with the slice scallions. Variation Dried Bean Chowder: Substitute 8 ounces dried shell beans, limas, or other white bean for the fresh shell beans. Soak them overnight in enough water to cover generously; drain. Depending on the bean you choose, the cooking time may be doubled or even longer. Follow the recipe and simmer until the beans are tender, adding water as necessary (about 1 cup) to compensate for the evaporation during the longer cooking time. Variation Cider and Bean Chowder: This idea also comes from the Shakers, who used sweet apple cider as the liquid in several of their soups. It adds a new dimension to the sweet-and-sour flavor of this chowder. Cider is pressed from late August through November, so you can try this in either the fresh or dried bean versions. Substitute 3 cups apple cider for 3 cups of the chicken stock (you will still use 2 cups of chicken stock). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64909,&quot;Dak Gui (Grilled Chicken in a Soy Chili Sauce) 1 1/3 pounds chicken breast cut into pieces 2 inches long a 2 inches wide 8 to 10 romaine lettuce leaves 2 cups cooked white rice Miso Paste, recipe follows 1/2 cup grated daikon 2 tablespoons soy sauce 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon corn syrup 3 tablespoons chili paste 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 3 tablespoons scallions, cut on the bias 1 teaspoon pepper 1/2 teaspoon ginger juice 1/2 cup Japanese light miso 1/2 cup Korean dark miso 1/4 cup red chili paste 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 tablespoon sugar Instructions: Mix all the marinade ingredients together until they are well combined.

In a mortar with a pestle grind garlic, peppercorns, rosemary and salt with a pestle until a well blended poultice. Trim excess fat from lamb. Rub olive oil onto the leg of lamb. Scoop out the poultice from the mortar and pack it completely around the leg of lamb. Make sure the leg is \sealed\ with the poultice to keep in the flavor. Place the lamb into a roasting pan and pour in 1 or 2 cans (depending on size of roasting pan) ripe pitted olives in their juice. The lamb should be swimming in about 1-inch of juice. Put roasting pan in the oven and roast for 45 to 1 hour, depending on size and density of lamb. The lamb must not be over-cooked. Serve it pink. For the Stuffed Grape Leaves: Add to the cooked and cooled white rice the parsley, white onions, lemon juice and olive oil and then blend. After blending these ingredients estimate adding a large tablespoon for each leaf. Lay the de-stemmed and rinsed grape leaf shiny side down, place portion of rice mixture in the center near the stem end and roll keeping stuffing close to end of leaf. Start folding in the sides and continue to roll keeping ends closed and stuffing secure inside. Lay \stem\ down (the end of the roll) in a flat pan and continue doing so until each one is side by side close together, keeping them from opening when cooking. You can often place at least 2 layers if making large amounts, but more layering is not recommended. Pour over leaves enough water to reach top layer only and bring to a boil and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. Add more water only, if necessary, so as not to burn the leaves. Water should all be evaporated in this period of time if not, drain remaining water. Remove from burner and let cool for about 1/2 hour. Then transfer in single layers into flat pans and pour over a mixture of lemon and olive oil and place in refrigerator cool and marinate overnight or at least several hours before serving. Can be stored for at least 2 to 3 days in refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 64917,&quot;Salt Lick Brisket 8 to 10 pound grain-fed beef brisket (recommended: Angus beef) 3 tablespoons dry rub (recommended: Salt Lick dry rub) Barbecue sauce (recommended: Salt Lick BBQ sauce) Instructions: Dry brisket with a clean cloth. Evenly spread the dry rub over the entire outside of the brisket. Rub in lightly and dust off any excess. Start a fire in your grill using oak, other hard woods, or oak charcoal. Do not use mesquite in any form. Once the fire has reached the stage where you can hold your hand about 1-inch over the grill to a count of 4, place the brisket fat side down above the coals. Leave for 5 to 10 minutes or until caramelization begins. Turn brisket over and repeat process. Remove from fire. The purpose of this procedure is to set the spices into the meat so that they will not wash off during the cooking process. Place the brisket on an open grill away from the coals and maintain a temperature to where you can hold your hand over it to a count of 12 or place in a closed smoker away from the coals at a temperature of 210 degrees F. Cook for 14 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. During the cooking process, turn and baste the brisket with Salt Lick BBQ sauce often (at least 4 times). If not using Salt Lick BBQ sauce, make sure your sauce has no tomatoes in it, as they will burn and leave a bitter taste. When turning the brisket, try not to use a barbecue fork. If you do, only insert it at the edges. Poking the center will cause the juices to run out and make the brisket dry. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 64918,&quot;Orange Sugar Cookie Sandwiches with Chocolate Rum Ganache 10 1/2 ounces sugar, plus more for sprinkling 8 ounces butter, at room temperature 2 eggs<br> Zest of 1 orange 12 ounces all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 2 teaspoons salt 6 ounces dark chocolate 6 ounces heavy cream<br> Dark rum Instructions: For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Place the dried mushrooms, and stock in small pot over medium-high heat. Bring to low boil then reduce heat to low and reconstitute. Heat a thin layer of olive oil, a couple of turns of the pan, in a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid or a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken pieces dry, and season liberally with salt and pepper. To avoid crowding the pan, brown 1/2 the chicken at a time, skin-side down, for 5 minutes, then turn the chicken and brown 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove the browned chicken to a plate and add to the pan the sliced fresh mushrooms, browning the mushrooms for 10 to 15 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaves, salt, and pepper and stir 10 minutes more to soften. Deglaze the pot with the Marsala. Add the chicken pieces back to the pot and arrange the vegetables and mushrooms on top. Remove the porcinis from the small pot, roughly chop, and add to chicken. Pour the porcini stock over the chicken, reserving the last couple of spoonfuls, as this is where any grit may have settled. Cover and braise at a low simmer for 30 minutes over low heat. Cool and store for a make-ahead meal. Reheat over a medium flame, or in a preheated 325 degree F oven, and heat through 20 to 30 minutes. Serve with quick-cooking polenta or crusty bread, and garnish with chopped celery tops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 64939,&quot;Goat Lukhmi with Mango Mint Chutney 2 cloves garlic One 1-inch piece ginger, peeled<br> 8 ounces minced goat meat<br> 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped<br> 2 tablespoons shan seekh kebab masala<br> 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder<br> 1 red onion, chopped<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for deep-frying<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 2 cups packed fresh cilantro sprigs, plus leaves for garnish 1 cup packed fresh mint leaves, plus more for garnish<br> 1 mango, peeled and roughly chopped (you can use frozen mango, thawed), plus some minced for garnish<br> One 1-inch piece ginger, peeled<br> 1 serrano cl, trimmed and seeded<br> 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste<br> 10 to 12 sheets phyllo pastry (extra just in case some pieces tear) 1/2 cup melted ghee<br> 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the filling: Add the garlic and ginger to a mortar and pestle and grind until a paste forms.

Blitz until the scallions are chopped finely, scraping down the sides as needed. Add the eggs and blitz again. Pour everything into a large bowl and add the milk. Gradually whisk in the flour to make a thick, tight batter. Add more flour by the spoonful until the proper texture is met (this should feel like it won&#39;t drip through a colander, but can be pressed through and remain stringy, not doughy). Fill a double boiler halfway with water and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and place a colander over the pot. Add a heaping cup of spaetzle batter at a time to the colander and, with a rubber or wooden spatula, press the batter through the holes into the boiling water. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the colander between pressings and stir the spaetzle into the water so the next group of batter doesn&#39;t stick to the one before it. The spaetzle is cooked when it floats to the top. Remove with a fine-mesh sieve and jiggle to remove as much water as possible. For the pan: You may need to do this in 2 batches; if so, only add half the ingredients each time. In a large pan on medium-high heat, add the butter and oil. Add the spaetzle and saute until it builds a golden crust, then toss and cook until it&#39;s mostly golden all over but still tender, 2 to 4 minutes total. Add the chopped scallions, lemon juice and a few grinds of black pepper and toss.

Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thick (a meat mallet or wooden spoon works well). Pat the chicken dry and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper on both sides. Sprinkle the goat cheese lengthwise on one half of each breast; then sprinkle with dill, orange zest and more salt and pepper. Fold in the short ends--like folding a burrito--then, starting on the half with cheese, roll up into a tight cylinder. Close the seams with toothpicks. Whisk the eggs in a wide, shallow dish. In a separate dish, combine the breadcrumbs and ground pecans. Sprinkle the stuffed chicken with salt and pepper. Dip in the egg mixture and then in the breadcrumb mixture; shake off excess breading. Place the breaded chicken on a wire rack set over a baking sheet and spray with coconut oil. Bake to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes.

Add the rice wine vinegar, cilantro, garlic, ginger, water, oil, mustard, and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and set aside. Bring chicken stock to a simmer. In a separate large saucepan on an adjacent burner, heat the olive oil and add the shallots and the rice. Lightly saute: you actually are toasting the rice. Cook until the rice becomes translucent and the shallots become soft, stirring constantly. Add the white wine to deglaze the pan. Begin slowly adding the warm stock, 1 ladle-full at a time, to the rice pan, stirring as you go. This will bring out the starch in the rice and make the mixture creamy. As the mixture absorbs the broth, ladle more into the pot. When the first ladle of stock has been absorbed into the rice, add the pinch of saffron. When all of the stock has been ladled into the rice pot, slowly simmer until the rice is soft and creamy. Stir the butter into the risotto for more flavor and creaminess. Set aside, keeping warm until needed. Heat a saute pan for the fish. Rub fish fillets with oil, salt and pepper. Place in pan, skin side facing up. Turn the fish over after 3 to 4 minutes. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes or until done. Do not overcook the fish. It is done when the flesh springs back. Remove the fish to a utility platter. Place a mound of risotto on each plate. Top with mahi-mahi. Drizzle some mango sauce around the plate and top with chopped scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 64968,&quot;Blazin&#39; Buttermilk Wings 1 quart buttermilk 2 packets (1.06 ounces each) buffalo wing seasoning, McCormick? 1/4 cup hot pepper sauce, Tabasco? 4 pounds chicken wings Blue cheese dressing, for dipping, Bob&#39;s Big Boy?

Or perhaps this is not the best thing to say here, given the likelihood of this lusciously over-the-top piece of chocolate excess inducing just such an outcome. I wouldn&#39;t want to make this very often, so impossible is it to walk away from with any conviction. I fear it is the kitchen equivalent to crack cocaine. Still, as the French say \Everything in moderation, even moderation.\ This is gloriously intemperate, riotously vulgar. I love it. The key is the blaring balance between sweet and salty: it&#39;s like several klaxons going off in your head as you eat. And it&#39;s strange that while I would normally eschew an all-milk chocolate offering, I prefer it here to the bittersweet-and-milk mixed version. Not that either is bad, and since the jury is matched on this, I feel it only right to alert you to either option. For what it&#39;s worth, I like the darker version in the round pan and cut into panforte-type skinny wedges, and my preferred milk chocolate version set in a rectangular pan and cut into chunky, squat slabs (rather as I feel and look like after eating too many of them). Line your springform pan with aluminum foil or use a foil pan. Break up or chop the chocolate into pieces, and drop into a heavy-based saucepan. Add the butter and syrup, put on a low heat, and melt gently together. Tip the peanuts into a bowl, and crush the honeycomb candy with your hands, letting the golden-glinting rubble fall into the nuts. Take the melted chocolate mixture off the heat and stir in the peanuts and crushed honeycomb candy, then tip straight into the springform pan or foil pan. Smooth the top of the mixture as much as you can, pressing down with a silicon spatula or vinyl-disposable-gloved hand. Put into the refrigerator for about 4 hours, and once set, cut into slices as desired. Make Ahead Note: The bars can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer slices to airtight container, layered with parchment paper, and store in refrigerator. Keeps for 3 to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64971,&quot;Muffaletta Salad 1 cup mixed cracked good quality olives, coarsely chopped 2 cups giardiniera salad (pickled cauliflower, hot peppers and carrots), drained 5 to 6 ribs celery from the heart, chopped 1/4 cup soft sun-dried tomatoes, chopped 1 fresh green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 1/2 red onion, chopped 1/2 pound stick salami, diced 1/2 pound thick cut ham, chopped 1/2 pound provolone, chopped 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it Salt and pepper Instructions: Combine olives, giardiniera, celery, sun-dried tomatoes, pepper, onion, salami, ham, and provolone.

Then add the powdered sugar and mix until completely lump-free, 3 to 4 minutes. In a separate bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Whisk until combined. In yet another bowl, combine the honey and milk, and whisk until the honey is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add half of the flour mixture to the creamed butter and sugar; mix for 1 minute. Then add half of the milk-honey mixture; mix until combined and smooth. Repeat with the remaining flour and milk-honey mixtures; the dough will be crumbly. Take the dough out of the mixer bowl and knead to form a ball. Place the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper and roll out to approximately 1/4-inch thick. Place on a cookie sheet and refrigerate for 24 hours to firm the butter. Remove the chilled dough to a work surface dusted with sifted powdered sugar; roll to slightly thinner than 1/4 inch. Using 3-inch cookie cutter (shape of your choice), cut out cookies and place them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. With a fork, dock 4 to 7 sets of holes in each cookie, being careful not to poke all the way through. Return the cookies to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees for convection). Bake the cookies for 14 to 20 minutes, rotating the cookie sheet halfway through.

Cut off the stalks and fronds from the fennel bulbs if still attached. Shave the fennel lengthwise like the carrots. Put the carrots and fennel in a bowl and toss with the olive oil, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Let stand for 20 minutes to soften. Add the red onion. Gently mix in watercress and tangerines. Season with salt and pepper, toss well, taste, and add more vinegar if needed. Serve immediately. Michael&#39;s Notes: If your tangerines are small, you can leave the sections intact. If the tangerines are large, or if you want to use oranges, you should remove each citrus section from its membrane. To do so, cut a slice off both ends of each fruit so it will stand upright. Stand each fruit on a cutting surface and, using a sharp knife, remove all the peel and white pith by slicing from top to bottom all the way around the fruit, following its contours. Cut the sections away from their membranes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 64978,&quot;Arugula, Apple, and Radish Salad with Cider Vinaigrette 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 shallot, minced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 bunches arugula, thick stems removed, rinsed and dried 1/2 pound radishes, thinly sliced on mandoline 1 red apple, peeled, cored and finely diced Instructions: Whisk together vinegar, olive oil, shallot, salt and pepper.
