Spoon the stuffing loosely into the main cavity of the goose (if there&#39;s extra, you can cook it in a buttered ovenproof dish). Rub the butter all over the goose, then season it with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the salt. Tuck the wing tips under the goose, and tie the legs together. Pour the olive oil into a roasting pan and place the goose in it, breast side up. Roast in the top third of the preheated oven until the goose begins to turn brown, about 30 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 325 degrees, pour the white wine over the goose, and cover it loosely with foil. Continue roasting, adding the stock when the wine has evaporated, and basting every 20 minutes, for 2 hours, or until an instant-read thermometer placed in the thickest part of the thigh registers 180 degrees. Transfer the goose to a carving board with channels to hold the juice, cover it again with foil, and let it rest for a good 20 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 58719,&quot;Swiss Vegetable Casserole 1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell&#39;s? Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free) 1/3 cup sour cream 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 bag (16 ounces) frozen vegetable combination (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots), thawed 1 can (2.8 ounces) French fried onions (1 1/3 cups) 1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Stir the soup, sour cream, black pepper, vegetables, 2/3 cup onions and 1/4 cup cheese in a 2-quart casserole. Cover the casserole. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 40 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Stir the vegetable mixture. Top with the remaining onions and cheese. Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58720,&quot;Caramel Apple Cake 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon allspice 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1 1/2 cups brown sugar 2 cups unsweetened applesauce 1 cup vegetable oil 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 60 caramel candies 2 tablespoons water 3/4 cup walnuts, toasted and finely chopped Waxed paper 1 large craft stick Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour 2 (1 1/2-quart) oven-safe bowls. Combine the first 6 ingredients in a large bowl mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, beat together the remaining cake ingredients, then add this mixture to the dry ingredients, and beat until well mixed. Pour the batter into the prepared bowls and bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the bowls for 10 minutes, then remove them from the bowls, and set them inverted on wire racks to cool completely. Once they have cooled, turn over the cakes and use a long knife to even the tops. To make the topping, place the caramel candies and water in a medium bowl and microwave on high power for 1 minute. Stir, then heat 30 to 45 seconds more until the mixture is smooth and forms a slow, thick ribbon when dropped from a spoon. Layer the cakes (flat sides together), using a few spoonfuls of the caramel to help hold them in place. Pour the remaining sauce over the cake. The caramel will run down the sides of the cake to cover it completely, or you can spread it with a knife while it&#39;s still warm. Let the caramel set for about 20 minutes before pressing the walnuts onto the bottom half of the craft stick with waxed paper and insert the covered end into the top of the cake. Refrigerate or serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 58721,&quot;Shrimp Terrine with Cucumber, Whipped Grapefruit, and Avocado Puree 1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp 3.6 grams activa RM 2 teaspoon chopped chervil Salt Cayenne pepper, to taste<br> 260 grams grapefruit juice (2 large grapefruits) 10 grams agave nectar 4 grams versa whip 600k .65 grams xanthan gum 1 ripe avocado 1 teaspoon glucose 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Salt 1 English cucumber Salt 1 tablespoon citron vinegar Agave nectar, to taste Shaved jalapeno Micro flowers Cilantro leaves Wild char roe Micro amaranth Instructions: Dice the shrimp and toss with activa, chervil, salt and cayenne to distribute evenly.

Crush the garlic clove and add it to the vinegar, along with 1/2 teaspoon salt. After 10 minutes or so, whisk in the olive oil and a little freshly milled pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Make the vinaigrette no more than a couple of hours before serving. Pick over the salad greens, discarding any tough outer leaves, or any that are wilted or blemished. (If you are using young head lettuces, trim the root ends with a sharp paring knife to free the leaves.) Fill a large basin with cold water and gently submerge the greens, allowing sand and grit to sink to the bottom. Lift the lettuces from the water and drain them in a colander, then dry them in a salad spinner. Wrap the leaves in clean cotton toweling and refrigerater in an airtight container. To serve, put the greens in a wide salad bowl and season with a small pinch of salt. Remove the garlic clove, whisk the vinaigrette, toss the greens lightly with just enough dressing to make the leaves glisten. (Your hands make the best salad-tossing tools.) Serve immediately with garlic toast or croutons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58723,&quot;Ahi Tuna Tartar with Wasabi Caviar and Spicy Ginger Vinaigrette 1 pound sashimi grade Ahi tuna, finely diced 1/4 cup Sake and Sesame Marinade, recipe follows 1/4 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted lightly 1/4 teaspoon black sesame seeds 1 avocado 1/2 cup diced pineapple 1/4 cup sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic 1/2 teaspoon chopped shallot 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped ginger 1 cup sake (rice wine) 1/2 cup rice vinegar, unseasoned 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/3 cup brown sugar, or to taste Cornstarch slurry (3 tablespoons cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water, blended), to thicken Instructions: Place tuna, marinade and sesame seeds in mixing bowl.

Butter and flour two 9-inch-round cake pans or 20 muffin tins. Place the dates in large saucepan with 3 1/2 cups cold water. Bring to boil, stirring a little to break up the dates. Then leave to simmer for 1 minute before removing from the heat. Stir in the baking soda (which will cause the mixture to bubble up). Cream the butter and sugar together in a food mixer until pale and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, occasionally scraping down mixing bowl. Add the vanilla extract and then the flour and salt and mix briefly to give a lumpy dough. Next, add the warm date mixture in two batches. Scrape down the sides of bowl in between mixing. The dough will now be quite watery but don&#39;t worry! Finally add the baking powder (this will bubble up also). Pour the batter evenly into the two pans or muffin tins. Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes for cake pans and about 20 minutes for muffin tins. Test if they are cooked with a small knife or toothpick, it should come out clean when cakes are done. Meanwhile, to make the sauce, combine the butter, brown sugar, heavy cream and vanilla extract in a medium saucepan. Bring to boil and then reduce to simmer gently for a minute or two until thickened and well blended. When the cakes are done, poke little holes all over with toothpick, this will enable the sauce to be absorbed more easily. Pour the caramel sauce over cakes while both are still warm and leave to soak for about 10 minutes. Turn the cakes out upside-down onto serving plates (the bottom is the most sticky bit!). Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 58730,&quot;Leftover Easter Candy Crispy Treats 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the pan One 10-ounce bag mini marshmallows 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Kosher salt 6 cups crispy rice cereal, such as Rice Krispies 1 cup chopped sugar-coated marshmallow chicks, such as Peeps (about 8) 1 cup candy-coated mini chocolate eggs or other candy-coated chocolates 1/3 cup chopped chocolate bunnies (about one 1.5 ounce hollow bunny) Instructions: Line an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with a sheet of foil large enough to leave a 2-inch overhang on all sides.

Put a medium mixing bowl in the refrigerator to chill. Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in a saucepan; put the chocolate and butter in a medium heat-proof bowl and set it over the pan, making sure that it doesn&#39;t touch the water. Stir with a wooden spoon until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly. Then whisk the egg yolks into the chocolate one at a time, beating until smooth after each addition. Set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. In the chilled mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream until it begins to thicken up. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and the vanilla, and continue beating until the cream holds soft peaks. Now combine the three mixtures: Stir a spoonful of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it; then fold in the rest. Fold in the whipped cream, taking care not to overwork the mousse.

Add the cheese, parsley and garlic to a small bowl and toss. Divide evenly over each cutlet. Roll up each cutlet and tie with butcher&#39;s twine to secure and to make a roll. Sprinkle each roll with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the beef rolls and the cubed beef and brown on all sides. Remove to a plate once browned. Add a touch more olive oil to the pan and add the carrots and onions and saute until tender. Add the wine and simmer for a minute or so, and then scrape up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Stir in the passata and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, add the beef back into the pot and cover with a lid. Cook on low until thick and the meat begins to fall apart, flipping the rolls occasionally, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

Add the ground lamb to a large bowl and break up slightly with a fork. Add the spice mixture to the lamb and using clean hands, mix the meat so the spice mixture is evenly dispersed. Form the meat into 4 equal size patties to fit the size of the buns. Brush the grates of an outdoor grill with oil and preheat to medium-high. On one side of the grill add the burgers and cook until the internal temperature is 145 degrees F, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the burgers to a plate. Once you remove the burgers, place the buns, cut side- down on the grill to lightly toast, about 2 minutes. To assemble burgers: Lay buns on a clean work surface, cut side-up. Spread the Tzatziki Sauce evenly on the top and bottom halves of the buns. Place a patty on each of the bottom buns and top with Charred Tomatoes and Feta. Place the top buns on and serve. Grate the cucumber on the large holes of a box grater. Using clean hands, squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the cucumber. Add it to a small bowl and stir in the sour cream, dill, lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Add the tomatoes to a large bowl and place the onions on top. Add the olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt and, using clean hands, rub the onions so they are coated in olive oil, but try to keep them intact in their rings. Lay the onions on a plate or rimmed baking sheet. The residual salt and oil will have dripped down to the tomatoes, so give them a slight toss to coat them. Skewer the tomatoes on a metal or wood skewer. This will help them not fall through the grates of the grill. (If using a wood skewer then be sure to soak in water for 30 minutes before using.) Brush the grates of an outdoor grill with oil and preheat to medium-high. Add the onions and tomatoes and grill until the onions are charred in places and the tomatoes are slightly bursting, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the onions and tomatoes and add to a medium bowl. Using kitchen shears, roughly cut up the onions and tomatoes. Add the crumbled feta and toss to combine. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 58738,&quot;Brie, Bacon and Cayenne Pear Bite 1 pear 4 ounces Brie<br> 1/4 cup crumbled cooked bacon Cayenne, for sprinkling Instructions: Cut the pear into 1/2-inch-thick slices and top with the Brie, bacon and a sprinkle of cayenne. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58739,&quot;Mudslide Pie 1/3 cup coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua 1/3 cup Irish cream liqueur, such as Baileys Irish Cream 1/3 cup vodka Nonstick cooking spray, for coating the pie plate 2 tablespoons chocolate-covered espresso beans (about 16 beans) 2 tablespoons sugar 20 chocolate wafer cookies 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 cup prepared hot fudge sauce 2 pints coffee ice cream 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 cup heavy cream Instructions: For the mudslide cocktail blend: Whisk together the coffee liqueur, Irish cream liqueur and vodka. Set aside. For the chocolate cookie crumb crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9-inch pie plate generously with cooking spray. Pulse the espresso beans and sugar in a food processor until finely ground. Add the chocolate wafers and pulse until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse until the crumbs are moist. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pie plate. Bake until set, about 8 minutes (if the crust puffs up at all, it can be pushed down with the back of a spoon). Let the crust cool completely on a wire rack. For the mudslide fudge and filling: Warm the fudge sauce in the microwave on high until pourable, about 1 minute. Whisk in 3 tablespoons of the mudslide cocktail blend; set aside. Set the ice cream out at room temperature for 5 minutes. Quarter the ice cream pints with a large serrated knife, peel off the packaging and place the ice cream in a blender. Add 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the mudslide cocktail blend and process until it forms a very thick milkshake. Immediately pour it over the cooled crust and transfer the pie to the freezer for 15 minutes. Cover the top of the pie with the mudslide fudge using an offset spatula. Cover the pie with plastic, return it to the freezer and freeze until set, at least 6 hours or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Blot the roast dry. Crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle (or in a spice-devoted coffee grinder) to a medium-coarse texture. (Some will be finely ground, but you want the larger pieces to resemble cracked pepper.) Rub the pepper into the meat, saving what doesn&#39;t stick for the marinade. Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat, and add the butter and garlic. Cook until the butter bubbles; add the vinegar, thyme and remaining black pepper, and remove from the heat. Sprinkle the pork with 1 teaspoon salt. Heat an ovenproof skillet large enough to fit the pork roast over high heat and add the oil. Brown the meat quickly on all sides. Brush the meat generously with some of the pepper mixture, put the skillet in the oven and roast for 10 minutes. Remove the skillet, roll the roast to another side and baste it with more of the pepper mixture. Continue to roast the meat, removing it from the oven every 10 minutes or so to flip and mop, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the roast reads 145 degrees F, about 50 minutes total. Transfer the meat to a platter and let it rest for at least 10 minutes, rolling the pork around to sop up its exuded juices. Refrigerate the pork until using. (The pork could also be sliced and served hot at this point.) For the doctored aioli: Stir together the mayonnaise, olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and lemon zest and juice in a medium bowl. Refrigerate until using. Heat a grill over high heat. Generously oil a baking sheet. Divide the flatbread into eight portions on the baking sheet. Press the dough into thin rounds, about 8 inches in diameter. Grill the breads over medium-high heat, closing the lid right after putting them on and flipping and turning to avoid any flare-ups. Each flatbread will take about 2 minutes to cook. Slice the pork very thinly. Spread some aioli across the flatbreads and pile some pork on one side of each. Top with shaved Parmesan and a handful of arugula. Fold the sandwiches in half and pile them on a platter for serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 58747,&quot;Gluten-Free Sugar Cookies 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 large egg<br> One 5.1-ounce package instant vanilla pudding mix (about 3/4 cup)<br> 3/4 cup rice flour<br> 1/4 cup coconut flour<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Colored sanding sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, or confectioners&#39; sugar, for coating, optional<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Slowly add in the water, a little at a time, using a fork to blend until the mixture forms into dough. Knead the dough until all the lumps are gone about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest about 1 hour. Meanwhile, melt the lard in a Dutch oven over high heat. When it just begins to smoke, drop a small piece of dough into the oil. If it quickly rises to the top, the oil is hot enough to begin frying. Take a piece of dough and roll it into a golf ball-sized ball. Stretch the dough into a disk-like shape as you would a pizza dough. When you have a piece ready to go, carefully place the dough into the oil and let it brown on 1 side about 1 1/2 minutes and then turn it over to brown the other side for another 1 1/2 minutes. Remove the fry bread from the oil and let it drain on paper towels until cool. Enjoy fry bread by sprinkling it with chili, honey, or powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 58750,&quot;Naan Bread 2 teaspoons salt 8 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 2 tablespoons sugar 1 cup whole milk 2 eggs 8 tablespoons grapeseed oil, divided Cold water, if needed Instructions: Sift the salt, flour and baking powder into a large bowl. In another bowl, mix the sugar, milk, eggs and half of the oil together. Pour the milk mixture into the center of the flour mixture and knead together. If it&#39;s a little dry add a little cold water. The dough should be soft and pliable. Add the remaining oil and knead again, then cover for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes knead the dough once again. Cover and set aside for 2 to 3 hours. About half an hour before the naan is needed, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F and put a lightly greased pizza stone into the oven. Divide the dough into balls and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Then shape them into flattened ovals and put on top of the baking stone. Bake the dough until puffed and is cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes depending on thickness. Remove from the stone to a serving platter and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 58751,&quot;Best Old-Fashioned Mashed Potatoes for a Crowd 4 pounds russet potatoes, scrubbed Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, diced Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with cold water by about 1 inch and add 2 tablespoons salt. Bring to a boil, uncovered, over high heat, and then reduce the heat to medium-high and simmer briskly until fork tender, about 45 minutes. Drain the potatoes, reserving 1/2 cup of the water. Quarter the potatoes and pass them through a food mill or ricer back into the pan. (Peel them first if you are using a ricer). When the potatoes are almost done, heat the buttermilk in a small saucepan over medium-high heat to just under a simmer. Set aside; it will separate and look curdled but don&#39;t worry, it will mix in fine. Fold the buttermilk and reserved cooking water into the potatoes over low heat. Then fold in the butter a handful of pieces at a time until fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.

Heat the broth in a medium saucepan until simmering. Melt the butter in an oven-safe braiser (or large cast-iron skillet with a lid or 4-quart saute pan with a lid) over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and mushrooms, tossing to coat in the butter, and cook, stirring once or twice, until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sherry, allowing the pan to deglaze. Add the rice and allow it to toast and soak in the flavors of the pan. Add about 4 cups of the hot broth to the pan. Add the thyme and bay leaf. Cover the braiser and place it in the oven to bake until the rice is almost cooked, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together the coriander, salt and pepper. Brush the chicken with the olive oil, then dust all over with the seasoning. Set aside. Fluff the rice with a fork and check on doneness. It should still have some chew with some grains just starting to pop open. Stir in the cranberries. Add the remaining hot broth to keep the dish brothy. Add the chicken breasts to the braiser, laying them at an angle so that most of the chicken is submerged in the rice. Shingle the lemon slices in between the chicken breasts. Cover and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook until the chicken registers an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about another 10 minutes. Top with the parsley or thyme before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58753,&quot;Michele Albano&#39;s Maple Pumpkin Pie with Pecan Streusel 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening, very cold 1 to 2 tablespoons heavy cream, for brushing 3/4 cup pecans, toasted and chopped 1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced, cold 2 cups pumpkin puree, preferably fresh 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/3 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/4 cups heavy cream 1 cup Grade B maple syrup 3 large eggs, beaten Maple Whipped Cream (recipe follows), for serving 2 cups heavy cream 1/3 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup Grade B maple syrup, or to taste Instructions: To make the crust, combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl and mix well. Break up the shortening and toss it with the flour mixture to coat. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, mix the ingredients together until the dough forms coarse crumbs. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons ice-cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough easily forms a ball that can hold itself together. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and as long as overnight. While the dough is resting, make the streusel: Toss the pecans with the brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Add the butter, and using a pastry blender or your fingertips, work in until you have small clumps. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Sprinkle flour generously over a hard surface and roll the dough out with a rolling pin until it forms an 11-inch round. Fold the round in half, place it in a 9-inch pie plate, and then unfold the dough to completely cover the pie plate with a bit of an overhang. Tuck the overhang under to make a double-thick rim, and then use your fingers to crimp the edges of the pie shell. Brush the heavy cream over the crimped edges, and refrigerate until the filling is complete. To make the filling, mix the pumpkin, flour, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt together with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, scraping the sides of the bowl well. Add the heavy cream and maple syrup, scraping the bowl several times while mixing. Mix in the beaten eggs. Pour the filling mixture into the pie shell, and bake for 15 minutes. Then lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until the filling is almost firm, about 30 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle the pecan streusel over the top, covering the pie completely. Return the pie to the oven and bake until the filling is just a bit wobbly in the middle and the pecan streusel is golden, 10 to 15 minutes. The total baking time should be 55 to 60 minutes. Cool the pie on a wire rack. The pie is best served at either at room temperature or cold. Before serving, garnish the pie with the Maple Whipped Cream. Place the metal bowl of an electric mixer in the freezer to chill for at least 15 minutes. Combine the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, and vanilla in the chilled bowl, and beat on high speed until the mixture thickens. Add the maple syrup and beat on high speed until the cream holds firm peaks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>Note: The wine pairing suggestions are based on general guidelines and may not be suitable for everyone&#39;s personal taste preferences.

In a small bowl, combine jerk seasoning, cloves, and cinnamon. Sprinkle liberally over all sides of chicken; set aside. Chicken can be prepared up to this point a day ahead. For glaze: In a small pot over medium-high heat, combine all glaze ingredients. Bring to boil and cook until glaze thickens, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside. Set up grill for indirect grilling over medium heat or heat a 10-inch cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Oil grate when ready to start cooking. Place the chicken in the skillet skin side down and cook until skin is crisp and has nice grill marks. Brush the flesh side with the glaze, then turn the chicken over and brush the skin side. Transfer the grill pan to the oven and bake until chicken is cooked golden and the internal temperature of the thigh registers 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 minutes. Transfer to cutting board; let rest 5 minutes before cutting. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinotage, Shiraz, Tempranillo]&quot; 58771,&quot;Air Fryer Pork Chops 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cups cornflakes, finely crushed (about 1 cup) 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika Four 6-ounce center-cut boneless pork chops (1 inch thick), trimmed of excess fat Instructions: Set up a breading station with 3 pie plates or small baking dishes.

Peel the outside of a whole melon, cut it in half through the stem end, and scoop out the seeds. Place the melon halves cut side down on a board, and slice them straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan each half-melon out slightly and arrange it on the platter. Next, cut off the top and bottom of the pineapple, peel the outside, and use a sharp knife to remove the \eyes.\ Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise and remove the core by cutting a \V\ down the center of each half. Again, place the pineapple halves, cut side down, on a board and slice them straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan the slices out and arrange them next to the melon on the platter. Once the base is set, you can add any kind of fruit that&#39;s available. I like to have one thing that is taller than the rest, such as a large bunch of grapes or a decoratively cut papaya, to give the platter height. Then I add raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and fresh figs in casual but organized groups. The platter can look like a bowl of M&amp;M&#39;s if there are too many colors scattered with no order. Visually, your eye needs to have a focal point and to be able to see each type of fruit. After all the fruit is arranged, I add flat green leaves around the outside of the fruit, to set off the colors. Use lemon and galax leaves from your florist, or fig leaves and grape leaves from your garden. Make sure they are pesticide-free and well washed. Any kind of fruit will work well on this platter. For special occasions, add persimmons, kiwi, passion fruit, Queen Anne cherries, fresh apricots, and mangos. Choose whatever is colorful and seasonal. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 58781,&quot;All-Purpose Pizza Dough 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110? F) 2 cups bread flour 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading 2 teaspoons sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl Instructions: Sprinkle the yeast over the hot water in a small bowl. Let stand until dissolved and slightly foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the bread flour, all-purpose flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the yeast mixture into the well and add the olive oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, dust the dough with flour and knead, dusting with more flour as needed, until very smooth and elastic but still slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough into two 1-pound balls. (If making sheet-pan pizza, let the dough rise, covered, on an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet coated with 3 tablespoons olive oil instead of in a bowl; do not divide into two balls.) If not using the dough right away, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.

Add the onion, season with salt, to taste, and toss in the crushed red pepper. Saute the onions until they are soft and very aromatic, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir in the chorizo and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the bread crumbs. Let the mixture cool. When cool, add the Manchego and parsley. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stuff the peppers with the filling and arrange them on a sheet pan. If there is extra stuffing, press a little on top of each of the peppers. Put the peppers in the oven to warm through, about 8 minutes. While the peppers are in the oven, combine the arugula, almonds and scallions in a large bowl. Dress the salad with sherry vinegar, big fat finishing oil and salt, to taste. Check for seasoning and divide the salad between 4 serving plates. Remove the peppers from the oven and arrange 2 peppers on each salad.

Stir together the soy sauce, chili sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, vinegar, grated ginger and grated garlic in a small bowl. Reserve 2 tablespoons for the vegetables and then stir in the hoisin sauce. Set half aside for serving with the cooked pork chops and stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons water. Sprinkle the pork chops on both sides with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper for all 4 chops. Place the pork chops and onions on a lightly oiled grill. Grill until the pork chops are just slightly pink near the bone, 6 minutes on the first side and 4 to 5 minutes on the second side. Grill the onions until they are soft. Start brushing both the pork and the onions with the hoisin sauce mixture about halfway through grilling. Transfer the pork chops to a cutting board to rest for about 5 minutes and the onions to a bowl. Put the bok choy in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave until the center core has softened and can easily be pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, 3 to 5 minutes. Season the bok choy with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and grill until charred, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add to the bowl with the onions and gently toss with the reserved 2 tablespoons ginger sauce. Serve the pork chops with the grilled vegetables and the reserved hoisin sauce mixture on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 58784,&quot;Oven Roasted cl Relleno with Chipotle Asado Sauce 4 fresh poblano chiles 1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil 1 medium yellow onion, diced 2 cups quinoa, rinsed 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded and remainder julienned 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup grated asadero cheese 6 egg yolks Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme Salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 ripe tomatoes, preferably Roma 1 small yellow onion, julienned 5 cloves garlic, peeled 3 tablespoons canola oil Salt Freshly ground black pepper Leaves from 3 sprigs fresh thyme 3 tablespoons chipotle chiles in adobo or 5 re-hydrated dried chipotles 3 cups heavy cream Instructions: To make the cl Relleno: Preheat oven to \broil\ and roast the chiles until skin blackens, making sure to turn frequently. Remove chiles from the oven and place into a stainless steel mixing bowl. Peel the outer skin, being careful not to tear the flesh of the cl. With a sharp paring knife, make a long slit the length of each cl and then gently remove and discard all of the seeds. Set the chiles aside while you make the filling. Heat the oil in a 4 quart saucepan over medium high heat and saute the onion until translucent. Add quinoa and toast for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add salt, pepper, and water to cover about 2 inches over quinoa. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender. Turn out onto a baking sheet and allow to cool. In a clean pan, saute the mushrooms in butter over high heat. Season lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper and allow to cool. In a bowl, combine the cooled quinoa and mushrooms with asadero cheese, eggs, thyme leaves, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stuff each of the chiles with the filling mixture until they are very full and then set aside while you make the sauce. To make the Asado Sauce: Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F. Quarter the tomatoes and then place into a stainless steel mixing bowl and combine with the onions, garlic, oil, salt, pepper, and thyme. Turn onto a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven about 15 to 20 minutes or until the tomatoes and onion start to turn black. Remove from the oven and process mixture in a food processor, working in batches if necessary. In a 4-quart saucepan, combine the processed onion-tomato mixture with the chipotles and heavy cream and heat over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep the sauce warm until you&#39;re ready to serve. To serve: Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. Place the stuffed chiles into the oven and roast for 20 minutes or until heated through. Ladle enough of the warm asado sauce on 4 dinner plates to form large pools and then place 1 cl relleno on each plate and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 58785,&quot;Gina&#39;s Pucker-Up Lemon Limeade 1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about 10 lemons) 1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed lime juice (from about 15 limes) 1 cup superfine sugar 1/2 cup honey 3 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger 4 cups cold water Crushed ice 1 lemon, thinly sliced for garnish 1 lime, thinly sliced for garnish Instructions: In a large pitcher combine all the ingredients and mix until the sugar has dissolved.

In a large bowl, combine the oats, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, brown sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the beer, buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into the well. With your fingers, stir the batter from the middle of the bowl to the outside, until it&#39;s well mixed. It will look more like cake batter than bread dough. Brush a 9 x 5 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pan with melted butter. Pour the batter into the pan and sprinkle the top with oats. Put the bread in the oven, immediately turn the temperature down to 400 degrees, and bake for 45 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Turn the bread out onto a baking rack and allow to cool completely.

Add the leeks, onions, scallion whites, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a couple turns of pepper. Cover and cook, stirring every 4 or 5 minutes, until the onion is very soft, about 15 minutes. Uncover, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, adjusting the heat as necessary and stirring often, until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes more. (Loosen and scrape up any browned onion with a splash of water as necessary.) Stir in the farro and wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the chicken broth, beef broth, Worcestershire, bay leaves and 2 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the farro is tender, about 15 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Preheat the broiler to high with a rack set 4 inches from the heat source. Divide the soup among flame-proof serving bowls and sprinkle evenly with the Gruyere. Broil until the cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the scallion greens and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58788,&quot;Jasmine Rice 1 cup long-grain jasmine rice (yields 3 cups cooked) 10 3/4 cups water Instructions: Put the rice in a medium pot with 3 cups of water. Gently swirl your fingers in the pot to allow the starch to separate from the grains. Once the water becomes white, tilt the pot over the sink to drain out the water. Be careful not to let your rice go into the sink. Repeat this process twice more. With each time, the water will get less cloudy. The idea is not to get rid of all the starch, just enough so that the rice will not be too sticky or too dry when cooked. After you have drained the rice the third time, add remaining 1 3/4 cup clean water. Swirl you fingers in the pot once to ensure the rice is leveled and place the lid on the pot. Cook the rice over medium heat, stir the rice with a wooden spoon a few times, then let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 58789,&quot;French String Beans 1 pound French string beans, both ends removed Kosher salt 1 red onion, large-diced 1/2 red pepper, large-diced 1/2 yellow pepper, large-diced Good olive oil Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Blanch the string beans in a large pot of boiling salted water for just 4 minutes. Drain immediately and immerse in a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. When they are cool, drain and set aside. Meanwhile, in a large bowl toss the onion and bell peppers together with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for about 15 minutes, tossing with a spatula from time to time to be sure the vegetables roast evenly. Just before serving, reheat the string beans in a large saute pan drizzled with a little olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and arrange on a platter.

Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or your hands for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth, and a somewhat elastic dough has formed. The starter will be thick and stretchy. Scrape the starter into a clear container with high sides and cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise. At this point you have two options. If you plan to make the dough later the same day, let the sponge rise at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to indent on top. This may take 6 to 8 hours. It will triple in volume and very small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top of the surface as it reaches its peak and begins to deflate. Make sure to use it before it sinks too much. If you are not planning to make the dough until the next day, let the sponge rise for 1 hour after mixing, then place it in the refrigerator and let it rise for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water in the dough, or let it sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature. To make the dough, place the yeast and water in a large bowl. Stir the yeast so it dissolves, and allow to stand for 1 minute. Add the sponge to the yeast mixture, and mix with your hands for 1 minute to break up the sponge. The mixture should be foamy. Add the flour and mix it in with your hands, lifting the wet mixture over the flour to incorporate it. Once the dough becomes a shaggy mass, knead in the bowl for 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes. Add the salt to the dough and knead briefly to incorporate. Gradually add the oil and milk, and knead gently until all the liquid has been incorporated. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until it begins to become smooth, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The dough will be sticky, so keep the work surface lightly floured. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn the dough to coat it, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until almost double in size, approximately 2 hours. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. When the dough has risen, loosen it from the bowl with lightly floured hands, and pour it onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 9 equal pieces, about 5 1/4 ounces each. Shape the dough into balls and place on the baking sheet approximately 4 inches apart. Brush each piece with olive oil, and press down gently so the bread is more like a disk than a roll. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until the dough has almost doubled in size. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Toss the slices of tomatoes in a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes in a decorative fashion on the dough. With your finger tips, press down on the dough in a few places, making impressions where olive oil can gather. Lightly brush the dough with olive oil, allowing it to pool in the dimples. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Place the baking sheet in the oven, mist the loaves with water from a spray bottle, shut the oven door, and continue to bake. Mist again one minute later. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F, and bake for 15 to 25 minutes longer, or until golden brown and crusty. Remove the focaccia from the oven immediately, brush with olive oil, and sprinkle with fresh herbs such as basil if desired. Let cool on a cooling rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 58795,&quot;Paloma Flaca Skinny Margarita 1 vanilla bean 4 ounces orange juice 3 ounces grapefruit juice 8 ounces silver tequila 6 ounces lime juice 1 tablespoon agave nectar Crushed ice 1 lime, sliced into discs, for garnish Instructions: Using a paring knife, split the vanilla bean down the center and place in a small saucepot with the orange and grapefruit juice.

Meanwhile, in a wide shallow pan, simmer about 1 1/2 to 2 inches water with white vinegar and salt. Poach the eggs in the water for 3 to 4 minutes for runny yolks. Toast the English muffins while the eggs are poaching. Warm up the Pork Green Chili. Top the English muffins with the chorizo sausage patties, poached eggs, then the Pork Green Chili. Serve with your favorite breakfast side. I like hash browns or breakfast potatoes to soak up the green chili, but cheesy grits or fresh fruit are also great options. For the braised pulled pork: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Combine chicken stock, beer, orange juice, pineapple juice, garlic, onion and cilantro in a pitcher and set aside. Place pork shoulder on a wire rack in a large/deep roasting pan, then stab shoulder repeatedly (watch out for the bone!) and pour the liquid over the murdered shoulder. Cover tightly with foil (as airtight as possible) and place in the oven to roast for 5 hours. Remove from the oven. Place the shoulder on a half-sheet tray, remove the bone, then roughly chop the meat and place it in the fridge to cool. (Chop the pork while it&#39;s hot! It is much easier!) For the chili: In a large stockpot over medium-high heat, add oil and saute onions, garlic, green peppers and jalapenos with salt and pepper until soft, about 7 minutes. Add canned green chiles, chicken stock, Worcestershire sauce, fresh tomato and 1 quart pulled pork (save the remainder of the pulled pork for another use), then simmer until peppers are tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat whisk the butter and flour together and cook to make a light brown roux, about 5 minutes. Add the roux to the simmering chili to get to desired thickness (should stick to a ladle). Salt and pepper to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 58801,&quot;PK&#39;s Pork Cracklings 1 pound pork skin Peanut oil, for deep-frying Kosher salt Instructions: Cut the pork skin into 4 pieces. It will cook more evenly and be easier to clean later on.<br> In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring 4 quarts water to a simmer. Add the skins and cook for 1 hour, or until they are soft and somewhat gelatinous.<br> Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.<br> Remove the skins from the water with a slotted spoon and put onto a large plate. Discard the liquid. Let the skins cool in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes so they will be easier to handle.<br> Put one of the pieces on a cutting board skin-side-down. The other side will have bits of meat and fat on it that will have turned white during cooking. With a very sharp chef&#39;s knife, slice as much of the meat and fat off as possible, leaving only a thin piece of skin. Be careful not to slice into the skin underneath. The cleaner you get the skin, the crispier the crackling will be when fried. Repeat with remaining pieces.<br> Arrange the skins on a parchment-paper or Silpat-lined sheet tray and put in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Flip the skins and continue cooking for 1 1/2 hours, or until the skins are completely dry. Remove from the oven and let cool.<br> When cool enough to handle, scrape off any remaining bits of fat and meat. The back of a knife works well for this. At this point, the cracklings can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week.<br> Heat about 4 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or pot to 350 degrees F. Break the cracklings into small, inch-sized pieces. Fry in batches for 30 to 45 seconds, until crisp and puffy. Remove from the oil and season with salt.

Coat a 9-inch round or square cake pan with nonstick baking spray; line the bottom with parchment. Set aside. Beat the butter with the sugar and vanilla in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). Reduce the speed to medium-low and add the eggs, one at a time, beating for 45 seconds after each addition. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.<br> Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a small bowl until combined.<br> With the stand mixer running on low speed, add the flour mixture and buttermilk, alternating between the two, starting and ending with the flour and mixing until just combined. Do not overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and level the top with a rubber spatula.<br> Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes before removing it from the pan.<br> For chocolate cake: Add 1/4 cup unsweetened dark cocoa powder to the flour mixture. After the eggs are incorporated, beat in 4 ounces melted and cooled bittersweet chocolate, beating until combined. Alternate adding 1/4 cup of hot brewed coffee with the flour mixture and buttermilk.<br> For lemon poppyseed cake: Beat 2 tablespoons freshly grated lemon zest with the butter, sugar and vanilla. Add 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice to the buttermilk before it goes into the batter. Before pouring the batter into the cake pan, gently fold in 2 tablespoons poppy seeds using a rubber spatula. For a lemon glaze, whisk 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice and 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar in a small bowl until smooth. Add more lemon juice, a few drops at a time, if needed. Once the cake is completely cool, drizzle the glaze over the top.<br> For coffee cake: To make a streusel, combine 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter cut into small cubes in a medium bowl. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture looks like coarse sand. Pour half of the batter into the cake pan and spread it out evenly with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle half of the streusel over the batter. Spread the remaining batter on top and sprinkle the remaining streusel over it. For a maple glaze, whisk 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup with 1 teaspoon water and 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar into a small bowl until smooth. Add more water, a few drops at a time, if needed. Once the cake is completely cool, drizzle the maple glaze over the top.<br> For confetti cake: Increase the vanilla extract from 1 tablespoon to 2 tablespoons. Before pouring the batter into the cake pan, gently fold in 1/4 cup rainbow sprinkles using a rubber spatula. For raspberry jam swirl cake: Bring 1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam to room temperature and stir it vigorously with a spoon until smooth. Pour half of the batter into the cake pan and spread it out evenly with a rubber spatula. Place 4 dollops (about half) of the jam on the batter. Spread the remaining batter over top and make 4 more dollops over the batter with the remaining jam. Drag a long wooden skewer through the batter, making sure the skewer reaches down to the bottom of the pan, creating swirls of jam.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 58803,&quot;Spice Double Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Served with Ruedas de Fuego 4 tablespoons cumin seeds 4 tablespoons coriander seeds 4 tablespoons fennel seeds 4 tablespoons mustard seeds 8 tablespoons oregano 2 tablespoons onion powder 2 tablespoons garlic powder 4 tablespoons paprika 6 bay leaves Salt and pepper 4 (16-ounce) rib-eye steaks 1 (6-ounce) can chipotle adobo 4 garlic cloves 1 lemon, juiced Extra-virgin olive oil 4 poblanos, sliced into rings 2 red onions, sliced into rings 1 cup flour 1/2 cup buttermilk Instructions: Toast and grind the cumin, coriander, fennel, and mustard seeds.

Mix together and add the flank steak. Marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Preheat the grill to medium-high. Remove the steak from the marinade and discard the marinade. Pat the steak dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill over medium-high heat until cooked to medium-rare, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Let rest 10 minutes, loosely covered with aluminum foil, before slicing. For the gravy: In a large pan with straight sides, add the butter, olive oil, onions and thyme. Season with salt and pepper and cook over medium heat until the onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic, season with salt and cook gently until the mushrooms are tender and darkened, about 5 minutes more. Add the Worcestershire sauce and horseradish. Sprinkle the flour over the entire pan. Stir to help the flour to soak into the vegetables and cook a minute more to lose the flour flavor. Raise the heat to medium-high and add the beef stock. Cook until slightly thickened, then slowly stir in the heavy cream. Simmer until the cream is thickened slightly, about 4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt, if needed. For the toast: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F or a grill to medium heat. Arrange the sliced bread on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. In a small pot, add the butter, onion powder, thyme and garlic and season with salt. Heat over medium-low heat until the butter is melted. Brush the garlic butter evenly onto the bread. If baking, place in the oven and bake until the edges are golden, about 10 minutes. If grilling, place the bread slices buttered-side down on the grill and grill until toasted and grill marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes. To serve, layer the toast, then slices of beef and pour over a spoonful of gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Malbec]&quot; 58805,&quot;Spanekopita 1 pound melted butter 3 to 5 tablespoons melted solid vegetable shortening 1/2 bag flour (2 1/2 pounds) 5 cups warm water 1 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons of the butter mixture Flour, for rolling 16 ounces cottage cheese 16 ounces feta cheese 6 eggs 3 tablespoons of the butter mixture 2 bunches green onions, chopped fine 3 bunches or 2 bags fresh spinach, washed and patted dry Instructions: Butter mixture: First make the butter mixture and put aside. Crust: Mix all crust ingredients, knead as you would bread, until pliable and not sticky, and using extra flour as needed. Shape ball into a long loaf, cut into 12 equal pieces, 6 for top crust and 6 for bottom. Take each piece 1 at a time, and roll until evenly flat, about 14 inches by 14 inches. The size will vary, so don&#39;t panic. Start a stack of 6 rolled pieces, painting butter mixture on each piece- cover all but about a 1-inch edge of the dough. Do not butter the top piece, as you&#39;ll be rolling this stack out. Do the same with the other 6 pieces. You will now have 2 stacks, 1 for the top and 1 for the bottom. Now you will roll 1 stack out to be very large, somewhat bigger than the pan you will be baking in. Place bottom crust in pan and trim the edges, you&#39;ll need a little extra edge to pinch together with your top crust, sealing the filling. Filling: Mix both cheeses, eggs and 3 tablespoons butter mixture in bowl. Then spread the mixture out evenly on bottom crust. Spread chopped onion on top of that, then spinach on top of that. Place top crust over, trim to fit and seal as you would a pie crust, following with a fork and pressing down to seal well. Bake in the oven for 1 hour in a preheated 350 degree oven.

Whisk in the cumin, turmeric, 1 cup of the yogurt, 1 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper. Add the chicken tenders and toss until well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Meanwhile, cut the remaining lime in half and juice one of the halves into a small bowl. Whisk in 1/2 cup yogurt and 1 tablespoon water until smooth; refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut the remaining lime half into wedges and set aside for serving. Put the flour, remaining 1 cup yogurt and 2 tablespoons water in a large bowl and mix with a fork until a shaggy dough forms. (The dough may appear dry and crumbly at first, but it will come together as you mix it.) Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until the dough is smooth and slightly elastic, dusting with more flour if necessary, about 8 minutes. If the dough feels too dry, add water 1 tablespoon at a time and continue kneading until soft and pliable. Divide the dough into 4 pieces, roll into balls and pat out into four 8-inch rounds. Spray a grill pan generously with nonstick spray and heat over medium heat. Rub 2 of the dough rounds on each side with 1 tablespoon of the oil and place on the grill pan. Cook until dry around the edges and dark grill marks form, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, about 2 minutes more. Set aside and repeat with the remaining dough rounds and oil. Brush any remaining dough bits to the sides of the grill pan. Shake off as much marinade as possible from the chicken pieces and transfer to the grill pan. Cook until dark grill marks form and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 165 degrees F, about 4 minutes per side. Spread each flatbread with 1 tablespoon of the yogurt sauce. Top each with 2 chicken tenders and sprinkle with one-quarter of the cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, red onion and cilantro. Drizzle with the remaining yogurt sauce and season with salt and pepper.

Put the fennel halves, cut-side up, in a baking dish and drizzle with enough olive oil to come up half-way; season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Roast for 30 minutes or until completely tender - the roasted fennel is the base of the soup, so it&#39;s important the flesh is soft enough to be cut with a spoon. Reserve until ready to serve. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium flame, add the onion and garlic, and saute for 4 minutes until translucent. Toss the thyme into the pan, along with the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes, until the mushrooms give off their liquid. Add the chestnuts and cook for a few more minutes until they have some nice color on them. Remove about 1 cup of the mixture to save as a garnish for the soup. Pour the stock into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring now and then. Remove from the heat and puree the soup until completely smooth, using a handheld or regular blender. Stir in the cream to make the soup even richer, and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Taste for salt and pepper. To serve: Ladle the soup into soup bowls; garnish each serving with a bit of the reserved mushrooms and chestnuts, a roasted fennel half, and a sprinkle of chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 58817,&quot;Cucumber Salad 1 hothouse cucumber, peeled and very thinly sliced 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt Hot water Tatsoi greens Ginger Lime Dressing, recipe follows 1 avocado, sliced 1 lime, cut into wedges 1 1/2 tablespoons wasabi 2 tablespoons water Juice of one lime 1 tablespoon sugar (raw) 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced 2 cup olive oil 2 teaspoon salt or to taste Freshly ground black pepper to taste Instructions: In a bowl, combine vinegar, sugar, salt and 2 to 3 tablespoons hot water.

Set aside to cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit on the milk for 1 minute. Add 8 cups of the flour. Stir until just combined, cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside in a relatively warm place for 1 hour. Remove the towel and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt and the remaining 1 cup flour. Stir thoroughly to combine. Use the dough right away or place in a mixing bowl and refrigerate for up to 3 days, punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl. Remove half of the dough. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 30 by 10 inches, with a long side facing you. To make the filling, pour 1 cup of the melted butter over the surface of the dough. Use your fingers to spread the butter evenly. Generously sprinkle half of the ground cinnamon and 1 cup of the sugar over the butter. Don&#39;t be afraid to drizzle on more butter or more sugar! Beginning at the end farthest from you, roll the rectangle tightly toward you. Use both hands and work slowly, being careful to keep the roll tight. Don&#39;t worry if the filling oozes as you work; that just means the rolls will be divine. When you reach the end, pinch the seam together. Transfer to a cutting board and, with a sharp knife, make 1 1/2-inch slices. One log will produce 20 to 25 rolls. Pour a couple of tablespoons of melted butter into several pie pans or baking dishes and swirl to coat. Place the rolls in the pans cut-side up, being careful not to overcrowd. Repeat the rolling-sugar-butter process with the other half of the dough and more pans. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cover each pan with a kitchen towel and let rise on the countertop for at least 20 minutes before baking. Remove the towels and bake for 13 to 17 minutes, until golden brown. Don&#39;t allow the rolls to become overly brown. While the rolls are baking, make the icing: In a large bowl, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, butter, coffee and salt. Splash in the maple flavoring. Whisk until very smooth. Taste and add more sugar, butter or other ingredients as needed until the icing reaches the desired consistency. The icing should be thick but still pourable. While the rolls are still warm, generously drizzle icing over the top. Be sure to get it all around the edges and over the top. As they sit, the rolls will absorb some of the icing&#39;s moisture and flavor. They only get better with time...not that they last for more than a few seconds! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58820,&quot;Carrot Oven Fries 1 lb. carrots, (about 5 or 6 large) peeled and cut into 4-in. x 1/4-in. sticks 1 teaspoon olive oil<br> 1 packet Hidden Valley?

Scrub potatoes, pierce the skin with a fork, drizzle with olive oil and salt and place on a sheet pan. Place the sheet pan in the oven and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour until they are easily pierced with a pairing knife. Allow the potatoes to cool slightly then peel the potatoes while they are still hot and press them through a potato ricer. Put the potatoes in a large bowl with salt, nutmeg, baking powder, grated cheese and egg white. Add the flour a little at a time and mix with your hands until the mixture forms a rough dough. Do not over-work the dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Gently knead the dough for 1 or 2 minutes until smooth, adding a little bit more flour, if necessary, to keep it from sticking. Break off a piece of the dough and roll it back and forth into a rope, about the thickness of your index finger. Cut the rope into 1-inch pieces. Gently roll each piece down the prongs of a fork while pressing a small dimple with your finger in the back. The gnocchi should be slightly curved and marked with ridges. This will allow the pillows to hold sauce when served. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 12 hours. Boil the gnocchi in batches in plenty of salted water. The gnocchi are done about 2 minutes after they float to the surface, remove with a slotted spoon. Reserve about 1/2 cup cooking water. If not cooking immediately, place the gnocchi in a single layer on a baking pan dusted with flour. Place 4 strips of prosciutto on a sheet pan and place in a preheated 350 degree F oven.

Tear the croissants into pieces and put in a small gratin dish; I use a cast iron oval with a capacity of about 500ml/ 2 cups for this. Put the sugar and water into a saucepan, and swirl around to help dissolve the sugar before putting the saucepan on the hob over medium to high heat. Caramelize the sugar and water mixture by letting it bubble away until it all turns a deep amber colour; this will take 3 to 5 minutes. Keep looking but don&#39;t be too timid. Take the pan off the heat and add the cream - ignoring all spluttering - followed by the bourbon and milk. Whisk to mix, then still whisking add the beaten eggs. Pour this quickly over the croissants and leave to steep for 10 minutes.

Season both sides of the chicken with spice rub, salt and pepper. Brush the chicken breasts on both sides with olive oil. Grill skin side down, until well-browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes on each side. While the chicken is cooking, make the salad. Combine the corn kernels, arugula, and oregano in a bowl. Add desired amount of citrus vinaigrette, toss, and season with salt and pepper. With a vegetable peeler, shave the pecorino onto the salad. Toss lightly. Slice chicken into bite size pieces, place on top of salad and serve. Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly and add the red pepper flakes, and toss. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put mixture in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. Cut off and discard the stem ends of 2 oranges. Cut into quarters, cut out the core, and pull out seeds. Place in a blender or food processor. Squeeze the juice from the remaining orange into the blender and add the red onion, sage, salt, and pepper. Pulse and then blend the fruit until as smooth as possible. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a thin, steady stream. The vinaigrette will be thick like a mayonnaise. If it is too thick, with the machine still on, thin with a little warm water. Taste for seasoning. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. If the vinaigrette separates, shake it up in a jar or return it to the blender and blend until smooth again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 58862,&quot;Stained Glass Cookies 2 1/2 cups cake flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 14 to 20 hard candies, such as Jolly Rancher or Life Savers Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl.

Add ice and shake 10 to 15 seconds, then strain into the prepared glasses. &quot;,&quot;[Tequila, Orange Liqueur]&quot; 58872,&quot;Schiacciata with Caramelized Onions 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 5 cups thinly sliced onions Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup water 1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves Cornmeal, for dusting baking sheets 1/2 pound store bought pizza dough All-purpose flour, for dusting dough and work surface About 15 oil-cured olives, pitted About 1/2 cup grated fontina or Gorgonzola 3 small handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, optional Aged red-wine vinegar, optional Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat until hot. Add the onions, season with salt so the onions release their liquid, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until the onions stop releasing water and the pan is nearly dry again, about 4 minutes. Do not allow the onions to brown. Add the water, stir, cover, and cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Uncover, stir in the thyme, and cook over medium heat until the onions are light brown, about 10 minutes longer. Season lightly with pepper. Do not cook the onions too long now as they will brown further in the oven. Let cool for several minutes. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Dust 2 baking sheets with cornmeal. Cut the dough into 3 equal pieces. Working on a floured surface, shape each piece of dough by hand or with a rolling pin into an 8-inch round, keeping the edges a little thicker than the center. Transfer the rounds to the prepared baking sheets. Brush each round with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil and divide the onions evenly among them. Let rise for about 20 minutes. Push the dough with your fingers. Top each round with the caramelized onions and then scatter olives on top. Dot rounds evenly with the cheese. Bake until light brown all around the edges and on the bottom, about 12 minutes. Let cool for a minute, then, if desired, pile a handful of parley leaves on top of each. If using, put the vinegar in a spray bottle and mist the parsley. Chef&#39;s Note: Diced cooked potatoes are also a good addition to the onions. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 58873,&quot;Marshmallow Fondant Zebras 5 ounces mini marshmallows (about 2 2/3 cups) 8 ounces confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted (about 2 cups), plus more for kneading Vegetable shortening, for kneading Black gel food coloring, for coloring the fondant Instructions: For the marshmallow fondant: Combine the marshmallows and 1 1/2 teaspoons water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add about three-quarters of the sifted confectioners&#39; sugar to the marshmallow mixture and stir to combine. Once the mixture becomes too stiff to stir, grease a work surface and your hands with shortening (or wear greased plastic disposable gloves) and dump the mixture onto the work surface. Knead, adding the remaining quarter of confectioners&#39; sugar a little at a time, until the fondant is very smooth, not sticky and holds its shape in a ball without relaxing. Use right away or grease it lightly with additional shortening, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and store in an airtight plastic bag or container at room temperature for up to several days. Remove a 1-ounce piece from the fondant ball (about 2 tablespoons). Wearing plastic disposable gloves, color the 1-ounce piece black (about 3 drops), rolling and kneading to evenly incorporate the color. Work in a little confectioners&#39; sugar if the moisture from the food coloring makes the fondant too soft. For the zebra head, legs, arms, ears and body: With greased hands, divide the white fondant into 6 pieces (one piece for each zebra). From the first piece, pinch off a portion of fondant and roll into a head. Pinch off 2 more pieces and roll them into stubby legs. Remove 2 more pieces of fondant and roll into arms. Pinch off 2 tiny pieces of fondant and roll them into triangular ears; use a toothpick to make a crease in each ear. Pinch off a small piece of fondant and reserve for the nose. Roll the remaining piece of white fondant into the body. For the zebra stripes, hair, eyes and markings. With greased hands, divide the black fondant into 6 pieces (one piece for each zebra). From the first piece, pinch off small pieces and roll into thin lines for stripes. Pinch off a small piece and shape into a circle for hair, using a toothpick to make indents around the circle. Pinch off 4 small pieces and shape into circles for the pads at the end of the arms and legs. Pinch off 2 tiny black pieces and roll into balls for eyes. Pinch off a small piece of black fondant for the nose. For the nose, combine the white and black fondant nose pieces into one gray piece and shape into an oval. Use a toothpick to poke 2 nostrils in the nose. Build the zebra: Add a black circle to the end of each arm and leg, using a little water to attach them. Add stripes to the arms and legs. Press the legs together to join them in a \v\ shape and set the legs on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Add the body in between the legs and arrange the arms on the side of the body. Add stripes to the head and attach the ears on either side, using a little water if needed. Attach the hair on top of the head in between the ears, using a little water and pressing lightly to adhere. Press the eyes and nose onto the face, using a little water if needed. Press the head on top of the body to adhere. Repeat with the remaining white and black fondant to make 5 additional zebras. Let the zebras dry, uncovered, overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 58874,&quot;Chipotle-Mango BBQ Chicken 1 1/2 cups mango, peeled, pitted and roughly chopped 3/4 cup fresh cilantro (loose pack, not chopped, stems andall) 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons unseasoned rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon canola oil, plus extra for grill 4 cloves garlic, peeled 2 chipotle peppers in adobo, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 2 pounds chicken thighs and drumsticks, bone in, skin on Instructions: Put the mango, cilantro, lemon juice, vinegar, oil, garlic, chipotle, salt and pepper in a food processor and puree until smooth.

Trim off the top and bottom of the eggplant and slice into 2-centimeter (1-inch) thick disks. Place the slices in a single layer onto the paper towel lined baking sheet and evenly sprinkle both sides with the kosher salt. Allow the salted eggplant to sit for about 20 minutes. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, for the sauce, combine the tomatoes and their juices with the butter, halved onion and Parmesan rind, if using, in a medium saucepan. Pick the basil leaves from the stems, add the stems to the tomatoes and set the leaves aside. Place a lid on the pan so that it is a little off kilter to allow steam out and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes, or even longer for a more intense tomato flavor. Pat the eggplant dry with some paper towel or a clean kitchen towel and remove from the baking sheet. Coat the bottom of the baking sheet with the olive oil and arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer. Flip the eggplant slices over to coat both sides in oil. Season with pepper and a bit more salt (don\u2019t worry, lots of the salt that you previously put on has been wiped away so the eggplant won\u2019t taste super salty). Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown on both sides. Remove the eggplant from the oven and top each with a spoon of the tomato sauce and sprinkle with the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Return the eggplant to the oven and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. To serve, spoon some sauce onto your plates and divide and stack the roasted eggplant parm on top. Tear up the fresh mozzarella and basil leaves, scatter on top and season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 58882,&quot;Bacon Burger Dogs 4 fresh pork bratwursts 2 12-ounce bottles lager beer 1/2 pound ground beef chuck 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 16 slices center-cut bacon 4 hot dog buns, split Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1/2 sweet onion, finely chopped 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces) Instructions: Put the bratwursts in a medium pot in a single layer. Pour in the beer, then add enough water to cover the bratwursts by 1 inch, if necessary. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low. Simmer until the bratwursts are cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove to a plate and allow to cool completely. Meanwhile, combine the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl. Gently mix with your hands and divide into 4 equal portions. Lay out a piece of plastic wrap. Arrange 4 bacon slices side by side on the plastic to form a rectangle, overlapping them slightly. Position the bacon rectangle with a short end in front of you. Press a portion of the beef over the half of the bacon rectangle closest to you. Place a bratwurst horizontally on top of the beef. Using the plastic wrap to help, tightly roll the bacon and beef around the bratwurst away from you; remove the plastic wrap. Secure the bacon with kitchen twine in 3 or 4 spots. Repeat to wrap the remaining bratwursts. Place the bacon-wrapped bratwursts seam-side down in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook, turning, until the bacon is crisp and the beef is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove to a plate, tent with foil and let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. Drizzle the insides of the buns with olive oil. Place on a baking sheet and broil until golden brown, about 1 minute. Use scissors to remove the twine from the bratwursts.

Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub the skin with olive oil. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the meat from the bones, discard the skin, and dice the chicken in large bite-size pieces. Meanwhile, add the broccoli florets to a large pot of salted boiling water. Cook for 1 minute, until crisp tender, drain, and place into a bowl of ice water until cool. This will stop the cooking and set the bright green color. For the dressing, whisk together the mayonnaise, wine, mustards, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add enough sauce to the warm chicken to moisten well. Add the tarragon, broccoli, and tomatoes and mix gently to combine. Refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.

Cover with plastic and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes or in the refrigerator for up to 1 hour. To make the sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the orange juice, apricot jam, cl sauce, rice vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil. In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch with a few spoonfuls of the hot mixture to make a slurry. Add the slurry back to the saucepan and whisk to combine. Continue cooking until the sauce is thickened and syrupy; this should only take about 30 seconds of boiling. Remove from the heat and reserve in the pan. To finish: Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat to 375 degrees F. To make the batter: Add 3 tablespoons tempura flour to a medium bowl. Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat. In a separate large bowl, add the remaining tempura flour and whisk in 1 1/4 cups very cold water. (The batter should still have a few lumps.) Add the dredged chicken to the batter mixture and toss to coat. When the oil reaches 375 degrees, fry the chicken pieces in batches, turning frequently, until the chicken is golden brown, 3 minutes total. Remove to a wire rack set over a baking sheet to drain of excess oil. Allow the oil to return to temperature before adding another batch. When ready to serve, warm the sauce in the pan, then toss in the fried chicken pieces. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with the scallions. Serve with rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 58899,&quot;Perfect Roast Turkey with Best-Ever Gravy 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature Salt and freshly milled black pepper 2 1/2 quarts homemade turkey stock or canned reduced-sodium chicken broth Melted unsalted butter, if needed 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup bourbon, port, or dry sherry, optional 1 (18-pound) fresh turkey About 12 cups of your favorite stuffing Instructions: Position a rack in the lowest position of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Reserve the turkey neck and giblets to use in gravy or stock. Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water. Pat the turkey skin dry. Turn the turkey on its breast. Loosely fill the neck cavity with stuffing. Using a thin wooden or metal skewer, pin the neck skin to the back. Fold the turkey&#39;s wings akimbo behind the back or tie to the body with kitchen string. Loosely fill the large body cavity with stuffing. Place any remaining stuffing in a lightly buttered casserole, cover and refrigerate to bake as a side dish. Place the drumsticks in the hock lock or tie together with kitchen string. Place the turkey, breast side up, on a rack in the roasting pan. Rub all over with the softened butter. Season with salt and pepper. Tightly cover the breast area with aluminum foil. Pour 2 cups of the turkey stock into the bottom of the pan. Roast the turkey, basting all over every 30 minutes with the juices on the bottom of the pan (lift up the foil to reach the breast area), until a meat thermometer inserted in the meaty part of the thigh (but not touching the bone) reads 180 degrees and the stuffing is at least 160 degrees, about 4 1/2 hours. Whenever the drippings evaporate, add stock to moisten them, about 1 1/2 cups at a time. Remove the foil during the last hour to allow the skin to brown. Transfer the turkey to a large serving platter and let it stand for at least 20 minutes before carving. Increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Drizzle 1/2 cup turkey stock over the stuffing in the casserole, cover, and bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a heatproof glass bowl or large measuring cup. Let stand for 5 minutes, then skim off and reserve the clear yellow fat that has risen to the top. Measure 3/4 cup fat, adding melted butter if needed. Add enough turkey stock to the skimmed drippings to make 8 cups total. Place the roasting pan on two stove burners over low heat and add the turkey fat. Whisk in the flour, scraping up browned bits on the bottom of the pan, and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the turkey stock and the optional bourbon. Cook, whisking often, until the gravy has thickened and no trace of raw flour remains, about 5 minutes. Transfer the gravy to a warmed gravy boat. Carve the turkey and serve the gravy and the stuffing alongside &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot]&quot; 58900,&quot;Roasted cl Guacamole with Baked Tortilla Chips Cooking spray 3 sun-dried tomato basil tortilla wraps 3 garden spinach herb tortilla wraps Olive oil Salt and pepper 1/2 cup frozen chopped onion, thawed 2 cups frozen no-salt added petite peas, thawed 1/3 cup water 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 (1-ounce) packet guacamole seasoning mix 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1/2 cup diced tomatoes with no-salt added 1 cup chopped avocado 1 (7-ounce) can fire roasted diced green chiles Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups cream, the remaining 1 1/2 cups milk and the kosher salt. Open the vanilla bean and, with the tip of the paring knife, scrape the seeds into the saucepan. Add the pod as well and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. In another medium saucepan heat the granulated sugar over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula, until the sugar melts and becomes dark brown. Remove the sugar from the heat and slowly stir in the warm cream mixture (be careful, as it will bubble and sputter) until well incorporated. Whisk a small ladleful of the warm cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture a little at a time. Then slowly mix the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan. Cook, stirring, until a thick custard forms. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a large heatproof measuring cup (you will have about 3 3/4 cups) or a bowl. Whisk in the butter until melted. While the custard is still warm, divide it among the serving bowls or cups (we use plain juice glasses), filling them no more than three-quarters full. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours. For the salted caramel sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the cream and salt. Open the vanilla bean and scrape the seeds into the cream with the tip of a paring knife. Add the pod to the saucepan as well, and bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, combine the butter and the sugar in a medium saucepan, and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula, until the butter and sugar have melted and are a deep amber color. (The caramel will bubble and look strange as it cooks. Once the sugar melts and the moisture from the butter evaporates, the mixture should become thin and glossy.) Remove the sugar from the heat and carefully add the hot cream; it will bubble and spurt but will settle down. Stir well to combine, then strain though a fine-mesh strainer. The sauce will keep, covered and refrigerated for at least 1 week. Reheat it gently before using. To serve: In a medium bowl, combine the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla extract and whisk to medium peaks. Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of the Salted Caramel Sauce over each custard. Top with a dollop of whipped cream and a pinch of the sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 58912,&quot;Breakfast Burritos Plain 18 flour tortillas 1 pound breakfast sausage<br> 4 tablespoons salted butter<br> 18 large eggs<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Wrap the flour tortillas in paper towels and microwave them for 1 minute to make them pliable.

Crack the eggs into a food processor and add the flour. Whiz it up and listen for the sound changing to a rumble - this means the dough is coming together nicely. Turn the power off and test the consistency by pinching the dough. If it&#39;s a bit sticky add a little more flour and pulse again. Tip the dough mixture onto a floured surface and shape it into a ball using your hands. Give it a little knead until smooth, then divide your dough into 4 equal parts. Start on the thickest setting of your pasta machine and run the first bit of dough through 4 or 5 times, moving the rollers closer together each time until the pasta is silky, smooth and about as thick as a CD. Flour your finished sheet generously, then fold it up and cut across into 1/2-inch strips. Gather all the slices together and toss them through your fingers, with a little flour, to open them up and make your pile of tagliatelle. Place to 1 side and repeat with the rest of the dough. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. In a bowl large enough to rest on top of the pan, put your creme fraiche, fontina or other melting cheese and your Parmesan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the bowl over the pan for the cheeses to slowly melt. It won&#39;t take long. Meanwhile, trim any dry ends off the broccoli, then finely slice the stalks diagonally and leave the florets whole (cutting any larger ones in half). At this point the cheese sauce should be lovely and oozy, so remove the bowl from above the pan and drop the pasta and broccoli into the boiling water. Boil hard for 2 to 3 minutes, until the pasta is just cooked through. Whip up the 2 egg yolks and the marjoram, or other chosen herb leaves, into the sauce. Drain the pasta and broccoli, reserving a little of the cooking water, and quickly toss them with the sauce - the heat from the pasta will be enough to cook the eggs through. If the sauce is a little thick, add a few splashes of cooking water to make it silky and loose. Taste and season, if necessary. Serve as quickly as you can, with some extra Parmesan sprinkled over the top and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the cauliflower florets in a food processor and pulse them to a fine snowy powder; you should have 2 1/2 to 3 cups. Transfer the processed cauliflower to a microwave-safe bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Microwave until it&#39;s soft, about 5 minutes Then pour it onto a clean, dry kitchen towel and let cool slightly. When it&#39;s cool enough to handle, wrap the cauliflower tightly in the towel and wring out as much moisture as possible, twisting and squeezing like crazy. By the time you&#39;re done, you should have a pretty dry clump! And don&#39;t worry?it shouldn&#39;t look like much at this point. In a large bowl, combine the cauliflower and Parmesan And add the Italian seasoning, salt, egg, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Stir/smush it together until well combined. Form it into a ball and place it on the baking sheet Then use your hands to flatten it into a large, flat round. Keep in mind that it won&#39;t move/rise like regular crust, so whatever shape it&#39;s in when you put it in the oven, that&#39;s the same shape/ size it&#39;ll be when you pull it out! (It&#39;s super easy to work with! You&#39;ll love it.) Bake the crust until it&#39;s golden, about 12 minutes. Top with the marinara and the remaining 1 cup mozzarella and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling, 10 minutes more. As soon as it comes out of the oven, sprinkle on some Parmesan. Then cut it into wedges. Sprinkle on basil leaves just before serving. Don&#39;t expect a crispy/chewy crust like regular pizza . . . but do expect an amazingly delicious dinner! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 58943,&quot;Roast Chicken with Celeriac 1 celeriac, peeled and coarsely diced 3 carrots, coarsely diced 1 leek, green top removed, split in half and rinsed thoroughly 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 (4-pound) whole chicken 1 lemon, cut in half 2 shallots, coarsely diced 1/2 bunch fresh thyme 1/2 bunch fresh sage 3 to 4 cloves garlic, smashed Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Toss in the onion slices with the oil and a generous pinch of salt. Add the sugar and cook over medium heat until the onions are caramelized and tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and if a splash of juice from the cornichon jar, if using, and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside. For the burgers: Break up the meat in a medium bowl, spreading it up the sides of the bowl so that the seasoning really permeates the meat. Sprinkle with the Worcestershire and salt. Mix with your hands, but do not overmix. (The more you work the meat, the tougher the burger.) Gingerly form the meat into four round 1-inch-thick patties. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. Heat a large cast-iron skillet and add the oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, arrange the patties in a single layer at a distance from one another. Let cook, undisturbed, until the bottoms brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the patties and let the bottoms brown again, 3 to 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium-low, then add the stock to the skillet and cover. Simmer until the patties are cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the lid, shut off the heat under the skillet and place a slice of cheese on each patty. Let the patties rest with the heat off until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Transfers the patties to a plate or cutting board and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce the remaining liquid in the skillet by half, about 5 minutes, and serve it on the side of the burgers. People can spoon this liquid over the burgers instead of or in addition to ketchup. You can also just add this reduced liquid to the onion jam to enrich the flavor. Assemble the burgers: Arrange the bun bottoms on a work surface. Spoon some of the onion jam on each and top with one of the patties. Top with more jam and a few slices of cornichon. Top with the bun tops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58948,&quot;Shrimp-Jalapeno \Poppers<br> 32 large uncooked large shrimp (about 1 lb.), peeled, deveined 1/3 cup KRAFT Zesty Italian Dressing 1/2 cup BREAKSTONE&#39;S or KNUDSEN Sour Cream 2 Tbsp. chopped cilantro 32 RITZ Crackers 6 oz.

F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Trace an 8-inch and a 4-inch circle on 1 sheet of parchment. Trace a 6-inch, 2-inch and 1-inch circle on the second sheet. Flip over both sheets (the circles should still be visible). Bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over low heat. Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and set the bowl over the saucepan (don\u2019t let the bowl touch the water). Whisk in the granulated sugar and cook, whisking constantly, until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture registers 165 ? F on an instant-read thermometer, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer and fit with the whisk attachment; add the cream of tartar. Beat on high speed until glossy with very stiff peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract. Reduce the speed to medium and beat until the mixer bowl is no longer hot to the touch, 2 to 3 more minutes. Transfer about half of the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Starting with the largest traced circle, pipe a ruffled edge around the perimeter. Use some of the remaining meringue from the bowl to fill the circle so the middle is just slightly higher than the piped border. Pipe a second smaller circle of ruffles on top to create a tiered effect. Repeat with the 6-, 4- and 2-inch circles, creating 2 tiers of ruffles on each. Pipe the 1-inch circle, finishing with a peak on top. Transfer the baking sheets to the oven and bake until the meringues are crisp but not browned, about 2 hours. Turn off the oven and let the meringues cool in the oven. When ready to assemble, beat the heavy cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy. Add the cream of coconut and confectioners&#39; sugar, then beat on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract and whisk just to combine. Dust all 5 meringue tiers lightly with confectioners&#39; sugar. Set the 8-inch layer on a serving platter or cake stand and spread a thick layer of whipped cream on top, just to where the ruffles start. Repeat with the remaining meringue layers and whipped cream, working from the largest to the smallest meringues to build the tree.

Sprinkle in the yeast and a pinch of granulated sugar. Set aside undisturbed until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the flour and remaining granulated sugar in a large bowl.<br> Combine the butter, vanilla and yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low until combined. Add the yeast mixture and continue to mix on low until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix on low until a thick and slightly sticky dough forms and comes together, about 1 minute. Switch to the dough hook and knead on medium speed, adding up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed to make a soft, smooth ball that sticks to the hook, 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Coat 2 large bowls with cooking spray. Cut the dough in half, form each into a ball and add one ball to each bowl, turning to coat in the cooking spray. Cover the bowls with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours.<br> For the filling: Microwave the chocolate and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth. Fold in the granulated sugar and set aside.<br> Line a baking sheet with parchment. Punch down one ball of dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead a few times, then roll into a rectangle 12 inches by 16 inches, keeping the longer side closest to you. If the chocolate filling has seized and is no longer spreadable, microwave for 30 seconds. Spread half of the chocolate filling all over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Starting from the long side, gently roll up the dough so you have a long log. Position it seam-side down. Using a bench scraper or sharp knife, cut the log in half lengthwise so you have 2 long pieces. Twist each piece 4 times. Form one twisted piece into a tight coil (it should look like the center of a cinnamon roll) and carefully transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Coil the second twisted piece around the first. Repeat the rolling, filling, twisting and coiling process with the remaining dough ball. You should have 1 giant twisted babka roll (it might get messy, but that is part of the fun). Cover the baking sheet with clean kitchen towels and let rest for 30 minutes.<br> Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.<br> Beat the whole egg with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the roll all over with the egg wash. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board.<br> For the glaze: Microwave the cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl until softened, 10 to 15 seconds. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk and whisk until smooth. Drizzle the glaze on top of the roll and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 58959,&quot;Steak With Blue-Cheese Butter and Celery Salad 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 4 6-to-7-ounce top blade steaks Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon hot sauce 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 3 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 4 stalks celery, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 lemon Instructions: Soak the onion slices in a bowl of cold water, about 10 minutes.

Combine the granulated sugar with 2 cups water in a small saucepot to make a simple syrup. Bring the syrup to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the lemon peels. Simmer the peels until the white pith is translucent, about 40 minutes. Cool the peels in the syrup and then drain, saving the syrup for another purpose (lemon simple syrup is great in a lemon drop martini). Lay the peels on a mesh cooling rack to dry, about 2 hours. Store them packed in granulated sugar in an airtight container at room temperature. For the lemon curd: Remove the zest from the lemons (without the bitter white pith) with a carrot peeler. Pulse the zest with the granulated sugar in a food processor until the zest has been finely minced into the sugar. Cream the butter with the sugar and zest at medium speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Crack the eggs into a small bowl to ensure there are no shells, then add the eggs one at a time to the mixer until combined. Add the lemon juice and salt and blend until combined. Place the mixture into a medium saucepot. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 10 minutes. The lemon curd is ready when it reaches 170 degrees F. Transfer the lemon curd to a metal bowl and cool the bowl in an ice water bath, then cover with plastic wrap pressed against its surface and refrigerate until ready to use. For the limoncello dip: Bring the limoncello and 2 cups water to a simmer in a medium saucepot set over medium heat. Allow the mixture to simmer for 4 minutes to cook off the alcohol in the limoncello. Remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to cool. For the ricotta filling: Add the ricotta, confectioners&#39; sugar, lemon zest and limoncello to a bowl. Mix to combine. Set aside at room temperature. For the whipped cream topping: Whip the cream and granulated sugar together in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk until soft peaks are formed, then hold for the assembly of the torta. Refrigerate until ready to use. Dip the ladyfingers halfway into the limoncello dip and line a 9-by-13-inch pan with the soaked ladyfingers. Once the bottom is covered, spread the ricotta mixture over the top evenly with an offset spatula. Place a second row of dipped ladyfingers on top of the ricotta mixture. Spread the lemon curd on top of the ladyfingers with the spatula. Place the third and final layer of dipped ladyfingers on top of the lemon curd. Spread the whipped cream topping over the ladyfingers. Refrigerate overnight. Serve well chilled, garnishing slices with candied lemon peel. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 58975,&quot;Yellow Split Pea Soup 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 onion, sliced 3 stalks celery, diced 2 carrots, peeled and diced Salt and white pepper 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 8 cups chicken stock (or combination water and stock) 2 cups dried yellow split peas 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced 1 ham hock (optional) Dark bread croutons, for garnish Brown mustard Instructions: Melt butter over medium-low heat in a large stockpot or Dutch oven.

Repeat the process with the 2nd egg and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil, and again with the 3rd egg and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Start kneading the dough with your palms, allowing the warmth of your hands to impart elasticity to the dough. Knead for a count of about 400 strokes or until you feel you have created a cohesive mass. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow it to rest for about 30 minutes. While the pasta is resting, begin the sauce: Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves, and nutmeg, if using, in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Spoon the melted butter into a separate heat resistant bowl and gradually whisk in the cornstarch, blending thoroughly, then whisk in the Comte cheese. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the cornstarch/cheese mixture, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk mixture, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf and cloves. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Begin making the spinach/cheese pillows. Have a bowl of water handy to moisten and seal the dough. Divide the dough in thirds. (You will be working with 1/3 of the dough at a time - keeping the balance wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.) Divide your first third of the dough in half. Use a pasta machine to gradually roll down each of these sections, successively reducing the setting on the machine until it&#39;s at the thinnest setting and lay on your floured dough board. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the spinach cheese filling at 4-inch intervals on the pasta dough, and top each with a knob of Brie cheese. Dip your fingers into the bowl of water and moisten the area surrounding the spinach/cheese filling. Cover the filling with the other rolled out piece of dough and press gently around the filling to seal, being careful not to flatten the filling or tear the dough. Using a pizza cutter, begin to cut the filled dough into ravioli squares. Remove each ravioli to a floured surface, pressing the edges firmly as you do so. Cover the ravioli with a towel and set aside for 2 hours. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, add the ravioli and cook for 1 minute. Remove the ravioli with a slotted spoon, drain on a paper towel, and keep warm. Reheat the sauce. Serve pillows with sauce spooned over and garnished with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 59039,&quot;Shaved Brussels Sprouts with Pancetta Good olive oil 3 ounces pancetta, 1/4-inch diced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups thinly sliced shallots (3 large) 2 (12-ounce) packages fresh Brussels sprouts, trimmed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon syrupy balsamic vinegar Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large (12-inch) saute pan over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until browned and cooked through. With a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a plate lined with paper towels and set aside. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the butter to the same saute pan and cook over medium-high heat just until the butter melts. Add the shallots and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until tender and starting to brown. Meanwhile, place the Brussels sprouts in the feed tube of a food processor fitted with the large slicing disk. (You don&#39;t need to core them.) Process the sprouts in batches until they are all sliced, transferring them to a bowl. Add the Brussels sprouts to the pan with the shallots, add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper and saute for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally (I use tongs), until crisp-tender and bright green. Add the pancetta and cook for 1 more minute. Off the heat, stir in the balsamic vinegar, season to taste, and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 59040,&quot;Butternut Squash Bisque with Vermont Maple Syrup 2 pounds butternut squash, peeled and coarsely chopped 8 ounces unsalted butter 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup Vermont Maple syrup 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg Instructions: Boil squash in lightly salted water until tender.

For the homemade dry rub: On a parchment paper-lined baking tray, put the garlic, ginger, shallots, and onions and bake in the oven 4 hours, or until dried. Using a food processor, reduce into a powder with the brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Set aside. Coat the brisket with the spice mixture. Cover and keep in the refrigerator overnight to marinate and flavor the meat. For the apple barbecue sauce: In a large bowl, mix together the onion, chipotle pepper, garlic, ketchup, honey, molasses, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, to taste. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the brisket, fat-side up, into a heavy baking pan just large enough to hold it, and pour sauce over it. Cover tightly and bake for 4 hours or until fork-tender. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and keep warm. Strain and pour the sauce in a stockpot and let reduce for about 10 minutes on medium high heat until thick. Remove excess fat. Cut the meat with a sharp knife against grain, to desired thickness. To assemble: Garnish onion buns with the meat, sauce, tomatoes, lettuce and top with deep-fried onion rings. Cook&#39;s Notes: You can buy dried onions and garlic from grocery stores instead of preparing it. The apple barbecue sauce is a recipe on its own and very versatile. It can be used as a dip, as a sauce or as a glaze for other meats like chicken, pork, etc. The brisket can be served on its own and served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Brisket can also be sliced and frozen for later use. Make the brisket the day before and reheat for best flavor. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 59042,&quot;Sauteed Apples with Ginger Snap Crumble 1/2 cup finely ground ginger snap crumbs (from 10 to 15 cookies processed in a food processor) 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon fine salt<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold 4 large pink lady apples, cheeks removed and cut into 1/2-inch slices<br> 3 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger<br> 1 tablespoon lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice<br> Unsweetened whipped cream, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the ginger snap crumble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the ginger snap crumbs, flour, sugar and salt. Using your fingers, work in the pieces of butter. Large clumps will form; this is what you want. Spread onto a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. For the sauteed apples: Meanwhile, over medium heat, melt the butter in an enameled cast-iron skillet over medium heat until golden in color, about 2 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the apples, brown sugar, ginger, lemon zest, juice and pumpkin pie spice. Toss to coat all the apples. Add the apple mix to the skillet and saute until tender, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat. Divide the apples and crumb topping among plates. Top with the whipped cream. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59043,&quot;Topanga Honey Rolled Baklava 1 cup honey 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced 2 whole star anise 1 cup clarified butter, melted 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 cup pitted dates 1 cup raisins 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon orange blossom water or 2 teaspoons grated orange zest 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger Pinch kosher salt 1 1/2 cups roasted almonds, chopped One 1-pound package frozen phyllo pastry, thawed Instructions: For the honey syrup: Combine the honey, granulated sugar, lemon juice, salt, sliced ginger, anise and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, for the baklava: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Brush 1 tablespoon of the clarified butter evenly all over a 9-by-9-inch baking pan. Melt the 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in a small saute pan over medium heat. Once melted, add the panko and granulated sugar. Toast, stirring often, for a few minutes until slightly golden. Remove from the heat and transfer to a small bowl. Add the dates, raisins, brown sugar, orange blossom water, cinnamon, ground ginger and salt to a food processor and pulse until the dried fruit is finely chopped. Add the almonds and process again until just combined. Transfer to a clean work surface and roll into eight thin 10-inch-long logs. Lay one sheet of phyllo onto a clean surface and lightly brush with some of the remaining melted clarified butter. Lay a second sheet of phyllo directly on top of the first, brush with more clarified butter and sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon of the panko mixture. Fold the phyllo sheets in half crosswise; place one of the date logs at the short end of the sheets and begin to roll the dough over the date log, continuing until the entire phyllo sheet has been rolled. You will end up with a phyllo cigar. Transfer the cigar to the prepared baking pan and lay horizontally. Brush the top lengthwise with some of the remaining melted clarified butter and repeat the process with the remaining phyllo and date logs. You will need 8 cigars to fill the pan. Brush the baklava with some of the remaining clarified butter once again. Using a sharp knife, slice vertically down in three equal sections, creating twenty-four 3-inch pieces. Bake until the baklava are golden brown, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Baste the baklava with the remaining clarified butter at 30 and 45 minutes into the baking time. Rotate the pan 180 degrees halfway through the baking. Strain the solids from the honey syrup and discard. Pour the syrup over the hot baklava immediately after removing from the oven and allow to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes to soak up all the syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 59044,&quot;Crab Farrotto with Peas Splash olive oil 1/2 onion, cut into small dice 1 cup semi-pearled farro Big splash white wine Kosher salt About 2 cups warm lobster stock, plus more if needed 1 cup defrosted frozen peas 1 cup lump crabmeat, shells picked 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon nice pea sprouts 3 or 4 stems fresh marjoram, leaves minced 1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves chopped 1 small bunch chives, minced 1/2 lemon, zested and juiced Instructions: Add a splash of olive oil to a medium saucepot and heat over medium heat.

Make the crust: Pulse the flour, pecans, sugar and salt in a food processor until the pecans are finely ground. Pulse in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons ice-cold water and pulse until the dough just comes together. Turn out the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, form into a disk, wrap and refrigerate until slightly firm, about 15 minutes. Put the dough in a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides. Freeze until firm, about 10 minutes. Place the tart pan on a baking sheet. Line the crust with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the edges of the crust begin turning golden, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and pie weights and continue baking until the crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Make the filling: Whisk 1 cup milk, the egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar and the cornstarch in a medium bowl. Heat the remaining 2/3 cup milk and 1/4 cup sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. While whisking, slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Return to the saucepan and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture starts to bubble and is very thick, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, then whisk in the cream cheese, lemon juice and vanilla until smooth. Pour into the cooled crust and refrigerate until set, about 1 1/2 hours. Make the topping: Toss the berries, sugar and sherry in a bowl and let sit at room temperature, 20 minutes. Top the tart with the berries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59046,&quot;Dark Chocolate Brownie Pops 2 cups powdered sugar 1 cup cocoa<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 2 sticks butter, melted<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla<br> 2 pounds dark chocolate melting wafers<br> Chocolate jimmies (chocolate sprinkles), for decorating Instructions: Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.

Cut each leg into drumstick and thigh, and quarter the breasts. To prepare the marinade paste, peel and coarsely chop the garlic, ginger, and 3 onions. Place in a blender with the cloves, peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, poppy seeds, mace, 1 teaspoon salt, and the lemon juice. Blend to a smooth paste. Turn into a large bowl, add the yogurt, and mix well. Dry Roasting: Spices are often dry-roasted before use. It is best to do this over medium heat in a preheated small, heavy, cast-iron frying pan. No oil is used; the spices are just stirred around in the pan with a wooden spatula until they brown lightly. Roasted spices develop a heightened, nutty aroma. They can be stored for several months in an airtight jar. Peel the 3 remaining onions, halve lengthwise, and slice finely. Heat the oil in a large heavy-based frying pan over medium heat. When hot, add the bay leaves and cardamom pods. Fry for 10 to 15 seconds. Add the sliced onions and fry, stirring, for about 10 minutes or until brown and crisp, but not burned. Remove with a slotted spoon, squeezing out as much oil as possible. Reserve the oil, cardamoms, and bay leaves. Add 2/3 of the fried onions to the marinade paste and mix well. Drain the rest on paper towels and set aside for garnishing. Pierce the chicken pieces with a fork and add to the bowl of marinade paste; mix well. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, turning the chicken occasionally. Transfer the chicken and marinade to a large heavy-based cooking pot or pan. Bring slowly to a boil, cover, lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Lift out the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and place them in a 6-quart casserole dish; cover and set aside. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Crumble the saffron into the warm milk and set aside to soak. Boil the marinade paste, stirring, over a medium heat, until reduced to 9 to 10 tablespoons. Spoon the paste over the chicken. Cover again. Pour about 3 quarts water into a large cooking pot or flameproof casserole. Add 3 teaspoons of salt and bring to a boil. Add the rice, bring back to a boil, then simmer for precisely 5 minutes. Drain the rice in a colander, then place it on top of the chicken in the casserole. Pour the saffron-infused milk over the rice, streaking it with orange lines. Sprinkle the reserved cardamom, bay leaves, and oil over the rice (retaining 1 tablespoon oil, for frying the raisins, if using). Cover the casserole dish with foil, cut 2 inches wider than the rim of the dish. Now put the lid on and use the protruding foil edges to seal the dish as best you can by crinkling it and pushing it against the sides. Bake in the oven for 1 hour. To prepare the garnishes, if including raisins fry them briefly in the reserved oil. Lightly toast the almonds if you wish. Quarter the hard-cooked eggs lengthwise, or cut into slice. Spoon the rice and chicken onto a large warm platter. Sprinkle with the fried onions, raisins, almonds and hard-cooked eggs.

Put the marshmallows and butter in a large pot and warm over medium heat, stirring, until completely melted. Add the rice cereal and stir until completely coated. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan. Lightly oil your hands or a little square of plastic wrap and press and smooth the cereal evenly into the dish. Cool until set, but not totally dry, about 30 minutes. Lightly oil a sheet of parchment paper and turn the block of crispy treats out onto it. Oil a baseball glove-shaped cookie cutter (about 4 inches wide) and cut out 6 baseball gloves, oiling the cookie cutter between each. Gather some of the scraps and make 6 baseballs, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Put the candy melts in a small bowl and melt them in the microwave in 30-second intervals at 30-percent power until thoroughly melted and smooth. Add the shortening (or paramount crystals) a little bit at a time until slightly thinned to a nice coating consistency. Coat the balls in the candy melts and let stand until completely set, about 20 minutes. Fit a #2 or 3 pastry tip into a small pastry bag and fill the bag with the red decorating icing. Pipe a red line in an elongated semicircle shape similar to the lines of a baseball onto each ball. Then pipe small, crosswise lines along the semicircle to represent the stitching on a baseball. Dab a little of the candy melt on the bottom of the balls, then press them lightly into the center of the gloves.

Remove the tips of the wings and discard or save for making stock. Use kitchen shears or a knife to separate the wings at the joint. Toss the chicken wings and vegetable oil on a baking sheet until well coated. Sprinkle with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Broil the wings until the skin starts to crisp and brown, about 12 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and flip the wings over. Broil the other side until crisp and golden brown, about 8 minutes more. Meanwhile, put the cranberries in a food processor and pulse until you have small pieces. Add them to a medium skillet with the sweet chili sauce and 3/4 cup water. Add all of the scallion whites and 2 of the scallion greens. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Strain into a medium bowl, pressing to get as much liquid through as possible. Return the liquid to the skillet and simmer until thick and shiny, like a glaze. Remove the wings and check for doneness; if a knife inserted into the meat closest to the bone is no longer pink, it&#39;s done. Toss the wings in the sauce bowl until well coated, return to the baking sheet and broil until the glaze turns shiny and the skin has blistered spots of char, 1 to 3 minutes. Check the wings every minute at this stage to ensure the glaze does not burn. If your glaze is not sticking as well as you would like, apply the glaze with a pastry brush. Sprinkle the remaining scallion greens over the top of the wings.

Prepare the cookie dough according to the package directions for drop cookies. Divide the dough into 2 pieces and flatten into discs. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes. Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Spray two 10-inch ovensafe rimmed plates with nonstick cooking spray and dust with flour; set aside.<br> Put one dough disc on a 12-inch-long piece of parchment and use a rolling pin to roll it to fit one of the plates. Gently place the plate face-down on the dough and trim any excess dough. Slide your hand under the parchment and, with your other hand holding the plate, flip it so the dough is now on the plate. Center the dough on the plate and peel off the parchment. Working from the center of the plate, gently press the dough down with the bottom of a 1/4-cup metal measuring cup to push out any air below the dough. Repeat with the second piece of dough and plate.<br> Place each plate on a baking sheet and bake until the cookie plates are slightly golden, about 12 minutes. Carefully remove from the oven and press the middle of the cookie plates again with the measuring cup to flatten. Place 1 peppermint candy in the center of each cookie plate and surround with 6 more candies. Use the remaining candies to line the circumference of the outer rim of the plates, placing them 1/4 inch inside the rim and leaving 1/8 inch between them so they can melt together. Place back in the oven, switching the positions of the baking sheets, and bake until the outer rims of the cookie plates are golden brown and the centers have just started to barely brown, about 4 minutes.<br> Transfer to a cooling rack to cool 5 minutes. Run a paring knife between the outer rims of the plates and the cookie plates to help release the cookie plates while they cool. Cool completely at room temperature, about 2 1/2 hours. Carefully remove the cookie plates.

Line each pan with parchment paper, then lightly coat the parchment with more melted butter. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place remaining butter and 8 ounces semisweet chocolate in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with film wrap. Allow to heat for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat, stir until smooth, and hold at room temperature. Place the egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on high until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, about 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat on high for an additional 2 minutes. While the egg yolks are beating, whisk 4 egg whites in a large stainless steel bowl until stiff but not dry, about 3 to 4 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold the melted chocolate mixture into the beaten egg yolk mixture. Add a quarter of the beaten egg whites and stir to incorporate, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Divide the batter between the prepared pans, spreading evenly, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool in the pans for 15 minutes. (During baking, the surface of the cakes will form a crust; this crust will normally collapse when the cakes are removed from the oven.) Invert 1 of the cakes onto the bottom of a springform pan. Invert the other 2 cakes onto cake circles. Remove the parchment paper and refrigerate cakes for 30 minutes. To prepare the chocolate and strawberry mousse, reserve the 12 best-looking strawberries to decorate the top of the cake. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, puree 4 ounces of strawberries (12 medium-sized berries should yield 1/2 cup of puree). Set aside until needed. Refrigerate the remaining berries until needed (that includes the 12 berries for decoration) Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place 16 ounces semisweet chocolate, the white chocolate and the strawberry puree in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with film wrap. Allow to heat for 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Transfer to a stainless steel bowl, using a rubber spatula to remove all of the melted chocolate mixture. Keep at room temperature until needed. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon whip, whisk the 6 egg whites on high until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Continue to whisk on high while gradually adding 2 tablespoons sugar. Whisk until stiff but not dry, about 30 seconds. Set aside at room temperature until needed. Using a hand-held whisk, whip the heavy cream in a well-chilled stainless steel bowl until stiff. Fold a quarter of the egg whites into the melted chocolate mixture, then fold in the whipped cream. Now fold in the remaining egg whites. Set aside at room temperature until needed. Assemble the springform pan. Spread 1/2 cup of chocolate strawberry mousse onto the cake layer in the assembled springform pan. Arrange 1/2 the amount of reserved strawberries (not including the 12 for decoration), stem side down, into the mousse. The berries should be arranged in 2 rings: the first ring being 3/4-inch from the outside edge of the cake, and the second, inside ring, 3/4-inch away from the first. Distribute 3 cups of mousse over the berries, being careful to keep the berries in position. Holding the pan by the top rim, gently but firmly tap the bottom of the pan 2 to 3 times on your work surface (this will eliminate air pockets). Position a cake layer on top of the mousse, then repeat the process used on the first cake layer (1/2 cup mousse, remaining strawberries, and 3 more cups mousse). Top the mousse with the remaining cake layer and gently press into position. Refrigerate the cake for 2 hours (do not freeze). Refrigerate 1 cup of Semisweet Chocolate Ganache for at least 1 hour. Keep the remaining ganache at room temperature until needed. Remove the sides from the springform pan (do not remove the bottom of the pan from the cake; this will make it easier to handle later). Use a cake spatula to smooth and fill in the sides of the cake with 2 to 3 tablespoons of room-temperature ganache. Evenly spread the remaining amount of this ganache over the top and sides of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for 1 hour. Transfer the chilled cup of ganache to a pastry bag fitted with a large-sized star tip. Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Pipe a circle of 12 evenly spaced stars along the outside edge of the top of the cake. Place a strawberry, stem side down, into each ganache star. Refrigerate the cake for 30 minutes. Cut the cake with a serrated slicer, heating the blade of the slicer under hot running water before making each slice. Allow the slices to come to room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before serving. Heat the heavy cream, butter, and sugar in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place the chocolate in a stainless steel bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Allow to cool to room temperature.

Bring chicken broth to a boil over high heat in a large deep pan. Bring 2-inches peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven. Preparing the glaze: Once cola is boiling, continue to cook vigorously, over medium-high heat, until it&#39;s reduced to about 1/3 cup and becomes slightly syrupy, about 15 to 20 minutes. While the cola is reducing, place the peach pieces into a blender and puree. Once the cola has reduced, stir in the horseradish, peach puree, and pepper. Set aside. The glaze will have the consistency of a thin syrup. Preparing the grits: Once the chicken broth comes to a boil, slowly whisk in the grits and stir vigorously to avoid lumps. Continue to cook the grits over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until they are soft and thick, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cover the pot and allow the grits to sit for 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup cream, pimientos, and cheese, and stir to combine. Just before serving, check the consistency of the grits. Stir in the additional 1/4 cream, if necessary, to thin them out. Prepare the sweet potato frizzles: Peel and grate the sweet potato using the large holes in a box grater. Using a tea towel, squeeze as much liquid as possible from the potato. Carefully drop the dry potato shreds in the oil once it reaches 350 degrees F. Fry for about 1 minute, until crispy and lightly browned. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and season lightly with salt. Prepare the watercress salad: Grate the onion using a box grater. In a jar or shaker, mix the onion, sugar, vinegar, oil, and salt. Shake vigorously until blended. Just before plating the salad, drizzle about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the dressing over the watercress and toss gently to coat. Preparing the chops: (Note the chops are fully cooked, so the preparation is to give them color, glaze them, and heat them through.) Preheat a large grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush each chop with about a tablespoon of oil, and season scantily with salt and pepper. Be cautious about oversalting the chops, since they are generally salty. Place the chops on the grill pan. Allow to sear for about 1 to 3 minutes, and then rotate the chop to get nice hash marks on the chop for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn chops over. Cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes total. Reduce heat. A few minutes before serving, spoon about a teaspoon of glaze over each chop. Turn over and repeat, being careful not to burn the glaze. To serve: Place a mound of the grits on each plate. Lean a chop next to the grits. Sprinkle about a tablespoon of sweet potato atop the grits/chop. On the side of the chop, mound a serving of the dressed watercress.

Bring to a full boil and then lower the heat to a rapid simmer. Skim the scum that rises to the surface.<br> Meanwhile put the ginger and onion halves on a baking sheet and char them under the broiler until lightly blackened, 10 to 15 minutes. Turn them over halfway through cooking. When cool enough to handle, rinse the onion and ginger under running water, using a knife to scrape away some of the charred surface. Cut the ginger into 3 pieces and toss it and the onion halves into the simmering broth, along with 1 tablespoon salt and the fish sauce.<br> Put the star anise, cloves, and cinnamon stick in a small skillet and toast them on top of a stove burner over medium heat. Turn the spices a couple of times until they&#39;re slightly darkened (3 to 4 minutes) and until you smell their aroma. Put the toasted spices and fennel seeds in a small square of double thick cheesecloth and tie the bundle with a long piece of kitchen twine. Add the spice bundle and the bay leaves to the broth, tying the end of the twine to the pot handle for easy retrieval.<br> Let the broth simmer, uncovered, skimming occasionally. After 4 hours, remove the spice bundle, onion, bay leaves and ginger from the pot and discard. Remove the oxtails from the pot and set aside. Let the broth continue to simmer. When the meat is cool enough to handle, pull the meat from the bones. Set the meat aside and return bones to the broth. Continue simmering, uncovered, until the broth is rich and flavorful, about 1 hour. Taste the broth and add more salt or fish sauce as needed.<br> Meanwhile, soak the rice noodles in cold water for at least 20 minutes. Arrange the sliced scallions, cilantro, parsley, basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and chiles on a platter in separate piles.<br> Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the drained noodles. Give the noodles a quick stir and cook until tender but firm, about 1 minute. Rice noodles can quickly become gummy, so don&#39;t let them overcook. Drain the noodles. Warm 6 large bowls by rinsing the with hot water and divide the noodles among the bowls.<br> Just before serving, return the broth to a full boil. Arrange the slices of raw filet and pieces of cooked oxtail meat over the noodles in each bowl. Carefully ladle the boiling broth over all; the raw beef should be submerged in the broth. Serve immediately, along with the platters of garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 59092,&quot;Cornmeal with Okra (Cou-Cou) 2 ears whole corn 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups okra, frozen or fresh 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only 6 cups water or chicken stock Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups yellow corn meal Freshly ground nutmeg Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the whole ears of corn into the oven (do not shuck the corn) and cook until the outside is charred and the inside feels soft when pressed, about 30 minutes. When it is cool enough to handle, pull out the silk and remove the husk. Cut the kernels off the cob and set aside. If using frozen okra, put it into a strainer and run it under cool water for a few minutes to thaw. Remove the stems from the okra and cut them into thirds. Heat 1 tablespoon each of butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion until it begins to soften, then add the corn, okra, and thyme. Cook for 1 minute and set aside. Butter a 13-inch by 9-inch pan with 1 tablespoon butter. Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan and add 1 teaspoon salt. Gradually sprinkle in the corn meal, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. When it is all incorporated, stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and the sauteed vegetables. Reduce the heat to low, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, to taste, and cook for 10 minutes stirring occasionally. Pour into the buttered dish and let cool. Slice the cooled cornmeal into squares and serve. You can also fry the cornmeal squares for a few minutes in butter or olive oil to make them crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 59093,&quot;Fire Roasted Chestnut Caramel Cookies 5 ounces whole peeled chestnuts (about 3/4 cup) 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 large egg 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3 tablespoons heavy cream 3 tablespoons unsalted butter Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling Instructions: For the fire roasted chestnuts: (Broiler Method) Preheat the broiler on your stove. Slice the chestnuts about 1/4 inch thick and place in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place under the broiler for 5 minutes. Transfer the chestnuts to a plate and allow to cool fully to room temperature. Rough chop the chestnuts and set aside. (Outdoor Method) Build a safe outdoor fire using lump charcoal. Be sure to keep a fire extinguisher close at hand. Wrap the chestnuts in heavy-duty foil so that they can move freely inside the foil pouch. Using a chopstick tip, poke three holes in both sides of the foil packet. Place the foil packet in the fire for 4 minutes. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes. Using tongs, remove the pouch from the fire and allow to cool to room temperature, approximately 30 minutes. Rough chop the chestnuts and set aside.<br> For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> Add the flour, cocoa, baking powder, salt and cinnamon to a sieve with a large dry bowl under it. Sift the ingredients together into the bowl, and then add the chestnuts and set aside. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed until the mixture becomes pale yellow and well combined. Add the vanilla and egg and mix until combined, approximately 30 seconds.<br> Slowly add the dry ingredients from the bowl into the stand mixer on the lowest possible speed. Once the mixture starts to come together, gradually increase the speed to medium until it forms a dough-like ball. Form 20 even-sized balls and place them on the prepared baking sheets.<br> Bake for 15 minutes, and then transfer to a cooling rack with a sheet of parchment paper under the entire rack. Allow the cookies to cool while you make the salty caramel crack.<br> For the salty caramel crack: Add the sugar to a medium dry skillet and set over medium heat; the sugar will start to melt and turn a pale yellow color. Shake the pan and let it continue to melt. The sugar will start to turn golden brown and then a deep rust color--make sure to shake the pan often to mix. Once the sugar becomes a solid amber red, remove from the heat and add the cream and then the butter. Mix quickly with a soup spoon; it will start bubbling. Be careful not to touch the sugar with your hands as it is scorching hot.<br> While the sugar is still soft and can be drizzled, spoon it generously over the cookies. The sugar will start setting to a hard crack as it cools fully. Sprinkle some flaky sea salt on top of each glazed cookie. Let the cookies fully cool before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59094,&quot;Jambalaya Sandwich 1/4 pound thick-cut bacon, diced 1 pound pork butt / pork loin, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 pound smoked sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices 1/2 pound andouille sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices 1 red onion, chopped 1 cup thinly julienned red bell peppers 1 pound boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 celery stalks, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves 3/4 cup plus 1/4 cup chopped green onions 2 teaspoons cayenne, or to taste Salt and pepper 1/2 cup water 2 sourdough bread loaves 1 pound Havarti cheese, thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.

Recommended Wine: Australian Muscat &quot;,&quot;[Muscat, Tawny Port, Sherry, Madeira]&quot; 59110,&quot;Cinnamon Chess Pie 1 1/2 pounds all-purpose flour 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1 pound (4 sticks) cold butter, cubed 1/4 cup heavy cream 4 egg yolks 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) butter, at room temperature 1 1/3 cups sugar 4 egg yolks 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt 4 cups all-purpose flour Food coloring 2 cups sugar 5 whole eggs plus 2 egg yolks 3/4 cup buttermilk 2 tablespoons finely ground cornmeal 1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup brown butter, cooled Nonstick cooking spray All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 egg, whisked Dragees, for decorating<br> Edible glitter, for decorating<br> Royal icing, for decorating Instructions: For the crust: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, sugar and salt. With the mixer running, drop in the butter and mix until the mixture resembles wet sand. In a small bowl, whisk together the cream and egg yolks, then pour into the mixer and whip until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a clean cutting board and cut in half. Using your hands, gently push each half of dough into a disc and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to overnight.<br> For the cookie dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter with the sugar. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, then add the vanilla and salt. Add the flour, a little at a time, until incorporated. Divide the dough into small batches and color each with food coloring, as desired. Chill the dough for 1 hour before rolling. When ready to decorate the pie, roll the dough to 1/4-inch thick. Use cookie cutters or a knife to cut out shapes for decorating the pie. For the filling: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the sugar, eggs and yolks until the mixture turns a light, golden color. Then whisk in the buttermilk, cornmeal, flour, cinnamon, vanilla and salt. While whisking, slowly drizzle in the browned butter.<br> For the pie: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch pie pan with cooking spray. Gently dust a clean work surface with flour, then place a pie dough disk on top and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a large circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer the dough to the pie pan, then crimp the edges and prick the dough on the bottom with a docker or fork. Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans to weigh the dough down. Bake until the dough just sets, 8 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Working quickly, use a pastry brush to brush the crust with egg wash. Carefully pour the filling into the crust.<br> Bake the pie until set but slightly jiggly, about 35 minutes, covering the edges of the crust with foil to prevent burning after about 10 minutes. Add the cookie dough topper decorations to the pie, then bake for 10 minutes more. Check the pie at about 40 minutes total; the center should still have a jiggle to it, but it should seem mostly set. Cool completely before decorating the pie with dragees, glitter and icing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 59111,&quot;Frozen Peanut Butter Cups 1 pound semisweet chocolate, cut in chunks 1 cup creamy peanut butter 1/4 cup warm water 1/4 cup honey 1 cup heavy cream, whipped 2 tablespoons chopped salted peanuts Instructions: Have 2 mini-muffin pans, a can of non-stick spray, a pastry brush, and a package of paper/foil candy cups out and ready; clear some space in the freezer. Slowly melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot water or in a microwave set on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through the heating time to smooth it out. Dot a bit of chocolate in the center of each muffin cup and press a candy wrapper in the molds so it sticks in place. Lightly spray the insides of the wrappers with a little non-stick cooking spray. Brush about a tablespoon of the melted chocolate into the paper liners, pulling it up the insides of the wrapper so it&#39;s all coated. Stick the chocolate cups in the freezer to harden while making the peanut butter filling. Keep the remaining melted chocolate warm so it stays smooth; we&#39;ll need it again in a few minutes. Combine the peanut butter, warm water, and honey in a mixing bowl, blend with a whisk until smooth and thinned out a bit. Using a rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture to make a light mousse \u2014 don&#39;t overdo it, it&#39;s ok if there are streaks of cream in the filling. Spoon the peanut butter mousse into a pastry bag filled with a large plain tip. Take the chocolate cups out; they should be pretty solid by now, and pipe the peanut butter mousse into the centers, leaving room for a cap of chocolate. Freeze again for a few minutes just so the mousse sets up a bit. Spoon more melted chocolate on top to cover the peanut butter and fill the cup to the top; spreading evenly with a knife so it&#39;s smooth and level. Sprinkle a little chopped peanuts on top and stick the peanut butter cups in the freezer to set up for 15 to 20 minutes. Invert the muffin pans on a cutting board to pop out the peanut butter cups. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59112,&quot;Round 2 Recipe - Chicken Pot Stickers Reserved chicken, from Chicken Teriyaki recipe 3 scallions, reserved from Chicken Teriyaki recipe, 1 uncooked, 2 grilled 12 round wonton wrappers 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 tablespoons water 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar Instructions: Chop the chicken into small pieces.

Buy a whole pork tenderloin (can&#39;t really buy any less) and cut off the 9 ounces needed for this recipe. Marinate and roast both pieces and use the extra char sui to make delicious sandwiches, fried rice or roast pork salad! For the marinade: In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, ginger, honey, bean sauce, rice wine, garlic and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the pork, cover with plastic wrap and leave in the fridge to marinate for as long as possible, preferably overnight. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the pork from the marinade and reserve the marinade. Place the pork in a roasting pan and roast until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F, about 40 minutes. While the pork is roasting, bring the reserved marinade to a boil in a small saucepan. Once the marinade has boiled you can take it off of the heat. Baste the pork halfway through cooking with 2 tablespoons marinade. Cool the remaining marinade to room temperature. When the pork is done, remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes, then cut the pork into 1/4-inch cubes. Toss the cubed pork in enough of the reserved, cooled marinade to coat. The pork mixture should be at room temperature before filling the pastry. For the puffs: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a roasting tray with parchment paper. Cut each sheet of puff pastry into six 3-inch squares, for a total of 12. Brush the edges of each square with the beaten egg and then place a heaping teaspoon of the pork filling in the center. Fold the square in half to create a triangular pastry. Tuck the triangle ends under to round off the triangular shape. Place on the prepared roasting tray and brush egg wash over the top. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the top of the pastries and cook in the oven until the pastry is golden, 18 to 20 minutes.

(Since the lamb will continue to cook for 5 to 8 minutes after you have removed it from the oven - carryover cooking - the meat thermometer will continue to rise to that period of time. So, the idea is to pull the lamb out at an internal temperature of 120 degrees F, so it ultimately ends up where you want it for medium rare.) Let meat rest, then cut into 1/4-inch thick slices. To make the tomato hash, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium low heat and gently cook the onion and garlic until the onion becomes translucent. Stir in the diced tomatoes and chives remove from the heat. Crumble in the cheese and allow it to melt. Place a piece of lamb on each slice of baguette, top with some of the tomato hash and mint leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 59131,&quot;Raspberry Sauce 1 half-pint fresh raspberries 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup seedless raspberry jam (12 ounces) 1 tablespoon framboise liqueur Instructions: Combine the raspberries, sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 4 minutes. Pour the cooked raspberries, jam, and framboise into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until very smooth. Chill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Wine]&quot; 59132,&quot;Fish and Chips 6 medium potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds) For the batter: 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 3/4 cup beer 1/4 cup milk 1 egg white 1 1/2 pounds skinned cod fillets Lemon, tartar sauce and malt vinegar Instructions: To make the chips: Peel potatoes. Square each end and sides. Cut each into 3/4-inch slices. Stack slices. Cut into 3/4-inch sticks. Place in a bowl of cold water to soak for 30 minutes. Soaking removes starch, so potatoes will be crisp when deep fried. Heat vegetable oil to 350 degrees in a deep-fat fryer.. Drain potatoes, pat dry using paper towels. Remember to dry thoroughly, any excess water will splatter when they are added to the oil. Dip frying basket in oil (this prevents potatoes from sticking to it), add potatoes. Lower basket into oil. Deep fry till just tender when pierced, and are starting to brown, 5-7 minutes. Lift basket out of oil, let potatoes drain. They are now partially cooked. After fish has been cooked, place the potatoes back in fryer basket, fry till hot, golden brown, 1-2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. For the fish: Sift baking powder with flour, place in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour, add oil and beer, stir with a wooden spoon. Gradually add milk until incorporated. Do not overmix. Batter will become elastic. Let batter stand for 30-35 minutes, till thickened. When ready to batter fish, in a copper bowl, whisk egg whites till stiff peaks form. Gently fold stiff whites into batter, using wooden spoon, until combined. Using a two pronged fork, dip a fillet in batter, turning to coat thoroughly. Hold it over the bowl, so excess batter can drip off. Lower fillet into hot oil, turning once, fry till golden and crisp, 6-8 minutes. Remove to baking sheet lined with paper towel, and keep warm in the oven as you fry the rest. To serve, sprinkle chips with salt, decorate fish with lemon wedges. Serve with tartar sauce malt vinegar.

Put the onion slices in a heatproof container and pour the hot vinegar mixture over them. Let sit for at least 1 hour before serving. For the sweet potato tottine: In a deep fryer or large Dutch oven, heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, heat the beef stock in a saucepan until slightly simmering. In a separate small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Once the bubbling subsides, add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add in the flour while whisking vigorously to prevent clumps. Cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add in the hot stock while whisking. Bring to a simmer and season with salt and pepper. Fry the tots in batches in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and let drain on paper towels. Add the tots to a bowl, place the cheese curds on top, cover in a ladleful of gravy and top with pickled red onions and fresh parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 59134,&quot;Creamy Polenta with Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms 2 cups heavy cream 2 cups milk 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3 ounces cornmeal, preferably coarse ground (about 2/3 cup) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 tablespoons freshly grated grana padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives, optional 1/4 cup olive oil 2 medium shallots, thinly sliced 8 ounces mixed domestic and wild mushrooms, sliced or cut into naturally occurring pieces (about 2 cups) Crushed red pepper 1/2 cup homemade chicken reduction, recipe follows, or purchased chicken reduction, diluted with water until a little thicker than chicken stock 1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives 1 teaspoon preserved truffles About 6 pounds chicken bones 3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil 2 stalks celery, coarsely chopped 1 carrot, coarsely chopped 1 clove garlic, coarsely chopped 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped 2 cups dry white wine 4 whole canned tomatoes (about 4 ounces), coarsely chopped 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, bruised with the dull side of a chef&#39;s knife Instructions: For the creamy polenta: In a heavy-based saucepan, combine the cream and milk and heat over medium-high heat just until small bubbles begin to appear on the surface. Add the salt, and whisk the cream and milk until quite frothy. (I don&#39;t have a scientific explanation as to why this whisking step is important; but I know from experience that when I don&#39;t do it, my polenta just doesn&#39;t seem as delicious as usual. Since this initial whisk is easy and takes practically no time, I recommend you do it, too.) Add the polenta and continue to whisk the mixture as it comes to a boil. Continue whisking for an additional 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to very low, cover the pan, and cook the polenta, stirring every 5 minutes or so (switch to a wooden spoon), until the cornmeal is completely cooked and quite tender, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. It may seem very thin initially, but it will gradually thicken. As the polenta cooks, a skin will form on the bottom and sides of pan (if you are not using a nonstick pan), which is proper and which gives the polenta a slightly toasty flavor. For the fricassee of truffled mushrooms: In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until the shallots just begin to color on their edges. Add the mushrooms and crushed red pepper to taste and cook until the liquid is released. Add the chicken reduction, bring to a boil, reduce to a bubbling simmer and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. (You can prepare the mushrooms ahead up to this point; reheat them over medium-high heat just before serving.) Just before serving, stir in the butter, grana padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano and chives if using. The polenta should pour from the spoon as you serve it and will thicken as it cools. If necessary, you can thin the polenta with a little milk just before serving. Divide the polenta among heated bowls or plates. Just before serving, reheat the mushrooms if necessary. Toss the mushrooms with the chives and preserved truffles. Spoon some mushrooms and some of the cooking juices over each serving of polenta. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Rinse the chicken bones and pat them dry. Spread them out in single layer with a little room between the bones on one large or a couple smaller sheet pans. Roast until they are golden brown, flipping and turning the bones every 15 minutes or so, about 1 hour. In a large stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the celery, carrots, garlic and onions, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are well browned, about 20 minutes. Add the wine, tomatoes and bones to the stockpot. Add enough water to cover everything by about 2 inches (about 6 quarts). Cook over medium heat (you want a gentle simmer, not a boil) until the chicken is falling off of the bone and the stock has a full flavor, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the chicken and strain the broth several times through a chinois or other fine strainer. If you want to make and use the reduction right away, spoon off any visible fat floating on top of the stock. Otherwise, chill the stock until the fat solidifies on top and then scrape off and discard most of it. Pour the defatted stock into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce the heat slightly so the stock is not boiling so furiously. As the stock simmers, some of it will remain on the sides of the saucepan; use a spoon or ladle to pour some of the stock over this to deglaze it. (This will further increase the intensity of the flavor.) Continue simmering until the stock has darkened and reduced to about 1 quart. The time this will take will vary, but it will likely take at least 20 to 30 minutes. Use right away, refrigerate for up to three days or freeze. Makes about 1 quart. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello di Montalcino, Chianti Colli Aretini]&quot; 59135,&quot;Red Velvet Cake Nonstick cooking spray 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled, plus more for dusting the pans 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 cup very hot water 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 cup milk 2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar 1 1/4 cups vegetable oil 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract One 1-ounce bottle red food coloring (about 2 tablespoons) Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch fine salt 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon milk, if needed Instructions: For the cake: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray; dust with flour, and tap out the excess. Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Stir together the hot water and cocoa powder in a small bowl until smooth; let cool slightly. Stir together the milk and vinegar in another small bowl, and let stand until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk together the oil, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk in the red food coloring and the cocoa mixture. Alternate whisking in the flour mixture in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes in the pans, turn out onto cooling racks and let cool completely. For the frosting: While the cake layers are cooling, beat the cream cheese, butter, vanilla and salt with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until smooth and fluffy. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until smooth. Increase the speed to high, and beat until very fluffy and there is no gritty texture left from the sugar. Beat in the milk to adjust the consistency if the frosting seems too thick. To assemble: Place one cake layer bottom-side down on a cake plate. Top with 1 cup of the frosting, and spread to the edge. Top with the second layer, and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting. If the frosting becomes too soft while assembling the cake, briefly chill the cake and frosting and then finish frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59136,&quot;Pan Seared Pork Chops with Apple Jelly Reduction 4 bone-in, center-cut porkchops, 1-1/2 to 2 inches thick 2 Tbs. butter 1 Tbs. olive oil 1 small shallot, chopped 1/4 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup white wine 3/4 cup apple jelly salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 375F.

Retain 1 cup flour for later use. Add 1/2 cup of water to the dry ingredients and mix by hand. Continue to add water by the tablespoon until the flour is incorporated - but not sticky. If the dough mixture becomes too sticky - add flour until the dough is dry to the touch. Lightly flour the working surface. Turn the dough mixture onto the floured working surface and continue to knead the dough until it is smooth. Cover the dough with a clean towel and let rest for approximately 15 minutes. Once the dough has rested for approximately 15 minutes, divide the dough into 4 pieces. Re-flour each piece thoroughly. Using a rolling pin, flatten each piece of dough until it is approximately 1/8-inch thick. Using a pizza cutter - cut each piece of dough into strips approximately 1/2-inch wide and each strip into \little nuggets\ approximately 3/4-inch wide. Using the tip of a dinner fork slightly tilted on an angle, press each \nugget\ into the fork tip and roll downward. This will give you a little round piece of dough with ridges. Place the finished gnocchi on a floured pan until the process has been completed with all of the remaining dough. Bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil - add the finished gnocchi carefully to the boiling water and stir completely to avoid sticking. Reduce the heat to a slow boil and cook the gnocchi for approximately 8 minutes or until the desired tenderness is attained. Drain the gnocchi thoroughly using a colander and serve immediately with your favorite sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 59141,&quot;Apple Crumble with Cardamom-Vanilla Caramel Sauce 3 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and sliced Zest and juice of 1 lemon 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch salt 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 2/3 cup brown sugar 2/3 cup oats Pinch salt 1 stick (4-ounces) unsalted butter 2/3 cup sugar 1/4 cup water 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 cup heavy cream or half-and-half 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon cardamom seeds, gently crushed to release oils Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the Apple Filling: In a small bowl, toss the apple slices with the lemon zest, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, and salt, and set aside. To make the Crumble Topping: In another small bowl, mix the flour, brown sugar, oats, and salt with a fork until uniform. In a baking dish, melt the butter in the microwave until about half melts, 10 to 15 seconds on high. Pour the butter into the flour mixture and incorporate with a fork. Leaving the excess butter in the baking dish, arrange the apple slices in the dish. Top with the flour-oat mixture. Bake until the apples are cooked through and the topping is golden, about 45 minutes. To make the Vanilla-Cardamom Caramel Sauce: In a medium-heavy saucepan, mix the water and sugar and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Allow the mixture to boil, without stirring. Cook&#39;s Note: Swirl the pan, if needed. Boil until the sugar mixture is pale golden brown, approximately 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and stirring vigorously add the butter and cream. The mixture will bubble. Add the cardamom seeds and stir to incorporate. Return the pan to the heat and bring the mixture to a boil and then remove from the heat and allow to cool a few minutes. Stir in the vanilla extract and strain the sauce before drizzling over the cobbler. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 59142,&quot;Prosciutto Wrapped Figs And Blue Cheese 8 Black Mission figs 1/2 cup blue cheese, cut into cubes 8 prosciutto (thinly sliced, cut in half lengthwise) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat grill.

Butter two 8-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the parchment and dust with flour, tapping out excess. Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the melted butter, buttermilk, egg, vanilla and 1/2 cup water together in another bowl until smooth. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans, smoothing the tops. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through cooking, until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Discard the parchment paper and flip the cakes right side up again. Let the cakes cool completely. Make the cherry filling: Quarter the cherries and transfer them to a medium bowl with the 2 tablespoons reserved syrup. Combine the gelatin with 1 tablespoon cold water in a small bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Heat the gelatin in the microwave until it melts completely, about 10 seconds, stirring to dissolve. Combine the gelatin, cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, salt and almond extract in a food processor and process until smooth. Scrape the cream cheese mixture into the bowl containing the cherries and stir to combine. Refrigerate, checking every 5 minutes, until the filling is just set enough to spread, 5 to 15 minutes. (Do not let the filling firm up too much.) Place one cake on a cake stand and pile the cherry filling in the center, spreading it in a thick layer almost to the edge. Top with the remaining cake, aligning the layers directly on top of each other so the cake does not lean. Refrigerate the assembled cake for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the chocolate ganache: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan then remove from the heat. Add the chocolate, shaking the pan gently to submerge it. Allow the pan to stand, off the heat, for 3 minutes to melt the chocolate. Whisk the ganache until smooth, then refrigerate until it is just thick enough to spread (like mayonnaise), about 15 minutes. (Do not let the ganache harden too much.) 15 to 20 minutes. (Do not let the ganache harden too much.) Stir the ganache again and scoop it on top of the cake, spreading it over the top and sides.

Beat together the egg and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to low again and slowly pour in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, increasing the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters as needed. Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide into 2 even pieces. Shape each piece into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight. To roll, cut and bake the cookies: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Dust another sheet of parchment paper with flour and put 1 piece of the dough on top. Dust with more flour and top with another sheet of parchment. Roll the dough out between the parchment sheets into a square about 1/4-inch thick (about 11-by-9 inches) and place in the freezer for 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough. From 1 piece of rolled dough, cut out cookies with a 2 1/2-inch cutter and arrange on the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Refrigerate while you cut the remaining cookies. Reroll any scraps of dough and repeat the freezing, cutting and refrigerating process until all the dough is used. Bake, rotating the baking sheets front to back and bottom to top about halfway through, until golden brown around the edges, about 12 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets set on a wire cooling rack, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons water and the vanilla and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes (add up to 1 tablespoon more water, if needed). Tint with a few drops of food coloring if desired. Fit a pastry bag with a small round tip and fill it with the icing.

Combine the chicken, breadcrumbs, roasted red pepper, buttermilk, parsley, oregano, thyme, basil, garlic, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Roll the mixture into 2- to 3-inch balls, though the meatballs can be made into any size desired. Place the meatballs on a lightly-greased baking sheet and roast until cooked through and a little brown, 35 to 40 minutes. For the ricotta cheese Bring the milk, buttermilk, heavy cream and salt to a boil in a large stockpot over medium heat, then turn off the heat and let sit for 30 minutes. Using a very fine strainer or cheesecloth, strain the milk mixture to separate the thick parts, or curds, from the remaining liquid, or whey, over a bowl or container. Discard the whey. For thicker ricotta, let the mixture strain longer so more liquid is removed. Let cool and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve the meatballs hot with your favorite homemade or store-bought tomato sauce and garnish with pieces of ricotta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 59148,&quot;Bucatini With Olive-Caper Sauce Kosher salt 12 ounces bucatini or spaghetti 1 small clove garlic 2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed Pinch of red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound tomatoes, diced 2/3 cup pitted kalamata or nicoise olives, chopped 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, finely chopped Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Prepare 4 (8-ounce) ramekins or a 1 1/2 -quart souffle dish by greasing with softened butter and coating with Parmesan. Make a thick bechamel sauce base by melting 3 tablespoons butter over low-medium heat in a thick-bottomed saucepan. Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to coat the flour and remove the starchy taste, do not allow to brown. Add the hot milk to the roux and continue to whisk until the mixture is smoothly thickened. Remove from heat. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Season with salt, pepper, and mustard. Stir in the cheese and incorporated evenly. Chill while preparing the egg whites. In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar just until they hold soft peaks. Fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the bechamel mixture to lighten it. Then gently fold in the rest. Pour into the prepared ramekins or souffle dish and place on a cookie sheet. Bake on the middle rack for about 25 minutes. The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden and the center giggles slightly. Take care not to over bake.

For the meat sauce: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until it shimmers. Add the cinnamon stick and whole cloves. Add the onion, sprinkle with a little salt and saute until softened but not browned. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add the sausage, breaking up the clumps with your spoon. Cook until the sausage is no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, 1/4 cup chopped basil, as well as some salt and pepper. Stir to combine and simmer uncovered, for about 15 minutes, stirring every now and then.

For the ricotta filling: Stir together the ricotta, 3/4 cup Parmesan, 3/4 cup mozzarella and mango chutney. Season with lots of pepper, about a teaspoon and set aside. To assemble the cupcakes: Pull out your favorite cupcake pan. If your pan is not nonstick, spray the cups with cooking spray. Place a wonton wrapper in each cup. Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re using square ones. Drop about 1 tablespoon of meat sauce into the bottom of each cup. Then add 1 teaspoon of ricotta filling. Then cover with another wonton wrapper, rotating it about 90 degrees so that the corners of the first wrapper and the second wrapper aren&#39;t right on top of each other. Repeat this until you&#39;ve built 3 layers total. Top each with a small basil leaf, then another wonton wrapper. Finish each cupcake with a spoonful of meat sauce, a little shredded mozzarella and pinch of grated Parmesan. Pop them into the oven and bake for 20 minutes.

Bake until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 59216,&quot;Bulgur Breads 1 1/2 cups fine or medium bulgur 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 cups boiling water 1/2 cup minced onion Approximately 2 cups unbleached hard white or all-purpose flour Instructions: You will need a medium-sized bowl, a food processor (optional), unglazed quarry tiles to fit on the bottom rack of your oven, and a rolling pin. Place the bulgur and salt in a food processor, pour the boiling water over, and stir or process briefly to mix. Let stand for thirty minutes. When you come back to the bulgur mixture, it will look like the bulgur has totally absorbed the water. However, proceed by adding 1 cup flour and the minced onion, and process for 1 minute. The dough should come together into a large ball as you process. If it doesn&#39;t, feel the dough: If it feels dry and floury, start the processor, add 2 tablespoons warm water and process for 30 seconds; again if the bulgur and flour still don&#39;t come together, add another 2 tablespoons water and process. Once a ball of dough forms, process for 2 to 3 minutes longer, then turn out onto a well-floured surface. (If your processor is too small to handle the whole dough, work with half at a time, adding 1/2 cup flour to each portion, then combine when you turn out of the processor and knead by hand). Knead by hand for 4 to 5 minutes. Alternatively, if you do not have a food processor, combine bulgur, salt and boiling water in a medium-sized bowl and let stand for 30 minutes. Add onions and 1/2 cup flour and stir in. Add another 1/2 cup flour and use your hands to fold flour into the dough. With a little persistence, you will soon have a dough (although somewhat sticky) that you can knead. Turn out onto a well-floured kneading surface and knead for 6 or 7 minutes. Dough will be sticky at first, but will soon come together into a smooth workable dough; you may be surprised to discover how kneadable bulgur is. When finished kneading, cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand until you are ready to proceed further, for 15 minutes to an hour, whatever is convenient. To bake, have your oven preheated to 450 degrees with baking stone or quarry tiles in place on a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Divide the dough into 8 pieces, and flatten each on a well-floured bread board. With a rolling pin, roll out one or two breads until very thin, about 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Work with only one or two at a time, as many as will fit in your oven. When ready, handle the bread gently as you place it on the hot tiles. (You can also try dusting a peel or the back of a baking sheet with flour and using peel or sheet to transfer breads to hot tiles.) Bake on one side for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes then turn over to the other side for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The bread should begin to brown around the outside. When baked, keep breads warm by stacking them one on top of the other and wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 59217,&quot;Mocha Mousse One 3.9-ounce package instant chocolate pudding mix 1 cup cold milk 1/4 cup strong brewed coffee or espresso, chilled 1 cup heavy whipping cream 3 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons chocolate chips, for garnish Instructions: In a large bowl, stir together the pudding mix with the milk and coffee until very thick. In another large bowl, beat the heavy cream with the sugar and vanilla using an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Reserve 1/4 cup for garnish. Stir one-third of the whipped cream into the pudding to lighten it. Fold the remaining whipped cream gently into the pudding. Spoon into dessert glasses and refrigerate until ready to serve. Mousse can be made ahead up to 4 hours in advance. When ready to serve, top each with a small dollop of the reserved whipped cream and sprinkle with the chocolate chips. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Pinotage]&quot; 59218,&quot;Boundary Road Brick Chicken 2 cups kosher salt<br> 2 cups brown sugar<br> Black pepper<br> 1 handful fresh herbs such as rosemary, thyme or sage<br> 1 head garlic, split horizontally<br> 1 whole hormone-free cage-free vegetarian-fed chicken, cut into quarters, carcass discarded 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> 1 tablespoon chopped capers<br> 1 filet anchovy, chopped<br> 1 clove garlic, finely grated Zest of 1 lemon<br> 1/2 cup olive oil<br> 6 medium red Beauregard (or any other well farmed) sweet potatoes<br> About 1/2 cup cider vinegar<br> A couple knobs cold unsalted butter<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 Spanish onions, medium dice<br> Salt 4 pounds collard greens<br> 1 smoked pig&#39;s foot or ham hock<br> Freshly ground black pepper Champagne or other fine white vinegar<br> Canola oil<br> Instructions: For the chicken and brine: Combine 2 gallons water, the salt, sugar, garlic, herbs and some black pepper in a large pot. Bring to a boil until the salt and sugar are dissolved, and then let cool completely. Submerge the chicken in the brine and let brine in the refrigerator for 4 hours. For the salsa verde: Whisk together the parsley, capers, anchovies, garlic and lemon zest. Slowly stream in the oil while whisking. For the sweet potato mash: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roast the sweet potatoes until completely soft, about 1 hour 30 minutes. While still warm, peel the potatoes and add them to a food processor. With the machine running, add the vinegar, butter and salt and pepper to taste. You may need a little water to get the mixture to puree, but don&#39;t add too much. Reserve. For the collard greens: Saute the onions in a large, wide-bottomed pan. Sprinkle with salt, and then add the greens, a bit more salt and about 1/2 cup water. Slowly cook the greens with the smoked pig&#39;s foot over low heat for at least 1 hour 30 minutes. The water will evaporate and draw the moisture from the greens. Stir occasionally and let them do their thing. Finish the dish by adjusting seasoning with salt, pepper and vinegar. Turn the oven temperature to 450 to 500 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the brine and let it rest and come to room temperature. Dry, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Get your saute pan medium hot; add a good amount of canola oil. Crispy brown skin is the goal here, so mind your heat. Don&#39;t burn it, but make sure the pan is hot enough to keep the chicken from sticking. Add your chicken skin-side down and shake the pan to make sure the skin is not sticking. Add a weight of your choice (we use antique bricks we found in our building, hence the name), and then transfer the pan to the oven. Let it roll for about 10 minutes. Carefully flip the chicken over and let it go for another 6 minutes. All ovens are different, so after the chicken rests for 4 to 5 minutes, check the temperature in the leg to make sure it is thoroughly cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 59219,&quot;Aperol Manhattans 2 cups bourbon 1/2 cup sweet vermouth 1/4 cup Aperol 8 cocktail cherries (such as amarena), plus 2 tablespoons syrup Orange slices, for garnish Instructions: Combine the bourbon, 1 cup cold water, the vermouth, Aperol and cherry syrup in a resealable plastic container. Freeze at least 1 hour. Pour into glasses and add the cherries.

Cover the saucepan, bring the soup to a boil, and cook it over a moderate fire until the peas are tender. Meanwhile, boil 1 cup of fresh peas, in a separate pan, to add to the soup later. Pass the soup through a strainer, or a vegetable mill, pressing the vegetables through with the liquid. Return the soup to the saucepan, add 3 cups of chicken stock, stir well, and simmer over a low fire for about 15 minutes. Then add the extra cup of peas, drained, and 1/4 cup cooked white meat of chicken, cut into very fine julienne strips. Mix 3 egg yolks with 1 1/2 cups of light cream and add this gradually to the soup, stirring constantly. Continue cooking until the soup thickens to a creamy consistency, but do not let it boil. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59227,&quot;Rosemary Couscous 6 tablespoons olive oil 6 rosemary sprigs leaves stripped, plus sprigs for garnish 4 cups Israeli couscous 8 cups chicken stock 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon pepper Instructions: Put the olive oil and rosemary leaves into a large, heavy bottomed saucepan and place over high heat.

Add the chicken stock, salt and pepper, lower the heat and let simmer until all of the stock has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat, fluff with a fork and transfer to a chafer. Garnish with fresh sprigs of rosemary around the sides of the dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 59228,&quot;Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits 280 grams (2 cups) gluten-free all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon whole psyllium husks 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 115 grams (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes, plus 2 tablespoons melted, plus additional for greasing 3/4 cup buttermilk, cold 1/4 cup whole milk yogurt Instructions: Whisk together the flour, psyllium, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and put the bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes. Put the butter cubes on a saucer and put them into the freezer as well. Put the flour mixture into the bowl of a food processor and whirl them up to aerate the flour and combine the ingredients. Add the butter cubes and pulse the food processor until the butter has been broken down into pieces the size of lima beans. Pour in the buttermilk and yogurt and pulse until everything is just combined. Put the biscuit dough onto a piece of parchment paper, being careful to remove the food processor blade. Using the heel of your hand, press the biscuit dough together very gently. Form the dough into a disc 1 inch in height. Grease a 9-inch skillet. Using a biscuit cutter or a small glass, cut straight down into the dough and cut out as many biscuits as possible. (Do not twist the biscuit cutter, as that will blunt the edges of the biscuit dough and prevent them from rising.) Place the biscuits into the prepared skillet, nestling them right up against each other, which will nudge the biscuits to rise taller. Gather all the scraps of dough into another tall disc and cut as many more biscuits as possible. Put the skillet into the freezer for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Take the skillet from the freezer and put it directly into the oven. Bake until the biscuits are firm and light golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter and let them rest in the pan for 10 minutes, then serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 59229,&quot;Pimento and Habenero Mac and Cheese One 16-ounce box pasta (your choice) 2 cups half-and-half (or 1 cup whole milk and 1 cup cream) 1 pound shredded sharp Cheddar 1 cup your favorite pimento cheese (homemade works best) 4 medium habeneros, seeded and chopped 2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper Cayenne pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic but still sticky. Wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. While the dough rests, prepare the Pork Belly (recipe follows) and Chili Vinegar (recipe follows). When the dough has rested, divide into quarters. Place one piece on a lightly floured surface and keep the rest covered with plastic. Roll out until you have a paper-thin 10- to 12-inch circle. Allowing the dough to stick a little to the surface while you roll helps to stretch the dough as thin as possible. This part is a little tricky since the dough is soft and sticky but be patient and don\u2019t use too much flour. Repeat with the rest of the dough. To assemble: Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon of oil, swirl it around to coat, and allow to get hot and shimmery. Gently lay the pancake in the oil. Crack an egg directly onto the pancake. Use the back of a spoon to gently break the yolk, very gently scramble, and then spread it all over the pancake. Sprinkle on a handful of scallions and a handful of the pork belly. Season with salt and black pepper and then press down slightly so the scallions and pork belly stick to the egg. Continue to cook until the egg is mostly set and the underside of the pancake has golden brown spots. Using a spatula, carefully flip and cook, egg side down, for about 30 seconds, or until the egg is completely set and has some brown spots. The pork will also render out some fat and get sizzly. Flip the pancake back over and allow the pancake to get nice and crisp, 30 seconds. Slide the pancake onto a cutting board. Squeeze some mayonnaise on top and a drizzle of sambal, if using. Roll up and slice in half. Repeat to make 3 more pancakes. Serve with Chili Vinegar (see recipe below) for dipping. *Alternatively, this recipe can be made with 16 slices of roughly chopped, cooked, thick-cut bacon by eliminating the braise in the pressure cooker. Simply cook the bacon to desired doneness and skip to the step of applying the bacon onto the egg as it cooks in the pan on the pancake. To serve, drizzle with hoisin sauce, mayo and sambal. Serve with the chili vinegar for dipping. Sprinkle the pork belly on all sides with black pepper. Into the insert-pot of a pressure cooker add the soy sauce, vinegar, water and hoisin sauce and whisk to combine. Place the pork belly in the pot, skin side up (it should be mostly submerged but if the skin peeks out a little it\u2019s fine). Add the ginger, garlic and chili pepper, if using. Seal with the lid, bring to HIGH pressure and cook for 30 minutes. Carefully release the pressure, away from your face, allowing all the steam to dissipate before opening the lid. Using tongs, remove the belly to a cooling rack set over a sheet pan to both cool slightly and drain of excess braising liquid. Alternatively, the pork belly can be braised in a Dutch oven at 350 degrees F for about 2 hours, covered. Discard the braising liquid. Roughly chop the pork belly into bite-size pieces. Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add the chopped pork to the pan and fry for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until crispy. Set aside. Alternatively, the pork belly can be braised in a Dutch oven at 350 degrees F for about 2 hours, covered. Discard the braising liquid. Roughly chop the pork belly into bite-size pieces. Combine all the ingredients into a small mixing bowl.

Add pancetta, onion, cl flakes, soybean paste, cl paste, sugar and pepper and process until fairly smooth. Set the pancetta mixture aside. Crumble the beef into a large bowl. Add the seltzer, sesame seeds, pancetta mixture and some salt and pepper and gently mix together with your hands, being careful not to overwork the mixture. Form the mixture into 4 patties, each about 1 inch thick and 4 inches wide. Create a depression in the center of one side of each patty, as burgers tend to rise in the middle during cooking and this will help the burgers come out flat. If not cooking immediately, cover the patties and refrigerate. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Put the patties in the skillet depression-side up and cook, flipping halfway through, until browned and cooked through, about 7 minutes total. Meanwhile, heat a two-burner griddle/grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Spread both sides of the buns with the butter and cook cut-side down until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. (If working in batches, toast the bottom buns first.) Transfer to individual plates. Put a patty on each bottom bun and top with lettuce and then the Cucumber Kimchi. Smear some Korean Ketchup and Doenjang Mayonnaise on the top buns and place on the burgers. Secure with bamboo skewers or long toothpicks and serve immediately. Cut each cucumber crosswise into 2-inch slices with a small knife. Stand the slices on their cut sides and cut each one two-thirds of the way down into quarters, keeping them attached at the bottom. Sprinkle the cucumbers with the salt, spreading the cucumbers open to get the salt deep inside the cuts. Arrange the cucumbers with their cross-cut sides up in a single layer in a glass or other nonreactive container that is at least 2 inches tall and that has a tight-fitting lid. Cover and let soften at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine the scallions, onion, cl flakes, shrimp, garlic, ginger and 2 tablespoons water in a food processor. Pulse until a coarse spice paste forms, then stir in the chives. Rinse the salted cucumbers well under cold water, making sure to rid the crevices of all the salt. Shake dry and then press the spice paste all over and into the crevices of each piece. Return the cucumbers to the (rinsed) container, cross-cut sides up, packing them somewhat tightly and pressing in any remaining spice paste and liquid. Cover and let the cucumbers ferment at room temperature for about 24 hours. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Stir together the ketchup and cl paste in a small bowl.

Season lamb osso bucco liberally with salt and pepper and set aside on a plate. In a heavy-bottomed roasting pan over medium-high heat, heat olive oil on stove top. Carefully place the osso bucco in the hot roasting pan and sear all sides, until nicely browned. Once seared on all sides, remove from pan and set back onto plate. Using the same pot with the lamb drippings in the bottom, add carrots, celery, onions, and garlic. Saute for approximately 10 minutes using a wooden spoon to scrape the lamb drippings off the bottom of the pan and to caramelize the vegetables. Once caramelized, add tomato paste, coat the vegetables with the paste, and brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the red wine to deglaze the pan, scraping the drippings off the bottom of pan using a wooden spoon. Reduce the wine by half and add the Lamb Stock and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Place the seared osso bucco back into the pan. Change to high heat and once the stock starts to boil, put roasting pan into the oven. Cook the osso bucco for about 2 hours until it is fork tender, almost falling off the bone. You will want to turn the osso bucco every half hour so that it cooks evenly and does not burn on the bottom. When finished, take the lamb out of the sauce and set aside. In a blender, blend the sauce until the vegetables are pureed. Place about a 1/4 cup of sauce into the bottom of each serving bowl, top with osso bucco and drizzle with a little more sauce. It is best served with roasted carrots, onions, and potatoes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large roasting pan, roast lamb bones in the oven until dark brown. On a sheet tray, roast carrots, celery, and onion in the oven until browned as well. Place the bones and vegetables in a 4-gallon stock pot. Add 2 gallons cold water, salt and pepper, and bay leaves, if desired. Bring to a boil over high heat and then turn down to a simmer over medium-low heat. Simmer for 4 to 5 hours to get the best results. If using lamb base, roast vegetables as explained above. In a 4-gallon stock pot, add 2 gallons water and whisk in lamb base. Add the roasted vegetables and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer for approximately 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 59304,&quot;Turon 24 8-by-8-inch square frozen lumpia wrappers or spring roll shells 4 very ripe plantains<br> One 12-ounce jar jackfruit in syrup<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for frying Instructions: Defrost the spring roll shells in the package on the countertop for 30 minutes.

Mix together the salt and brown sugar and the porcini, cl de arbol and garlic powders in a bowl, using your fingers to make sure all the ingredients are evenly distributed. Rub the steak generously on all sides with the spice rub. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and leave to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. Preheat a cast-iron pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add enough olive oil to coat the bottom. Unwrap the steak and add it to the pan; cook until well charred on all sides. Remove the steak to a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and roast until medium-rare, about 6 minutes. Allow the steak to rest for 4 to 5 minutes, then cut the steak off the bone and slice it across the grain, on the bias. For the chili lobster: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the coriander, celery, halved garlic head, lemon, thyme, white wine and a good amount of salt. Add the lobster and poach for 6 minutes. Remove the lobster to a baking sheet to cool. In a large saute pan, add enough oil to coat the bottom. Add the 5 garlic cloves, chili paste and some salt and cook over medium heat until the garlic turns golden brown and the mixture fragrant. Pull the claws off the lobster and set aside. Set the body upside down on a cutting board and slice the entire lobster in half lengthwise. Discard the contents inside the head and body cavities, leaving the tail meat intact. Remove the meat from the claws and add it to the garlic-chili sauce; cook just until the meat is warmed through. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside. Place the lobster halves cut-side down in the sauce and sear for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the lobster to a plate. With the pan off the heat, stir in the parsley. In a small bowl mix together the arugula, red onion and a tablespoon of the garlic-chili sauce from the pan. Season with salt and toss to coat. Assembly: Place some of the arugula reserved for garnish on one side of a serving platter and lay the sliced steak over it. Pour any meat juices from the baking sheet over the steak. Arrange the lobster halves on the other side of the platter and fill the cavities with some of the arugula salad. Top with the warmed claw meat and pour a couple tablespoons of the garlic-chili sauce over the lobster. Drizzle both steak and lobster with big fat finishing oil (extra-virgin olive oil). &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 59315,&quot;Popovers 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 eggs, room temperature 1 1/4 cups whole milk, room temperature 1 tablespoon lightly salted butter, melted, plus additional for greasing the molds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a nonstick, standard 12 muffin tin and place in the oven to heat while you prepare the batter. In a large bowl, sift together the flour and salt. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and melted butter until blended. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and use a whisk to mix them together. Fill each hole in the muffin tin between 2/3 and 3/4 full. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until they develop a nice brown color, an additional 15 minutes; they should feel crusty. Opening the oven door while popovers bake increases the chances they will deflate so look through the window but don&#39;t give in to temptation! Remove the tin from the oven and turn the popovers out onto a flat surface to cool. Pierce the sides with the tip of a small knife to allow steam to escape as they cool. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59316,&quot;Joan Rombauer&#39;s Beef Brisket with Spicy Barbecue Sauce 2 beef briskets, approximately 5 pound each, trim the fat 4 to 6 (14-ounce) cans beef broth Spicy Barbecue Sauce, recipe follows 2 teaspoons dry mustard 2/3 cups apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup chili sauce 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce 2 medium onions diced Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine ingredients and add to beef brisket during the last hour of cooking. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah]&quot; 59317,&quot;Giant Bacon-Cheddar Juicy Lucy Burger 2 tablespoons Montreal steak seasoning, such as McCormick? Grill Mates? Montreal Steak Seasoning 2 pounds 80 percent lean ground beef (preferably a mix of chuck and brisket) 8 ounces sliced medium or sharp white Cheddar<br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup yellow mustard, such as French&#39;s? Classic Yellow Mustard 8 long pickle slices (from a pickle that&#39;s been cut lengthwise), plus 2 tablespoons brine<br> One 10-inch round loaf soft bread, such as a boule, cut in half horizontally Olive oil, for the grill grates and bread Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large heirloom tomato, thinly sliced<br> 1 small red onion, thinly sliced<br> 8 slices bacon, cooked 2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce Instructions: Line a 9-inch round cake pan with aluminum foil. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of the Montreal steak seasoning. Press half of the ground beef into the cake pan. Layer the cheese in the middle, leaving a 1/2- to 1-inch border around the side. Sprinkle with another 2 teaspoons of the Montreal steak seasoning. Top with the remaining ground beef in an even layer and press to seal in the cheese. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 teaspoons Montreal steak seasoning. Lift out the burger from the cake pan using the foil and flatten it with your hands to about 11 inches in diameter. Refrigerate until ready to cook; the burger can be assembled up to 2 hours in advance. Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard and pickle brine in a small bowl until smooth. Cover and refrigerate.<br> Remove most of the soft insides from the top of the loaf of bread to make it fairly hollow. Reserve for another use.<br> Prepare a grill for direct and indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the side burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling. Oil the grill grates. Hold the burger on the foil bottom and flip it onto the indirect-heat side of the grill; peel off the foil. Cook until the sides of the burger are cooked and it feels firm when you lift it with a spatula, 8 to 10 minutes depending on the heat of your grill. Using 2 spatulas, carefully flip the burger (if you have a large fish spatula, use it here); try not to create any holes through which the cheese could escape. Cover the grill and cook until the burger is cooked through and the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes more. (If you would like more char on the burger, move it to the direct-heat side of the grill for 1 to 2 minutes per side.)

Grease one side of 2 to 3 sheets of parchment paper. Lay them butter-side up inside a 10-inch springform pan, arranging so that they cover all sides, and crimping the edges to ensure they stay in place. Place the springform pan on a sheet tray. In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese, granulated sugar and salt. Cream on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides. Turn the mixer down to medium and add the condensed milk. Beat to combine, then scrape down the bowl. Add the heavy cream, fresh ginger, ground ginger, vanilla and minced lemon zest. Fully combine, then scrape down the sides. Turn the mixer to medium-high and add the eggs one at a time, being sure that each is fully combined before adding the next. Add the flour, then beat again, scraping down the sides. Pour the cheesecake into the center of the springform pan and tap it lightly on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake for 30 minutes, then rotate. Continue to bake until dark golden brown, another 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until completely set, 6 hours. Remove the cheesecake from the pan, then peel down the paper. (You can leave the paper in place for a rustic look.)

You do not want to bring the milk to boil or it will be too hot and kill the yeast. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast over the mixture. Stir once or twice and set aside until it becomes foamy, about 5 minutes. Put the raisins in a small bowl and add 2 tablespoons water. Heat in the microwave on high until the raisins plump, about 45 seconds. Whisk both flours with the salt in a small bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until the sugar is dissolved and the eggs have lightened in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed of the mixer to low and slowly pour in the yeast mixture. Beat until smooth, and then add the flour mixture. Beat until just blended, and then switch to a dough hook and continue to mix the dough until it is soft, just a bit sticky and forms a loose ball shape, about 5 minutes. At this point touch the dough; it should only leave a small bit of sticky dough on your finger. If more than a bit sticks to your finger, add more all-purpose flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the right level of stickiness. Do not add more than 1/4 cup of flour or your dough will be dry and tough. Beat in the soaked raisins and any of the liquid in the dish until blended into the dough. Coat a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray, add the dough and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface lightly dusted with all-purpose flour. Pat into a 15-by-10-inch rectangle. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and brush over the dough. Top with the apple butter, cinnamon and brown sugar. Fold in half from top to bottom to get a 16-by-6-inch piece of dough, and then cut into 24 strips. Twist and stretch, and then place on a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between each strip. Loosely cover with a piece of plastic wrap until the strips have doubled in size, about 1 hour longer. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and brush over the twists. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar with 1 to 2 teaspoons very hot water until a smooth thick glaze, and brush over the warm twists. Serve warm.

Salt the water and cook the pasta shy of al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. While the water comes to a boil, heat the EVOO in a Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and remove some of the drippings, leaving a thin layer. Add the beef, brown and crumble, but leave a few larger pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Once the beef has caramelized, add the onions and cook to tender. Add the stock and Worcestershire, then reduce the heat to low. In a saucepot over medium to medium-high heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour, cook 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and season with salt and pepper. Thicken to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the cheese. When the cheese has melted into the sauce, stir in the mustard, ketchup, relish and hot sauce. Combine the pasta with the sauce and fold in the meat. Place in a large casserole dish. Cool and store for a make-ahead meal. To serve, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring the casserole to room temp then bake until brown and bubbly on top and golden at edges, 45 to 50 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 59330,&quot;Dipped Chocolate Anything 2 pounds good-quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped into bean-size pieces (by hand or in a food processor) Pretzels, graham crackers, dried fruit or anything, for dipping Instructions: Melt 1 1/2 pounds chocolate in top of a double boiler (or clean metal bowl set over simmering water). Remove chocolate from heat when it reaches between 110 and 115 degrees F on a candy thermometer. To bring into tempering range, add remaining chocolate to the mixture and stir constantly with a rubber spatula until the thermometer registers 82 to 84 degrees. Put chocolate back over the hot water and bring temperature to between 88 and 91 degrees. Be careful not to let the temperature fall too far or you will have to gently re-warm the mixture; if the temperature rises above 91 degrees in the tempering step, you will have to start the process over. Once tempered, use immediately for dipping. Store tempered chocolate at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59331,&quot;Cheese Puffs (Gougeres) 1/2 cup milk 1 stick (4 ounces/113 grams) unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup (120 grams) all-purpose flour 3 to 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1 cup grated Cheddar cheese 1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Set aside. In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup water with the milk, butter, sugar and salt and stir over low heat until the sugar, butter and salt have melted. Raise the heat to medium and bring to a healthy simmer. Take from the heat and immediately add the flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens, is smooth and no flour lumps remain. Return to the heat and cook, stirring, until a film forms on the bottom of the pan. Continue stirring, careful not to scrape up the film, for a minute or two more. Transfer the mixture (panade) to a food processor. Mix for a minute to dissipate the heat. Add the eggs one at a time with the processor running. Pay attention to the consistency of the paste. It should be smooth and shiny, so you may only need 3 of the eggs. Stir in the cheese. Using a small cookie scoop, scoop generous mounds onto the parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them an inch apart. Place in the oven, immediately reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cheese puffs are golden brown.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59332,&quot;Poinsettia Cocktail 1/4 cup vodka 1/4 cup Champagne 1/2 cup cranberry juice Crushed ice 2 strips orange zest, each about 1/4-inch wide and 2 inches long Instructions: Combine the vodka, Champagne and juice in a large-stemmed red wine glass. Add crushed ice and stir until the mixture is well chilled. Twist the orange strips over the glass, drop them in, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 59333,&quot;4-Cheese Flatbreads 1/2 cup grated fontina cheese 1/2 cup grated mozzarella<br> 1/4 cup mascarpone, at room temperature<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning<br> 2 garlic or plain naans, defrosted if frozen<br> 2 tablespoons pesto<br> Red pepper flakes, optional<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Mix together the four cheeses and Italian seasoning in a bowl. Place the naan on a sheet pan and spread each piece with a tablespoon of the pesto. Spread the cheese mixture on the naan. Bake until the cheese is melted, bubbly and lightly golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with pepper flakes, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barbera, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 59334,&quot;Pasta e Patate: Pasta and Potato Soup 1/4 cup/50 ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling 4 ounces/100 g prosciutto or salami, chopped 1 white onion, chopped 1 celery, coarsely chopped 1 carrot, coarsely chopped 1 fresh cl pepper, chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 potatoes, peeled and cubed 2 1/2 cups/600 ml water 10 ounces/300 g tomato puree 10 ounces/300 g spaghetti, broken into small pieces 1/2 cup/125 ml Pecorino cheese, chopped 1/2 cup/125 ml freshly grated cheese Parmigiano Instructions: Heat up extra-virgin olive oil in a deep saucepan. Add the prosciutto or salami and cook until crisp. To make the &#39;soffritto&#39;, add the onion, celery, carrot, cl pepper, salt, and black pepper. Saute until the onion becomes soft, and then add the potatoes. Stir to prevent the potatoes from sticking to the pan. Add the water and tomato puree. Add the spaghetti to the pot. Mix together well and add the Pecorino cheese. Add water, a little at a time periodically and cook for a few minutes until the soup is creamy and thickened. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with Parmigiano cheese. Allow the soup to cool and thicken. Serve the soup at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 59335,&quot;Chicken Karahi 2 pounds of boneless chicken cut into medium size cubes (can use chicken with bones, but cut into very small pieces, about 3 inches in length) Salt to taste 4 green chilies, coarsely chopped (any kind, preferably the thin long ones) 10 whole black peppercorns 1/4 cup water 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil or any vegetable oil 2 pounds of fresh red tomatoes, coarsely chopped Red chili powder to taste 2-inch piece of fresh ginger julienned Chopped cilantro for garnish Instructions: Wash and dry chicken pieces properly. Put the chicken pieces in a medium sized saucepan. Add salt to taste, green chilies, peppercorns, and water and place on stove on high heat. Once the water starts to boil, reduce heat to low and cook chicken until tender and the liquid has evaporated. If the chicken sticks and is not cooked add a little more water. While the above is being done, in a separate \karahi, which is an Indian/ Pakistani Wok, (or you can use a Chinese wok also) add the olive oil, tomatoes, some salt and red chili powder (around one teaspoon for medium hot or two teaspoons for hot). Cook on medium heat until the tomatoes are tender and reduced to a sauce like consistency. Add the cooked chicken pieces to the sauce. Reduce heat to very low so that the sauce absorbs and coats the chicken pieces. Add the julienned ginger and green chilies to the chicken. Simmer for around five minutes. Before serving sprinkle on chopped cilantro and serve in the Karahi, with hot pita bread or any available Indian bread from the market. The dish is best eaten fresh off the stove with \Dal\ as an accompaniment. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 59336,&quot;Kale and Artichoke Chicken Casserole 2 bunches kale, tough center stems removed, chopped into 2-inch pieces 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 small onion, finely chopped<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 3/4 cup 2 percent milk<br> 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth<br> 8 ounces frozen artichoke hearts, thawed and roughly chopped<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne<br> 4 tablespoons grated Parmesan Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the baking dish 2 tablespoons panko breadcrumbs<br> Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the kale and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain, squeeze out any moisture and dry very well. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then add it to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden on some sides and most of the pink is no longer visible, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon (the chicken will not be fully cooked). Reduce the heat to medium. Add another tablespoon of oil if the skillet is dry, then add the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Slowly pour in the milk while stirring constantly to dissolve the flour, then stir in the chicken broth. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a simmer while stirring. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add the kale, artichokes and cayenne, then add the chicken and any collected juices. Cook, stirring, until the kale and artichokes are hot and the chicken is just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the Parmesan. Preheat the broiler to high. Spray an 8-inch broiler-proof baking dish with cooking spray and spoon the mixture inside. Top with the panko and remaining tablespoon Parmesan. Broil about 3 inches from the element until golden brown in spots, about 3 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 59337,&quot;Pulled Pork 3 tablespoons pimenton 2 tablespoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons cayenne 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon celery salt 1 tablespoon dry mustard 1 (bone-in 7 to 9-pound) Boston butt, \X\ patterns cut in the fat cap 1 beer 3 cups apple cider vinegar 2 cloves garlic, smashed 2 Fresno chilies, sliced in half 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup tomato paste 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 12 burger buns, toasted Broccoli Stem and Carrot Slaw, recipe follows 6 broccoli stems (save the tops for something else), peeled and julienned on a mandolin 4 carrots, peeled and julienned on a mandolin 3 celery ribs, julienned 1 red onion, julienned 1 Granny Smith apple, skin on, julienned 1/2 cup julienned cornichons 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1 clove garlic, smashed and finely chopped Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Combine all the spices for the rub and massage it into the meat. Place the rubbed pork in a roasting pan and pour the beer into the pan. Cover it with foil and roast for 6 hours. Check it periodically just to make sure everything is going along just fine, turning it over every 2 hours. Remove the foil and roast until the pork has reached an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, about another 3 hours. Remove it from the oven, cover it loosely with foil, and let it rest for 30 minutes. Sometime during the marathon cook time, make the sauce. In a small saucepan combine all the ingredients and bring to a boil. Taste it to make sure it is delicious. Remove the chiles. When the sauce is cool, I recommend putting it in a squeeze bottle for easy use. Remove the bone from the pork, it should slide right out. Using your hands with dish gloves on, or with two forks, start to \pull\ the pork into long shreds. Get rid of the fat and anything else that doesn&#39;t look delicious. Serve the pork on burger buns with a drizzle of vinegar sauce to your liking and top with Broccoli Stem and Carrot Slaw. Combine all the ingredients. Season with salt to make sure it is delicious. Let sit for at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 59338,&quot;Watermelon-Jalapeno Cooler 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded 2 sprigs fresh thyme 5 cups chopped, seeded watermelon Ice, for serving Instructions: Combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes. Add the jalapeno and thyme and let it infuse for 5 minutes. Remove the jalapeno and thyme and set aside. Pour the simple syrup and chopped watermelon into a blender. Blend until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Serve cold over ice and garnish with the sugary sprigs of thyme. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 59339,&quot;Apricot Couscous Extra-virgin olive oil 1 small red onion, small dice</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/Turn the oven up.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Toast%20chiles%20on%20a%20griddle.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Toast chiles on a griddle</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/Vegetable%20oil.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Vegetable oil</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
