Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Whisk the all-purpose four, almond flour and salt together in a bowl. In another bowl, beat the butter and granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the egg and almond extract until combined. Slowly beat in the dry ingredients in 2 additions, mixing just until incorporated. Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and roll into a disk or log. Refrigerate until slightly firm, about 1 hour. Scoop the dough into balls, each about 2 tablespoons. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Press a 1/2-inch-deep thumbprint into the center of each ball. Bake the cookies until the edges just start to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. (For even baking, rotate the pans halfway through.) While the cookies are still warm, use the back of a teaspoon to redefine the thumbprints. Allow the cookies to cool completely. Place the confectioners\u2019 sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and generously dust the cookies with the sugar. Fill each thumbprint with about 3/4 teaspoon jam. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 25611,&quot;Herb-Marinated Rack of Lamb 2 lamb racks (about 8 to 9 ribs each) 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons 4 garlic cloves, unpeeled and crushed 2 (4-inch) rosemary sprigs, crushed 6 thyme sprigs, crushed 4 rosemary sprigs, for garnish Freshly ground black pepper Sea salt Instructions: Clean the rib bones well by scraping off meat and sinew with a small sharp knife. Cut the racks in 1/2 so that each has four ribs. Mix together the olive oil, crushed garlic, crushed rosemary and thyme sprigs in a large bowl. Add the lamb and coat well. Grind some coarse black pepper over all. Wrap well and marinate the racks overnight. The next day remove the lamb from the marinade and scrape off as many herbs as possible. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season the lamb well with salt; no additional pepper should be necessary, and sear fat side down until golden, about 7 minutes. Turn over so that the fat side is up and roast in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Let the rack rest for 10 minutes before cutting. To serve, cut each lamb rack into 4 equal pieces, 2 bones per chop and serve on individual plates or a platter with the accompaniments of your choice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 25612,&quot;Almost-Famous Pecan Waffles 3/4 cup pecans 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 large egg 1 cup whole milk 1/2 cup buttermilk 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for brushing and topping 1/4 cup vegetable shortening, melted and cooled Maple syrup, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the pecans on a baking sheet; bake until toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool, then chop. Reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F. Whisk the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a large bowl. Whisk the egg, milk, buttermilk and vanilla in a separate bowl until combined. Stir the egg mixture, melted butter and shortening into the dry ingredients until just combined. (The batter will be lumpy.) Preheat a waffle iron and brush with melted butter. Ladle some batter into the iron (about 1/2 cup, depending on your waffle iron); sprinkle with 2 tablespoons toasted pecans. Cook until golden brown, then transfer the waffle to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining batter. Top the waffles with butter and maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25613,&quot;Banana-Walnut Bran Muffins Cooking spray 1 1/4 cups whole-wheat pastry flour or white whole-wheat flour 1/2 cup bran flakes 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon walnuts, toasted and finely chopped 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Fine salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream 2 ripe medium bananas, mashed 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Turbinado sugar for sprinkling, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-muffin tin with paper liners and spray with cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, bran flakes, 1/3 cup of the chopped walnuts, baking powder, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, baking soda and nutmeg in a large bowl. Whisk together the brown sugar, oil, sour cream, bananas, eggs and vanilla in a medium bowl. Add the wet mixture into the dry mixture and gently fold until just incorporated (it&#39;s OK if there are lumps in the batter). Evenly divide the batter among the muffin cups and sprinkle each with some of the remaining 1 tablespoon walnuts and turbinado sugar if using. Bake until the muffins are golden brown, bounce back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes, then remove and cool completely on a rack. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 25614,&quot;Pisco Maria (Bloody Mary with Pisco) 5 ounces pisco 2 teaspoons prepared horseradish 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons aji Amarillo puree, or 1/4 teaspoon habanero hot sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 stalks celery, plus 4 small inner stalks with leaves, for garnish Ice, for serving 2 cups tomato juice, chilled Instructions: Puree the pisco, horseradish, lemon juice, aji Amarillo puree, soy sauce, Worcestershire, pepper and large celery stalks in a blender until smooth.<br> Divide the puree among 4 tall glasses filled with ice. Top with tomato juice and stir. Garnish each glass with a leafy celery stalk. &quot;,&quot;[Pisco, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 25615,&quot;Latin Burgers with Caramelized Onion and Jalapeno Relish and Red Pepper Mayonnaise 3/4 pound ground sirloin 3/4 pound ground chuck 1/2 pound raw chorizo, casings removed and crumbled 1 tablespoon adobo seasoning 1 large onion, grated 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 large yellow onions, finely sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup bottled and sliced jalapeno chiles, drained 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 2 medium jarred roasted red bell peppers, drained 3/4 cup mayonnaise 6 slices Oaxaca cheese or mozzarella 6 hamburger rolls Instructions: In a large bowl, mix thoroughly by hand the ground beef, the chorizo, the adobo seasoning, the grated onion and the bread crumbs. Form the burgers into 6 patties without pressing them too much or they can become tough. Line a baking pan with waxed paper and put the burgers side-by-side in a single layer. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This will help the burgers hold together. If you make more than you need just separate with waxed paper and insert into a storage freezer bag for future use.; Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper. Add the jalapeno chiles and the brown sugar. Saute for 15 minutes or until the onion and the chiles are caramelized and soft. Set aside.; Drain the roasted red peppers and put them in a blender or food processor. Add the mayonnaise, and season with salt and pepper. Puree the mayonnaise and roasted red peppers until well combined and the mixture is smooth. NOTE: This may be done up to 2 days ahead of time, and in fact the flavor will be more complete with an overnight chilling.; Preheat an outdoor grill or grill pan on the stove top over medium-high heat. Place the burgers on the hot grill or pan until cooked to desired doneness. Due to the raw chorizo in the recipe, at least medium-well is recommended, approximately 10 minutes on each side. In the last 5 minutes of cooking, top the burgers with the slices of cheese so it can melt. If your grill has a lid, putting it on briefly will help the cheese melt quickly and evenly. To serve: Spread about 1 tablespoon of the red pepper mayonnaise on both sides of the rolls. Lay a burger on the bottom halves, and top with a couple of spoonfuls of the caramelized onion and jalapeno relish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 25616,&quot;Grilled Corn with Chiles 6 ears fresh sweet corn, husks on 1 habanero pepper, seeded, stemmed and lightly toasted 1 cl negro, seeded, stemmed and lightly toasted 11/2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns 1/2 bunch thyme leaves 1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped 4 garlic cloves 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the grill. Pull down the corn husks, but don&#39;t remove them. Extract the silk and rewrap the husks around the corn. Soak the ears in cold water for 30 minutes. In a blender or food processor, combine the remaining ingredients. Pulse intermittently to make a paste. Remove the corn from the water, pull back the husks and drain thoroughly. Spread the paste over the kernels. Rewrap the husks, then arrange the corn on the hot grill. Cook, turning often, for about 15 minutes, or until the husks are lightly charred. Serve in the husks. Optional serving style: After removing corn from water, drain, rewrap in husks and grill. When done, remove from grill, cut corn into 1inch rings and toss with the cl paste.

Set over low heat and cook, stirring often, about 15 minutes until cheese melts and mixture is smooth, or microwave 5 minutes on HIGH in covered, microwave-safe casserole, stirring once at halftime. Serve warm with corn chips or bite-size broccoli or cauliflower florets, celery, carrot, or zucchini sticks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Zinfandel]&quot; 25618,&quot;Vegetable Pad Thai 1 (12-ounce) pack dried rice stick noodles (sen lek) 6 eggs 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 tablespoons smashed garlic 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion 1/2 cup red bell peppers, julienned 1/2 cup green bell peppers, julienned 1/2 cup ground peanut 1/2 cup fish sauce 1/2 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup sugar 2 teaspoons Thai pepper powder 1 cup fresh bean sprouts, for garnish 1/4 cup shelled peanuts, for garnish 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: Soak the rice stick noodles in tepid water for about 15 minutes. Remove them to a cutting board and cut into 4-inch pieces then place in a strainer to let all water drain off, and set aside. Coat the bottom of an omelette pan with a small amount of oil and pour off excess. Beat the eggs together and add to pan forming a thin layer, and cook as you would a thin omelette. Remove from heat and chop cooked egg roughly and set aside, keeping warm until ready to serve. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a wok or large skillet and add garlic, onion, and red and green peppers, and cook for 2 minutes. One at a time, add the ground peanut, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar and pepper powder, stirring the mixture the entire time. (Note: chicken, shrimp, or tofu can be added to this dish at the saute stage.) Add the noodles and be sure to stir! The noodles tend to burn if not continuously stirred. Check to see if the taste of the dish is suitable to you, if not, then add in either fish sauce or soy sauce (both salty), or sugar (sweet). (Here is where a matter of preference comes into play.) To serve, place the noodle mixture on a plate, top with cooked egg and garnish with bean sprouts, peanuts and cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 25619,&quot;Tres Leches Coconut Cupcakes with Dulce de Leche Buttercream 1/4 cup shortening 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 1 cup sugar 3 eggs, separated 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup evaporated milk 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk 1/2 cup coconut milk 1 cup lightly toasted flaked coconut (Mounds or Angel Flake brand) 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk (Eagle brand) 2 egg yolks 3/4 cup sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup water 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 14 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened to room temperature 1 cup powdered sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, cream the shortening, butter, and sugar until light and fluffy on medium speed; add egg yolks 1 at a time, beating until all the yellow disappears. Add the vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Add alternately with the buttermilk to the creamed mixture beginning and ending with the flour. In a small bowl, beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold into cake batter. Fill standard paper-lined muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to wire rack that has been placed over a baking sheet to cool. While cupcakes are still warm, stir together the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and the coconut milk. Using a meat injector needle, inject each cupcake in several different spots with about 1/2 to 3/4-ounce of the mixture. Or, poke several holes in the top of each of the cupcakes with a 1/4-inch wooden skewer. Pour the milk mixture over each cupcake while they are still warm, filling each hole. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight before icing. For the Buttercream: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. To make the dulce de leche, pour the sweetened condensed milk into a glass pie plate and cover with foil. Place in a larger roasting pan where pie plate can sit flat. Pour hot water into the roasting pan to a depth of about halfway up the pie plate. Place in oven and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. Stir until smooth. Place egg yolks in a medium mixing bowl. Stir the sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a small, heavy saucepan. Whisk in the water first, then the dulce de leche and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Remove from heat. Gradually whisk the dulce de leche mixture into the 2 egg yolks. Stir in the vanilla. Strain through a wire mesh strainer into a small bowl and set aside to cool completely. Beat the butter on high speed in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the cooled dulce de leche mixture. Beat in the 1 cup powdered sugar until smooth and spreadable. Frost each cupcake with a generous amount of dulce de leche buttercream. Refrigerate any remaining buttercream for another use. Sprinkle each cupcake with toasted coconut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 25620,&quot;Reasonable Crabmeat Saute 4 thin slices of white bread Melted butter for brushing 2 tablespoons butter 2 carrots, grated 8 ounces lump crabmeat, picked over 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup each finely chopped chives, basil, mint and parsley Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Lightly toast the bread and brush both sides with melted butter; divide each slice in half diagonally and set on a dinner plate. Heat the butter in a skillet. When the foaming subsides, add the carrots and saute for a couple of minutes or until the carrots just begin to soften. Add the crabmeat and stir for a minute just to heat up. Add the lemon zest and juice and herbs; saute for 30 seconds and remove from heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25621,&quot;Deep-Fried Saffron-Parmesan Sticks 1/2 teaspoon tightly-packed saffron threads 1/2 pound good-quality young Parmesan cheese, such as Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padana, less than 3 years old 4 cups sunflower oil, for deep-frying 1 egg yolk 1 1/2 cups ice water 1 1/2 cups sifted flour, plus extra for coating Instructions: In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Add saffron and boil 2 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Use a sharp knife to cut Parmigiano-Reggiano into thin slices. Cheese will not cut evenly, but any shape 2 to 3 inches long and no more than 1/4 inch thick will work well. In a small bowl combine cheese with saffron liquid and marinate 6 hours. In a deep-fryer heat oil to 365 degrees. In a bowl beat egg yolk; add water, stirring lightly to blend. Add 1 1/2 cups flour all at once and stir gently with a fork or chopstick until just blended. Do not overblend; batter will be lumpy. Piece by piece, coat cheese pieces with extra flour; dip pieces thoroughly in batter, then quickly toss in hot oil (don&#39;t wait for extra batter to drip off). Cook 2 to 3 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden and crisp. Using a slotted spoon, scoop up cheese and drain on paper towels. Keep warm while you fry remainder. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 25622,&quot;Mixed Fruit Tart 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces and slightly softened at room temperature 1 egg yolk 6 ounces almonds, toasted, and cooled 2/3 cup sugar 8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 2 eggs 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 3/4 cup plus 1/4 cup apricot preserves Assorted fresh fruit, including strawberries, kiwi, mango, blackberries, fig, blueberries, and star fruit, sliced 2 tablespoons water Instructions: To make the crust, put the flour in a large bowl. Add the sugar and mix. Using your hands, make a well in the center. Place the butter pieces and egg yolk in the well. Using your fingers, work the butter and egg yolk together until well combined then work the butter-egg mixture into the flour mixture until combined. The dough will be crumbly, but when you squeeze a handful in your hand, it should hold together. Sprinkle into a 10-inch pie or tart pan. Press the dough firmly and evenly onto the bottom of the pan. Make ropes of the dough and press them onto the walls, making sure not to let the crust thicken at the corners. It should make a clean right angle where the sides meet the bottom. Chill the crust at least 30 minutes or, covered, up to 3 days. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To make the frangipane filling, in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, pulse the almonds and sugar just until sandy. Do not over-process, or the mixture will become pasty. Add the butter and process just until blended. Add the eggs and process until blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the vanilla and flour, and process until smooth (you have just made a frangipane). Spoon the frangipane into the unbaked tart shell. Bake until the frangipane is golden brown and puffy and the crust is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool. Spread 3/4 cup apricot preserves on the surface of the baked tart to act as a bed for the fruit. Slice fruit and arrange it decoratively. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup apricot preserves with the water until boiling and smooth. Brush the fruit with the apricot preserves to protect the fruit from drying out and make it glisten. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 25623,&quot;Rigatoni with Merguez, Ricotta Salata, and Brown Butter 1 pound ziti or other tube-shaped pasta 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving 1 pound merguez sausage (see Chef Talk, below), casings removed 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded ricotta salata cheese 1/2 cup Sicilian Bread Crumbs (see below) or pan-toasted soft bread crumbs 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 3 cups cubed (1-inch) trimmed brioche, challah, or crusty Italian bread 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions:</p><ol><li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

Wrap in plastic wrap and chill 1 to 2 hours. Line container with tissue paper and place all items inside. The recipe card should read as follows: Get started on your cookie bouquet garden by preheating the oven to 350 degrees, then butter a sheet pan. After that, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Using the cookie cutters, cut out cookies and transfer to the prepared pan. Insert a lollipop stick inside each cookie and bake until light golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely on the sheet pan. To ice the cookies, you can either use the icing provided, or if you&#39;re feeling a bit adventurous, here&#39;s a quick and easy recipe. For the icing: In a medium bowl, mix the confectioners&#39; sugar, 4 tablespoons of the milk, and the vanilla until smooth. If still too thick to spread, add the remaining tablespoon of milk a little at a time until the icing is smooth and pourable, but thick enough to coat. Measure 1/4 cup of white icing into each of 4 small bowls. Color them 4 different colors. Cover with plastic wrap until ready to use. When you&#39;re ready to ice the cookies, set a wire rack over a piece of waxed or parchment paper. Place the cooled cookies on the wire rack and pour the remaining white icing onto them. Using a metal icing spatula, cover the cookies completely with an even layer of icing. Before the icing sets, use forks or squeeze bottles to drizzle the other 4 colors of icing over the cookies to make spidery lines. Let harden 1 hour then store in an airtight container. To assemble the cookie bouquet, start by cutting out cubes of flower foam that will fit into the flower pots, then wrap the foam in plastic. Place a silk leaf against the stick in one of the iced cookies, then wrap the entire stick with floral tape, so it looks like a flower stem. Stick the cookie \flower\ into the foam in the flower pot then cover the foam with jelly beans.

In a medium bowl, stir the chopped tomatoes with 1 tablespoon olive oil, the vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Toss well and let stand to become juicy and soft while you make the pizza. Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Stretch each piece of dough into a large rectangle on a lightly floured work surface using your hands or a rolling pin, about 10-inches long by 6-inches wide. Transfer to the back of a large baking sheet using your hands and reshape the rectangle, if necessary. In a small bowl, mix the remaining 3 tablespoons oil with the grated garlic and lightly brush the top of each piece of dough. Working with one piece of dough at a time, place the dough, oiled-side down, on the grill until the dough puffs and the bottom is lightly charred with deep grill marks, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the dough, using heatproof tongs and a spatula. Brush what is now the top of the pizza with half the oil and sprinkle with half the Parmesan. Grill until the cheese is melted and the pizza is crisped, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large cutting board. Repeat with the second dough rectangle. Cut the grilled pizza into 2-inch wide strips and cut each in half crosswise. Mash the tomato mixture, using a potato masher, to form a chunky sauce and stir in the basil. Serve the flatbread strips with the tomato sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 25671,&quot;Fluffy Japanese Omelet 3 large eggs, beaten 1/4 teaspoon baking powder Large pinch kosher salt 1 tablespoon unsalted butter For serving: breakfast meat platter (cooked breakfast sausage and strips of bacon), fried rice, spaghetti carbonara or cooked tater tots Instructions: Whisk the eggs, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl until the yolks and whites are completely combined and the beaten eggs are frothy, about 2 minutes. Melt the butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the beaten eggs and immediately begin stirring with long chopsticks. Move the skillet on and off the heat in 5-second intervals to control the setting of the eggs. If your omelet is setting too quickly, reduce the heat to low. Push the edges of the omelet toward the center of the skillet as they begin to set, about 2 minutes. Large curds will form in the middle of the skillet. At this point, stop stirring with the chopsticks and swirl the skillet until the liquid is nearly completely set, about 3 minutes more. Remove the skillet from the heat. Use the chopsticks to gently loosen the edges of the omelet. Fold the omelet into a half-moon shape using both chopsticks. Return the skillet to low heat, tilting it at a 45-degree angle to allow any loose egg mixture to run to the edges and soft set, about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat.<br> Quickly roll the omelet away from you in the skillet until a log forms. Tilt the skillet and push the omelet out of it, landing it seam-side down over your cooked dish of choice. Make a lengthwise slice in the top of the omelet to reveal the soft-set curds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 25672,&quot;Grape and Olive Goat Cheese Crostini 1 small baguette, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick slices (about 30 slices) 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cloves garlic, 1 left whole and 1 minced 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves<br> 1 cup green seedless grapes, sliced in half<br> 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, sliced in half<br> One 8-ounce log goat cheese, at room temperature Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and line a sheet tray with a wire rack.

Add the fish and cook, carefully turning once to avoid breaking the fillets, until lightly browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. Mix the sambal oelek, ground ancho and salt together. Spread generously over the fish and continue cooking until the fish is barely opaque when flaked with the tip of a small knife, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and add the lime juice and cilantro. Let the fish cool completely in the liquid. (The fish and its liquid can be transferred to a shallow dish, covered and refrigerated for 1 day.) Use a 3-inch round cookie cutter to cut out 18 rounds from the tortillas. Pour enough vegetable oil to come about 3/4 inch up the side of a heavy deep skillet and heat over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and place near the skillet. Have ready 6 small (1/2-inch-wide) cannoli forms. (If you have more forms, use them, but if you have only 6, they can be reused after they cool.) Working with one tortilla round at a time, use tongs to dip a round in the oil just until it softens, about 3 seconds. Transfer to the paper towels. Place a cannoli form across the center of the round. Let the round cool slightly, then fold up the sides to make a taco-shell shape. Holding the round and cannoli form together with the tongs, transfer them to the hot oil and fry until the shell holds its shape, about 15 seconds. Let go of the shell and continue deep-frying until the shell is golden brown, about 30 seconds more. Return to the paper towels. (With practice, this will take less than a minute per shell and you can do more than one at the same time.) Let cool slightly; slide the form out of the shell. (The shells can be covered loosely with plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours.) Drain the fish and discard the marinade. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the fish and cook, turning once, until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Do not overcook. Remove from the heat. Smear about 1/2 cup guacamole over the fish and set aside to warm the guacamole, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and use 2 forks to break the fish mixture into bite-sized pieces. Divide the fish filling among the taco shells. To each taco, add about 1 tablespoon mango salsa and a drizzle of the chipotle cream. Transfer to a platter, add the lime wedges and sprinkle with cilantro.

In a small bowl, add the water and slowly pour in the gelatin powder, stirring well until fully incorporated. Set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, add the coconut cream and milk. Stir well with a whisk to combine. Bring to a simmer then stir in the gelatin mixture. Once the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Spray an 8 by 8-inch nonstick square cake pan with a little nonstick spray (this will help hold down the plastic wrap). Line the cake pan with plastic wrap (1 sheet across 1 way and another sheet across the other way, works well), leaving enough overhang so you can pick the jelly up from the pan. Give the coconut mixture a final whisk and pour it into the lined pan. Allow to cool slightly before putting it in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight. To serve, remove the jelly from pan using the plastic wrap and invert it onto a cutting board. Remove the plastic wrap and discard. Using a hot knife cut the jelly into 1 1/2-inch cubes.

They are less extravagant - I use cocoa powder in place of the good-quality chocolate, and stud the mixture with a newstand&#39;s or convenience store&#39;s bar or two of milk chocolate - although to taste them, you would never, never guess. They ooze with such dark elegance and deep, deep chocolatiness. This is the recipe you turn to when a child or colleague informs you last thing that you&#39;re expected to bake something for a bake sale tomorrow. You can just smile serenely and head for the cupboard. If you&#39;re working from a more restrained array, so are clean out of light brown sugar, and there&#39;s no chance to nip to a convenience store for the chocolate, then just use 1 1/2 cups regular white sugar and up the butter to 1 1/2 and the cocoa to a heady 1 cup. A final note or, rather, nag: when I say cocoa powder, I do mean unsweetened cocoa; do not under any circumstance ever substitute drinking chocolate. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the butter over a gentle heat in a medium-sized saucepan. When it&#39;s melted, add the sugar, stirring with a wooden spoon (still over a low heat) to help it blend with the melted butter. Whisk together the cocoa powder, flour, baking soda and pinch of salt, and then stir into the pan; when mixed (this will be a very dry mixture, and not wholly blended at this stage), remove from the heat. In a bowl or jug, whisk the eggs with the vanilla extract and then mix into the brownie mixture in the pan. Stir in the chopped chocolate and quickly pour and scrape into a foil-lined baking tin or disposable foil pan, spreading the mixture with a spatula, and cook in the preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes. It will look set, dark and dry on top, but when you feel the surface, you will sense it is still wibbly underneath and a cake tester will come out gungy. This is desirable. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool a little before cutting into 16 pieces and dusting with confectioners&#39; sugar. I love these gorgeously warm. But then again, I love them cold, too. Actually, when cold they are properly speaking more brownie-like: gooily tender within and moreishly chewy on top. Make Ahead Note: The brownies can be made up to 3 days ahead and stored in airtight container. Will keep for total of 5 days. Freeze Note: The brownies can be frozen for up to 3 months in airtight container, layered with baking parchment. Thaw overnight in cool place. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 25723,&quot;5-Ingredient Cashew Cream Blender Sauce 1/2 cup creamy cashew butter 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 small cloves garlic, crushed 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons hot sauce, plus more to taste if desired Kosher salt Instructions: Combine the cashew butter, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, hot sauce and 1/3 cup warm water in a blender and blend on high until very smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender jar once or twice with a rubber spatula. The sauce should be the consistency of thick pancake batter. If it is too thick, add more water, a tablespoon at a time, and blend until the sauce is the consistency of thick pancake batter. (Depending on your brand of cashew butter, you may need to add up to 3 tablespoons of water.) Transfer to a bowl. Season with salt and more hot sauce if using.

Whisk in the goat cheese until combined. Set aside; the mixture will thicken as it cools. Toast the mini bagels until golden brown and crispy. Set aside. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add 4 slices of the pancetta and cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain the pancetta on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining pancetta. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a small frying pan over medium-low heat. Crack 4 quail eggs into the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining eggs. To build the PLT: Spread each bagel half with 1 tablespoon of the goat cheese sauce. Layer with a slice of pancetta, a slice of tomato, and some arugula.

Add the bacon to a 10-inch non-stick skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring regularly, until the bacon is crispy, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. In a large bowl, add the eggs, 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Set aside. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the skillet. (If the bacon has not rendered enough fat, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead.) Return the skillet to medium-high and add the sweet potato, 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the potato is slightly browned and fork tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Add in the kale and a small pinch each of salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 4 minutes. Add the bacon back to the skillet. Turn the heat down to medium-low and add the egg mixture and half of the Cheddar. Using a rubber spatula, start lightly scrambling the eggs. When the edges begin to set, top with the remaining Cheddar and transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake until the egg is set and lightly puffed up, 5 to 7 minutes Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C/gas 6. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the vermicelli, and cook for slightly less time than it says on the packet. You want it to be al dente. Once ready, drain, rinse in coldwater and leave to cool. Put it into a large bowl and grate in your courgettes (zucchini). Add the chopped tomatoes, coriander (cilantro), preserved lemon, 1 teaspoon harissa, sweet paprika, ground ginger, and cumin. Mix it all together really well with your clean hands, then have a taste, add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed, and put aside. Place the fish on a large chopping board and score the skin every 3/4-inch/2 cm on both sides at a slight angle, using a sharp knife. Sprinkle over a little salt, a small pinch of cumin, and a pinch each of sweet paprika and ground ginger. Mix the remaining 1 teaspoon harissa with 1 teaspoon olive oil and rub 1/2 of it into the fish, making sure it gets into the cuts you&#39;ve made. Turn the fish over and repeat on the other side. Spoon 2/3 of the vermicelli filling into a large baking tray or earthenware-type dish, making a bed for the fish; gently place the fish on top. Stir your prawns into the rest of the vermicelli filling and spoon this into the cavity of the fish, pushing it right in-don&#39;t worry if it spills out a little. Drizzle over a little olive oil, and roast in the hot oven for around 25 minutes, until the fish is crisp on the outside and cooked through. To serve, pull the meat off and pick the bones out.

Remove husks from the tomatillos and rinse under warm water to remove the stickiness. Put the chiles, garlic, onion and tomatillos on a baking sheet. Season with a little olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Put on a rack about 1 or 2 inches from the heat, and cook, turning the vegetables once, until softened and slightly charred, about 5 to 7 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel the garlic and pull off the tops of the chiles. Add all the broiled ingredients to a blender along with the fresh cilantro and puree. Pour in 1/4 cup of chicken broth and blend to combine. Add more broth, if needed, for desired consistency. To make the chilaquiles: Pour about 1/3 cup vegetable oil into a large saute pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the tortillas, working in 2 or 3 batches, and cook until lightly browned and nearly crisp. Drain the tortillas on paper towels and discard the remaining oil. Wipe the pan with a paper towel. In the same pan, add the tomatillo salsa and bring to simmer over low heat. Add the tortillas and cook until soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide the mixture among 4 individual casserole dishes. Top with the cheese crumbles and onion rings. Drizzle with Mexican crema, sprinkle with some chopped fresh cilantro and serve immediately. *Cook&#39;s Note: Salsa Verde means \green sauce\ and is typically made with tomatillos, green chiles and cilantro. Make your own fresh, or you can also find it canned at most supermarkets. Tomatillos are a small green fruit encased in a tissue paper-like husk. They should be used when they are still green, before they are ripe and the husk has turned brown. Before using, remove the husk, rinse and dry the fruit. (They do not need to be seeded.) They are found in most supermarkets **Cook&#39;s Note: Chilaquiles is a Mexican brunch dish invented to use leftovers. It is made with day old tortillas (cut or torn into chips) and salsa verde. They are cooked together until the tortillas are slightly softened. Chilaquiles are eaten alone or with beans, eggs or shredded chicken. ***Cook&#39;s Note: Queso fresco is a white, mild, fresh Mexican cheese with the texture of fresh farmer&#39;s cheese in the US.

Add the cheese, basil, parsley, egg, and salt. Mix gently but thoroughly. Form into small meatballs. Mary&#39;s were no more than 1 1/2-inch diameter. 2 jumbo eggs weighing 4 1/2 ounces in their shells, lightly beaten (slightly over 1/2 cup but less than 2/3 cup lightly beaten eggs measured in a liquid measuring cup) 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (10 ounces) all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon hot tap water Lightly whip the salt into the beaten eggs. Set aside. Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the noodles. Put a bowl of ice water near the stove, and set out a few towels next to the bowl to drain the pasta. Generously grease a 10 by 14-inch baking pan using 1 to 2 tablespoons of the butter. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix the ricotta, egg, and parsley together. Rip up the basil leaves and fold them into the ricotta mixture. Season with salt and set aside. With a slotted spoon, transfer the pieces of pork, sausage, and meatballs from the Sunday Gravy to a separate bowl. They will be coated with some of the tomato gravy. That&#39;s okay. Set the remaining gravy and bowl of meats aside. Generously salt the boiling water and cook the lasagne sheets, a few at a time, at a rolling boil for 1 minute. The noodles will be very firm; they will cook further in the oven. Transfer the pasta to the ice water with a long-handled flat skimmer or strainer. As soon as they are cool to the touch- less than a minute- lift them out, shaking off excess water, and lay the noodles out on towels to drain. Repeat the process until all the pasta is cooked. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cover the bottom of the baking pan with a layer of lasagne sheets, allowing the pasta to hang over all sides of the pan. Top with another layer of lasagne sheets cut to fit the bottom of the pan without an overhang. Cover the pasta with 1/2 of the reserved meats. Spoon over enough gravy to moisten well, about 1 cup. Sprinkle with a rounded 1/4 cup Pecorino Romano. Cover with another layer of pasta cut to fit without an overhang. Top with 1 cup gravy. Dollop 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over the gravy and top with half of the mozzarella and a rounded 1/4 cup of Pecorino Romano. Repeat the pasta and meat layer and the pasta and ricotta mixture layer. Cover with a final layer of pasta (you may not have used all the lasagne sheets) cut to fit the inside of the pan without an overhang. Top with the remaining gravy and Pecorino Romano. Bring up the overhang of pasta and fold over the top of the lasagne to enclose the filling. Dot with remaining butter and loosely cover with foil. Bake the lasagne for 25 minutes, uncover, and continue to bake until very lightly browned and bubbling hot, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. To keep the top noodles soft without browning, bake the lasagne covered with foil for 35 minutes and uncovered for the last 5 to 10 minutes in the oven. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed stockpot. Add the pork chops and sausages and brown on all sides. Transfer the pork chops and sausages to a plate to make room for the onions. Toss the onions into the pot with the garlic, fennel, and salt. Saute over moderate heat, stirring frequently and scraping up any bits left behind by the pork and sausages, until the onions are soft and golden. Put the pork chops and sausages back in the pot with any juices on the plate. Add the tomatoes, water, and tomato paste. Drop in a few cheese rinds or ends if you have any. They are completely optional but give a nice flavor to the sauce. Cover the pot, bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Gently drop in the meatballs, 1 at a time, shaking the pot a bit to encourage the meatballs to nestle in with the pork and sausage and to make room for the addition of more meatballs. After all the meatballs have been added, continue to simmer, covered, for an hour longer or until the pork chops are very tender. To finish the gravy, transfer the pork chops to a cutting board. Remove and discard the bones, chop up the meat, and return it to the sauce. Keep warm over low heat. Homemade, fresh pasta is glorious and well worth the effort. Nothing compares to the silky, light, slippery noodles you can produce in your own kitchen. This is a quick recipe. The dough is mixed in a food processor and a pasta machine kneads and rolls the dough. George&#39;s whips this up easily, in 5 minutes tops. There are minor variations depending on the weather and the moisture in your flour (you may have to knead in an extra tablespoon or 2 of flour) but if you follow these proportions you will have excellent pasta. The organic eggs we buy at the farmers&#39; market vary in size. The most reliable way to get an accurate measurement is with a portion scale. The measuring cup method will work, too (crack eggs into a small mixing bowl, whisk to combine, pour the required amount into a liquid measuring cup, and discard or save any excess for another use). In making pasta, skill is developed through repetition. Each batch will be easier than the last and with a little experience exact measurements will be less important. Don&#39;t fret if the final dimensions of the pasta are different from those specified in the recipe. The strips coming through the rollers of the pasta machine may be longer and/or not as wide. The ends may also narrow rather than being perfectly square. For instance, the edge going through the rollers first will be u-shaped (they can be cut later to square the noodle, if you like). Practice does make a difference in developing a feel for the process. Try to roll the dough as wide as possible--a little less than the width of the rollers, but don&#39;t be discouraged if that doesn&#39;t happen the first time. Adjust the cutting of the pasta to the strips you have--less wide sheets of lasagna noodles, for instance. Put the flour in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. With the motor running pour the eggs through the feed tube. Stop the machine as soon as the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Run the motor again pouring the hot water through the feed tube. Pulse on and off for 10 seconds; stop the motor. The dough should stick together when pressed between your fingertips. If not add another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon hot water and run the motor again. Turn out onto a cool, smooth surface--marble is ideal. Knead for 1 to 2 minutes until the dough is smooth and pliable. If it is sticky, knead in 1 to 2 tablespoons flour. Shape into a ball and cover the dough completely with plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for a minimum of 20 minutes or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator. If the dough is refrigerated, remove it from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before proceeding with the recipe. Set up the pasta machine with the rollers at their widest opening. Divide the dough in 1/2. If the dough is sticky, dust it with flour. Flatten the dough half with the heel of your hand, and feed it through the rollers of pasta machine. Fold the dough in half lengthwise and feed it through the rollers again. Repeat 20 to 30 times occasionally folding widthwise to fit between the guides. This kneads and smoothes the dough further, creating silky and supple pasta. Now you can roll the pasta into thin sheets by feeding it through each successive setting of the pasta machine until you have passed it through the second thinnest opening (dust with just enough flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking). This process is done without folding. If the sheet of pasta becomes cumbersomely long cut it crosswise into 2 pieces to make it more manageable. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Lay the dough out on a barely floured counter or clean, dry kitchen towels. Each half of dough will yield 2 strips of pasta roughly measuring 3 feet by 4 inches. Try to make lasagna noodles as wide as your pasta machine allows (4 to 5-inches); cut the lengths the most appropriate size for the pan you plan to use--anywhere from 8 to 12-inches long (longer if you like, or shorter if smaller noodles are easier for you to handle. Lasagna noodles can be cut and patched together in assembly). Keep in mind the pasta will grow, or expand, when it boils, increasing its dimensions. After you have cut the noodles, you can cook them right away or lay them out in a single layer without touching on a lightly floured surface or on clean, dry kitchen towels until ready to cook (flour dusted or towel lined baking trays work well if you don&#39;t have counter) If you are not using the pasta the same day, allow it to dry completely, then transfer to long, shallow containers with lids.

Reduce the heat and simmer to blend the flavors, uncovered, for 20 minutes, stirring and skimming the surface occasionally. Strain the broth into large bowl, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon to release as much liquid as possible. Return the broth to the pot and keep warm. Meanwhile in a medium, heavy saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the carrot, celery, and bell pepper and cook until fragrant, about 7 minutes. Add the tomato and cl de arbol and cook for 5 minutes longer. Mix in the tomato paste and dried shrimp powder and cook for 3 minutes. Add the cooked vegetables to the warm broth and stir. Cook on medium-low heat, covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Add the shrimp to the simmering broth. Turn off the heat and let the soup stand for 3 minutes until the shrimp are translucent and cooked through. Serve hot with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 25750,&quot;Chicken Broth 1 (4-pound) chicken, whole 1 medium onion, peeled and quartered 2 medium carrots, quartered, 2 stalks celery, quartered 1 leek, dark tops only 1 medium parsnip, peeled and quartered, optional 3 generous sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried 3 generous sprigs flat-leaf parsley 5 whole black peppercorns 1 bay leaf About 4 quarts water Instructions: Combine the chicken, vegetables, herbs, and peppercorns in a large stockpot. Pour in enough water to just cover the chicken completely. Heat the water to just under a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a very low simmer, so that 1 or 2 bubbles break the surface of the broth about once a minute. Skim any fat and scum from the surface with a ladle, large spoon, or skimmer. (To prevent losing a lot of stock when skimming, put the skimmed liquid into a degreasing cup, and return any useable broth back to the pot.) Cook for about 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked through but not dry. Remove the chicken from the pot, but continue to simmer the broth. Cool the chicken for about 10 minutes. Cut the chicken meat from the bone, and reserve for a chicken salad, soup, or other recipe. Return the bones to the pot and cook for 1 hour. Strain into a non-reactive container, like another pot, a large bowl, or plastic quart or pint containers. Fill the sink with a mixture of ice and cold water so it comes about halfway up the sides of the container. Nestle the broth in the ice bath. (Stirring the broth speeds up the cooling process.) Cover and refrigerate or freeze the broth for future use. Broth can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If the broth is unused after 5 days bring it to a boil before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25751,&quot;Jicama and Tropical Fruit Salad 2 oranges 2 mangoes, peeled and diced 1 pineapple, peeled and diced 1 small jicama, peeled and diced 1/4 cup lime juice 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 1 cup fresh grated coconut or dried, unsweetened shredded coconut Instructions: Slice ends off oranges and stand upright.

Place in a bowl, toss with the lemon juice and reserve. Put the diced onion, peppers and oil in a nonstick 3-quart saucepan and saute over medium heat until the vegetables are soft and wilted. Turn the heat to low, add the dry spices and stir to coat the vegetables evenly and release the full flavors of the spice mixture. Add the sugar and continue cooking until it melts and begins to bubble. Add the vinegar slowly and carefully to avoid splashing. Continue cooking 5 minutes. Stir in the reserved apples and their juice and cook no more than 2 to 3 minutes, watching to be sure the apples don&#39;t overcook and become mushy. Remove from the heat and set the pan in an ice-water bath to cool the relish as quickly as possible. Chop the cilantro leaves coarsely and add to the relish at the last moment before serving. Without the cilantro leaves, the relish will keep 1 to 2 weeks in the refrigerator, longer if properly stored in air-tight jars.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 25753,&quot;Lime-oncello Spritzers with Mint 2 pounds limes (about 10 large) 1 (750-ml) bottle 100-proof vodka 2 1/2 cups sugar 2 1/2 cups water Ice cubes 1 cup fresh mint leaves 1 cup club soda Instructions: To make limoncello: Using a vegetable peeler, remove the peel from the limes in long strips (reserve the limes for another use). Place the lime peels in a 1-quart jar. Pour the vodka over the peels and screw on the lid. Steep the lime peels in the vodka for 1 week at room temperature.

Rub this paste all over the chicken. Season the chicken from high above (to ensure even distribution) with salt and pepper. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Place the chicken on a baking sheet (or large pan) with a rack. Allow the chicken to sit at room temperature for 1 hour (this will allow it to cook more evenly). Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Pour 1 cup of water in the bottom of the baking sheet and roast the chicken until it is deep golden brown and caramelized, and the thickest part of the leg registers 160 degrees F on a thermometer, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Allow the bird to rest for 20 minutes (the temperature will continue to rise to 165 degrees F out of the oven). For the vinaigrette: While the bird is resting, pour 4 tablespoons of the juices (depending on how rich you want the vinaigrette, you can reduce the juices first before measuring) into a large bowl along with the vinegar, shallots, mustard and tarragon. Drizzle in the olive oil. Toss in the lettuce and season with salt and pepper. Divide among 4 plates. Carve the bird by removing the breast and legs from the carcass. Cut the 2 breasts into 4 pieces and separate the thighs from the drums on the legs, leaving you also with 4 pieces.

The buzz of the fresh hot green cl adds thrill, all of which adds up to a condiment most of us simply don&#39;t want to live without. For the All-Raw version: Roughly chop the tomatillos and the chiles. In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatillos, chiles, cilantro and 1/4 cup water. Process to a coarse puree, then scrape into a serving dish. Rinse the onion under cold water, then shake to remove excess moisture.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Toss the rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, and orange zest together in a large bowl. In a measuring cup, dissolve the cornstarch in the orange juice and then mix it in with the fruit. Carefully ease one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate, making sure not to stretch the dough at all, or it will shrink as the pie bakes. Spoon the fruit mixture into the pie shell, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula to be sure you have all the juices. For the lattice, place the second crust on a cutting surface and slice 8 equal size strips of dough with a pizza wheel. Starting at one edge, using every other strip of dough, place 5 parallel strips across the pie. Fold back the 2 strips that are on either side of the center half way and place a strip of dough across the center of the pie perpendicular to the other strips. Place the 2 strips back over the pie again and fold the 3 alternate strips half way back. Place a second perpendicular strip of dough over the pie. Place the 3 strips back over the pie again and repeat with a third strip of dough on the opposite side. Trim the lattice pieces. Lift the edge of the bottom crust over the edge of the lattice pieces and crimp the two together with your fingers. Brush the lattice pieces with the egg wash. Place the pie on the prepared sheet pan and place it in the middle of the oven. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F and bake 45 minutes, until the filling is very bubbly and the crust is nicely browned. Allow to cool and serve warm or at room temperature. Cut the butter in 1/2-inch dice and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out onto a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle at least 1 inch larger than the pie pan, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough so it doesnt stick to the board. (You should see bits of butter in the dough.) Fold the dough in half, ease it into the pie pan without stretching at all, and unfold to fit the pan. With a small sharp paring knife, cut the dough 1 inch larger around than the pan. Fold the edge under and crimp the edge with either your fingers or the tines of a fork. \Barefoot Contessa Foolproof\ by Ina Garten (c) Clarkson Potter 2012. Provided courtesy of Ina Garten.

Stir in the yeast and let stand until the mixture is foamy, about 10 minutes. Pour the yeast mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the sugar, butter and 2 of the eggs and stir until smooth. Add the flour and salt and mix on medium-low speed until the dough comes together. Increase the speed to medium high and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let stand until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line the back of a baking sheet with parchment. Whisk together the heavy cream and remaining egg for an egg wash.<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough into an 11-inch circle.<br> For the neck and head: Using shears, cut a 6-inch slit from the top of the circle down the left side of the circle, 1 inch in from the side. Pinch in 4 inches from the top of the dough strip. The top of the strip will be the turkey head and the bottom will be the neck. Fold the head over the top of the neck. Adjust and refine the neck and head shapes by slightly thinning the neck and pressing the head into a rounder, flatter shape, pulling the tip of the dough out to create a pointed beak.<br> For the wings, wattle and feet: Trim off a 7-by-2-inch strip of dough from the bottom right edge of the dough curve. Cut the strip into 6 long triangles. Form 4 of them into long teardrop shapes for the wings and wattle. Make feet from the 2 remaining triangles by cutting 2 short slits on the short ends of the triangles. Pinch and slightly stretch the 3 dough strips on each triangle to make toes. Set the feet, wings and wattle aside.<br> For the tail feathers: Working along the top two-thirds of the dough circle, use kitchen shears to snip 1-inch-wide strips of dough down toward the middle of the circle (sort of like rays of the sun). Make 2 shallow snips into each strip so that they form spikes; the spikes should point outward to the edge of the circle. Pinch the ends of each feather to a point. For the coloring: Brush the turkey head, neck and body--but not the tail feathers--with the egg wash. Divide the remaining egg wash among three bowls and color them red, orange, and yellow with food coloring.<br> Brush 2 of the reserved teardrop shapes with the red egg wash. Tuck the narrow end of 1 red teardrop under the turkey head for the wattle (it will sit on the neck). Put aside the second red teardrop. Brush the 2 remaining teardrops orange and yellow. Arrange the orange, yellow and remaining red teardrops in a fan to make a wing. Place the wing on the turkey near the base of the neck.<br> Brush the 2 feet with the yellow egg wash and tuck them under the body at the bottom of the circle. Brush the tip of the turkey&#39;s beak with the yellow egg wash. Brush the tips of the turkey tail feathers with yellow egg wash. Brush the center of the feathers with the orange wash. And brush the base of the feathers with the red wash, making sure the lines are in an arc.<br> Bake until the bread is slightly golden brown and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. While the bread is still warm, press the chocolate chips into the face of the turkey to make eyes. Let the bread cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheet then transfer to a serving platter.

Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the ice water, then pulse until crumbly and the dough holds together when squeezed. (If too dry, add another sprinkle of water, but do not over mix.) Transfer the dough to a plastic bag, press into a disk and refrigerate for one hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out the dough on floured surface, then press it into a deep 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edges to leave 1 inch of overhang, fold it under and flute the edges. Cut a piece of parchment or nonstick foil to the size of the pie plate and use it to line the pie crust. Fill with pie weights and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Remove the pie weights and return the pie dough to the oven to dry out, about 8 minutes. Lower the oven to 325 degrees F. For the filling: In a double boiler, melt the semisweet chocolate, bittersweet chocolate and butter, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from the heat. In a large bowl, mix together the pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, light brown sugar, eggs, cornstarch, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and salt. Fold in the melted chocolate mixture. Set the pie plate on a baking sheet and pour the filling into the crust. Bake until the center of the pie has just about set but still has a slight jiggle, about 1 hour. Let cool completely before serving. Top with chocolate shavings. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 25791,&quot;Steamed Lobsters 4 live lobsters, 3/4 to 2 pounds Drawn Butter, recipe follows Coral Butter, recipe follows 1/2 pound unsalted butter 1/2 pound unsalted butter 1 to 4 tablespoons lobster roe (eggs), also called coral, preferably uncooked Instructions: Choose a pot with a tight-fitting lid that is large enough to fit the lobsters comfortably with enough room for the steam to circulate around them. Wrap the lid tightly with a kitchen towel. Place a steamer basket or an upturned colander in the pot, and pour in cold water to a depth of about 2 inches. Cover and bring to a boil.<br> Meanwhile, put the lobsters on a cutting board. Place the tip of a large, heavy knife at the cross marks on the back of a lobster&#39;s head. In one quick motion cut down through the head to the cutting board. Repeat with the remaining lobsters.<br> To keep the tails straight and ensure even cooking, slip a thin wooden skewer through the length of the lobster&#39;s tails.<br> When the water is boiling, quickly add the lobsters to the pot and cover. Steam the lobsters, shaking the pot occasionally, until cooked through, about 8 minutes for 3/4 to 1 pound lobsters, about 10 minutes for 1 to 1 1/4 pound lobsters, and about 11 minutes for 1 1/2 to 2 pound lobsters.<br> Remove the lobsters from the pot and, if you are serving them whole, set them aside for several minutes to rest. Using the back of the heavy knife or a mallet crack the claws. Transfer the lobsters to plates and serve with drawn butter and lobster claw crackers.<br> To remove all the meat from the lobster: Transfer the lobster to a colander in the sink and rinse under cold running water to stop the cooking. Using your hands, twist the claws, knuckles, and tails off of the lobsters. Reserve the bodies for making broth.<br> On a work surface, rest the tails on their sides and, using the palm of your hand, press down on them to crack the shells. Holding a tail with both hands, with the belly facing you, break the tail shell back and pop out the meat. Repeat with the remaining tails. If you have female lobsters (the swimmerets at top of the tail are soft and have hair-like wisps protruding from them), you may want to prepare coral butter, (recipe follows) with the roe. The roe are the dark green eggs located in the body and the top of the tail. Carefully cut open the top of the tail and the body and remove the roe.<br> Grab the \thumb\ of a lobster claw and move it back and forth. Try to wiggle the shell off of the meat while pulling out the internal piece of cartilage, leaving the meat attached to the claw (this is a tricky maneuver, if it doesn&#39;t work you should be able to shake the meat out). Place the claw horizontally upright with the curve of the claw facing up. Using the heavy part of the blade of the knife, with a short and swift motion, crack the back end of the claw. Drop the claw to its side and, with the back of the knife, crack the side of the back of the claw. Remove the cracked back end of the claw and wiggle the meat out from the shell. Repeat with the remaining claws.<br> Place the knuckles on the work surface and cover with a kitchen towel. Using the back of the knife, crack the knuckles. Using your hands, remove the shell from the knuckles and carefully pick out the meat. You may also use kitchen shears to cut open the knuckles and remove the meat. Place the butter in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 1 minute.<br> Set the saucepan aside and let the butter settle, undisturbed. The milk solids will come to the top of the butter and the watery whey will collect on the bottom. Skim off the milk solids with a spoon and pour the drawn butter into a serving bowl or several small ramekins, taking care not include the watery liquid in the bottom of the pan. Serve.<br> Yield: about 1 cup Place the butter in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 1 minute.<br> Set the saucepan aside and let the butter settle, undisturbed. The milk solids will come to the top of the butter and the watery whey will collect on the bottom. Skim off the milk solids with a spoon and pour the drawn butter into a small bowl. Wipe out the sauce and return the drawn butter to it.<br> Place the roe in a medium bowl and whisk lightly to break it up. Heat the butter over medium heat until just hot. Gradually pour the warmed butter over the roe, while whisking, until the eggs turn bright red.

To make the pastry, let the butter soften to room temperature and put it into a mixer on low speed. Pulse for 2 seconds before adding the egg followed by the water. Mix for a few seconds and then add the salt and the flour, keeping 2 tablespoons aside to add later in case the dough is too sticky. Work fast because the gluten in the flour makes the dough go elastic. Stop the mixer before the dough turns into a ball. Flatten the pastry and shape a circle about 6 inches wide. Place the pastry on a plate, wrap it in plastic wrap and leave in the refrigerator for 1 hour minimum to 24 hours. This lets the gluten relax and when you roll out the pastry it stays flat. Caramel Apple Filling: Cut the butter into little bits and scatter on a 10-inch baking dish. Shake the sugar over it and add 2 tablespoons of water to keep it from crystallizing. Caramelize the sugar by placing the dish on a medium heat. Meanwhile, peel the apples, cut in 2 and remove the core. Cut them into 4 big pieces. Once the butter and sugar have caramelized take the pan off the heat. Place the pieces of apple vertically on top of the caramel in the baking tin, taking care to fill the gaps with more pieces so they stick together in a solid mass. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar over the apples. Put the dish back on a heat diffuser for 15 minutes at a medium heat until the caramel starts bubbling up through the apples. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll the pastry out and place over the apples folding it in at the edges. Make 3 or 4 holes with a knife and 1 in the middle to let steam out when baking. Bake for 20 minutes and then let it rest for 15 minutes. It is important that you do this otherwise the apples will fall apart when you turn it over. Take a dinner plate and put it over the baking tin. Turn it over. Slowly remove the baking tin.

Blend together the honey, Toasted Spice Rub and thyme. Place ham on an open brown paper bag or waxed paper for easy clean up. With the tip of a paring knife carefully score a 1-inch grid pattern around the outside of the ham. Brush the entire surface of the meat on all sides with some of the honey mixture. Add about 1/2 cup of water to the base of a roasting pan. Lay the celery sticks in the bottom of the pan and then place the ham on top of the celery. Cook for 1 hour. Every 15 minutes, baste ham with juices that collect in the base of the roaster and the honey. Let rest for 15 minutes before carving as desired. For the savory bread pudding: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Using a serrated knife, shave off the thicker parts of the crust from the bread loaf. Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes and place in a large bowl. Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a 13 by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place in a large bowl. Leave the oven on. In a skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over high heat and cook, without stirring, until it turns nut brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the thyme and cook for 10 seconds to release its fragrance. Pour the onion mixture over the toasted bread. Add 3/4 cup of the Parmesan and toss well. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and nutmeg. Pour the milk mixture over the bread and toss well. Butter a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Arrange the toasted bread evenly in the baking dish. Pour the custard evenly over the bread. Scatter the blue cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan over the top. Bake until the bread is golden brown and crispy on top and a thin knife blade inserted into the custard comes out almost clean, about 30 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes. Cut into individual servings and serve warm. Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put mixture into a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. *See Chef&#39;s Notes &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 25862,&quot;BLT Frittata 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 turns of the pan 1/4 pound sliced pancetta, chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 bundles arugula, trimmed and chopped, about 3 cups, loosely packed 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained 12 extra-large eggs 1/3 cup half-and-half, eye ball it 1 teaspoon salt Black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Toast coconut: Spread coconut on a nongreased baking sheet and put in oven until lightly brown and fragrant (about 10 minutes). Remove from the oven and reserve. Put 6 ounces of the chocolate and the butter and 1 tablespoon of the coconut extract in a double broiler being careful not to let the bowl that the chocolate mixture is in come in contact with the boiling water. Stir until all of the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy, take off heat and let cool slightly (about 2 to 3 minutes). Use an electric mixer with the whisk attachment to beat the eggs, yolks, sugar, and remaining 2 tablespoons of coconut extract at low-medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Increase speed to high and beat until the egg mixture becomes pale and thick (about 5 to 8 additional minutes). Reduce speed back to its lowest setting (we don&#39;t want a cloud of flour in our kitchen!). Gradually sift in the flour while mixing, add the chocolate mixture to the egg mixture and beat again until completely incorporated and mixture is thick and glossy being careful not to overmix (about 5 minutes). Carefully fold in toasted coconut. Fill each prepared custard cup about half way, place a few of the remaining chocolate chips into each custard cup. Top off each with remaining batter. Place all custard cups on a baking dish that is at least 1/2-inch deep (in case of any spills). Bake cakes until edges are set and center is still slightly jiggly (about 12 minutes). Let cool slightly making sure you don&#39;t cool the cakes too much, they&#39;re best served warm. Carefully run a knife around the edges to loosen the cake and invert the cake onto individual plate. Dust with powdered sugar and more toasted coconut flakes, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 25883,&quot;Chocolate Souffle 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3/4 cup milk Pinch kosher salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 4 ounces semisweet chocolate 1/3 cup sugar 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier 3 egg yolks 4 egg whites Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks crumbly. Drizzle in 1 beaten egg and pulse until the dough holds together when pinched. Turn out onto a clean surface and knead a few times until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into 2 balls and place each ball on a separate piece of parchment paper. Top each with another piece of parchment and roll out each into an 11- to 12-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick). Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Whisk the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon flour and the cinnamon in a medium bowl. Halve, pit and thinly slice the plums, then cut each slice in half crosswise. Cut out small rounds as close together as possible from 1 piece of dough using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Gather the scraps and refrigerate until firm; reroll once to cut out more rounds. Meanwhile, arrange 9 rounds on one of the prepared baking sheets and brush the edges with some of the remaining beaten egg. Toss the plums in the cinnamon sugar mixture to coat, then arrange about 4 plum pieces in the center of each dough round on the baking sheet, leaving space around the edges. Top each with a second round of dough and press the edges to seal. (If the dough is too stiff to work with, warm it briefly between your hands to make it more pliable.) Crimp the edges with a fork and cut 4 small steam vents into the top of each cookie. Transfer to the freezer and repeat with the remaining dough and plums.<br> Lightly brush the cookies with the remaining beaten egg and sprinkle with turbinado sugar.

In a bowl, combine the crushed KELLOGG&#39;S RICE KRISPIES, ground ginger, salt, and pepper, to taste. Coat the outside of the tuna steaks with the cereal mixture. Put the vegetable oil in the hot pan and swirl to coat, and then sear the tuna on all sides, until the coating just turns brown in color, about 2 minutes per side. This should cook the tuna perfectly with the inside remaining rare. Remove the pan from the heat. For the cucumber salad: Cut the ends off the cucumber, and then cut it into thirds. On a mandolin slicer with fine teeth in the blade, and using the hand guard, grate the cucumber pieces in a long motion. This will make cool cucumber noodle looking strands. Repeat with the remaining cucumber pieces. Put the rice noodles into a bowl and pour the boiling water over them until covered. Let noodles soak until soft and a little chewy.

Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the grill to high. Grill on both sides for 3 to 4 minutes, for medium-rare. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes and then slice thinly. Puree the beans, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and thyme in a food processor until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Mix together the tomatoes, olive oil, vinegar, honey, and parsley, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat grill to high. Flatten flatbread dough and gently press into a large rectangle and throw on grill. Grill on 1 side until golden, about 2 minutes. Remove from grill, turn over, and spread each flatbread with a thin layer of White Bean Puree, sliced beef, roasted shallots, and Tomato Chutney. Return to grill, close cover and cook for 2 minutes. Serve immediately. Mix water and yeast in a large bowl and let stand 5 minutes to proof. Gradually pour in 2 cups of the flour and stir to incorporate. Mix for about 1 minute to form a sponge. Let stand, covered, for at least 1 hour. Put sponge in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook, add the salt and oil, then add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a dough. Remove from bowl and knead. Place in a clean oiled bowl and let rise, slowly, about 2 1/2 hours. Divide dough into 4 balls, if desired, let rise again for 1/2 hour, and then roll out as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 25903,&quot;Caramelized Spicy Tofu 17 1/2 ounces (500 grams) tofu 2 to 3 tablespoons avocado oil, for frying (untoasted sesame or peanut oil would also be good) 1/2 cup water 8 3/4 ounces (250 grams) sugar 1 small finger ginger, peeled and finely julienned or sliced 1 small finger galangal, peeled and finely julienned or sliced 1 to 2 red chiles, finely sliced 1 lemongrass stem, cut off the base, peel and discard the outer two layers, and finely slice the lower 2 inches 1 teaspoon dried shrimps, pounded in a mortar and pestle 4 lime leaves 1/3 cup lemon juice 1 tablespoon fish sauce Instructions: Note: This dish utilizes the subtlety and texture of tofu to serve as a vehicle for the spicy flavors of the sweet dressing. The combination of the 2 works really well. Slice the tofu into 4 pieces and place them in a single layer on absorbent paper, lay some more paper on top and gently press down, leave for 20 minutes. This drains off excess water and makes frying easier. Heat up a fry pan and drizzle in the oil, add the tofu and fry until golden, gently flip over, and cook on the other side. Take out of the pan and place on a plate. Place a wok over heat and add the water and sugar. Stir until the sugar has dissolved and cook over a moderate heat, without stirring, until the sugar begins to caramelize and goes a golden amber color. Now add the ginger, galangal, chiles, lemongrass, shrimps, and lime leaves and stir it into the caramel. It will firm up a little, but keep it cooking over the heat for 20 seconds, then add the lemon juice and fish sauce and bring to a boil. Spoon the sauce over the tofu and eat while warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Gewrztraminer, Riesling, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 25904,&quot;Brown Rice Crispy Treats 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 (10-ounce) bag marshmallows 6 cups brown rice cereal, such as Koala Crisp 1/2 cup dried cranberries or raisins, optional 2 tablespoons sesame or sunflower seeds, optional Instructions: Spray a 13 by 9-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.

For the sauce. If using drained canned tomatoes, place them in a blender jar. If using fresh tomatoes, spread the onto a baking sheet and place them 4 inches below a very hot broiler. When they are darkly roasted (they&#39;ll be blackened in spots), about 6 minutes, flip them over and roast the other side-5 to 6 minutes more will give you splotchy-black and blistered tomatoes that are soft and cooked through. Cool. Working over your baking sheet, pull off and discard the blackened skins, and for round tomatoes, cut out the hard cores where the stems were attached. Transfer to a blender, along with all the juices on the baking sheet. If using canned chipotles, add them to the blender, seeds and all, If using dried chipotles, toast them in a dry skillet over medium heat for a couple of minutes, turning frequently until very aromatic. Place in a small bowl, cover with hot tap water and let rehydrate 30 minutes. Drain and add to the blender. Blend the tomatoes and chiles to a puree, but one that still retains a little texture. You should have 2 1/4 cups puree. Over medium heat, set a medium-large wide pot (like a 4-quart Dutch oven of Mexican cazuela) or a deep, large (12-inch) saute pan-you&#39;ll need a lid for whatever vessel you choose. Measure the oil, add half of the onion and cook, stirring regularly, until richly golden, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for another minute, then raise the heat to medium-high. Add the tomato puree and stir nearly constantly for 4 to 5 minutes, until the mixture thickens somewhat. Stir in the broth or water and season with salt. The sauce needs to be seasoned highly with salt, but watch out if your chips or broth is already salted. Cover the pot if not continuing with step 2 right away. You should have 4 1/2 cups broth mixture. To cook and serve the chilaquiles. Set out the crema, chicken and cheese. Put the pot over medium high heat until the broth mixture boils. Stir in the epazote (if you&#39;re using cilantro, set it aside to add later) and the tortilla chips, coating all the chips well. Let return to a rolling boil, cover tightly and turn off the heat. Let stand 5 minutes (no longer). Immediately uncover and very carefully stir to coat the chips evenly with the sauce and to check that the chips have softened nicely-they should be a little chewy, not mushy. (If they are too chewy, stir in a little more broth, cover and set over medium heat for 3 or 4 more minutes). Sprinkle with the cilantro, if that is the herb you&#39;re using. Either spoon onto warm individual plates in the kitchen or serve directly from the vessel it was made in. Whichever you choose, drizzle the chilaquiles with the crema (or one of its stand-ins), strew with the remaining sliced onion and the optional shredded chicken, and dust generously with the finely crumbled cheese.; &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 25964,&quot;Garlic Chick Peas and Greens 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 6 cloves garlic, crushed 1 pound trimmed mustard greens, coarsely chopped Salt and pepper 1 cup vegetable broth 2 (15-ounce) cans chick peas, drained Instructions: Heat a skillet over medium heat.

Refrigerate, bone-side down and uncovered, at least 4 hours and up to overnight. The day of roasting, remove the roast from the refrigerator 2 hours before you begin cooking to let it come to room temperature. Set an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Once the roast is at room temperature, use a sharp knife to cut a crosshatch pattern on the fat at 2-inch intervals, without cutting into the meat. Combine the rosemary, black pepper and garlic in a small bowl and stir in the olive oil. Rub all over the meat until evenly distributed. Place the meat, fat-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan (or on a cooling rack set on top of a baking sheet if you don\u2019t have a roasting pan).

You can throw the rack of bones back in the oven at 500 degrees F for a few minutes to crisp them up if you\u2019d like to serve them. Slice the roast crosswise into slices. If you\u2019ve crisped the bones, cut them into ribs. Place the meat and bones on a platter and sprinkle with some flaky salt. Serve immediately with the Creamy Gremolata. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the parsley, mayonnaise, chives, horseradish and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 25969,&quot;Salmon Burger 1 1/2 pounds fresh salmon fillet 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning 2 eggs, well mixed or whisked 1/2 cup Asian-style breadcrumbs 1 to 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 cup shredded romaine lettuce 1/4 cup thousand island or remoulade sauce Four 5-inch buns 4 slices ripe tomato 1 lemon French fries, as side serving Instructions: To prepare the cakes, fine dice the salmon and then place in a mixing bowl.

Trim the ends from the oranges, then cut away the peel and pith. Working over the bowl to catch the juice, cut along the membrane on both sides of each orange segment with a paring knife and let the segments drop into the sieve. Squeeze the juice from the leftover membranes into the bowl. Remove the segments from the grapefruits in the same manner, and squeeze the juices from the leftover membranes into the bowl. Remove the segments from 1 lemon and squeeze the juice from the leftover membranes into the bowl. Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon into the bowl. Place the citrus segments, juices, sugar and arrowroot in a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then refrigerate for 30 minutes. For the crust: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt and lemon zest. Pulse until blended. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Combine the ice water and almond extract. With the machine running, gradually add the water mixture and process until moist clumps form. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and form into a ball. Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for 30 minutes. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a large sheet of parchment paper, roll out the dough into a 10-inch round. Slide the dough and parchment onto a large, heavy baking sheet. Fold in the edge of the dough to make a border, forming an 8 to 9-inch round. Pleat the edge loosely and pinch to seal any cracks in the dough. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork. Bake until the crust is golden, about 40 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slide a metal spatula under the crust and remove the parchment. Let cool completely. For the topping: In a small bowl, mix together the mascarpone cheese, sugar, vanilla and the orange and lemon zests until smooth. Spread the mascarpone topping over the cooled crust, then spoon the citrus jam on top.

Slowly whisk in the olive oil until emulsified. In a medium bowl, combine 1/2 cup of the dressing with the tomatoes and salt to taste. Toss to coat and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Reserve the remaining dressing for the sandwich. Make the pork: Cut the tenderloin on a bias into four equal pieces. Pound out each piece between 2 sheets of plastic wrap into a long 1/4-inch-thick cutlet. Set up a breading station with three shallow bowls. Place the flour in the first bowl. In the second bowl, beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (this gives it the puffy golden brown exterior we love!). Place the breadcrumbs in the third bowl. Generously sprinkle the pork cutlets with salt and pepper. Dredge in the flour and shake off the excess. Then coat in the egg, allowing the excess to drip off. Coat in the breadcrumbs, pressing to make sure it all sticks. Transfer the cutlets to a sheet pan and let dry out for 5 to 10 minutes. Heat the remaining 2 cups oil in a large high-sided pan or skillet over medium heat until it registers 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Fit two sheet pans with wire racks and set aside. Fry the cutlets in batches while gently shaking the skillet to ensure no sticking and that the tops of the cutlets get some love, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a rack to drain. Assemble the subs: In a medium bowl, combine the arugula and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Set aside. Cut the bread in half horizontally to split. Drizzle the cut sides of the bread with the reserved balsamic dressing and some olive oil.

Place the lobster in the pan and cover. Once the water has come to the boil, cook the lobster for ten minutes or until it no longer has any blue hue and has turned a deep red-orange color. Remove the lobster from the pan and leave to cool. Once cool you can prepare the lobster in the traditional manner: with a sharp knife make an incision at the point where the head joins the body and cut down the length of the lobster towards the tail. Make sure that you have cut right the way through the body. Now turn the lobster 180 degrees and cut from the original incision back through the head. With you fingers gradually prise the shell apart so that it falls into two halves. Remove the front claws and set aside. With your index finger prise the meat out of the shell (trying to keep it in one piece, again working from the tail upwards. Replace the meat in the shell (this process makes it easier for your guests to keep their fingers clean) and repeat with the second half. Using a cleaver or hammer crack both sides of the claws. Remove the surrounding shell and extract the meat in a single piece. Arrange the two halves of lobster on a plate together with the claw meat and serve with mayonnaise, which you can make in the following way: Put eggs, mustard, pinch of salt, grinding of pepper and a small squeeze of lemon juice/vinegar in a basin and beat well with a wooden spoon, beater or whisk. Start adding the oil, drop by drop to begin with, stirring all the time. When the mixture starts to emulsify you may add more oil in steady dribblets but keep stirring until you get the required jelly-like substance, which is the consistency that proper mayonnaise should be. Finally test for more seasoning.

When the coals are all ignited and the temperature has lowered to medium (hold hand about 5-inches above grill grid, over the area where coals are deepest, for 4 to 5 seconds), the grill is ready to cook. In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until it has rendered a good amount of fat, but has not begun color or crinkle up, about 4 minutes (The bacon should be cooked halfway, it should remain pliable). Remove from the heat. Thread the scallops onto skewers, putting 3 on each skewer, zig-zagging with a piece of bacon around each trio of scallops, securing it at the top and bottom with toothpicks, or secure with a second skewer. Sprinkle the skewers generously with salt and pepper, then place on grill over the side with fewer coals and cook until scallops are opaque all the way through, about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the corn, lima beans, tomato, sage, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the ingredients are nice and hot, about 5 minutes. To serve, place about 1/4 of the succotash on each plate, top with 2 skewers.

Whenever we would get to the farm in the mid-afternoon my grandmother would have a platter of deviled eggs, pimento cheese with soda crackers, and BLT&#39;s with the summer&#39;s best tomatoes on the simple sandwich. Since those days past, the simple BLT sandwich has always been a source of comfort to me. When I had the opportunity to run a kitchen and bring out these same memories of comfort through food to my guests, but with a twist, I couldn&#39;t pass it up. This is where the Green Tomato BLT came from. For the remoulade: Whisk the shallots, garlic, mustard, vinegar, paprika, cayenne, lemon juice, horseradish, and salt and pepper, to taste. Whisk in the olive oil. Stir in the celery, parsley, and scallion. Reserve 1 tablespoon for the sandwich, and store the rest in the refrigerator for later use. For the fried tomatoes: Combine the buttermilk, salt, pepper, and egg in a bowl. Combine the flour with the Creole seasoning and garlic powder in another bowl. Heat the oil in a 7-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat until the oil reaches approximately 150 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Dredge the green tomato slices in the flour mix, then the egg wash, and then the flour mix again and set aside. Once the oil is at the correct temperature, slowly place the green tomato slices in the oil. (Make sure the oil is no higher than half way up your pan.) Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Once golden on both sides, lift the tomatoes out and place on a plate that has been lined with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble: Place the butter in a pan and melt over medium-high heat. Toast both sides of the bread. Slather both sides of the bread with reserved remoulade. Then layer with fried green tomatoes, Roma tomatoes, bacon, and arugula and top with the remaining slice of bread. Slice in half and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 26017,&quot;Buffalo Chicken Sliders with Celery-Blue Cheese Slaw 2 tablespoons unsalted butter One 12-ounce bottle buffalo hot sauce<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br> 4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken, light and dark meat<br> 12 sweet Hawaiian slider rolls, sliced in half through the middle<br> Celery Blue Cheese Slaw (see recipe below) 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon vegetable oil<br> 4 celery stalks, thinly sliced on a bias (about 1 heaping cup)<br> 3 green onions, thinly sliced on a bias<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: To a medium-sized, straight-sided pan, add the butter and melt over medium heat.

Cut 6 of the garlic cloves in half lengthwise and insert one half clove into each slit. Rub the pork with the Rib Rub, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 3/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Place the loin in a zip-top plastic bag or glass dish and pour the orange juice and 3 tablespoons of the oil over the pork. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours, turning occasionally. Remove the pork from the marinade and pat dry. Transfer the marinade to a saucepan, bring to a boil, and reduce to 3 tablespoons, about 6 minutes. Set aside and reserve for the gravy. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the beets with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper in a small bowl. In a separate, large bowl, combine the onions, parsnips, carrots, potatoes, remaining 4 garlic cloves, and remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and toss to combine. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and remaining 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Arrange mixed vegetables and the beets in the bottom of a small roasting pan. Place the pork loin on top of the vegetables and roast for 20 minutes.

Scoop out the flesh leaving the shells 1/8-inch thick. Salt the shells and invert to drain over paper towels for 30 minutes. Salt the flesh and drain it in a strainer. Defrost the spinach in a microwave, squeeze out all of the water and separate it with fingertips. Put the spinach in a mixing bowl. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat with extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan. Add the meat, sage and salt and pepper, to taste. Lightly brown the meat, then stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, Add the meat mixture to the mixing bowl. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a sauce pot over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, cook for 1 minute, then whisk in milk and bring the mixture to a bubble. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season the sauce with salt, pepper and nutmeg, to taste. Cool for a few minutes, then add it to the meat and spinach. Pat the salted flesh of the eggplant dry and finely chop, then stir it into meat mixture along with an egg and about 1/2 cup cheese. Tear the bread, add it to a food processor and pulse-grind into fresh crumbs. Finely chop the parsley leaves and stir it into the bread crumbs. Pat the eggplant shells dry and drizzle a baking dish with extra-virgin olive oil. Arrange the eggplant shells in the dish and mound the filling into them. Top with bread crumbs and a little more cheese, dot with dabs of butter and bake until lightly golden, about 30 minutes. Cool completely, cover and refrigerate for a make-ahead meal. To reheat, put the eggplant in a 350 degree F oven, loosely covered, for 20 minutes, then uncover and bake until deeply golden in color, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Cut the thick layer of fat and the skin from the ham and discard. Place the ham in a roasting pan. For easier cleanup, line the pan with aluminum foil, because the glaze will drip off and burn on the bottom of the pan. Roast the ham for 1 hour. While the ham is roasting, make the glaze. Combine the orange juice and zest, brown sugar, liqueur, cl paste, and pepper in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer the mixture until is reduced by about half and is as thick as maple syrup, about 35 minutes. Whisk in the espresso or espresso powder. You should have almost 2 cups of glaze. You are going to use half of this glaze to brush the ham while it is roasting and reserve the other half for brushing on the ham after it is sliced. After the first hour of cooking, brush the ham with the glaze. Roast for another hour, brushing with the glaze every 15 minutes. Since the ham is already cooked, you just need to warm it all the way through. Check for an internal temperature of 130 to 140 degrees using an instant-read thermometer. Remove the ham from the oven when it is nicely browned and warmed through. To serve: We like to serve this with warm cornbread. For a lovely presentation, slice half the ham and arrange the slices up against the unsliced part on a big platter. Brush the slices with the remaining glaze. Cook&#39;s Note: The glaze can be made a few days ahead and stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator. Serving Suggestion: Etta&#39;s Cornbread, recipe follows. To make the cornbread, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square baking dish. Combine the flour, cornmeal, cheese, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and honey. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Add the melted butter and stir into the mixture. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.

Fry the patties over medium to medium-low heat in a large skillet, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Onto each half of a burger bun, place a cooked patty. Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons grated Cheddar and a pile of hot chili. In a large, heavy pot, brown the ground beef with the garlic over medium heat until the beef is totally cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain off most of the excess fat, leaving a little behind for moisture and flavor. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and cayenne. Stir together well, cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally; if the liquid level seems low, add up to 1 cup water to keep it from burning. After an hour, stir in the kidney and pinto beans. In a small bowl, combine the masa harina with 1/2 cup water and stir together with a fork until it&#39;s smooth. Pour the masa mixture into the chili. Stir together well, then taste the chili and adjust the seasonings. Simmer the chili for another 10 minutes to thicken, then turn off the heat and let it cool.

Place the slice on a kitchen towel and make sure to dry them off. This will prevent the oil from spattering from the excess moisture of the potatoes. Heat the oil in a deep frying pan or a fryer, to 350 degrees F. Slowly add the potato slices and fry for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown. Quickly remove the chips from the oil and drain on paper towels. While the chips are still hot, sprinkle the salt over the chips.

With the motor running, stream in the olive oil until the paste loosens into a pesto. Use immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 2 days before using. (Makes 2 1/2 cups; see Cook&#39;s Note.) For the shrimp scampi: Heat the butter and olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the shrimp with 2 teaspoons salt; add to the hot pan, along with the garlic. Cook until the shrimp are just starting to turn pink, 3 minutes. Add the wine and cl paste, and bring to a boil; boil until the shrimp are cooked through and the wine is reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice and lemon zest. Season with more salt if needed. For the pizza: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with foil. Place the flatbreads, bottom-side up, on the prepared baking sheets; brush each with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Transfer to the oven and toast until just beginning to brown and get crispy. Let cool for 5 minutes. Turn the flatbreads over, spread 1/4 cup kale pesto over each and then sprinkle each with 1/3 cup of the fontina. Place back in the oven for another 5 minutes, until the top edges have browned slightly and the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven and top with 6 to 8 pieces of shrimp per pizza. Spoon over some scampi sauce. Cut the pizzas into smaller pieces and serve immediately. In a large bowl, combine the kale and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Massage the salt into the kale and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. In another bowl, combine the raisins, 1/4 cup of the vinegar and 1/4 cup hot water. Rehydrate the raisins for at least 15 minutes. Drain when ready to serve. Combine anchovies, grated pecorino, shallots, honey and the remaining 1/4 cup vinegar in a blender. Blend on high speed until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add in the oil. Pour the dressing over the salad at least 15 minutes before serving to help further tenderize the kale. When ready to serve, add the toasted hazelnuts and plumped golden raisins to the salad, and garnish with shaved pecorino. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 26063,&quot;MYOTO - Make Your Own Take Out: Thai Chicken Noodle Soup 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan 1 medium size yellow onion, peeled, quartered and thinly sliced 3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 2 poblano or anaheim peppers, seeded and thinly sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup shredded carrots, available in pouches in the produce department 6 cups, 1 1/2 quarts, chicken broth 1 1/2 pound chicken tenders cut into bite size chunks, 2 packages 2 small bundles from a 3.75 ounce package of bean thread noodles, there is usually 3 bundles in one package (recommended: Kame) 3 tablespoons cilantro leaves, chopped 15 fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped 1 lime Instructions: Heat a large heavy-bottomed soup pot with vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan, over high heat.

Add the meat chunks to the skillet a few at a time, turning to brown well on all sides. Do not crowd or they will not brown properly; cook them in batches if necessary. (You may find it easier to do the initial browning in the oven: Preheat to 500 degrees and roast the meat with 1 tablespoon of the oil and the garlic clove, shaking the pan to turn them once or twice, until brown all over. Remove the garlic clove before continuing.) Season the meat with salt and pepper as it cooks. When the meat is brown, remove it with a slotted spoon. Pour or spoon off most of the fat and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions. Cook, stirring, until they soften, about 10 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add the stock or water or wine, bay leaf, thyme, and meat, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to low and cover. Cook, undisturbed, for 30 minutes.</p><ul><li>Uncover the pan; the mixture should be quite soupy (if it is not, add a little more liquid). Add the potatoes and carrots, turn the heat up for a minute or so to resume boiling, then lower the heat and cover again. Cook 30 to 60 minutes until the meat and vegetables are tender. Taste for seasoning and add more salt, pepper, and/or thyme if necessary. (If you are not planning to serve the stew immediately, remove the meat and vegetables with a slotted spoon and refrigerate them and the stock separately. Skim the fat from the stock before combining it with the meat and vegetables, reheating, and proceeding with the recipe from this point.) Add the minced garlic and the peas and bacon; if you are pleased with the stew&#39;s consistency, continue to cook, covered, over low heat. If it is too soupy, remove the cover and raise the heat to high. In either case, cook an additional 5 minutes or so, until the peas have heated through and the garlic flavor has pervaded the stew.

Coat a large, wide pot set over medium-high heat with olive oil. Toss in the garlic and crushed red pepper. When the garlic becomes golden and very aromatic, remove from the pan and discard. Toss in the tomatoes, zucchini and onions and roll them around in the oil. Add 1 cup of the stock and season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the tomatoes start to burst and give off their juices, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup more stock if the liquid level is very low. Drop the tagliatelle into the boiling water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Toss the shrimp into the pot with the tomatoes and stir to combine. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, and then toss the pasta immediately into the pot with the tomato mixture. Add in the reserved cooking water, if needed. Toss vigorously to combine. Remove from the heat and drizzle some finishing oil over the top, then add the Parmesan and a sprinkling of fresh oregano to garnish. Transfer to a serving bowl or platter and serve immediately. Place the flour on a clean dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour about 8-inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, a pinch of salt and 1 to 2 tablespoons water. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water and salt. Then begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture; be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together as a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch, but not to tear, the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 minutes for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately, do not refrigerate. To roll out the pasta, you need to run the dough through a pasta roller a bunch of times to get it long and thin. To start, cut off about a quarter of the dough, keeping the rest wrapped up so it doesn&#39;t dry out. Squish the dough to flatten it. Run the dough through the pasta roller starting on the widest setting, number 1. Then dust the dough with flour, fold it into thirds, and put the dough through this setting two more times. If the dough ever feels sticky or tacky, dust with flour. Now adjust the setting to number 2 and repeat the process again, changing the setting each time until the dough reaches the desired thickness. Once the dough is rolled out, be sure to keep the pasta covered so it doesn&#39;t dry out. Repeat this process with the remaining dough, then cut the dough to the desires pasta shape. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 26069,&quot;White Cupcakes with Marshmallow Frosting 1 1/2 cups cake flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 cup milk, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 large egg whites, at room temperature 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 1/2 cups confectioners sugar 1/4 cup marshmallow cream 2 tablespoons milk 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch fine salt Rainbow sprinkles, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line one 12-cup standard muffin tin with paper cupcake liners. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together into a medium bowl. Stir the milk and vanilla together in a small bowl. Set aside. Beat the butter on low speed in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar. Increase the speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add about one-third of the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Add half the milk mixture and beat until smooth. Repeat, adding flour, then milk, and then the rest of the flour, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat briefly to make a smooth batter. Clean the medium bowl and the mixer beaters. Put the egg whites in the clean medium bowl. Whip on high speed with the electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and continue to beat until the egg whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks, about 10 minutes. Fold one-third of the whites into the batter to lighten it and then fold in the remaining whites. Divide the cake batter evenly between the liners. Clean the large bowl and the mixer beaters. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, rotating the tin about halfway through, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes on a rack in the tin for 10 minutes, and then remove from the tin. Cool on the rack completely. Beat the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar in the clean large bowl with the electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the marshmallow, milk, vanilla and salt and beat on low speed until blended. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until fluffy and thick, 1 to 2 minutes.

Feel free to fold moist leaves in half. Place a heavy dinner plate directly on top to fully submerge the leaves. Soak until the leaves are dark green and very pliable, 10 to 24 hours. (The water may darken during soaking.) Drain the bamboo leaves in a large colander. Fill the stockpot halfway with fresh water. Thoroughly wipe both sides of each leaf with a clean sponge or dish cloth, then rinse under running water. Stack them in a pile and return to the stockpot. Always top with a clean plate to fully submerge the leaves in the water. (The leaves can be kept submerged in the fresh water for up to 2 days). Whisk together the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sugar and five-spice power in a small bowl until well combined. Add the pork belly and turn until well coated. Cover and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours. Remove the pork belly from the fridge 1 hour before assembling the zongzi. Rinse the rice under water in a large bowl until the water runs clear, 4 to 5 times. Cover with at least 2 inches water and soak for 2 hours. Rinse the mung beans in a medium bowl until the color of the beans lightens, 3 to 4 times. Cover with at least 1 inch water and soak for 2 hours. Cover the shiitakes with at least 1 inch water in another medium bowl and soak until squishy and filled with water, about 2 hours. Put the peanuts and dried shrimp in separate small bowls; cover each with at least 1/2 inch water and soak for 1 hour. Meanwhile, slice the sausage on the bias into 8 even slices and split the egg yolks in half. Set aside in two separate bowls. Drain the shiitakes and wipe out the bowl. Using kitchen shears and a paring knife, remove the hard stems and discard. Cut each mushroom into 4 slices; return to the bowl. Drain the peanuts, shake to remove the excess water and return to the bowl. Repeat with the dried shrimp; roughly chop any that are larger. Set the 3 bowls aside. Drain the rice in a large fine-mesh strainer, shake to remove the excess water and return to the bowl; add 2 teaspoons salt with the oil and stir with a rubber spatula until well combined. Drain the mung beans in the large fine-mesh strainer, shake to remove the excess water and return to the bowl; add 1 teaspoon salt and stir with the rubber spatula until well combined. Set both bowls aside. Now it\u2019s time to assemble the zongzi: Take 2 bamboo leaves that are about the same size and shake off the excess water; lightly pat dry. Stack them shiny-sides up, slightly overlapping the leaves lengthwise. Gently fold into a cone (do not make a hard crease, which will crack the leaves) at the midpoint of the stack, with the longer ends pointing up. Hold the cone with the leaf tips pointing toward you. Fill the pocket with 3 leveled tablespoons rice and 2 leveled tablespoons mung beans. Use a rubber spatula to pat down and level the surface of the filling. Add 4 to 6 peanuts, 1 tablespoon dried shrimp, half salted egg yolk, 1 piece of Chinese sausage, 2 pieces of shiitake, 1 piece of pork belly, then another 4 to 6 peanuts, 2 tablespoons mung beans and 3 tablespoons rice. The pocket will be very full. Use the rubber spatula to push down and level the surface of the filling along the length of your palm. Grip the middle of the cone, forming the letter \C\ with your dominant hand. Tap the cone once or twice on a cutting board to help the filling settle to the bottom, never letting go of the C-grip. (It\u2019s fine if a little water starts to leak out--that&#39;s from the soaked mushrooms and rice.) With the opening facing you, fold the protruding leaf ends over to neatly enclose the rice dumpling. Use both hands to shape the cone into a pyramid with the tip at the bottom and the base at the top. Grip tightly and prepare to tie. Using your nondominant thumb, hold 1 piece of the butcher\u2019s twine against the ends that are folded over, leaving about 6 inches of twine dangling on one side. Make several loops widthwise around the zongzi traveling down its length. Be sure to pull the twine tightly as you loop to prevent the rice from spilling out during cooking. Then make a double knot with the 6-inch length that was dangling. Use this knot to transition and loop around the zongzi lengthwise, then double knot the two ends of the twine. Cut off the excess twine and trim any extra bits of leaves. Practice makes perfect! The first one is going to look rough, but it will get better. Repeat with the remaining bamboo leaves, fillings and twine. Place the zongzi in a 6- to 8-quart Instant Pot?. Fill with enough water to leave 2 inches of space from the maximum fill line. Set to pressure cook on high for 1 hour (see Cook\u2019s Note). After the pressure cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for natural release and wait until the natural release cycle is complete. Set to keep warm for 1 hour. Using tongs, carefully remove the zongzi to a plate and let cool slightly. (It\u2019s fine if the corners of the zongzi release a little bit of rice.) Using kitchen shears, cut off the twine and remove the bamboo leaves, if desired. Transfer to a dinner plate and serve as is or with additional light soy sauce. Enjoy! To store extras, once the rice dumplings are completely cooled, refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. To reheat: Place on a steamer rack in a large saucepan, cover and steam for 15 minutes from the refrigerator; 30 minutes from frozen. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 26071,&quot;Cranberry Champagne Cocktail 1-ounce cranberry juice (sweetened) 1 wedge lime Champagne or sparkling wine Cranberries (frozen) Instructions: In a chilled Champagne flute add cranberry juice and a squeeze of lime.

Combine the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Starting on low speed, mix in the flour mixture in 3 additions; scrape down the sides of the bowl in between. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into a disk. Refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours, up to overnight. Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Cut the dough in half. Dust your work surface and the dough liberally with flour and roll one piece of dough about 1/4 inch thick. Cut as many ghosts as you can with a 3.5-inch ghost-shape cookie cutter and transfer to the baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining dough. Gather the scraps from both pieces of dough, then flatten, rewrap and refrigerate. Meanwhile, bake the ghosts, switching and rotating positions of the baking sheets halfway through, until golden on the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the refrigerated dough scraps to get about 30 cookies in total. For the royal icing: Combine the egg whites and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high until foamy, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, vanilla and 1 tablespoon water. Beat on low speed until combined.

Place the bacon on a wire rack fitted over a baking sheet and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Bake until dark brown and crispy, about 15 minutes. Break each slice in half and reserve. Cut the tomatoes into 4 to 5 slices each. Place a large saute pan or grill/griddle pan over medium heat and add a pat of butter. Sprinkle the tomatoes with salt and pepper, add to the pan and cook until warmed through but still solid. Cut the doughnuts in half and butter the outside of each half. Place 4 doughnut halves buttered-side down in the same pan. Layer on a slice of cheese, a few slices of grilled tomato, a dash of hot sauce, 1 to 2 bacon pieces and another slice of cheese. Place the 4 remaining doughnut halves on top to make sandwiches and cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until the cheese is melted, the sandwiches are heated through and there is a nice crust on the bottom, another 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately. Heat the oil to 365 to 375 degrees F in a cast-iron Dutch oven over medium heat. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, cheese, scallions, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, sour cream and egg. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix to combine, making sure there are no dry bits left. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly coat with flour. Pat the dough into a 1-inch disc. Then, using a large glass dipped into flour, cut out rounds for the doughnuts. Press the dough back together to cut out another doughnut or 2. Dip your finger into the flour, then press it into the center of each doughnut while it is on the floured surface to create a hole. Move your finger around in the hole to make it larger. Turn the doughnut over and repeat on the other side to make sure the hole is clear and large. When the oil is ready, place the doughnuts into the oil carefully and fry for 3 to 4 minutes per side. The doughnuts are thick and take time to cook all the way through. You can flip them every minute to keep them from browning too much on each side. Transfer the doughnuts to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and sprinkle with a little salt.

Cut each piece in half lengthwise, then cut out all the seeds and spongy pulp from the center. Slice each section crosswise 3?16 inch (41/2 millimeters) thick. (A mandoline or other manual vegetable slicer is helpful for this.) Make layers of sliced zucchini and salt in a large bowl, then toss well. Macerate for 12 hours to draw the water out of the zucchini. Drain the zucchini, then squeeze a handful at a time to remove excess water. Place the zucchini in a heavy nonreactive pot and add the vinegar and 1 cup (250 milliliters) water. The liquid should barely cover the zucchini. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir to redistribute the zucchini, then reduce the heat to medium and cook until the zucchini slices are cooked through but still whole, about 5 minutes. Do not allow them to break apart. Smaller zucchini will take less time. Drain the zucchini and put them in a large colander. Top them with a heavy weight, such as a pot filled with water, to squeeze out the liquid. Let the zucchini drain under the weight for 15 minutes. Lay several clean kitchen towels on a table covered with cardboard. Arrange the zucchini slices on the towels, spreading the slices apart. Let dry at room temperature until they feel a little leathery and are no longer damp, 24 to 48 hours. They will shrivel considerably. Place the zucchini in a bowl and toss with the mint, garlic, hot peppers, and the 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) olive oil. Taste for salt and let the mixture marinate at room temperature for a day. Transfer the zucchini to a 1-pint (1/2-liter) glass jar. Pack them in tightly, pushing them down with a fork or spoon to remove any air gaps. Top with olive oil so they are completely submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 weeks before sampling to give the zucchini time to absorb the seasonings. Bring them out of the refrigerator about an hour before you plan to serve them to allow the oil to liquefy. Return any leftover zucchini to the refrigerator, topping with oil so the zucchini remain completely submerged. If kept submerged in olive oil and refrigerated, the zucchini will last for up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26121,&quot;Polly&#39;s Fried Chicken 1 whole chicken, giblets and liver removed, cut into 8 pieces 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons salt Vegetable oil, for frying, enough to come up halfway on the chicken Instructions: In a large bowl, soak the chicken in enough salted water to cover in the refrigerator overnight. Add about 1 tablespoon salt per cup of water. Drain the chicken and shake off the excess water. In a pie plate, mix together the flour, pepper and salt. Roll the chicken in the flour to coat. Into two 12-inch cast iron skillets, pour enough vegetable oil to come to a depth of 1 1/2 inches in each skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until very hot, 305 degrees F. Using tongs, carefully add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, making sure there is a lot of space between the pieces. Cook all the chicken at the same time. Cover the skillets and lower the heat to medium. After 15 minutes, the bottom sides should be brown. Turn the pieces over with the tongs, and continue to cook, covered, browning on all sides, and adjusting the heat as necessary. Remove the breast pieces after 12 minutes. All the chicken should be cooked in about 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to paper towels to drain.

Marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to 1 hour. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Thread the shrimp lengthwise onto soaked wooden skewers, straightening the shrimp as you go. Grill until the shrimp are grill-marked and opaque throughout, 3 minutes per side. Cut the cauliflower into 1/2-inch-thick slices, making sure to cut through the main stem so the slices stay intact. Oil the slices generously, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon smoked paprika. In a VERY HOT nonstick skillet, sear the cauliflower \steaks\ in enough canola oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Once each side is golden brown, transfer to a baking sheet and roast until al dente. In a saucepan, combine the honey, sparkling wine and ginger and bring to a simmer. Add the kumquats and cook over low heat until jammy. Cool and reserve.

Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend. When you are ready to freeze, remove the vanilla pod from the base. (Rinse the vanilla pod, dry it, and save it for another use.) Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Alternately, pour 1 cup of the cold base into a sandwich-sized plastic bag and seal with heavy-duty tape (to prevent the salty water from getting into the bag). Fill a 1-gallon plastic storage bag half full of ice and add about 1/2 cup rock or sea salt. Put the smaller bag into the larger bag and seal. Put this bag into a large garbage bag and cover it with more ice and salt. Close the bag and toss around for 15 minutes. Make sure you wipe off all the salty water on the bag containing the finished ice cream before you open it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 26125,&quot;Seared Tuna 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon powdered wasabi, or more if desired 3 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 2 (8 ounce) sushi quality Ahi tuna steaks 2 tablespoons olive oil Fresh ginger, grated, for garnish Instructions: Mix the cream and powdered wasabi in a small saucepan.

Put the butter in a small mixing bowl and add the parsley. Stir to combine with a rubber spatula. Scoop into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe the butter into rosettes on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze until the butter is set, about 1 hour. For the salmon: Line a plate with paper towels and place the salmon on it skin-side up. Using a paring knife, score the salmon by making 2 small slits in the skin on each piece, making sure not to cut into the flesh. Pat the skin with paper towels to make sure it is as dry as possible. Place a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Once the skillet is warm, add the vegetable oil and heat until shimmering. The skillet needs to be very hot to create a crispy sear at the start. Season the salmon skin with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, then place the salmon pieces skin-side down in the oil; reduce the heat to medium. Using a fish spatula, apply even pressure to each piece to make sure it stays flat. Cook, without flipping, until the edges are golden brown and the flesh is turning opaque, 7 to 8 minutes. Season the flesh of the salmon with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and flip over to finish cooking; it will take about 2 minutes more for medium (125 degrees F), depending on the thickness of the fish. Do not flip the fish again or cover the skillet. Plate the salmon crispy skin facing up. Top each piece with a rosette of herb butter.

Cook the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon. Reserve the drippings. Crumble enough of the fruitcake to measure 1 cup; set the remaining cake aside. Mix the crumbled cake, flour and butter with your fingers in a bowl until the mixture is in pea-size pieces. Place on a baking sheet and bake until crisp, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring halfway through. Let cool, then add the bacon and crumble the mixture into smaller pieces. Beat the gorgonzola, cream cheese, chives, Worcestershire sauce and cayenne in a bowl with a wooden spoon until smooth; set aside. Line a mini loaf pan or small souffle dish with plastic wrap, leaving a long overhang on the sides. Press the crumble into the bottom of the dish. Spread the cheese mixture over the crumble layer and fold in the excess plastic wrap to cover the cheese. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, brush a baking sheet with some of the reserved bacon drippings. Slice the remaining fruitcake into 1/4-inch-thick pieces with a serrated knife (if they fall apart, press back together with your fingers). Place the slices on the prepared baking sheet, brush with more drippings and toast 7 to 10 minutes per side. Cool on the baking sheet. Uncover the cheese mold and invert onto a platter. Serve with the fruitcake toasts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 26139,&quot;Balsamic Chicken with Corn and Swiss Chard 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon ketchup 1 tablespoon dijon mustard 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 4 ears of corn, kernels cut off (about 2 cups) 1 bunch Swiss chard, chopped (stems and leaves separated)<br> 1 bunch Swiss chard, chopped (stems and leaves separated) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 scallions, sliced Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium and lightly brush the grill grates with olive oil. Whisk the vinegar, olive oil, ketchup and mustard in a small bowl. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and brush all over with the vinegar mixture. Grill until marked and cooked through, 8 to 9 minutes per side; transfer to a plate. Meanwhile, heat a cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat on the stove or place directly on the grill grates. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the corn kernels and Swiss chard stems to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the corn is tender and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the butter, scallions and chard leaves. Cook until the chard is just wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the chicken and serve with the corn mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 26140,&quot;Spicy Braised Collard Greens 8 ounces smoked bacon, cut into thin strips (lardons) 1 cup diced onions 4 pounds collard greens, rinsed well but not dried Kosher salt, to taste Freshly ground black pepper 2 cups chicken stock 1/4 cup cider vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste Hot pepper vinegar, for serving Instructions: In a large Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until just crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the bacon drippings and lower the heat to medium. Add the onions and cook until tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.<br> While the bacon and onions are cooking, prepare the greens. To remove the thick, woody stems that run down the center of the leaves, hold the base of the collard stem in one hand. Wrap your other hand around the bottom of the stem, directly under the leaf (like you are holding a baseball bat). In one firm motion, quickly slide your hand up the stem, removing the leaf in one swift movement. To chop the leaves, stack a few on top of each other and roll up like a cigar. Slice the roll into 1-inch pieces, rotate, and give another good chop. Continue until all the greens are chopped.<br> Increase the heat of the Dutch oven to medium-high. Add a few large handfuls of greens at a time - stirring constantly to allow each batch to wilt for a few moments - until you can fit all of the greens into the pot. Continue to saute the greens for 3 to 5 minutes, until bright green and wilted. Season with a very generous pinch of kosher salt and a few big grinds of freshly ground black pepper. Add the chicken stock, vinegar, sugar, and red pepper flakes to the greens and stir until combined. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes.<br> Add the cooked bacon to the greens and simmer an additional 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning (don&#39;t be afraid to be generous with the salt). Serve with hot pepper vinegar on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 26141,&quot;Strawberry-Chia Breakfast Pops One 5-ounce can evaporated milk Juice of 1 lime 3 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons chia seeds 6 large strawberries Instructions: Whisk together the evaporated milk, lime juice, honey and chia seeds in a medium bowl.

Refrigerate 24 hours. Discard the paper towels, rewrap and return to the refrigerator, on the rack, for 3 days. Change the paper towels again if it becomes damp and sticks to the steak. An hour before cooking, remove the steak from the refrigerator and remove the paper towels. Thirty minutes before cooking, sprinkle the steak on both sides with the kosher salt. Spritz 2 pieces of newspaper with the vegetable oil and put in the bottom of a charcoal chimney starter. Light a pound of natural lump charcoal in the chimney on the cooking grate of a kettle grill. Burn the coals for 11 to 15 minutes, or until all pieces are ashen and have decreased to a single layer of charcoal with several holes through which you can see. Carefully shake the chimney to knock any ash off the coals. Pick up the chimney and use tongs to brush away any coals or ash on the grate. Lay the steak on the grate where the chimney was. Put the chimney over the steak and cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Watch for coals that may fall out of the chimney onto the steak and remove immediately. Remove the chimney, flip the steak, and replace the chimney for another 1 1/2 minutes. Put a cooling rack on top of the chimney during this time to heat. Remove the steak from under the chimney and put on the cooling rack. Cover with a medium metal mixing bowl and cook for 1 minute.

Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook stirring until the shallots are well coated. Add the diced tomatoes and 1 teaspoon salt, bring to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Simmer until the tomatoes have softened about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup water and let sit until soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer the soup, gelatin and cream to a blender. Blend until smooth and pour in to a glass loaf pan. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.<br> For the dough: Put the flour in a large bowl. Pour half the hot water in and stir with a wooden spoon. Add the remaining hot water and stir until the dough starts to look shaggy. Add all of the cold water and oil. Keep stirring until the dough forms a ball.<br> Knead the dough on a floured surface until soft, smooth and springs back when you poke it with your finger, 8 to 10 minutes. (Alternately, you can knead the dough in a stand mixer with the hook attachment, on medium speed for 6 to 8 minutes.) Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Take 1 piece (cover the remaining 3 pieces with plastic wrap) and cut it into 4 pieces. Work with 1 small piece of dough at a time, keep the remaining covered with plastic wrap. Roll the dough between your palms to make a round, smooth ball. Using a rolling pin, roll into a 4 1/2-to-5-inch circle. (You may need more flour to keep the dough from sticking but try to use it sparingly.)<br> Fill the dough with 1 heaping tablespoon of tomato soup filling and then press 1 tomato half into it. Pleat the dumpling: Use your fingers to pleat and pinch the edge of the dough together, enclosing the filling, into a little satchel. Twist and pinch the tip of the dough close. Repeat with rest. Make sure that you cover any dough that you aren&#39;t currently using and cover the dumplings with a towel to prevent drying out. Fill a large pot with 2-inches of water and insert a steamer basket that has a lid. Line the basket with a single layer of Napa cabbage leaves. Cover and steam over medium heat to warm up the steamer and soften cabbage, about 2 minutes. Place dumplings on the cabbage leaves, leaving 1-inch between each dumpling.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and grease a 9-by-13-inch gratin dish with oil. Spoon some of the tomatillo sauce into the bottom of the pan to lightly coat it. Dip each tortilla into the heated tomatillo sauce (this will both flavor the tortilla and also make it more pliable). Spoon 1/4 cup of the ground turkey filling onto each tortilla. Divide 1/2 cup of the shredded Jack cheese between each tortilla. Fold the tortillas over the filling and place them seam-side down in the gratin dish. Place 6 enchiladas in the pan and top with more tomatillo sauce so they are just barely covered. Top with remaining 1/2 cup of Jack cheese and sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco. Place on a tray (to catch any drips) and bake until the cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling, 15 to 17 minutes. Finish under the broiler to brown further if desired. Remove from the oven, let cool slightly and garnish with the chopped cilantro. Serve with the sour cream on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 26162,&quot;Fudgy Mocha Brownies Crisco?

Add the wine, garlic, pepper, curing salt, pistachios, and truffles, if using. Mix well with your hands. Divide the mixture in half. Form and press each half into a sausage about 8-inches long and 2-inches in diameter. Take care to press the mixture firmly enough to eliminate air bubbles, which would result in unsightly holes in the sausages. Wrap individually in plastic wrap, twisting the ends to enclose the sausages, and then roll each of them in aluminum foil, twisting the ends of the foil. Refrigerate for at least 3 days to cure. (Freeze 1 of the sausages, if desired, and thaw it slowly in the refrigerator before cooking.) The very important part of poaching these sausages is to do it at a low temperature for a long time. This makes a big difference in the taste and juiciness of the meat. Bring a pot of water to between 150 and 160 degrees F. Lower the wrapped sausages into the pot, and place a heavy lid that is a little smaller than the top of the pot on top of the sausages to weigh them down in the pot and keep them immersed in the water. Cook in the same temperature range, checking the pot occasionally, for about 1 hour, or until the internal temperature of the sausages is close to the same temperature as the water, about 150 degrees F. To keep warm, let the sausages sit in the 150 to 160 degrees F water until serving time. Note: Morton Tender Quick Curing Salt is a curing agent composed of 99 percent salt, 1/2 percent sodium nitrate, and 1/2 percent sodium nitrite. If you use regular salt the sausages will be fine to eat but will be gray in color rather than the appealing pink color achieved with the curing agent. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 26178,&quot;Beef Bourguignonne 6 strips thick-cut bacon, chopped 2 1/2 pounds flat-iron or tri-tip beef, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 medium carrots, diced 2 medium onions, diced 1 sprig fresh thyme 1 bay leaf 2 cloves garlic 1 sprig fresh parsley, plus more for garnish 1 4-inch piece celery stalk 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1/2 cup brandy 2 cups burgundy, cotes du rhone or other dry red wine 2 cups beef stock 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 cup pearl onions, peeled 1 teaspoon sugar 1 cup quartered button mushrooms Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Grind and pound the mixture into a smooth paste. Place the turkey breast skin side down on a clean flat surface. With a sharp knife, butterfly the turkey by cutting down the long side of the breast so it can open up like a book to create a large, flat rectangle of even thickness. Score the flesh lightly in a cross-hatch pattern, being careful not to cut too deeply into the flesh. Season the turkey with salt and black pepper. Rub the herb-spice paste into all the cuts on the surface of the turkey breast. Roll the butterflied breast together tightly starting with the side that does not have skin underneath it (that way there is skin on the outer layers when rolling it up). Form the turkey into a cylinder and secure with butcher?s twine. Tie the roll every 1 1/2 inches, then place in the refrigerator for 4 hours uncovered; this will help the turkey firm up and allows the salt to do a short dry cure on the meat. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the turchetta from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Brush the turchetta with olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. In a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, brown the turchetta, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Arrange the turchetta skin side up and place the whole pan into the oven and cook until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F (carryover cooking will increase the temperature as the turchetta rests), about 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, place on a large plate, tent with foil and rest 15 to 20 minutes. Add the chicken stock to the reserved juices in the pan and stir to combine. Keep warm. To serve the turchetta, remove the string and use a sharp carving knife to slice it into 1-inch-thick medallions. Shingle the slices on a large serving platter, spoon cooking juice over the turchetta, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 26184,&quot;Minestra 4 to 6 cloves garlic, crushed 1/8 pound pancetta, sliced and chopped 2 tablespoons (2 turns around the pan in a slow stream) extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 2 pounds escarole, washed and coarsely chopped (2 medium bunches or 1 large bunch) 2 (14-ounce) cans, cannellini beans, drained 1 quart prepared chicken stock or broth A couple pinches ground nutmeg or fresh grated nutmeg Coarse salt and black pepper Shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano, for topping Warm, crusty bread, for mopping Instructions: In a deep, large, heavy pot over moderate heat, saute garlic and pancetta in extra-virgin olive oil for 3 minutes. Add onions and cook 1 or 2 minutes longer. Add the greens and wilt them down to fit them all in the pot. Add beans, broth, and nutmeg, salt and pepper. Cook over moderate to medium-high heat for 12 minutes, or until greens are no longer bitter. Serve with shaved cheese, bread, and good red wine. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 26185,&quot;Small Mixed Salad with Macadamia Nut Oil 4 cups mixed greens Macadamia nut oil 1 cup crushed macadamia nuts Instructions: Wash the mixed greens and dry well. Place 1 cup of mixed greens per plate. Drizzle macadamia nut oil, to taste, over greens. Garnish with a little crushed macadamia nut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26186,&quot;Lemon Poppyseed Pound Cake 3 tablespoons milk 3 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups sifted bleached cake flour (sifted into the cup, then leveled off) 3/4 cup superfine sugar 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 3 tablespoons poppy seeds 13 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 cup lemon juice, freshly squeezed Fresh Blueberry Glaze, recipe follows 2 1/2 cups fresh blueberries 2 teaspoons arrowroot 1/4 cup sugar 1/3 cup water 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br> In a medium bowl, lightly combine the milk, eggs and vanilla. In a large mixing bowl, preferably with the whisk beater, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, lemon zest and poppy seeds. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to blend. Add the butter and half the egg mixture. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened. Increase to medium speed (high speed if using a hand held mixer) and beat for 1 minute to aerate and develop the cake&#39;s structure. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Gradually add the remaining egg mixture in 2 batches, beating for 20 seconds after each addition to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure. Scrape down the sides. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with a spatula. The batter will be almost a 1/2-inch from the top of the 4-cup loaf pan. Bake 55 to 65 minutes at 350 degrees (35 to 45 minutes in a fluted tube pan) or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Be sure to use a wooden toothpick to test for doneness. (The cake will spring back when pressed lightly in the center even before it is done. If the cake is under baked, it will have tough, gummy spots instead of a fine, tender crumb.) Cover loosely with buttered foil after 30 minutes to prevent over browning. The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven. To get an attractive split down the middle of the crust, wait until the natural split is about to develop (about 20 minutes) and then with a lightly greased sharp knife or single-edged razor blade make a shallow mark about 6 inches long down the middle of the cake. This must be done quickly so that the oven door does not remain open very long or the cake will fall. When the cake splits, it will open along the mark.<br> Shortly before the cake is done, prepare the Lemon Syrup: In a small pan over medium heat, stir the sugar and lemon juice until dissolved. As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, place the pan on a rack, poke the cake all over with a wire tester and brush it with 1/2 the syrup. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Loosen the sides with a spatula and invert onto a greased wire rack. Poke the bottom of the cake with a wire tester, brush it with some syrup and reinvert onto a greased wire rack. Brush the sides with the remaining syrup and allow to cool before wrapping airtight. Store 24 hours before eating to give the syrup a chance to distribute evenly.<br> Slice with a thin sharp knife into thin slices. Serve with Fresh Blueberry Glaze and lightly whipped cream.<br> Rinse the berries and allow them to dry thoroughly on paper towels. Place the berries in a bowl. In a medium saucepan, stir together the arrowroot and sugar. Stir in the water and lemon juice and heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is clear and thickened. With arrowroot this will happen before the boil. Remove the pan from the heat and add the blueberries all at once, tossing until coated with the glaze. The berries will turn a bright blue. Empty the berries into a colander or strainer to drain away any excess glaze not clinging to berries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26187,&quot;All Grown Up Raspberry Hot Tart 1 frozen pie crust 4 tablespoons lemon curd 8 tablespoons raspberry jam 1 (8-ounce) bag chocolate chips 1/2 cup heavy cream Favorite ice cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll the pie crust to 15 by 15 inches, and cut into 4 equal squares. Create a small border around the end of the crust by running a damp finger around it. Staying inside the border spread 1 tablespoon of lemon curd on half of the square. Spread 2 tablespoons of the jam on top of the curd and fold the square over, pressing the edges closed. Place the tarts in the freezer for 5 to 7 minutes, to firm. Bake the tarts on a cookie sheet for 10 to 12 minutes, until browned. You may have to turn the pan once to get even color. Meanwhile, in a double boiler on the stove, melt the chocolate chips. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cream. To serve, put a scoop of ice cream on a plate, top with a warm tart and drizzle with chocolate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26188,&quot;Thai Marinated Beef Cabbage Salad with Warm Shallot Vinaigrette 1 medium Napa cabbage, cored and fine julienne 1/2 medium green cabbage, cored and fine julienne 1/2 medium red cabbage, cored and fine julienne 2 carrots, peeled and fine julienne 1 bunch mint leaves, picked 1 bunch Thai basil leaves, picked 1 bunch cilantro leaves, picked 2 cups canola oil 3 large shallots, peeled and finely sliced 2 stalks lemongrass, white part only, minced 2 to 3 Thai bird chiles, de-stemmed, minced 2 tablespoons fish sauce 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons sesame oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds, to garnish 2 choice sirloins (8 to 9 ounces each), or similar cut of beef 2 jalapenos chiles, roughly chopped 2 serrano chiles, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon sambal 4 large shallots, peeled and roughly chopped 4 garlic cloves 3 tablespoons honey 2 cups soy sauce 1 cup rice wine vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste Instructions: Combine all ingredients and mix well.

In a separate shallow dish, whisk together 3 eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt to create a smooth egg wash. Line a cookie sheet with parchment. Dip the mozzarella cheese chunks into the egg wash, coating completely, and then into the pretzel crumbs, coating the cheese completely on all sides. Transfer to the prepared cookie sheet. Let the cheese stand for 5 minutes to set the coating, and then repeat the process, adding more eggs to the egg wash if necessary. When all the cheese is coated again, return to the cookie sheet and transfer to the freezer. Freeze the cheese for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. The longer the cubes freeze, the better they will fry. In a large bowl, blend the mayonnaise with the milk, chili sauce, vinegar, dill, parsley, garlic powder, garlic salt, onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper until smooth, about 2 minutes. Refrigerate the dip until ready to serve. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven on the stovetop or in an electric fryer to 350 degrees F. Remove the cheese from the freezer. Fry a few pieces at a time until crispy brown, and place them onto a paper towel-lined cookie sheet to drain. Serve immediately with the spicy ranch dip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 26209,&quot;Ranch Pork Chop Sheet Pan Supper 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce<br> One 3.5-ounce packet ranch dressing mix<br> 5 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 boneless pork chops (1/2 inch thick)<br> 1 pound baby Yukon gold potatoes, halved<br> 8 ounces green beans, trimmed<br> 2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.

Line the bottom of a 13-by-18-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the powdered sugar, almond flour, all-purpose flour and egg whites and mix on low until the ingredients combine without any visible lumps, approximately 1 minute. Meanwhile, put the butter and scraped vanilla bean seeds in a 2-quart saucepan and cook on high heat, whisking occasionally. As the mixture cooks, the butter will begin to brown and it will start to smell amazing, about 15 minutes! The longer the butter and vanilla stay on the heat, the more \nutty\ the final flavor will become. So cook it to your preference. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, reserving the brown butter. Turn the stand mixer to the lowest speed and stream the hot brown butter into the batter, mixing for approximately 2 minutes. Transfer the cake batter to the prepared baking sheet and bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool, then cut into rectangles about 4 inches by 1 1/2 inches. For the toasted marshmallow sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water and mix until the sugar is dissolved. Add the corn syrup to the sugar/water mixture. If there are any granules of sugar on the side of the saucepan, brush them down using a pastry brush dipped in water. Add the egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix the egg whites on high speed until soft peaks appear, then turn the mixer down to medium speed. Place the saucepan on medium-high heat and cook the sugar mixture to thread stage, approximately 234 degrees F. Turn the stand mixer to high speed and stream in the cooked sugar. Continue to mix the meringue on high speed until the outside of the bowl feels cool to the touch, approximately 5 minutes. For the spring fruit and berry compote: Combine the blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, figs, granulated sugar and mint in a mixing bowl and toss together. Let stand at least 5 minutes For the mint oil: Put the oil and mint in a blender and blend for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to a saucepan, slowly bring to a simmer and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Strain with a fine-mesh strainer, then let cool. Transfer the cooled mixture to a squeeze bottle. To assemble: Spoon and drag about 2 tablespoons of the marshmallow onto each plate and toast the top with a kitchen blowtorch. Place a rectangle of cake on top of each, then divide the fruit among the cakes. Decorate the plates with the mint oil from the squeeze bottle. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 26237,&quot;Shrimp Shumai and Pork Pot Stickers with Dipping Sauce 2 large egg whites 1 tablespoon cornstarch 2 pounds large shrimp, peeled, deveined and coarsely chopped 2 large cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped 2 scallions, chopped 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 1/2 tablespoons peeled and grated fresh ginger 1 tablespoon soy sauce, plus more if needed 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 pound ground pork 3 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more if needed 1 1/2 tablespoons peeled and grated fresh ginger 1 teaspoon sambal oelek 4 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped 4 scallions, chopped 2 large egg whites One 4-ounce can water chestnuts, drained and minced 1/2 orange bell pepper, finely diced 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped 1 tablespoon canola oil 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar 1/4 cup fish sauce 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon sambal oelek One 10-ounce package round wonton wrappers 4 large napa cabbage leaves, optional 2 tablespoons canola oil, or more as needed Instructions: For the shrimp shumai filling: Whisk to combine the egg whites and cornstarch in a medium bowl and set aside. Add the shrimp to a food processor and pulse into a chunky paste. Transfer the shrimp to a medium bowl and stir in the cornstarch and egg white mixture. Stir in the garlic, scallions, lemon zest, lemon juice, ginger, soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. To determine if the filling is seasoned well, make a small patty, about 2 tablespoons. Place a small saute pan over medium-high heat and add the canola oil. Once heated, add the tester patty and cook on both sides until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the pan and place on a paper-towel-lined plate, then taste. Adjust the seasoning of the remaining filling with soy sauce if needed. For the pork pot sticker filling: Mix to combine the pork, soy sauce, ginger, sambal, garlic, scallions, egg whites, water chestnuts, bell pepper and cilantro in a large bowl. To determine if the filling is seasoned well, make a small patty, about 2 tablespoons. Place a small saute pan over medium-high heat and add the canola oil. Once heated, add the tester patty and cook on both sides until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the pan and place on a paper-towel-lined plate, then taste. Adjust the seasoning of the remaining filling with soy sauce if needed. To make the dipping sauce: Combine the rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, sugar and sambal in a container, then cover and shake to combine. Set the dipping sauce aside while you assemble the dumplings. To cook: Place half of the wonton wrappers on a clean surface and add about 2 teaspoons of the shrimp filling to the center of each wrapper. Brush the edges of the wrapper with water. Fold and pleat as you gather the wrapping around the filling, leaving the top of the filling uncovered. Gently tap the shumai on your work surface, flattening the bottom and allowing it to stand upright, and form into a basket shape. Place the remaining half of the wonton wrappers on a clean work surface and add about 2 teaspoons of the pork filling to the center of each wrapper. Working one at a time, brush the edges of the wrapper with water and fold over to make a half-moon. Pinch the edges to pleat and close the filling into the center. Line each tray of a bamboo steamer with a round of perforated steamer parchment paper or the cabbage leaves, if using, and cover with the lid. Bring 1 to 2 inches of water to a boil in a large, wide pan. Set the bamboo steamer over the pot. Continue to add water as needed. Working in batches, place the shrimp shumai in the steamer and cover with the lid. Steam the shumai until cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes. Heat the canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the pork pot stickers and pour in 1/4 cup water. Cover the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes, then remove the cover and cook until the remaining water has evaporated and the bottom of the pot stickers are golden and crisp. Serve the shrimp shumai and the pork pot stickers with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26238,&quot;Italian Roast Beef 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup granulated garlic 1/4 cup granulated onion 1/2 cup dried basil 1/2 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup dried oregano 5 to 7-pound roast beef round 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.<br> Combine all the seasoning ingredients in a medium jar.<br> Trim all the fat from beef round. (I grind the trimmings), but you can cut them up into bite-size pieces and arrange on the bottom of a roasting pan. Sprinkle the trimmings with some of the seasoning mix. Put the roast beef on top of the trimmings and coat the beef well with more of the seasoning mix. Drizzle olive oil on top of the roast and pat the oil over the seasonings. Put the pan into the preheated oven on the lowest rack and roast approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours, uncovered, until the internal temperature registers <em>130 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.

With a sharp knife, cut each chicken breast lengthwise into 12 long, thin strips. Thread 1 strip onto each of the skewers, weaving the skewer back and forth along the length of each chicken strip. Arrange them on a large platter or baking tray. To prepare the marinade, in a small bowl combine the curry powder, pepper, salt and cumin. Spoon the oil over the chicken strips, turning to coat them evenly, and then evenly sprinkle the dry ingredients over them on both sides. Cover the platter or tray with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour or longer. To prepare the mint-soy vinaigrette, in a food processor fitted with the steel blade or a blender, combine the egg yolks, vinegar, mint, soy sauce and coriander. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the oil and continue processing until smooth. Transfer the dressing to a bowl, season to taste with salt and pepper, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. Preheat a hinged indoor grill or panini maker, according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions, or preheat a broiler, outdoor grill, or stovetop grill pan. Grill the skewers, in batches if necessary, until cooked through and nicely browned, about 2 minutes total on a hinged grill or panini maker or 2 minutes per side in the broiler, in a grill pan, or on an outdoor grill. If using an indoor grill, take care that the skewers don&#39;t prevent the grill or panini maker from closing properly. Serve the skewers immediately, passing the vinaigrette for guests to drizzle over their own skewers or to use as a dip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 26240,&quot;Pasta alla Formiana Butter, for greasing dish 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 clove garlic, coarsely chopped 1/2 pound (8 ounces) mezze penne or other small pasta 1/3 cup olive oil, plus extra for drizzling 1/4 cup dried oregano 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 to 5 very ripe, extra-large or beefsteak tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices Instructions: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven.

Filling: In a small saucepan, add the potato and enough cold water to cover. Add a generous pinch of salt and bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. In a second small saucepan, bring 4 cups water to a simmer and add a generous pinch of salt, bay leaves, 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, peppercorns, chili flakes, and chicken breast. Simmer until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Mash the potato and finely shred the chicken and put into a large bowl. Combine with mango, lime juice, chipotle sauce, remaining coriander seeds, cumin, cilantro, and salt and pepper, to taste. Mixing with a spoon or your hands, until well incorporated. Taste for seasoning and adjust, if necessary. Set aside. Samosas: Roll the puff pastry out slightly, to flatten the seams. Using a paring knife to trace a 7-inch ring mold or bowl, cut the dough into 8 (7-inch wide) rounds. Cut each into 2 semicircles. Put a tablespoon or so of the filling in the center of a semicircle. Have a small bowl of water handy. Dip your finger in the water and run it along the edges of the semicircle. Arrange the samosas so the flat side is facing away from you. Grab the left corner and fold it over the dough in a triangular motion, so that this corner lands on the bottom right side of the filling. Do the same with the other corner. Squeeze bottom shut, and fold over, sealing with water. If you like, seal using a fork. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Arrange the 8 samosas on a lightly greased baking sheet. In a small bowl, whisk the egg and 1 teaspoon water with a fork until thoroughly combined. Brush the tops of the samosas with the egg wash. Bake for 15 minutes at 425 degrees F, then turn heat down to 375 degrees F and bake for 10 more minutes. You can flip them over just before you turn the heat down, if you like. Chutney: In a food processor, whiz together the mint, cilantro, ginger, lime juice and water until it all comes together as a sauce. There&#39;ll probably still be little bits of leaf in the sauce, but I like how those taste, so no worries. Pour the chutney into a bowl. In a small pan, over medium heat, warm the oil until it shimmers. Add mustard seeds; they should sizzle. Immediately cover with a lid until they stop spluttering. Make sure they don&#39;t burn! If they do, start over. No big deal. I do it all the time! Immediately add the seeds and oil to the chutney. It will sizzle so stand back. Once you&#39;ve poured in all of the oil, you can even spoon a little chutney into the pan (cue sizzling again!) so that you pick up all that lovely oil. Pour into the bowl with the chutney. Serve samosas hot, with the chutney... and bask in gratitude for the great ideas we all come up with, for our sensitive taste buds and for the blessing of good friends! In large bowl, combine the flour, buttermilk, oil, salt and ajwain seeds. Bring the ingredients together until a dough forms. Knead until it has softened a bit, about 5 minutes. Allow to rest, at room temperature, for 15 minutes. You can put this in the refrigerator, but make sure you let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes or so, in order for it to soften. Roll the dough into a short cylinder. Slice in half, then slice each half into 2 pieces, so you have 4 bits. Roll each bit into a ball. Flatten the balls into discs then, on a floured surface, roll them into a 1/8-inch thick, 7-inch wide circles. Cut in half to form 2 semicircles. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 26243,&quot;Fried Chicken, Korean Style with Napa Cabbage Slaw 1 cup Greek yogurt 1/2 cup buttermilk<br> Hot sauce, optional<br> 1 chicken, broken down into 8 pieces, skin on and bone in<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 3/4 cup cornstarch<br> 2 teaspoons granulated garlic powder<br> 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon celery salt<br> 1 teaspoon celery seeds<br> 2 serrano chiles, finely diced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 green onions, coarsely chopped<br> 1 small head Napa cabbage, finely shredded<br> 1 large carrot, julienned<br> Instructions: For the chicken: Mix the Greek yogurt, buttermilk and hot sauce if using together in a large bowl. Add the chicken and allow the chicken to submerge thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to overnight. To make the dredge, add the flour, cornstarch, granulated garlic, onion powder, cayenne and some kosher salt and black pepper to a large bowl and mix together. Using tongs, remove the chicken from the buttermilk, shaking off any excess, and dredge in the flour mixture. Coat the chicken evenly and shake to remove any excess. Then, dip back in the buttermilk and then the flour mixture to coat a second time. Allow to sit on a baking sheet lined with a wire rack. If not frying immediately, keep in the fridge up to 2 hours. Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast-iron skillet; the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces. For the Napa cabbage slaw: Meanwhile, whisk together the mayo, vinegar, sugar, celery salt and seeds, serrano and kosher salt and black pepper to taste in a large bowl. Add the green onions, cabbage and carrots and stir until combined.

Place the beef roast on a clean work surface and rub with the olive oil and chopped rosemary. Place into the preheated oven and cook for 15 minutes and then turn the heat down to 350 degrees F. Cook for about 15 minutes per pound for rare meat, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest, covered, for about 15 minutes before slicing. To make the Yorkshire Pudding, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Mix the milk, eggs, and salt, and add pepper, beating all well together. I use my freestanding mixer but a hand-held electric mixer, rotary, or balloon whisk would do. Let these ingredient stand for 15 minutes and then whisk in the flour. Meanwhile, add the drippings a large heat-proof pan and put it in the oven to heat for about 10 minutes. Into this intensely hot pan you should pour in the batter and cook for 20 minutes, or until well puffed and golden. Bring it, triumphant, to the table. To make the grilled eggplant, place the garlic-oil into a shallow dish and set aside. On a clean work surface, slice the eggplant into long, thin slices and then place into the garlic-oil, turning to coat. Preheat a griddle or stove top grill pan and then place each eggplant slice onto the grill. Cook about 2 to 3 minutes and then turn, and cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the grilled slices to a platter and drizzle with more of the garlic-oil. Garnish with coarse salt, cracked black pepper, lemon juice and snipped chives. To make the pea, mint and avocado salad, first make the dressing: put the oil, vinegar, and sugar into a large bowl and then put in a decent handful of the chopped mint. Stir well so all is amalgamated. Cook the peas for 2 minutes or so in salted boiling water, just so that they&#39;re ready, but not soft. Taste after 2 minutes and keep tasting. Drain the peas in a colander, put them straightaway into the bowl of dressing, and let steep for 1 hour or up to a day. Just before serving, stir in the mixed greens, the endive, and the avocado. You may need to drizzle a bit more oil after tossing. Serve this on a big plate. Sprinkle with some more of the chopped mint. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 26245,&quot;Steel-Cut Oats 2 cups steel-cut oats 1 teaspoon salt 2 1/2 cups boiling water 1 cup milk, warmed Toasted pecans, for topping, optional Golden raisins, for topping, optional Pinch light brown sugar, for topping, optional Instructions: Combine the oats and salt in a pot and stir to combine.
