Line two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment and lightly coat with cooking spray. Spread the walnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until light brown and fragrant, about 7 minutes. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, apple pie spice and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. Whisk together the granulated sugar and eggs in a large bowl until smooth, about 1 minute. Whisk in the oil until well combined. Add the grated carrots, vanilla and walnuts and mix well. Add the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.

In a large bowl with a hand-held mixer, cream the butter until fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, add the coconut sugar and continue beating until light, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl again if needed, then add the egg mixture, beating for about 1 minute. Sift the flour with the salt in a small bowl. Reduce the mixer speed to low, then add the flour mixture, mixing just until blended. Turn the dough out of the bowl. Divide the dough in half and place each half between 2 pieces of lightly floured parchment or waxed paper. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a disk about 1/4 inch thick. Slide the dough/parchment sheet onto a flat baking sheet or on the back of a rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours and up to overnight. Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment (or use nonstick baking sheets). Place 1 disk of the cookie dough on a clean work surface and peel off the top sheet of paper. Cut the cookies with a 1 1/2-inch round or decorative-shaped cookie cutter directly on the parchment. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Repeat with the other sheet of dough. Any excess dough can be re-rolled, refrigerated and cut. Bake until the edges of the cookies are light golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a rack to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63741,&quot;Baked Goat Cheese with Pop-Tartsandreg; Crumble 2 packages Unfrosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tarts 4 tablespoons butter, chilled Zest from 1 orange 1 (8-ounce) log goat cheese Dried cherries, for garnish Instructions: Set the oven to broil.

Transfer 1 dough to each prepared baking sheet.<br> Spoon the Marinara Sauce over the dough, dividing equaling and leaving a 1-inch border around each pizza. Sprinkle the cheeses over the sauce. Arrange the pineapple pieces in a single layer over the cheeses. Sprinkle with the ham. Bake the pizzas until the crusts are crisp and brown on the bottom and the cheese is melted on top, about 12 minutes. Cut the pizza into wedges and serve immediately. Mix the warm water and yeast in a small bowl to blend. Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a food processor to blend. Blend in the oil. With the machine running, add the yeast mixture and blend just until the dough forms. Turn the dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm draft-free area until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour. Punch the down dough and divide into 2 equal balls. In a large casserole pot, heat the oil over a medium-high flame. Add the onions and garlic and saute until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the celery, carrots, and 1/2 teaspoon of each salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and bay leaves, and simmer uncovered over low heat until the sauce thickens, about 1 hour. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Season the sauce with more salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 63763,&quot;Halloween Chocolate-Covered Strawberries 6 ounces dark-green candy melting wafers 1 to 2 teaspoons coconut oil or vegetable shortening, if needed<br> 1/2 cup dark-green sanding sugar, plus more as needed<br> 12 large strawberries with green tops, rinsed and dried well<br> 24 small candy eyeballs<br> 1 ounce chocolate chips, optional<br> 6 ounces white candy melting wafers 1 to 2 teaspoons coconut oil or vegetable shortening, if needed<br> 12 large strawberries with green tops, rinsed and dried well<br> 1 ounce black candy melting wafers or chocolate chips 6 ounces orange candy melting wafers 1 to 2 teaspoons coconut oil or vegetable shortening, if needed<br> 12 large strawberries with green tops, rinsed and dried well<br> 1 ounce chocolate chips Instructions: For the monsters: Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.

Combine the grape tomatoes, green tomato, red onion, garlic, bacon fat, olive oil, thyme, bay leaves, rosemary, sage and a pinch each of salt, pepper and sugar in a small casserole dish. Cover the casserole with foil and place it in the center oven rack. Let cook for at least 2 hours. Carefully remove the foil and inspect the confit: The grape tomatoes should be wilted, but not popped, and the red onions should be nice and brightly translucent. Discard the herb sprigs and bay leaves and keep the confit covered near the stove until ready to plate. For the shrimp: Heat an 11-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and keep dry. Warm the butter in the pan. In batches, sear the shrimp on both sides for 2 minutes in butter. Transfer the shrimp to a plate and keep warm. Reserve the pan and drippings for the spinach. For the grits: Combine the cream, chicken broth, corn stock, butter, thyme and garlic in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until boiling. Season the liquid lightly with salt. Slowly stir the grits into the liquid. Once all the grits are incorporated, turn the heat down to low and cook, stirring every minute or so, until cooked, about 10 minutes. You will know the grits are done when there&#39;s still a little texture, but the grains don&#39;t stick to your teeth. Finish with some cracked black pepper and cover until plating. If the grits become thick after standing, adding warm chicken stock will help to thin them. For the shrimp creamed spinach: Heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 2 cups of the reserved shrimp shells and sear until the shells are bright and release a nice shellfish aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Vidalia onion, bay leaf and 1 tablespoon of the garlic and cook an additional 2 minutes. Reduce the heat, add the cream and simmer until thickened and reduced slightly, 10 to 12 minutes. Strain through a mesh strainer and reserve. Bring a medium pot half full of salted water to a boil. In the meantime, place a large bowl of ice water nearby. When the water is boiling, add the spinach and blanch for about 30 seconds. Use tongs and carefully remove the spinach to the ice water. Drain with a colander and set aside to let dry for a few minutes. In the same pan used to sear the shrimp, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the spinach and cook until just beginning to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon garlic and the shrimp cream and cook until the cream thickens. For the bacon gastrique: Cook the bacon in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat until almost crispy, about 10 minutes. Add the onion and garlic and sweat lightly over medium heat until translucent. Add the brown sugar, Marsala, sherry wine and vinegar and cook until reduced, about 15 minutes, then taste. The gastrique should be rather on the thin side--chunky and sweet with a nice acidity and dark in color. Cover and keep warm until ready to plate. To serve: Scoop about 1 cup grits each in the center of 4 entree bowls. Divide the cream spinach among the bowls, placing it in the middle, standing tall on the grits. Arrange 6 to 8 shrimp around the spinach in each bowl. Next, spoon the warm confit tomato on top of the cream spinach. Finish with a spoon of the smoked bacon gastrique around the edge of the bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 63773,&quot;Peachy Breakfast Mug Cake 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 1/4 cup frozen peaches, thawed<br> 2 tablespoon peach preserves<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon butter, softened 1 tablespoon vanilla yogurt<br> 1/2 teaspoon honey<br> Instructions: Add the oats, milk, peaches, preserves, baking soda, salt and cinnamon to a blender.

Carefully scoop out the yolks into a medium bowl and place the whites on a plate. Add the mayonnaise, relish and Sriracha to the bowl with the yolks; season with salt and pepper and mix and mash until smooth (or use a food processor to speed up this process). Stir in about three-quarters of the fried ham. Transfer the yolk mixture to a piping bag and pipe into the egg whites. Top with the roasted red peppers and the remaining fried ham. Garnish with microgreens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 63780,&quot;Cannoli 1 1/2 cups flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch kosher salt 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pea-size pieces 1 egg, separated 1/4 cup marsala 1/4 cup cold water 5 cups peanut or other neutrally flavored oil, for frying 2 pounds ricotta 2 cups powdered sugar, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups mini chocolate chips, plus more for sprinkling Instructions: For the shells: In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon, and pinch of salt. Add in the butter and egg yolk. Pulse until the mixture looks like grated cheese. Add in the marsala and pulse. Add a few drops of water and pulse. Continue to do this until the mixture comes together in a ball. You may not need to add all of the water. Dump the mixture out onto a clean work surface. Work the mixture gently into a ball and squish into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap until ready to use. Place the oil in a large, wide pot and bring to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Set a cooling rack over a sheet pan. To roll the dough out by hand, dust a work surface lightly with flour. Cut the dough in half; start with half the dough and keep the other half covered until ready to use. Roll each half out to 1/8-inch thick. If using a pasta roller, set the pasta roller on the widest setting (number 1). Use your hands to flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller twice, dusting it with flour in between rolls if it feels sticky, and then fold in half. (When rolling out pasta dough, always hold the pasta on the tops of your hands with your palms down. If you hold it fingers up you will create stretch marks). Move the roller to the next setting (number 2) and run the dough through. Continue to run the dough through the machine, reducing the opening (or moving the setting to the next largest number) in between every roll. Stop when you get to the correct thinness, this will be around number 5 on the dial, but every machine is different and you will have to be the judge of your own thickness. Using a pastry wheel, cut the dough into 3-inch squares. Keep the squares covered until they are ready to be fried. Repeat this process with the other half of the dough. Beat the egg white with 2 tablespoons of water. Wrap the first batch of dough squares around metal cannoli tubes so that the points of the square overlap to close. Brush the overlapping points with the beaten egg white to seal shut and press to secure. Fry the dough shells in the heated oil until they are brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Use tongs to remove the shells from the oil and drain on the cooling rack. When the shells and tubes have cooled enough to handle, gently slide the metal tubes out of the shells. Repeat the process with the remaining dough squares. For the filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the ricotta, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Mix together until smooth and creamy. Stir in the chocolate chips and taste to make sure it is delicious. Place in a pastry bag with a large enough tip to allow the chocolate chips to pass through. To assemble: Pipe the filling into the shells and sprinkle each end with a few more chocolate chips. Dust with powdered sugar. Do not fill them until you plan to serve them or the shells will get soggy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 63781,&quot;Steak Fresca Taco 1 jar hot sauce, such as Try Me Tiger 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> Pinch red pepper flakes<br> 1 1/2 pounds skirt steak 1/2 cup arugula 1/2 cup thinly sliced radicchio<br> 1 clove garlic, crushed<br> Juice of 2 limes<br> 2 to 3 teaspoons crema<br> Salt and pepper 1 ear corn, grilled and kernels removed Seeds from 1 pomegranate<br> 2 jalapenos, seeded and diced<br> 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves<br> Juice of 3 limes 2 cloves garlic, crushed<br> Salt and pepper<br> Corn tortillas Chopped fresh cilantro<br> Crumbled cotija cheese Lime wedges<br> Shaved radishes<br> Instructions: For the skirt steak: Combine the hot sauce, brown sugar and red pepper flakes in a bowl.

Put 2 parts black melting chocolate disks to 1 part white in a double boiler and stir to melt completely. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly before dipping the pops. Dip the end of a lollipop stick into the melted chocolate and insert into the center of a cookie ball. Repeat with the remaining sticks and cookie balls. Place back into the freezer for 15 minutes. Use the wide end of a pastry tip to cut a crescent moon shape from 24 blue melting chocolate disks. Attach it with the curve up on the front of the cookie pop with a dot of melted chocolate to form the trunk. Attach the marshmallows to the bottom of the pop for feet. Put back into the freezer for 10 minutes to set. Dip the entire pop into the melted chocolate to cover and coat. Let the excess drip over a bowl. Stick each pop into a floral foam to hold while you dip the remaining cookie pops. Place into the refrigerator if needed to set the chocolate. Attach blue candy melt disks to the sides of the pop for ears and use confetti sprinkles for eyes. Dot each eye in the center with an edible marker to make a pupil. Add a mouth and nose with the edible marker.

Simmer the cream mixture over medium heat, whisking, until it thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Set aside. Cook the pasta: In a large pot, bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and season with 1/2 cup salt. The pasta water should taste like seawater. Add the orecchiette to the boiling water and stir with a slotted spoon to make sure it does not clump or stick to the bottom as it cooks. Cook until the pasta is al dente (chewy but not hard or raw tasting), 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the pasta in a large colander, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water in case you need it to adjust the sauce. Finish the dish: Reheat the pasta sauce over medium heat until it simmers gently. Add the pasta to the skillet and toss to coat in the sauce. Remove the skillet from the heat and allow the pasta to rest for 2 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Stir in the bacon, some of the reserved bacon fat, an additional splash of lemon juice, chives and pasta water (if needed) to make a sauce that lightly coats the pasta.

Scrub the artichokes clean under running water. Using sharp scissors, cut 1/2 inch off the top of each leaf, and with a very sharp knife slice about 1-inch off the top of the artichoke. To a large kettle of boiling salted water, add 2 or 3 whole garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook the artichokes, covered, for 45 to 55 minutes, or until tender. Remove them carefully with tongs or a big slotted spoon, and place them upside-down on a rack to drain as they cool. To make the filling, cut the tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice and chop the remaining garlic. Mix the tomatoes and garlic with the chopped herbs, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, and a touch of vinegar or lemon juice if you want it. Stir in most of the bread crumbs, check the consistency, then stir in more as needed to make a fairly thick mixture. Finally, add the Parmesan. When the artichokes are cool enough to handle turn them right side up and gently pull open the leaves from the center of each one. Pull out the thin leaves from the very center and then scrape out the fibrous choke with a teaspoon. Spoon some of the filling into the center cavity of each artichoke, then spoon a bit more here and there between the leaves. Distribute it evenly between the 6 artichokes, using about 2/3 cup for each. A little bit more olive oil can be drizzled over the artichokes just before serving.

Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Place the ribs on the sheet pan meat-side up and sprinkle them with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Pour the barbecue sauce generously on each rack and cover the ribs loosely with aluminum foil. Bake for 1 1/2 hours for baby backs and 1 3/4 hours for St. Louis ribs, until the meat is very tender when tested with a fork. As soon as the ribs are out of the oven, spread them generously with additional barbecue sauce. Grill right away or refrigerate to grill later. About 40 minutes before you want to serve, heat a charcoal grill with a layer of hot coals or heat a gas grill to medium-high heat. After the charcoal turns gray, brush the cooking grate with oil to keep the ribs from sticking. Place the ribs on the grill ribs-side down, put the lid on top (be sure both vents are open!) and grill for 5 minutes. Turn the ribs meat-side down, put the lid back on and grill for another 4 to 5 minutes, until nicely browned. Place on a cutting board and cover tightly with aluminum foil and allow the ribs to rest for 10 minutes. Cut into ribs and serve hot with extra barbecue sauce on the side. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over low heat, add the onions and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until the onions are translucent but not browned. Add the garlic and cook for one more minute.

Set aside. In a non-reactive saucepan combine the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 1/2 cups of the cream, and the salt. Heat the cream mixture over medium-high heat until just boiling. Remove from the heat; whisk the eggs constantly while gradually pouring the hot liquid into the yolks. Return the egg mixture to the saucepan. Cook the mixture while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon in a figure 8 motion, over medium-low heat, until thickened, about 5 minutes. When the ice cream mixture is properly cooked it coats the back of the spoon, is satiny thick, and free of any bubbles on the surface. (The ice cream base will taste slightly egg-y.) When the mixture is thickened pull it from the heat; add the reserved 1/2 cup cream, and strain it through a fine strainer into a medium bowl. Set the bowl of ice cream base in a bowl of ice and whisk until cool. Add the strawberry puree. Freeze the strawberry mixture in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. (Take care not to over churn the ice cream or it can have a grainy texture.) Place the ice cream in the freezer to set up for at least 1 hour. Serve. Put the strawberries and the honey in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer; cook, stir frequently, until the berries breakdown and get juicy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Add the lime juice. Taste and adjust the sweetness or tartness of the puree with more honey or lime if needed. Use now, or refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for 1 month.

For a smoky flavor that will add depth to the finished dish, grill the eggplants on a very hot, oiled grill pan (or barbecue) until the skins are wrinkled and black, and the eggplants shriveled and soft; turning often. (If you prefer, roast the eggplants in a preheated 400 degree F oven for 30 minutes.) When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, split them open and scoop out the flesh, discarding the skin and as many seeds as possible. In a food processor, combine the garlic, tahini, lemon juice and parsley; puree until smooth. Add the eggplant flesh; season with cumin, salt, and pepper; pulse several times to make a thick, coarse puree. Pour in the oil and pulse again to incorporate. Taste and adjust seasoning, as needed. Pour into a serving bowl and garnish with chopped pistachios. Serve with pita wedges for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache Blanc, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 63808,&quot;French Onion Chicken Noodle Casserole 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 3 large yellow onions, thinly sliced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves 6 ounces wide egg noodles 1/2 cup sour cream<br> One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature, cut into chunks 1 cup grated Gruyere cheese<br> 2 cups shredded skinless rotisserie chicken 1 cup crispy fried onions, such as French&#39;s 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Soooooooooooo...if you didn&#39;t think yesterday to soak your beans you can do the \quick soak\ method, which is to put your beans in a pot covered by at least 2 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil, turn the heat off and let the pot sit until the water cools down naturally and then pick up the process as if you had soaked the beans overnight. Strain the beans from the soaking water. Put the beans in a large pot and cover generously with water. Add the onions, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, bay leaves and bacon skin. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer the beans until all the beans are soft, about 1 hour. Add more water if it reduces too much. Test the beans for doneness by doing the 5 bean test. Bite 5 beans, if they are all soft then they are done. Beans do NOT all cook at the same rate so the 5 bean test is important. When the beans are cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Season the water generously with salt and let sit for 15 minutes. Transfer the beans to a serving bowl and serve.

The paper cone was 3 1/2 inches tall with a 2 1/2-inch diameter opening. You can use any mold that you like. If you use the paper cones, place them point side down inside small glasses to make it easy to fill them. Use a serrated knife to slice the pound cake into 1/2-inch thick layers. Use a round cutter to cut cake rounds the same diameter as the cone mold. Pour the heavy cream into a medium-size mixing bowl and whip to soft peaks with an electric mixer set on medium speed. At this stage, the whipped cream has the most volume. If you overwhip the cream, you will lose volume and the mousse will not be as light and airy as it should be. If you are using fruit flavored alcohol, fold it in with a rubber spatula, being careful not to deflate the cream. Carefully pour the warm melted chocolate into the mixture. If the chocolate is too warm, it will melt the whipped cream. If it is too cool, the chocolate will seize (harden) upon contact with the cooler mixture and you will have pieces of chocolate in your mousse. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold in the chocolate until completely incorporated. The chocolate mousse should be the same color throughout, with no streaks. Place the chocolate mousse in a large pastry bag (no tip). Drop a few cherries into the tip of each paper cone. Pipe the chocolate mousse into the cone so that it is about 1/4-inch from the top. Close each cone with 1 cake round, gently pressing the cake round into the mousse. Invert the cone and place it on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Place the desserts in the freezer for 2 hours. To make the chocolate decorations: Use a small offset spatula to spread some tempered chocolate on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Keep the thickness of the chocolate as even as possible, about 1/8-inch thick. Use a sharp paring knife to cut some long triangles of chocolate that are about 15 inches long with a 1 1/2-inch base. Cut 1 triangle for each dessert you are making. When the chocolate has set slightly, place it inside a large round tube or bucket. I made my tube of aluminum flashing that I taped into a 15-inch diameter. Place the chocolate triangles inside the tube and let the chocolate set. When set, remove the acetate from the tube. Peel off the parchment paper and break apart the curved triangles. This piece forms the moon for each dessert. Make the chocolate sauce cups: Use a spoon to fill a round measuring tablespoon with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the spoon should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the spoon clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the spoon. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the spoon in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat to make 1 sauce cup for each dessert. Make a chocolate tube: Roll a piece of parchment paper into a tube that has a 2-inch diameter. Fill the tube with chocolate. Then invert it and let the excess chocolate flow back into the bowl. Spin the tube while inverted to ensure the inside is completely and evenly covered. Allow this to set until firm. Remove the parchment paper. Use a hot serrated knife to slice the tube into 1 1/2-inch wide slices. Cut 1 slice for each dessert. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \cut\ through the chocolate by melting it. Assemble the chocolate decoration: Dip the side of the tube piece in tempered chocolate and place the tube on a glass plate. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the moon to the top of the tube piece. Use more chocolate to adhere the chocolate sauce cup to the top of the moon. To unmold the dessert: Fill a bowl with very hot water. Dip the outside of the frozen dessert in the hot water for about 2 seconds. Be careful not to allow the water to seep into the opening. Invert the dessert and gently pinch the tip. The frozen dessert should release from the mold. To spray the dessert: Place a mixture of 50 percent cocoa butter and 50 percent chocolate in a saucepan. Heat it until warm. Make sure there are no lumps. Transfer this mixture to the container of the paint sprayer. Spray the dessert with this mixture to give it texture, color and contrast. Use an offset spatula to move the frozen dessert to the base of the chocolate moon. Fill a squeeze bottle with raspberry sauce and fill the chocolate sauce cup.

Top with a piece of tempeh, some grated carrot and some sauerkraut, then top with another slice of cheese each. Top with the remaining slices of bread. Heat the iron griddle or skillet over medium heat. Cook the sandwiches about 2 minutes per side. (I like to use a metal mixing bowl to dome the sandwiches so the cheese melts.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 63822,&quot;Mexican Mini-Pizzas 1 pound ball store-bought pizza dough Olive oil, for brushing pans 4 tomatoes, thinly sliced 12 ounces Mexican chorizo, casing removed, cooked and crumbled 1 /2 to 2 cups shredded mozzarella or Monterrey Jack cheese 1 teaspoon dried oregano Instructions: Cook the chorizo in a medium-size skillet over medium heat.

Whisk together to incorporate. Slice the block of tempeh as desired (such as into cubes, triangles or thin pieces). Arrange on a microwave-safe plate with 1/4 cup of water. Cover with a wet paper towel and microwave on high until the tempeh is soft and has absorbed some of the liquid, about 4 minutes. Drain off any excess water. Arrange the warm tempeh pieces in a single layer in the marinade. Tilt the pan a few times to make sure the marinade is evenly distributed. Marinate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, flipping the pieces and tilting the pan every 10 minutes, or cover the pan with plastic and refrigerate overnight. When the tempeh is ready, remove from the pan, reserving the marinade for brushing and dipping, and cook on the grill or in the oven or air fryer as follows: For the grill: Preheat a grill or grill pan for medium heat. Grill the tempeh pieces, brushing with the reserved marinade, until nicely charred, about 5 minutes per side. For the oven: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment and top with the tempeh pieces, spacing them 1/2 inch apart. Bake, brushing with the reserved marinade and flipping halfway through, until slightly charred, about 20 minutes. For the air fryer: Line the basket of a 6-quart air fryer with foil or parchment. Working in batches, arrange the tempeh pieces in a single layer, spacing them slightly apart, and cook at 375 degrees F until nicely charred, about 10 minutes. Remove and immediately brush the pieces with the reserved marinade. Serve immediately or store for meal prep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 63824,&quot;Skillet Chicken and Artichokes 4 6-to-8-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breasts Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 9-ounce package frozen artichoke hearts, thawed and patted dry (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 small red onion, cut into wedges 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 teaspoon dried oregano 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese 1/4 cup sliced Peppadew peppers, plus 2 teaspoons brine from the jar (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Place the chicken breasts between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound with a skillet until about 1/2 inch thick.

Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour. Roll the dough out into a 10-inch circle; to check the size, put the 9-inch pie pan upside down over the dough. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside the pie pan. Press the dough firmly into the bottom and sides so it fits tightly. Trim the excess dough around the rim. Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it can prevent spills from burning in the bottom of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the filling: In medium-size mixing bowl, combine the molasses and water; stir in baking soda, eggs, and spices. To make the crumb topping: With a pastry blender, mix together the flour, brown sugar, and butter, until it is the texture of coarse crumbs. Take 1/2 cup of the crumb mixture and put it in the bottom of the pie shell, pour in the molasses filling, and scatter the remaining crumbs on top. Bake for 30 minutes, until the filling jiggles slightly and the top is firm. Let cool to room temperature before cutting.

Add the butter and pulse until it resembles coarse sand with some pea-size pieces of butter, about 20 pulses. Add the cream cheese and sour cream and pulse until it comes together in a rough dough, with some uneven pebble-size pieces. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and divide into four equal portions. Pat each portion into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze for 15 minutes. For the filling: Meanwhile, chop the hazelnuts in a clean food processor. Add the preserves, raisins and salt and puree to make a very smooth paste. Roll a portion of dough into a 6- by 14-inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. (Don&#39;t worry about slightly rough edges; these will be rolled inside of the rugelach.) Spread one-quarter of the filling over the surface with a small spatula. Starting with a long side, roll the dough up into a tight cylinder, ending with the seam on the bottom. Press the top slightly to flatten and wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze for another 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. (The cylinders can be frozen for up to a month.) Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and evenly position the racks. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

Whisk the sugar, cinnamon and salt together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg white and water together until frothy. Toss the pecans in the egg white mixture, then add the sugar mixture and toss until the pecans are evenly coated. Spread the coated pecans on a baking sheet. Bake, stirring every 15 minutes, until the pecans are evenly browned, 1 hour. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut two 8-inch parchment circles and use to line the bottoms of two 8-inch cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the four, white sugar, black and Dutch-process cocoa powders, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the buttermilk, brown sugar, oil, vanilla and eggs; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Whisk in the hot coffee until completely incorporated--the batter will be quite thin. Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes, then slide an offset spatula around the edge of the pans and flip out the cakes. Cool on a rack for another 30 minutes. For the buttercream: Combine the egg whites and powdered sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed for 5 minutes. (This helps dissolve all the sugar and prevents that grainy texture you often get with American buttercreams.) You will now have what looks like a really runny royal icing. Make sure your butter is soft. Set the mixer to medium and gradually add the butter, scraping down the bowl occasionally. Add the vanilla extract. Beat for 10 minutes on medium. Swirl in the butterscotch caramel. For the ganache: Heat the cream in a microwave just until boiling, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the cream over the chocolate and allow to sit for 1 minute. Stir until the ganache is silky smooth--it look a bit curdled at first but will eventually come together. Leave the ganache on the counter to cool until it has reached the consistency of peanut butter. At this point it is ready to be used to frost the outside of the cake. (Makes 2 cups.) To assemble the cake: Remove the parchment paper from the bottoms of cakes. Split the cakes in half horizontally with a serrated knife (to make four layers). Place one layer on a serving platter. Spread a generous 3/4 cup buttercream over the layer to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Sprinkle 3 to 4 tablespoons candied pecans over the buttercream. Place a second cake layer over the first and repeat witht the buttercream and pecans. Continue with a third layer. Top the cake with the final layer and gently frost the outside with ganache. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 63835,&quot;Chocolate-Covered Peanut Butter-Stuffed Dates 22 to 24 pitted Medjool dates, about 12 ounces 1/3 cup crunchy peanut butter 1/4 cup roasted salted peanuts, roughly chopped 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 tablespoon coconut oil 1 teaspoon flaky sea salt 8 soft caramel candies, about 1.5 ounces Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. If the dates do not already have slits in them, cut a slit lengthwise along each date, making sure not to cut all the way through (it should look like a little canoe). Stir together the peanut butter and peanuts in a medium bowl until combined. Stuff about 1 teaspoon into each date and set aside. Combine the chocolate and coconut oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave until melted, stirring once halfway through, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Dip 1 date into the chocolate and turn it a few times with a fork until completely coated. Use the fork to remove the date to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dates and chocolate, working with 1 date at a time. Sprinkle the tops of the dates with the flaky sea salt. Refrigerate until the chocolate has hardened, about 30 minutes. Microwave the caramels in a small microwave-safe bowl in 30 second increments, stirring in between each, until the caramel can be drizzled, about 1 minute. Drizzle the caramel over the dates and refrigerate until set, about 10 minutes.

Transfer the design to foam board and cut out the pieces. It is helpful to construct a 3-D version of your centerpiece before you make it from chocolate. You can make any design and any size you like. My centerpiece design included a large moon with a flame and other flame pieces. Then I made a total of 4 thin single flames and 4 thick double flame pieces. The tallest flames I made were about 28 inches long with 3 progressively shorter flames. Trace the foam board design onto the rubber mat and cut out the moon design to make the template. Repeat to make the flame designs. Make the moon design and the flames in dark chocolate: Place the rubber mat moon design cut out on a parchment paper lined surface. Use a ladle to fill the cut out with chocolate. Allow the chocolate to set. When the chocolate has set, peel away the mat. Repeat to make other flame pieces. Make a base: Use flexible aluminum strips or cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 10 inches in diameter. Place it on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring to form a 3/8-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. Make the chocolate plate: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a 10-inch sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to trace around an 8-inch cake circle. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Make the white chocolate moon design and the thin flames: Use the templates for the moon and flames as a guide and draw slightly thinner versions of these things onto acetate. Cut out the acetate pieces. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate over the acetate pieces. When the chocolate has set, remove acetate from the chocolate piece and place each one on top of its existing dark version. Use tempered chocolate to glue each 1 into place. Use an airbursh to paint the white chocolate pieces red. Make the chocolate flowers: Each flower consists of about 13 or more petals. Some petals are about 3-inches long while others are about 4 inches long. I used a lot of flower petals so I made my own petal templates. To do this, I drew the shape of the petal at 1 end of a piece of plastic (like plastic from the side of a bucket) that was about 10 inches long and 5 inches wide. Repeat to draw as many petals as will fit on the plastic. Use an X-acto knife to cut out the petals. Repeat to make another template for the 3-inch petals. Place the template on a piece of parchment paper. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over the template. Let the chocolate set slightly. Lift the template from the chocolate. Place the parchment paper over a rolling pin to give the petals a slight curve. You will need petals of varying degrees of curves. Make as many petals as you will need to make as many flowers as your design requires. Assemble the flowers: I used a plastic dome mold to give my flowers their final shape. You could also use a small glass bowl. Place a small dollop of white chocolate in the bottom of the mold. Add petals resting the ends in the chocolate and the tops along the side of the bowl. Add another layer. Continue this process to make as big of a flower as you like. I used the petals with the sharpest curve for the inside layer. When the chocolate has set, pop the finished flower out of the mold. Use an airbrush to paint the flower. Assemble the centerpiece: Use tempered chocolate to adhere the moon design to the base. Use more chocolate to adhere the flames to the base. I glued 1 flame slightly behind the moon design piece and the other slightly in front of the piece. Use more tempered chocolate to glue the flower to the base at the front. Determine the points at which the chocolate plate will rest inside the base of the moon design. Use a hot paring knife to create a 90-degree indentation on the inside of the moon. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \cut\ through the chocolate by melting it. Create the same type of indentation on the plate where it will rest near the tip of the moon. Balance the plate into the spot you have created using the tempered chocolate to glue it into place. If you are using this as a dessert display, place any dessert that you have on the chocolate plate.

Remove the meat to a rimmed baking sheet fitted with a baking rack. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part reads 125 degrees F, 35 to 50 minutes. Allow the meat to rest for 15 minutes before slicing. For the peperonata: Meanwhile, place the skillet that you seared the meat in over medium heat. Add the garlic and anchovy paste and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, to bring out the flavors, for 1 minute. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes. Add the peppers and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized and the peppers are soft and beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the olives, vinegar, capers and oregano. Remove from the heat. Spoon the peperonata onto a platter. Slice the tenderloin and shingle it around the platter. Sprinkle the meat with the coarse salt if using and drizzle with any juices. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 63840,&quot;Hazelnut Ice Cream Sundae 1 cup milk 1 pint hazelnut gelato 4 biscotti 1 to 2 tablespoons cocoa powder Instructions: Warm the milk for about 30 to 40 seconds in the microwave.

Place the tomatoes in a large mixing bowl and crush by hand to break down into small pieces, or pulse in a food processor until the tomatoes puree into a chunky sauce. Be careful not to over mix. (This will make more sauce than needed for one pizza.) Spread approximately 1/2 cup of sauce on the pizza crust and evenly sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt. Drizzle with the heavy cream and olive oil. Top with whole fresh basil leaves. Bake until the crust is golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, slice into 6 pieces, top with shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve. Combine the flour and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook. Add 1 3/4 cups of the water (reserving 1/4 cup to add if necessary) and mix on low speed for 1 minute. Add the salt and continue to mix for another 3 minutes, adding reserved water if the dough seems dry. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, then mix again on medium-low speed until the dough no longer sticks to the side of the bowl, about 2 minutes. The dough should still be tacky to the touch, but not too wet and sticky that it does not hold its shape. If the dough is still too dry, slowly add water 1 tablespoon at a time. If it is too wet, gradually mix in flour by the tablespoon until you reach the desired consistency. Do not overmix the dough. Transfer the dough to a well-floured counter and begin to gently roll the dough into a ball. Using a sharp knife, cut 6- or 9-ounce pieces and form into a tight ball (6-ounce dough ball for a 10-inch crust and 9-ounce dough ball for a 12-inch crust). Place the dough balls on a baking sheet covered in olive oil or cooking spray to prevent them from sticking to the sheet. Brush the dough balls with additional olive oil. Cover the dough balls in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then place the dough balls in the refrigerator and let them rest 24 hours. The next day, remove the dough balls and let sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours prior to making pizzas. Push out the dough by hand or use a rolling pin until you reach the desired shape.

Discard skin and bones. Combine the pulled meat, and all of the remaining ingredients, except for the crostini, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook. Beat at medium speed for about 1 minute, or until everything is well mixed. Or use a food processor, taking care not to puree the mixture or let it turn into a paste. The texture should be like finely chopped meat. Serve rillette with crostini. If not using immediately, spoon rillette into ramekins and cover with reserved fat from the duck confit. Store in an airtight container, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Lay the leg portions on a platter, skin side down. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt and the black pepper. Place the garlic cloves, bay leaves, and sprigs of thyme on each of 2 leg portions. Lay the remaining 2 leg portions, flesh to flesh, on top. Put the reserved fat from the ducks in the bottom of a glass or plastic container. Top with the sandwiched leg portions. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt. Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Remove the duck from the refrigerator. Remove the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and duck fat and reserve. Rinse the duck with cool water, rubbing off some of the salt and pepper. Pat dry with paper towels. Put the reserved garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and duck fat in the bottom of an enameled cast iron pot. Sprinkle evenly with the peppercorns and table salt. Lay the duck on top, skin side down. Add the olive oil. Cover and bake for 12 to 14 hours, or until the meat pulls away from the bone. Remove the duck from the fat. Strain the fat and reserve. To store the duck confit, place the duck leg portions in a container, cover with the reserved cooking fat, and store in the refrigerator. Alternately, pick the meat from the bones and place it in a stoneware container. Cover the meat with a thin layer of some of the strained fat. The duck confit can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one month. The excess oil can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator and used like butter for cooking. The tinge of duck taste in the oil is wonderful. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet and brush generously with olive oil on both sides. Sprinkle lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bake for 2 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp.

Divide 3 of the squash lengthwise and remove the seeds. Place the 6 squash halves cut-side up in a large, high-sided ovenproof skillet or pot (you may need to do this in batches or two pots). Sprinkle the cut sides all over with salt, then pour the milk into the cavities, filling halfway. Pour water into the pot until it reaches halfway up the sides of the squash. Carefully place in the oven and roast uncovered until fork-tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, peel, seed and dice the remaining squash. Place in a roasting pan along with the olive oil and a pinch of salt. Toss and roast until fork-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. For the risotto: Add the olive oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until they are translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with the olive oil and onion mixture. Add the white wine and stir until the liquid has absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, and stir until all the liquid has absorbed before adding another 1/2 cup. (This process will take approximately 25 minutes and the risotto will become creamy from the starch releasing.) When all of the liquid has been added and absorbed, stir in the Parmesan and the roasted, diced squash. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (If the risotto seems too dry, just add some more broth). Stuff the roasted squash halves with the risotto and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 63881,&quot;Pan Roasted Foie Gras and White Peach Chili Relish 1/4 cup white vinegar 1/4 cup loosely packed light brown sugar 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 1/4 cup finely chopped red jalapeno pepper 2 tablespoons raisins 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic 1 tablespoon grated ginger 1/2 teaspoon salt 6 firm white (or other) fresh peaches, blanched to remove the skin, pit removed and sliced 1 pound fresh duck foie gras Salt and pepper to taste 12 slices french baguette bread, brushed with olive oil and toasted in a hot oven Instructions: The fresh, raw duck or goose liver known as foie gras is from specially raised fowl that produce this large and fat liver much different in size than the ordinary ducks liver.

Mix until combined and the oil just covers the garlic, adding more oil as necessary. Cook over medium heat until the oil begins to bubble and the garlic turns golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and drain off the oil. Set the garlic aside and let cool. For the BBQ marinade: Combine the pear puree, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice wine, pepper, schichimi togarashi and 5-spice powder in a 2-quart saucepan and mix thoroughly with a whisk. Cook over high heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Add the prepared garlic mixture, lower the heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the onion and scallion. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, remove any excess fat and sinew from the ribs. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes and transfer to a 4-quart container. Slowly pour the cooled BBQ marinade over the ribs and mix until thoroughly coated. Marinate the ribs in the refrigerator at least 8 hours. Drain the ribs and onion of excess BBQ marinade through a sieve or strainer. Heat the oil in a frying pan over high heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the ribs and onion and cook, mixing often to prevent burning, until caramelized and cooked to desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes for medium-rare, 3 to 5 minutes for medium. Serve on rice, bread or salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 63909,&quot;Charred Broccolini and Shishito Romesco 8 ounces shishito peppers 1 lime, halved<br> 1 pound broccolini<br> Olive oil, for drizzling<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup peeled hazelnuts, toasted<br> 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed<br> 1 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped, plus additional for garnish<br> 1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar 1 red jalapeno, sliced into rings<br> Flaky salt, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: Preheat a cast-iron griddle or skillet over medium-high heat until hot.

Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 63911,&quot;Apricot Gelee 2 cups apricot puree (about 4 cups fresh or frozen apricots, pureed and then strained to make 2 cups) 4 teaspoons pectin, available in the baking section of supermarkets or natural food stores 2 1/2 cups sugar, plus extra, for rolling 1/2 cup light corn syrup 2 teaspoons non-buffered ascorbic acid, available at natural-food store 1 teaspoon water Instructions: Heat the puree over medium-high heat in a saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Mix the pectin with half the sugar to \dilute\ it. When the puree reaches 100 degrees F, add the pectin/sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add the remaining sugar and the corn syrup and cook until the mixture reaches 225 degrees F, stirring slowly and constantly with a rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides. Dissolve the ascorbic acid in 1 teaspoon of water. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the ascorbic acid. Pour into a baking dish lined with a silpat or parchment paper, and let set for at least overnight, until gelled and firm. Cut neatly into rectangles 1-inch by 1 1/2 inches. Spread a few tablespoons of sugar in a dish and roll each square in sugar, to coat. Wrap individually in cellophane or store in an airtight container. At room temperature, they keep up to 4 weeks. Notes about the recipe: When golden-brown cookies and dark-brown chocolates threaten to overwhelm my petit-four trays, I can always depend on the bright garnet sparkle of these candies, lively in color and flavor. In France, where I learned to make them, gelees come in a tremendous range of colors and flavors, from grass-green kiwi to deep purple blackberry. And if you&#39;re a fan of Chuckles candies, these will blow your mind. Pectin is a natural fruit gelatin that you can buy in powder form, especially during canning season (June-October). Ascorbic acid, a natural antioxidant available at health-food stores, keeps the color bright. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 63912,&quot;Sweet Potato Flan 2 pounds sweet potatoes 2 cups granulated sugar 1 1/2 cups water 1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar 8 eggs 2 cups heavy cream 3 tablespoons brandy 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice Instructions: Reheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Pulse the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor until combined. Add the 4 tablespoons chilled butter and pulse until the butter is in pea-sized clumps and the mixture is sandy. Add the 3 tablespoons frozen butter; pulse until the frozen butter is also in pea-sized clumps. Add 5 tablespoons of the vinegar mixture; pulse 2 or 3 more times. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers. If it does not stay together easily, add 1 more tablespoon of the vinegar mixture and pulse 3 or 4 more times. (Do not let the dough come together.) Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and gather into a lumpy ball; flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. On a floured surface, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle, about -inch thick. Fit into an 8-inch pie plate and trim the extra dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang; reserve trimmings. Fold the edges under the rim and crimp. Refrigerate the crust until firm, 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line the chilled crust with foil and fill with pie weights or dry beans. Bake until the edges are golden, 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights; continue baking until the center of the crust is dry and golden brown, about 12 minutes. Cool slightly on a wire rack. Cover any cracks in the crust with the dough trimmings before filling. Prepare the filling: Whisk the sugars and the flour in a medium bowl, breaking up any clumps of brown sugar. Combine the heavy cream and vanilla in a separate bowl and slowly whisk into the sugar mixture until smooth. Pour the filling into the prepared crust; bake until the pie begins to set around the edge but is still slightly wobbly in the middle, 40 minutes. (Tent loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes if the crust gets too dark.) Cool to room temperature on a wire rack, then refrigerate until ready to serve.

Stand the watermelon upright vertically in a large bowl. Place an immersion blender into the cut part at the top of the watermelon and puree the flesh, moving the blender in and around, following the shape of the inside of the watermelon. Be careful not to cut through the sides or bottom of the watermelon rind. Pour out the juice and reserve 1 1/2 cups for the ice cream; save the rest for another use. Using a spoon, scoop out any remaining red watermelon flesh so you have a smooth white interior (this is important so the melon freezes properly). Make sure there is no juice remaining inside and pat dry with a paper towel.<br> Freeze the watermelon while you make the ice cream.<br> Whisk together the condensed milk, salt and reserved watermelon juice in a large bowl and set aside.<br> Whip the heavy cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, about 2 minutes. Fold about one-half of the whipped cream into the condensed milk mixture with a rubber spatula until combined, then fold the lightened mixture into the remaining whipped cream until well blended. Pour the mixture into the frozen watermelon, filling it all the way to the top. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until solid, 3 hours and up to overnight.<br> If frozen overnight, let the watermelon thaw for about 2 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Place the watermelon cut-side down on a cutting board and halve lengthwise with a long chef&#39;s knife. Cut each half lengthwise into 3 wedges.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 63958,&quot;Soba Noodle Salad Kosher salt 8 ounces dried buckwheat soba noodles 1/3 cup creamy almond butter 1/4 cup soy sauce 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons sesame oil 1 1/2 tablespoons honey 2 teaspoons wasabi paste One 1 1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped<br> One 1 1/2-pound head napa cabbage, cored and shredded 3 green onions, thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and thinly sliced 1 hothouse cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick half-moon shapes<br> 1 cup slivered almonds, toasted, see Cook&#39;s Note<br> 3 tablespoons black sesame seeds Instructions: Boil a large pot of salted water over high heat.

Mix in the hot water a little at time, kneading until a sticky dough forms. It will be tacky and lumpy, but should not contain any dry clumps of flour. Drizzle the 3 tablespoons vegetable oil over the dough and then tilt and rotate the bowl a bit to make sure that all of the visible surface of the dough has been coated. Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel and let rest at room temperature for about 2 hours. (The dough will not rise or expand while resting.) To fry the dough, heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F, or until a pinch of flour tossed into the oil gives off an audible sizzle. Pull off a handful-size chunk of dough and shape it into a thin disk without overhandling the dough. Fry until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. (Trust your eyes and nose to tell you when the bread is ready.) Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dough, bringing the oil back up to 350 degrees F between batches. (You should end up with 8 to 10 medium-sized pieces of fry bread. If your pan is 12 inches or larger, you can experiment with cooking two pieces at a time.) To serve, top each piece of fry bread with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the Beans and 1/4 cup of the Chili. Top with some cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. Rinse the soaked beans, place in a medium pot with 10 cups water and turn the heat to medium-low. Add the onions, oregano, cilantro, pepper flakes, garlic, bay leaf and 1 teaspoon salt and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the beef, onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned, about 7 minutes. Skim off any fat and then stir in the tomatoes, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add the dark chili powder, light chili powder, paprika, cumin and pepper flakes and simmer on low, stirring occasionally, for 2 1/2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 63960,&quot;Phoenix (Orange) Cinnamon Buns 5 oranges 10 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 (12-ounce) package refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough 10 tablespoons milk Instructions: Cut the top third off the oranges and scoop out all the pulp; reserve the tops for this recipe and reserve the pulp for another use, if desired. Mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. For each orange, flatten the dough for 2 biscuits and top them with 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar mixture. Roll the biscuits up into a ball and place them into the oranges. (Note: The dough should fill the orange about 2/3 of the way full, leaving room at the top for the bun to expand. Add more or less dough according to the size of your orange.) Add 2 tablespoons milk to each orange and put the tops back on. Wrap them individually in 3 layers of foil. Put them into the glowing embers of the campfire to cook for 7 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through the cooking time.

Pound out the pork cutlets between 2 pieces of plastic wrap until they are 1/4-inch thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set up a dredging station with the flour, eggs and panko in 3 separate bowls. Dredge the cutlets first in the flour, shaking off any excess, followed by the egg and panko. Carefully slip the cutlets into the oil and shallow fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately with Braised Red Cabbage. Garnish with lemon wedges. Combine the cabbage, vinegar, spices, onions and bay leaves in a glass bowl. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and weigh down with heavy cans. Marinate for 2 hours in the refrigerator, keeping any liquid that&#39;s released. In a Dutch oven, saute the bacon until it begins to crisp and the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve.

Use the width (18 inches) of the piece of acetate to be the length of the finished cone. While rolling hold the tip so that it is as tight as you can make it. Tape the cone closed where necessary. With scissors trim the open end of the cone so that it is flat. Place the cone in a vase or some tall container that allows it to stand upright. Use a ladle to fill the cone with the tempered chocolate. Empty the cone of excess chocolate by flipping it over the bowl of tempered chocolate. Set on a baking sheet fitted with a baking rack so the chocolate can continue to drain. When the chocolate has drained, place the cone in the refrigerator or let cool at cool room temperature until set. Repeat this process 1 more time in order to achieve thick, more stable chocolate cone walls. Pour tempered chocolate onto a sheet of acetate that is on your work surface. Spread the chocolate so it is a minimum of 1/4-inch thick. Allow it to set slightly. When the chocolate has begun to set but is not yet hard, cut a round base on which to \glue\ the cone. The size of the round base will be determined by how tightly you wrapped your cone. The tighter the cone is wrapped the smaller the diameter of the cone&#39;s bottom. You can measure the diameter of your cone and add 4 inches, which should leave you with a base that will have a wide rim around your cone. Next, cut the concentric rings that will fit on the cone. I used cake rings, cookie cutters and piping tips to make the concentric circles and the inside cut-outs. Again, the size of concentric rings is determined by the cone that you made. Make at least 3 concentric rings and remember, the larger rings will have to have the larger cut-outs so they can slide towards the base of your cone. You may need to repeat this procedure to make additional circles. Unwrap the cone from the acetate. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the cone to the base, placing it in the center of the circle. Slide the concentric rings onto the cone. Arrange the Wagashi pastry on the circles. ; How to Temper Chocolate . From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres . Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. . One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. . Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. . The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. . A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 63989,&quot;Garlic Staked Leg of Lamb with Salad of Mixed Greens 2 potatoes 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 (1-pound) boned leg of lamb 3 ounces garlic 1 sprig rosemary 4 sprigs thyme 1/4 cup chopped parsley 1/4 cup chopped marjoram 2 cups lamb stock 2 slices dry bread, crust removed 1 ounce sliced garlic 3 ounces mixed salad greens 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 lemon, juiced Salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Scrape out the seeds. Put the seeds, pod halves, milk cream and 1/4 cup of the brown sugar in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Bring just to the simmering point over low heat. In the meantime, combine the remaining 3/4 cup brown sugar, egg yolks and vanilla extract in a large bowl and whisk until just blended. While gently whisking the yolks, drizzle the hot cream mixture into them so that they are gradually warmed up. Return everything to the saucepan and cook while stirring with a wooden spoon. Make sure that you are constantly scraping the spoon across the bottom of the pan so the custard does not scorch. The custard is done when it has thickened slightly and can evenly coat the back of the spoon. Do not let it come to a boil. Strain the custard through a fine sieve. Press our all the liquid in the vanilla beans and nestle the container holding the custard into a large bowl of ice. Let cool, stirring occasionally. Transfer the custard to an ice cream machine and freeze according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Put the finished ice cream in a storage container and freeze until firm. For the fluff: In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, bring the water, corn syrup, 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla bean to 246 degrees F. In the meantime, in a completely clean, dry mixing bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, salt and cream of tartar until creamy and foamy, about 2 minutes. Still whisking, sprinkle in the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and continue to whisk until the whites hold very soft peaks, about 2 minutes. While mixing on slow speed, carefully drizzle in the hot syrup. Turn the mixer to high and whisk until thick, fluffy and just warm, about 7 minutes. Turn the mixer to low and whisk in the vanilla seeds. For the Butterscotch Sauce: Bring sugar, butter and vanilla bean to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat, whisking until combined. Remove pan from the heat. Add the Scotch, return the pan to the heat and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and whisk in the salt and warm cream until smooth. For the Homemade Fudge Sauce: Bring cream, corn syrup, sugar, cocoa, salt, and half of chocolate to a boil in a 1 to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until chocolate is melted.

Whisk to combine and bring to a boil over low heat. Meanwhile, combine the eggs and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl. In another bowl, combine the cornstarch and remaining 1/2 cup cream. When the cream and coconut mixture comes to a boil, remove it from the heat and whisk half into the egg and sugar mixture. Then IMMEDIATELY whisk it back into the pan with the hot cream and coconut mixture. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Return the saucepan to medium heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch and cream mixture. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat to thicken the pastry cream, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. (It is necessary to bring this mixture to a boil to cook the cornstarch; if the mixture is not brought to a boil, the mixture will feel starchy and gritty. The desired outcome is the consistency of vanilla pudding. YUM!) Strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl and chill until chilled through. (This can be done really quickly over an ice bath.) For the tropical fruit salad: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the macadamia nuts on a small baking sheet and toast until golden and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly, then roughly chop and set aside. Toast the remaining 1/4 cup coconut flakes in medium skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside to cool and crisp. For the whipped cream: Beat the cream, sugar and vanilla seeds in a chilled mixing bowl with a hand mixer until the cream starts to thicken and hold soft peaks. To serve: Layer some pastry cream, pineapple, banana, starfruit, mango, whipped cream, toasted macadamia nuts and toasted coconut in 4 individual trifle dishes. Repeat the layers and top with a dollop of whipped cream, toasted macadamia nuts, toasted coconut and some fruit, including a slice of starfruit.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]</p><p>Note: The wine pairing suggestions are based on general guidelines for wine pairing and may vary depending on personal taste preferences.&quot; 64003,&quot;Touchdown Peach Cobbler 5 ripe peaches 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons bourbon 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out dough 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, chilled 3/4 cup cold buttermilk 1/4 cup heavy cream, for brushing Raw sugar, for sprinkling Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: For the peaches: Remove the skins from the peaches and cut into wedges.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a wide shallow skillet or paella pan over medium heat. Make a sofrito by sauteing the onion, garlic, and tomatoes; cook until the mixture caramelizes a bit and the flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the paprika, salt and pepper. Fold in the rice, stirring to coat the grains. Pour in the hot, black stock and give it a stir. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Do not cover or constantly stir like risotto. Mix the pimentos, olives, parsley, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons of oil together in a small bowl. Arrange the pan-roasted prawns on the black rice, and sprinkle the olive mixture all over the top; serve directly from the pan at the table. Make a quick marinade for the prawns by combining them in a bowl with a healthy drizzle of olive oil, the paprika, crushed garlic, lemon slices, salt, and pepper. Toss the prawns so they are coated with all the good stuff and marinate for 5 minutes to 2 hours in the refrigerator. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil is hot, pull the prawns out of the marinade and toss them into the pan.

Divide the pizza dough into 2 balls. Put one ball on a heavily floured surface and roll and shape into a thin 11-inch circle with a thicker edge. Transfer to a floured pizza peel or floured upside-down baking sheet. Spread half the pizza sauce evenly on the dough round. Top with 3 slices of salami and half the cheese. (Make sure the dough, with all its toppings, can slide back and forth easily on the pizza peel; if not, add more flour.) Carefully slide the dough onto the hot pizza stone (the dough may not be perfectly round when it slides onto the stone). Bake until the bottom of the crust is lightly browned and very crisp and the cheese is melted, about 7 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven, top with basil and sprinkle with some crushed red pepper. Cut into 4 pieces. Repeat with the second ball of dough and remaining toppings. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small pot. Add the bulgur and quinoa and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer the grains to a fine-mesh strainer and hold under cold running water to stop the cooking. Let the grains drain in the strainer for 15 minutes, then spread them out on a thick layer of paper towels to absorb any extra moisture. Meanwhile, coarsely grind the flaxseeds in a spice grinder, just to break them open. Stir together the warm water, agave and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Whisk the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl; add the foamy yeast mixture and olive oil and mix together with a stiff rubber spatula. When the dough starts to come together, mix in the cooked grains, ground flaxseeds and sunflower seeds; form the dough into a uniform ball in the center of the bowl. Be sure to scrape and use any dough stuck to the sides. The dough will be very sticky at this stage. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on a clean, dry work surface. Scrape the dough onto the floured surface and knead for a couple of minutes, working in just enough flour to make the dough less sticky but still moist to the touch. Flour your hands periodically to prevent sticking. Form the dough into one single ball or divide it into smaller balls. Place the dough ball(s) on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let the dough rest for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes, the dough can be shaped and cooked as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 64013,&quot;Prosciutto and Arugula Pizza 8 ounces prepared pizza dough, formed into a circle 1/4 cup ricotta cheese<br> 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella<br> 8 slices prosciutto<br> 1/2 cup arugula<br> Olive oil, for drizzling Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.

In a large pot or deep-fryer preheat vegetable oil to 325 degrees F. Add the plantains to the oil and fry for 5 minutes. Remove them and place on a flat surface. Increase heat to 375 degrees F. With a metal flat spatula press down onto the plantains until they are flat, less than 1/4-inch. Using a knife to help scrape the plantain off the spatula, deep-fry the plantains again for 3 minutes. Pull them out and season both sides with salt and pepper. Combine the bread crumbs, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, paprika, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder to create Cajun spice. Dip each piece of steak into 4 ounces melted butter and then into the Cajun spice, covering both sides of the steak. Spread the remaining melted butter onto a flat top grill or metal skillet, place the steak on top and cook on both sides until medium or preferred degree of doneness. After the steak is done slice it thin against the grain. Combine the mayonnaise and chipolte sauce to create chipolte mayonnaise. Onions: In a mixing bowl combine flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Slice the onion very thinly. Place in the flour mixture. Squeeze the slices of onions as you are mixing them with the flour mixture. Shake off the excess flour.

Arrange the flatfish- dark skin side up- in a buttered or oiled dish that closely fits it and pour on the shellfish- cooking liquid. There should be enough liquid to come halfway up the sides of the fish. If there isn&#39;t, add some water or fish broth. Place the containers with the fish on the stove over medium heat until the liquid comes to a simmer. Loosely cover with aluminum foil and slide the fish into the oven .

Combine the buttermilk, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Add the onion rings, toss well, and allow to marinate for at least 15 minutes. (The onion rings can sit in the buttermilk for a few hours.) In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set aside. When you&#39;re ready to fry the onion rings, preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a large pot or Dutch oven. (A candy thermometer attached to the side of the pot will help you maintain the proper temperature.) Working in batches, lift some onions out of the buttermilk and dredge them in the flour mixture. Drop into the hot oil and fry for 2 minutes, until golden brown, turning them once with tongs. Don&#39;t crowd them! Place the finished onion rings on the baking sheet, sprinkle liberally with salt, and keep them warm in the oven while you fry the next batch. Continue frying the onion rings and placing them in the warm oven until all the onions are fried. They will remain crisp in the oven for up to 30 minutes. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 64025,&quot;Slow-Cooked and Stuffed Baby Bell cl Peppers 10 small, round baby bell cl peppers (cherry peppers) Small bottle olive oil 2 good handfuls rocket (arugula) 1 good handful parsley 1 small handful capers, soaked and drained 1 handful anchovies 10 tablespoons balsamic vinegar or enough to cover Salt and fresh ground black pepper Instructions: Halve the chiles, remove the seeds and then wash in cold water.

Spread the pine nuts onto a small sheet tray and place in the oven to toast, 5 to 7 minutes. Set up a large pot of well-salted boiling water. Set up a large bowl of well-salted ice water. Blanch the broccoli rabe for 1 minute until bright green and tender, but still crisp. Remove from the boiling water and plunge immediately into the ice bath. Once cool, remove from the ice bath and use your hands to squeeze out excess water. Finely chop the broccoli rabe and add to a large bowl with the sausage, pine nuts, parmesan, breadcrumbs, egg and crushed red pepper. Sprinkle with salt. Heat a small saute pan over medium-high heat with a little olive oil. Take a small amount of filling and cook a small tester patty to test for seasoning. Adjust the seasoning on the remaining raw mixture if needed. Trim any excess fat from the pork chops. Cut the pork lengthwise to butterfly, then pound to an even thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch. Lay a large piece of caul fat out on a large, flat work surface. Place 4 slices of prosciutto over the caul fat, followed by the pounded pork loin on top of the prosciutto. Set half the broccoli rabe and sausage filling on top of the pork loin and shape into a thin log. Wrap the prosciutto and pork loin around the filling and roll into a tight log. Wrap the caul fat around the stuffed pork, cutting off any excess from the ends, making sure the caul fat is in one even layer around the pork. Tie with butcher\u2019s twine to secure and trim any excess string. Repeat with the remaining pork and filling. Heat a large saute pan with olive oil over high heat. Sear the roulades, turning on all sides, until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the pork to a sheet tray and place into the oven and reserve the pan that the pork was cooked in. Roast the pork at 375 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes, or until an instant read thermometer registers 150 degrees F. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then remove the string. Place the pan that the pork was cooked in back onto medium-high heat and drain off any remaining fat. Add the shallot and cook for 2 minutes until tender. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and stir, making sure to scrape the bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until almost all of the liquid has reduced, then add half the chicken stock. Continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half, then add the remaining chicken stock. Cook until slightly reduced then remove from heat. Slice the pork into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Plate alongside the mashed potatoes and a drizzle of sauce over the pork.<br> Place the potatoes in a large saucepan. Add cold water to cover the potatoes by 1 to 2 inches and generously season with kosher salt. Bring the pot of water to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Drain the potatoes and add back to the large saucepan. Using an electric hand mixer, mix the potatoes and gradually add the butter and warmed heavy cream, alternating, until the potatoes reach a creamy and silky consistency.

In a heavy-bottomed pot over high heat, mix the chickpea flour, salt, cumin, black pepper and cayenne. Gradually add 2 1/2 cups water while stirring with a flat-bottomed wooden spatula. Avoid lots of lumps of flour, but a few are ok. While stirring almost constantly, gradually lower the heat as the mixture thickens. Add the parsley when most of the water has been absorbed. Once it is thickened and the mixture pulls away from the sides and bottom of the pot when you stir it, it is done. It should take 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the patty mixture to the sheet pan and spread it evenly, covering the entire pan. (Optional: Also oil the bottom of another pan and place it on top of the patty mixture. Press firmly to create a smooth, even surface, then remove.) Cool completely. For the squash: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices (when delicata first come into season you can eat the skin). Toss with a little olive oil and a pinch of black pepper, place on a sheet pan and bake until easily pierced with a knife, 10 to 15 minutes. Keep these warm. For the aioli: Add the mustard, garlic, egg yolks, lemon zest and lemon juice to a food processor and puree. With the unit running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until all is used. It should form a thick emulsion, like mayonnaise. Cool completely. For the slaw: Toss the carrots and radishes with the oil and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Keep at room temperature. Now for the sandwiches! Fill a deep-fat fryer with vegetable oil (alternatively use rice bran oil) and set to 350 degrees F. (If preferable, bake or grill the patties as you would polenta.) Slice the rolls in half to open them, lightly brush with olive oil and toast them either on a grill or in the broiler of an oven. Take the sheet pan of chickpea and cut into 12 pieces. For each sandwich, drop 2 of the patties into the fryer until they are crispy and begin to brown, about 4 minutes. Spread aioli on each side of the roll, then place salad greens on each side. Cover 1 side with the carrot radish slaw, then place 3 to 4 slices of roasted squash on top. Remove the patties from the fryer, drain on paper towels and lightly salt them. Place them over the squash and close the sandwich up! This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.

For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 64043,&quot;Teriyaki Chicken Wings 2 dozen chicken wings, about 3 1/4 pounds, rinsed and patted dry Salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted in a skillet over medium heat until lightly browned Leaves from 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped 1 cup low-sodium soy sauce 1 cup grapefruit juice 1/4 cup hoisin sauce 1/4 cup ketchup 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1/4 cup brown sugar 1 fresh, hot red cl, halved 5 garlic cloves, halved 2-inch piece fresh ginger, smashed with the side of a large knife Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season the chicken wings with salt and pepper and drizzle a little olive oil on them to prevent sticking. Lay the wings in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes or until the skin gets crispy and the wings are cooked through. Meanwhile, combine the teriyaki sauce ingredients in a large saucepan. Simmer over low heat and reduce until slightly thickened. Pour the sauce into a large bowl. Dump the wings into the bowl and toss to coat them with the sauce. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with the sesame seeds and cilantro. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64044,&quot;Toronto Cocktail 8 ounces rye whiskey 1 ounce Fernet Branca<br> 3/4 ounce Simple Syrup, recipe follows 2 dashes bitters, such as Angostura 4 large strips orange peel 1 cup sugar Instructions: Combine the whiskey, Fernet Branca, Simple Syrup and bitters in a glass with ice.

Roast, turning every couple of minutes, until the chiles and tomatoes are soft, blistered, and blackened in spots and the garlic is soft, 12 to 13 minutes. Place the chiles in a bowl, cover with a towel, and let stand for 5 minutes, then wipe off the blackened skin. Pull or cut out the stems, seed pods, and seeds; rinse quickly to remove any stray seeds and bits of char. When the tomatoes are cool, peel off and discard their skins. Slip the papery skins off the garlic. In a mortar or food processor, make a coarse puree of the roasted garlic and poblanos (with both mortar and processor, it&#39;s best to start with the garlic, then add the poblanos); place in a large bowl. Chop the roasted tomatoes (for this recipe, it&#39;s best not to use any of the juice from the baking sheet) and add to the poblano mixture along with the parsley. Finishing the guacamole: Cut the avocado lengthwise in half around the pit, twist the halves apart and remove the pits. Scoop out the flesh into the bowl with the flavorings. Using a potato masher or the back of a large spoon, coarsely mash everything together. Taste and season with salt, usually a scant teaspoon, then add enough lime juice to enliven all the flavors. Cover with plastic wrap, placing it directly on the surface, and refrigerate until you&#39;re ready to eat. To serve, scoop into a decorative bowl or Mexican mortar, sprinkle with the queso anejo and stud with radish slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 64046,&quot;Mama&#39;s Stew Beef 5 pounds Angus beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes 2 cups spicy ketchup<br> 2/3 cup bottled Caribbean green seasoning 1/2 cup garlic powder 1/2 cup onion powder<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup canola oil 4 tablespoons sugar<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the beef, ketchup, green seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and some salt and pepper.

Add the seasoned beef and cook, stirring vigorously, until browned, about 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium-high and cook undisturbed for another 5 minutes. Slowly add just enough water to cover the beef. Cook for 30 minutes, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the meat is tender, about 25 minutes more. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 64047,&quot;Creamy Broccoli Soup 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup sliced leeks, white and light green only 1 cup chopped peeled potato 3 to 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1 bay leaf 1 medium clove garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 3 cups broccoli florets 1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the potato, thyme, bay leaf, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring, until the potatoes are well coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the broth and bring to a simmer. Add all but 2 to 3 of the broccoli florets, bring back to a simmer and cook until the broccoli is tender, about 20 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a simmer. Remove from the heat, and let cool at least 5 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme and carefully puree until smooth with a handheld immersion blender or in 2 to 3 batches in a blender (do not fill blender more than halfway full). Meanwhile, cut the reserved broccoli florets in half, lengthwise. Put in a small microwave-safe bowl, toss with a splash of water and a pinch of salt, cover and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside. Add the cream and reheat the soup if necessary. Adjust the consistency and seasoning with water, salt and pepper. Serve hot and garnish each soup with a broccoli half.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 64048,&quot;Sturgeon Fillets Served with a Fig and Corn Cream, a Licorice Flavored Crustacean Broth, and Stuffed Artichokes 4 sturgeon fillets, totaling about 2 pounds, skinless About 4 ounces chicken consomme About 5 ounces cream About 3 1/2 ounces white polenta Salt and freshly ground black pepper Dash lemon juice About 1-ounce fig puree Olive oil, to taste About 6 pounds langoustine carcasses 1 carrot, roughly chopped 1 onion, roughly chopped Parsley sprigs, to taste Thyme, to taste Bay leaf, to taste Star anise, to taste 2 liters water About 2 1/2 ounces powdered licorice 1 pint cream 4 large artichokes Lemon juice About 1 3/4 ounces carrots About 1 3/4 ounces shallots About 1 3/4 ounces zucchini About 1 3/4 ounces red bell peppers About 1/2 ounce country ham Olive oil 2 chopped up artichoke hearts (from above) Fresh chives, to taste Instructions: Fish: Using a nonstick skillet, caramelize the sturgeon fish. Set aside. Corn and Fig Cream: Boil the chicken consomme and the cream. Incorporate the polenta by sprinkling it into the pan. Let it cook for 5 minutes, stirring continuously. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Add the fig puree. Crustacean Broth: Heat some olive oil in a pot. When the oil is hot, add the langoustines to heat through. Add the carrot, onion, parsley, thyme, bay leaf, and star anise. Cook for a few minutes. Add the water and powdered licorice. Cook on low heat for 30 minutes. Pass the mixture through a fine strainer and add the cream. Stuffed Artichokes: Trim each artichoke, 1 at a time, to reveal the heart. Cut off the stem and the top of the artichoke, then cut away all the outer leaves in 1 circular motion. Use a spoon to scrape out the pointy thistles, and use the knife to trim away any remaining leaves or husk. You should be left with just the heart (artichoke should be in the shape of a little bowl) Rub the hearts with lemon juice. Place artichokes into a pot of cold water with enough water to cover. Cook on medium heat until a knife easily slides through the artichoke heart, about 15 to 20 minutes. Once artichoke hearts are cool enough to handle, set 2 aside and chop the other 2 into small pieces. You will use the chopped up artichoke for the artichoke filling. Cut the carrots, shallots, zucchini, bell peppers, and ham in a \brunoise\ fashion (small cubes). Saute all the ingredients in olive oil, in the order given. Do not overcook. Fold in the chopped artichokes. Stuff the 2 artichoke hearts with the filling. Set aside. To finish the dish: On the center of a large platter, place the fig polenta. Arrange the sturgeon around the polenta. Add the stuffed artichoke hearts to the plate. Garnish the plate with chives. Drizzle the platter with the Crustacean Broth and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 64049,&quot;Cauliflower Fried Rice 1 head of cauliflower, stem removed, head cut into florets 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil<br> 3 green onions, sliced thin<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger<br> 1 tablespoon chili paste, plus more if desired<br> 1/2 cup shredded carrots<br> 1 cup packed baby spinach<br> 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons butter<br> 4 eggs<br> Sriracha (if desired) 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds<br> Instructions: In batches, pulse the cauliflower in a food processor until rice-size crumbs form. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Put a large skillet over medium heat and add the vegetable oil and sesame oil. Add two-thirds of the green onions, the garlic, ginger and chili paste. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Raise the heat to medium high and add the carrots and spinach; continue to cook, stirring, until the spinach has wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Continuing to stir constantly, add the cauliflower rice. Cook until the cauliflower is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the soy sauce and stir, scraping the bottom of the skillet, until the liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a second skillet over medium heat. Crack in the eggs; as they cook, spoon hot butter over the whites of the eggs so that the whites set without flipping. Towards the end of cooking, carefully spoon hot butter over the yolks and cook until the eggs reach the desired doneness. Remove the pan with the cauliflower from the heat, drizzle with sriracha, and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and reserved green onions. Divide between 4 plates and top each serving with an egg. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 64050,&quot;Sam Choy&#39;s Hummingbird 1/2 ripe banana 2 ounces rum cream 3/4-ounce coffee liqueur 2 ounces strawberry syrup 1 scoop crushed ice Instructions: Blend all ingredients together until smooth, pour in desired glass and garnish with a cherry. &quot;,&quot;[Rum, Coffee Liqueur, Strawberry Wine]&quot; 64051,&quot;Ham and Cheese Spirals 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon crushed garlic 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning Flour, for work surface 1 pound refrigerated pizza dough, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar 1/2 pound deli sliced ham 1 large egg 2 tablespoons water Instructions: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, garlic, and Italian seasoning. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into a 12-inch square. Brush the entire surface with the seasoned olive oil. Top with 1 cup of shredded cheese and an even layer of ham. (Reserve the extra cheese and ham for Round 2 Ham and Cheese Croquettes.) Starting from the bottom edge, tightly roll up the dough to form a log. Using a sharp serrated knife, slice the roll on the bias into 1-inch thick pieces. Arrange the rolls on their side on a nonstick or lightly oiled baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to proof. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush the tops and sides of the rolls with the egg wash. Bake until golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer to a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 64052,&quot;Green Bean and Asparagus Salad with Crispy Prosciutto and Warm Lemon Dressing 8 pieces prosciutto, thinly sliced and cut into 1-inch pieces 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 shallot, diced 1/4 cup sliced skinless almonds 1/4 cup sultana (golden) raisins 1/4 cup raisins 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives Juice of 1 lemon 1 teaspoons honey Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces green beans, trimmed and blanched in salted water 1 bunch asparagus, bottoms trimmed and blanched in salted water Instructions: For the crispy prosciutto: Heat a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Put the prosciutto pieces in the pan and cook until crisp. Remove the prosciutto from the heat and reserve for the green bean and asparagus salad. For the warm lemon dressing: Put 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan over medium- high heat. Add the shallots and season with salt. Saute the shallots until tender. Add the almonds, raisins, and olives, and mix to incorporate. Add the lemon juice and honey, stir to combine. Add the remaining olive oil, season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. For the green bean and asparagus salad: Cut the green beans and asparagus into 1-inch pieces and put in a bowl. Pour the warm lemon dressing over the green beans and asparagus. Toss to combine and garnish with the crispy prosciutto. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 64053,&quot;Roast Chicken with Jus 1 (3 1/2 to 4 pound) chicken, giblets removed and reserved Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 carrot, chopped 1 small onion, chopped 1/2 celery stalk, chopped 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, homemade or canned low-sodium canned Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Season the chicken cavity with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and fold the wing tips under the back. Put the carrot, onion, celery, neck, and heart, if using, in the center of a roasting pan just large enough to accommodate the chicken. (Discard the liver or reserve for another recipe.) Season the butter with salt and pepper and brush the entire chicken with it. Set the bird breast-side up on top of the vegetables. Roast the chicken for 45 minutes. Then increase the temperature to 425 degrees F., cooking until an instant-read thermometer stuck into the chicken thigh registers 160 to 170 degrees F., about 15 minutes more. Tip the chicken so the juices run into the pan. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and loosely tent with foil while making the jus. To make the jus: Set a strainer over a bowl. Strain the vegetables, giblets, if using, and pan juices into the strainer. Shake the strainer to get more juices into the bowl. Set strainer aside. Skim most of the fat from the surface of the liquid with a spoon, or alternately, use a degreasing cup. Reserve the pan juices. Place the roasting pan directly on a burner set at medium-high. Pour the chicken broth into the pan, and scrape the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen all the browned bits that cling to the pan. Add the reserved pan juices, increase the heat to high and boil the liquid until slightly thickened. Return the reserved vegetables to the sauce, if desired, or carefully strain jus through a fine sieve into a serving bowl. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve. Carve the chicken and serve with the jus. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64054,&quot;Coconut Butter Cookies 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, room temperature 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon dark rum 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut, toasted Scant 2 cups flour 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: In a mixer with a paddle attachment, whip the butter until very light and fluffy. Add the sugar and continue whipping, then add the rum and vanilla and mix. Toss together the coconut, flour and salt then add to the butter mixture and mix until blended. Butter a small sheet pan (9 by 12-inch), and line it with plastic all the way up the sides. Spread the dough evenly into the pan, cover it with plastic and freeze. Cut frozen dough into 2-inch strips and roll in flour. Wrap and freeze or cut into1/8-inch bars and place on parchment or silpat-lined sheet pan. Bake in a conventional oven at 250 degrees F for about 30 minutes until crisp but barely colored. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 64055,&quot;Beef Salad with Chipotles and Radishes 2 pounds sirloin steaks, 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil, for brushing 1 large red onion 1/2 cup canned chipotle chiles, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 2 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper 2 large cloves garlic, minced 3 Anaheim chiles, roasted, peeled, stemmed, and seeded (see Note) 1/2 hothouse cucumber, peeled and cut into 1/4inch dice 5 radishes, cut into 1/4inch dice 1 bunch cilantro, leaves only, finely chopped 1/2 head romaine lettuce, pale inner leaves only, coarsely julienned 2 ripe plum tomatoes, cut into julienne Instructions: Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron frying pan or griddle to high heat. Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper and brush them with a little olive oil. Sear the steaks for about 4 minutes on each side, depending on their thickness, for medium rare meat. Remove from the heat and allow to cool almost to room temperature. Trim the stem and flower ends of the red onion and cut it in half crosswise. Pressing from the bottoms, pop the onion sections out so that you have 6 good-sized onion cups. Set aside and cut the remaining onion into 1/4 inch dice. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the chopped chipotles, olive oil, lime juice, vinegar, salt, cracked pepper and garlic until well blended. Cut the Anaheim chiles into 1/4inch dice and add them to the bowl, along with the diced red onion, cucumber, radishes, and cilantro. Slice the beef across the grain on the diagonal into 3/8inch slices. Spread a layer of the romaine on each plate and distribute some of the beef and the tomatoes on top. Spoon the dressing, with all its chunky ingredients, over the top and serve immediately. Note: Fresh chiles and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. (If you are rushed, you can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits. Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away flavorful juices. Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 64056,&quot;Caipirinha (Brazil) 3 limes 1/2 cup sugar 1 1/2 quarts ice 1 cup cachaca (Brazilian brandy made from sugar cane) Instructions: Cut the limes in half, and then cut each half into 8 pieces. Place 12 pieces of lime in each of 4 double old-fashioned glasses (or other 12-ounce glasses.) Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar into each glass. Using a muddler or the butt end of a large wooden spoon, mash the limes into the base of the glass. Try to dissolve the sugar as you do this, and stir occasionally. Fill each glass with 1 1/2 cups of ice and 1/4 cup of cachaca. Pour the contents of the glass into a shaker, and invert the glass into the shaker to act as a lid. Shake the glass and shaker to combine the sugar and cachaca for several seconds. Lift the glass from the shaker, and pour the contents back into the glass. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 glasses. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 64057,&quot;Avocado Mayonnaise 1 large egg yolk 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons lemon juice 3/4 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon boiling water 1 avocado, peeled and pitted 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/2 small red onion, minced 1/2 bunch flatleaf parsley, leaves only coarsely chopped Instructions: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the yolk together with the salt, pepper, mustard, and lemon juice. Add the olive oil in a thin stream, very slowly at first, whisking constantly. Keep whisking until all the olive oil is completely absorbed. Whisk in the boiling water to stabilize the mayonnaise. In another bowl mash together the avocado and the lime juice. Stir the avocado, onion, and parsley into the mayonnaise and cover. If not using right away, refrigerate for up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 64058,&quot;Blueberry Almond Breakfast Tart 5 1/4 pints fresh blueberries, divided 3/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 3 large egg yolks 2 teaspoons cornstarch 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon grated lemon peel 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup sliced almonds, plus 2 tablespoons, lightly toasted 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup (1 stick) chilled butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1 large egg yolk 1/3 teaspoon almond extract 1/2 cup black currant jelly Instructions: Filling: In a heavy bottom medium saucepan add 4 pints blueberries, the sugar, and the lemon juice. Coarsely mash the berries with a fork. Stir over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and mixture boils and thickens, about 8 minutes. In a medium bowl whisk the egg yolks and cornstarch together. Slowly whisk in half of the hot berry mixture (making sure not to cook egg yolks), then return the egg mixture to the pan. Stir over medium-high heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the butter, and lemon peel. Transfer the filling to a bowl, cover and refrigerate overnight. Crust: Mix the flour, 1/3 cup sliced almonds, sugar, and salt in a food processor until the almonds are finely ground. Add the butter, pulsing until the mixture looks like coarse meal. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, and almond extract. Add the mixture to the food processor and blend until moist clumps form. Gather the dough into a ball and flatten it into a disk. Lightly butter a 9-inch-diameter tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Pierce the crust all over with fork, and freeze for 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degree F. Line the crust with foil, and fill it with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until the crust is set, about 12 minutes. Remove the foil and beans, and continue to bake until the crust is golden, about 16 minutes more. Cool the crust completely on a rack. Spread the filling in the crust, and sprinkle the remaining 1 1/4 pints of blueberries over the filling. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add the black currant jelly and stir until melted. Brush the jelly over the berries as a glaze. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons sliced almonds around the edge of the tart. Cover loosely with foil and chill at least 2 hours. Remove the pan sides. Put the tart on a platter, and serve cold or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 64059,&quot;Red, White and Blue Smoothie 4 ounces pomegranate juice (1/2 cup) 1/2 frozen banana, sliced 1/2 cup frozen blueberries 1/2 cup ice 1 tablespoon honey 2 ounces orange juice (or the juice from 1 orange) 1/2 cup ice 1/2 cup yogurt, plain or vanilla 1 frozen banana, sliced 2 ounces pomegranate juice (1/4 cup) 1 cup frozen strawberries, halved 1/2 frozen banana, sliced 1/2 cup ice Instructions: For the blue layer: Pour the pomegranate juice into the blender.

Add the barley and cook to just shy of tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain in a sieve and run under cold water, then drain again. Put the dried porcini mushrooms in a small saucepan with about 2 cups water. Bring to a low boil, then simmer until tender. Transfer the mushrooms with a slotted spoon to a food processor. Pour in all but the last few spoonfuls of the cooking liquid (grit from the mushrooms may settle there). Puree until smooth. Heat the EVOO in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the portobello mushrooms and cook until browned. Add the thyme, shallots, celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Deglaze with the sherry, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Stir in the stock, porcini puree and Roasted Garlic Paste. Meanwhile, bring the steak to room temperature and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle the steak with EVOO, then cook for 7 to 8 minutes, turning once. Let rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes, then thinly slice and cut into bite-size pieces. Dress with the Worcestershire sauce. Stir the parsley and barley into the soup, then ladle into shallow bowls. Arrange the steak on top of the soup.<br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Arrange the garlic in a cluster on a large piece of foil and drizzle with 1/4 cup EVOO. Wrap up the garlic in the foil to make a tightly sealed pouch. Roast until very tender, about 45 minutes. Let cool, then squeeze the garlic from the skins into a food processor. Add the remaining 3/4 cup EVOO and the honey and season with salt and pepper. Puree until smooth, then transfer to a small container. (Alternatively, you can mash the garlic paste with a fork instead of using a food processor.)

Meanwhile, whisk together the brown sugar, cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until no lumps of sugar remain. Work in 12 tablespoons of the butter and stir until completely combined. Set aside until ready to assemble.<br> Beat the cream cheese, confectioners&#39; sugar, cream, vanilla, the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Set aside until ready to serve.<br> Gently deflate the dough by lifting it up around the edges and letting it fall back into the bowl, turning the bowl and repeating if needed. Transfer to a clean work surface lightly dusted with flour. Roll into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle, pushing the edges towards the center to make the sides straight. Spread the butter-brown sugar mixture over the dough in an even layer, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edges. Starting on one of the shorter sides, tightly roll into a log, pressing the sides occasionally to keep them flush.<br> Grease a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with butter. Cut the dough log crosswise into 12 equal pieces and arrange them cut-side up in the pan, gently shaping the rolls to make them fit in the pan. Let rise, covered, in a warm, draft-free area until almost completely covering the pan, about 30 minutes.<br> Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake until the rolls are puffed and brick red and the filling is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.

This will start to soften the couscous and you will see the water disappear as its soaks in. While the couscous is softening, we need to blacken the peppers. I do this by placing the peppers directly on the naked flame of my gas burner. If you don&#39;t have gas, then blacken under the grill. Both ways you need to blacken the peppers on all sides, so turn when need be. When fully blackened, place in a sandwich bag, wrap in plastic wrap or cover in a bowl for 5 minutes until cool. This will steam the skins and make peeling and deseeding easier. Remove the skins and seeds and roughly chop. On a very hot ridged grill pan, lightly char the asparagus and patty pans on both sides then toss them into the bowl of couscous with the peppers, spring onions, chilies and torn or chopped herbs. Mix well. Add the olive oil and lemon juice dressing and toss well. Finally, taste and season with salt and pepper and a couple of dribbles of red wine vinegar for a slight twang.

A makeshift couscousiera can be made by placing a colander over a similar-size pot and sealing the two together with simple dough to prevent steam from escaping. To make the dough: Combine 1 cup flour with enough water to create dough. Roll the dough into a long rope and use as a seal.<br> For the cous cous: Place half the durum wheat in a large bowl. Add splashes of water, salt, cinnamon, and extra-virgin olive oil, while stirring/raking the durum wheat in a circular motion with your hand. You should use approximately 1/2 the quantities of water, salt, cinnamon and extra-virgin olive oil at this point. Continue working in a circular motion, constantly stirring to moisten the grains evenly. Rub the mixture between your hands to remove any lumps that may form. If the mixture becomes too wet, add some more durum wheat, if it becomes too dry, add some more water. The mixture should form into small pellets. If you have not achieved small pellets, rub and rake some more. Add the remaining durum wheat, salt, cinnamon and extra-virgin olive oil and repeat the process above. Transfer the cous cous to a colander and embed the zest of 1 lemon in the cous cous. Rest the colander over a pot of boiling water. Let the cous cous steam for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. Serve with seafood, stewed meats and/or vegetables, or use as a base for Marilu&#39;s cous cous dessert recipe follows. Place the cooked cous cous, butter, sugar, pine nuts, raisins, almonds, hazelnuts, and water in a mixing bowl. Thoroughly combine all the ingredients. Cover the bowl and let rest for at least 1/2 an hour. Butter a ramekin to prevent sticking. Firmly pack some cous cous mixture in the ramekin and invert onto an individual dessert plate, so that the form of the cous cous is released from the ramekin. Sprinkle with icing sugar. Repeat for other individual plates and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 64110,&quot;Everything Seed Buns 1/2 cup whole milk 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one 1/4-ounce package) 2 tablespoons sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the bowl and plastic wrap 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the bowl and plastic wrap<br> 1 large egg yolk 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons poppy seeds 3 tablespoons sesame seeds 2 tablespoons dried garlic flakes 2 tablespoons dried onion flakes One 8-ounce block cream cheese, at room temperature 1 large egg 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 5 small scallions, whites and greens sliced 1 teaspoon lemon zest Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 small scallions, whites and greens sliced 3 small scallions, whites and greens sliced<br> Kosher salt Instructions: For the dough: Warm the milk and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan over low heat to about 100 degrees F (but no more than 110 degrees F). Remove the saucepan from the heat, and sprinkle the yeast over the liquid. Sprinkle a pinch of the sugar over the top, and set aside without stirring until foamy, about 5 minutes. Then whisk in the butter and egg yolk. Whisk together the flour, remaining sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon until you have a thick, slightly sticky dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Add the dough ball, turning to coat lightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, trace a circle the size of the dough on the plastic and note the time. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl, and knead briefly to release excess air. Re-form it into a ball, and return it to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap, and lay it on the dough. Cover the entire bowl tightly with the rest of the plastic, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight to let the dough proof. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the poppy seeds, sesame seeds, garlic flakes and onion flakes on a pie plate, and toast until lightly browned and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Mix the cream cheese, egg and flour in a small bowl until combined. Stir in the scallions, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. To fill and form the buns: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with the 2 tablespoons softened butter. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and press it flat. Roll the dough into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle, with a long side facing you. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on the side opposite you. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the toasted seed mix (for the topping), and scatter the rest over the filling. Starting from the side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight roll. Lightly brush the 1-inch border with water, and continue rolling to seal the roll. Fold the ends in just a bit, and if any spots look thicker than others, even out the roll with your hands. Cut the roll every 1 1/2 inches with a serrated knife, to make 12 buns. Place the buns cut-side down (except for the end pieces) in the prepared pan, spacing them 1 inch apart. Cover the buns loosely with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place to rise until they double in size with no gaps in between, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. For the topping: Stir the butter, reserved seed mix and scallions in a small bowl; set aside. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the buns until they&#39;re golden brown and the tops spring back when pressed lightly, 25 to 30 minutes. Spread the topping evenly over the buns, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and return to the oven until the butter is melted and the topping is fragrant, 5 minutes more. Let the buns cool in the pan for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64111,&quot;Green Curried Vegetables 2 carrots, peeled and sliced 2 potatoes, peeled and diced 1 cup broccoli florets 1 cup cauliflower florets 1 small zucchini, sliced 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 bunch cilantro, rinsed and coarsely chopped, about 1 cup Fresh ginger, 1-inch coarsely chopped 1 jalapeno, seeded 2 cloves garlic 1/2 cup chopped onion 1 tablespoon lime juice 1/2 cup chicken stock 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk Salt and pepper 2 carrots, peeled and sliced 2 potatoes, peeled and diced 1 cup broccoli florets 1 cup cauliflower florets 1 small zucchini, sliced 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 bunch cilantro, rinsed and coarsely chopped, about 1 cup Fresh ginger, 1-inch coarsely chopped 1 jalapeno, seeded 2 cloves garlic 1/2 cup chopped onion 1 tablespoon lime juice 1/2 cup chicken stock 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk Salt and pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and generously season with salt.

With a sharp knife on a solid surface, put the knife through the head of the lobsters to kill them instantly and then flip them over and split lengthwise down the middle, keeping the back of the shell intact. Remove the roe and tomalley and discard. Pull the claws off and remove the tail meat from the shell and set aside. Place the bodies on a baking sheet and broil the bodies until bright red, about 3 to 5 minutes, and set aside. In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the lobster claws for 5 minutes and cool to room temperature until ready to serve. In a large skillet over medium heat add the olive oil and lobster tail meat; cook until meat turns white, about 2 minutes. Add crabmeat and stir to combine. Add the shallots and garlic and cook for 1minute while shaking the pan to prevent burning. Remove the pan from the heat and add the brandy (the alcohol will ignite, so be careful) and return the pan to medium heat. Add the heavy cream and Dijon mustard and cook until reduced by half. Add the Parmesan and fold it in to melt. Add the chopped tarragon and season with salt and pepper. Stuff the mixture in the lobster shells and sprinkle the top with the bread crumbs.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low. BEAT egg yolks and orange juice in upper pan of double boiler with electric mixer on medium speed until mixture is thickened and doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. PLACE the upper pan over simmering water in lower pan of double boiler. (The water should not boil or touch the bottom of the upper pot. Whisk constantly or the eggs may begin to cook.) Gradually drizzle in butter, whisking until sauce is thickened and temperature reaches 160degreesF. Remove upper pan from heat. Whisk in marmalade, salt and cayenne pepper. Return to heat and heat through, stirring constantly. Serve over cooked asparagus or Eggs Benedict. TIP If a double boiler is not available, substitute a medium stainless steel bowl for the upper pan and a medium saucepan for the lower pan. Choose a bowl that has a diameter larger than that of the saucepan so that the bowl doesn&#39;t fall into the saucepan or touch the simmering water. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64114,&quot;All-Purpose, Foolproof Pickle Brine 1/2 cup white wine vinegar 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 bay leaf 1 cinnamon stick 1 clove garlic, lightly crushed 1 cup vegetables, such as green beans, cucumber slices or radish wedges Instructions: In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a simmer over medium heat with the vinegar, sugar, salt, coriander, allspice, bay leaf, cinnamon and garlic.

Put a baking sheet or pizza stone on the bottom rack. Combine the sugar with 4 cups of the blueberries in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, crushing up the berries with a wooden spoon to release their juices, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick and reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour and the remaining 2 cups blueberries. Transfer to a bowl and cool completely, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, fit one of the pie crusts into a 9-inch pie plate and fold and crimp the edges as desired. Refrigerate while you wait for the filling to cool. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Cut out as many stars as you can from the second pie crust. Arrange on the baking sheet. Bake on the upper rack until golden, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Stir the cooled filling once and pour into the dough-lined pie plate; spread it out into an even layer. Place the pie on the preheated baking sheet, turn the oven down to 375 degrees F and bake until the crust in golden and the edge of the filling is bubbly, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool. Press the stars into the filling, standing them up slightly.

Add the dried onion, cayenne, cumin, oregano, paprika, salt and pepper and mix together. For the salmon: Spoon the rub onto the salmon fillets on both sides and rub in. (Don&#39;t do this more than 5 minutes ahead of cooking or it will start to affect the fish and soften it.) Heat a large pan over high heat, add the olive oil and heat until very hot. Add the salmon fillets skin-side down. Cook on high until the flesh turns opaque about halfway up the side of the fillets, about 5 minutes. Cover with a lid or an inverted frying pan. Turn the heat off and leave it for 5 minutes; the heat and steam will cook the top of the fish so it will be crisp on the bottom and cooked through. For the salad: Meanwhile, add the arugula and spinach to a bowl. Add the red onion to the center and scatter the fennel and fronds around the edges of the bowl. Drizzle the balsamic only on the red onion. Sprinkle the rest of the salad with salt and pepper and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss everything together. Add a heap of salad to 2 plates and top each with a salmon fillet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 64118,&quot;How to Make Homemade Peanut Butter | Homemade Peanut Butter 15 ounces shelled and skinned AB&#39;s Roasted Peanuts, recipe follows 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons honey 1 1/2 tablespoons peanut oil 2 pounds in-shell raw peanuts (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons peanut oil 1 to 2 tablespoons kosher salt Instructions: Place the peanuts, salt and honey into the bowl of a food processor. Process for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Place the lid back on and continue to process while slowly drizzling in the oil and process until the mixture is smooth, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Place the peanut butter in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse the peanuts under cool water to remove excess dirt. Pat dry and place in a large bowl and toss with the peanut oil and salt until well coated. Place on 2 half sheet pans, making sure to spread them out into a single layer. Roast in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through cooking. Once you remove the peanuts from the oven, let them cool slightly before eating. They will continue to \cook\ and become crunchy as they cool. If using peanuts to make peanut butter, remove shells and discard. Remove the skin by rubbing the peanuts together in your hands held over a salad spinner, allowing the peanuts and skins to fall into the bowl. Once the skin has been loosened from all of the peanuts close the salad spinner and spin until all of the skin has been separated from the peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64119,&quot;Lemon Cream Cupcakes 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks unsalted) butter, softened 1 1/2 cups sugar 6 large eggs 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 1/4 cups cake flour or all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 3/4 cup cream cheese, softened Confectioners&#39; sugar for dusting (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Pour into a spice grinder and process until powdered. In a small food processor or blender, combine the toasted spice mix and the rest of the wet masala ingredients. Process until smooth. Place a large (preferably nonstick) pot over high heat and add the oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the onions and serrano pepper. Stirring frequently, saute the onions until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Don&#39;t let them burn! Turn the heat down to medium-high if they&#39;re starting to burn. Add the ground wet masala, taking care because it will sizzle wildly and steam up your glasses, if you wear them. Stir quite vigorously and turn down the heat if it&#39;s bubbling too furiously. Don&#39;t wash the food processor bowl yet. Keep stirring, with short pauses, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the masala comes together as one mass, about 2 minutes. Also, you may see little droplets of oil on the perimeter of the masala. That&#39;s a good sign! Quickly add the meat and stir, coating the meat in the masala. Stir and cook about 5 minutes until the meat browns. Remember that dirty food processor bowl? Fill it with 1 cup of hot water (from the tap is fine), swirl it around so it picks up any leftover masala, and pour that into the pot. Add salt and pepper, stir, bring the curry to a boil, and then turn it down to a simmer. Cover and cook 30 minutes. Then cook with the lid ajar for another 10 minutes to thicken the gravy slightly. Check the meat at the end of the cooking time; it should be tender and not chewy at all. Adjust the salt if you like, and serve over rice or with chapatis (whole wheat griddle bread). Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. Save what you don&#39;t use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It&#39;s a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64124,&quot;Pluot Galettes with Apple Mint and Calvados-Laced Whipped Cream 1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 10 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1/4 to 1/3 cup ice water<br> 1/4 cup almonds, ground in a food processor<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling on the pluots 2 1/2 to 3 pounds pluots (not too soft, not too firm), pitted and sliced<br> 2 tablespoons chopped apple mint 2 eggs, beaten, for egg wash<br> Coarse turbinado sugar, for sprinkling One 8-ounce jar plum preserves 1 cup heavy whipping cream Superfine sugar, for sprinkling Dash of calvados<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Remove to a counter and knead a couple times. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the fridge and cut into four pieces. Roll out into 10-inch rounds on floured parchment paper and slide onto parchment-lined baking sheets. In a small mixing bowl, stir together the ground almonds, granulated sugar and the remaining 3 tablespoons flour. Sprinkle the mixture over the pastry rounds. In a medium mixing bowl, sprinkle the sliced pluots with some granulated sugar and half of the apple mint and toss. Place the pluots in the middle of each pastry round and gently fold the pastry up and around the fruit. Brush the top and edges of the dough with some egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Dot the pluots pieces of the 2 tablespoons butter. Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the bottom is cooked through. While the galettes are baking, melt the plum preserves in a small saucepot, just to soften. Brush the melted preserves on the crusts as soon as the galettes come out of the oven, and sprinkle with the remaining apple mint. Whip the cream with an electric mixer.

Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly grease the foil with olive oil. Remove the pizza dough from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. In a small bowl combine the garlic, Parmesan, parsley and 1/4 cup olive oil. Set aside. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll out the pizza dough into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle. Arrange the dough with the 14-inch side parallel to you. With a ruler, mark every 4 inches along the 12-inch side. Cut the dough straight across at the marks to make three 4-inch-wide strips. Brush top of the strips with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Shingle the pepperoni slices over the dough strips. Sprinkle 3/4 to 1 cup of the mozzarella in a line down the center of each strip. Roll up each dough strip into a long log, as you would for cinnamon rolls. It is easiest to begin by folding the bottom of the dough up over the cheese; if there is any cheese sticking out, stuff it back into the roll. Continue rolling the dough over itself until it forms a log with dough on the outside and all of the pepperoni and mozzarella on the inside. Pinch the seams together, then pinch the sides together. Lightly brush the logs all over with olive oil and transfer them, seam-side down, to the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 12 minutes. Brush the tops of the logs generously with the garlic mixture and return to the oven for another 3 minutes, until the garlic is very fragrant but not yet browned. Let cool for 10 minutes. Transfer the pepperoni rolls to a cutting board and slice into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Serve immediately with marinara sauce. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a medium saucepot. Add the onions and salt and saute until softened, 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook an additional 30 seconds until fragrant but not browned. Stir in the tomato paste, oregano and crushed red pepper; cook 30 seconds to toast the tomato paste and spices. Stir in the chopped tomatoes. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Keep warm until ready to serve, or cool completely and refrigerate in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 64150,&quot;Guid-Moc-Shoe 3 fresh corn on the cob, preferably white, with husk 1 red bell pepper, diced 1 green bell pepper, diced 1/4 pound bacon, diced 1 red onion, diced 1 yellow onion, diced 1/2 jalapeno, diced 3 celery stalks, diced 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup white wine 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken stock 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup Roma tomatoes, diced Instructions: Lightly oil the corn and slightly roast on a grill or grill pan.

Fill each boat with a small scoop of lemon sorbet and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 64195,&quot;Alcapurias 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon annatto seeds 1 pound yautia (root vegetable), peeled and chopped 1 medium green plantain peeled and chopped 2 teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons sofrito, (recommended my brand Sofrito, alternatively, Goya Sofrito) 1 pound ground beef 1/2 packet Latin seasoning mix (recommended: Sazon) 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 cup beef stock, (recommended, boxed organic) 1/2 cup raisins, soaked in dark Puerto Rican rum Oil, for frying Instructions: In a small saucepan heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil with the annatto seeds until the olive oil changes color; it should be a mild orange/red. Strain and set aside. Using a food processor, process the yautia and green plantain on medium speed until nice and smooth; add the salt and strained annatto oil. Now you have a fresh masa; place in the refrigerator. Preheat a large Dutch oven on medium-high heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and sofrito. Stir-fry for 1 minute and add the ground beef. Brown the beef and add the Latin seasoning mix, garlic powder, onion powder and oregano mixing well. Add the beef stock and simmer on medium-low for 10 minutes. Remove the beef from the heat, strain the raisins and add them to the beef mixture mixing well. Set aside to cool. Remove the masa from the refrigerator and using 1 to 2 tablespoons (depending on how large you want them) scoop out of the bowl and into the palm of your water moistened hand patting into a round disk to prepare it for the filling (the masa can be a little too pliable; if you notice that you can&#39;t form a round disk, place the masa in the refrigerator to firm it up before proceeding). Add a teaspoon or more of beef mixture to the center of the masa and using a patting motion (as if you were making a snow ball) pat the masa around the beef to form a ball being very careful not to let the beef stick out of the plantain. Continue forming the balls until both mixtures are finished. Leftovers of either can be saved for your next meal (I&#39;ll show you what to do with them in a future recipe). Preheat a large Dutch oven on high and add enough oil to comfortably fry the Alcapurias (about 2 to 3 cups). (Heat the oil to 350 degrees F if you are frying them fresh; if frozen, lower the temperature to 325 degrees F.) When the oil has reached the desired temperature, carefully add the alcapurias 1 at a time making sure not to crowd the pan. Remove and drain on a thick bed of paper towels; transfer to a cooling rack once drained and store in a warm oven until you have completed frying them all. To serve: Alcapurias can be placed on a dish and passed around to your guests or on a serving platter and placed on your buffet. They do not require a sauce, topping or dip of any kind.

Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over high heat and cook, without stirring, until amber brown, about 8 minutes. Slowly whisk in the warm cream, blackberry puree and liqueur and cook until smooth and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Let come to room temperature. French Toast: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put a baking sheet in the oven. Whisk together the eggs, sugar and salt in a large baking dish until smooth. Add the pumpkin puree, ground spices, milk, 1/4 cup of the heavy cream, vanilla and rum and whisk until smooth. Put 4 slices of the bread in the custard mixture and let sit for 2 minutes.

Add the butter and pulse until it resembles coarse sand with some pea-size pieces of butter, about 20 pulses. Add the cream cheese and sour cream and pulse until it comes together in a rough dough, with some uneven pebble-size pieces. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and divide into four equal portions. Pat each portion into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze for 15 minutes. For the filling: Meanwhile, chop the hazelnuts in a clean food processor. Add the preserves, raisins and salt and puree to make a very smooth paste. Roll a portion of dough into a 6- by 14-inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. (Don&#39;t worry about slightly rough edges; these will be rolled inside of the rugelach.) Spread one-quarter of the filling over the surface with a small spatula. Starting with a long side, roll the dough up into a tight cylinder, ending with the seam on the bottom. Press the top slightly to flatten and wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze for another 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. (The cylinders can be frozen for up to a month.) Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and evenly position the racks. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Slice the cylinders into 1 1/2-inch pieces and place seam-side down on the prepared sheets. Whisk the egg yolks together and brush over the tops.

Add the cherries, simmer 1 minute and turn off the heat. Soak the cherries in the warm mixture until they plump up, about 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Set a heat-proof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Place the chocolate and the butter into the bowl and let it sit over the heat until the chocolate begins to melt. Stir to combine and continue to heat until the mixture is smooth and the chocolate is completely melted. Remove from the heat. In a large bowl, beat together the whole eggs, yolks and sugar until the mixture turns light and thick. Pour the melted chocolate into the egg mixture. Beat in the flour until just combined. Do not over-mix the batter. Butter 6 (4-ounce) ramekins. Sprinkle each ramekin with 1 teaspoon cocoa powder and tap out the excess. Divide the batter among the ramekins. Drain the cherries and put a few cherries into the center of each ramekin. Use a spoon to push the batter over the cherries to cover them. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 7 to 9 minutes. The outside of the desserts will be set, but the centers will be soft. To serve, invert each mold on a plate and let sit for 10 seconds. Slowly lift one side of the mold and the cake will fall out. (If the cakes won&#39;t easily come out, just serve them right in the cups.) DB note: These little desserts are easy to make ahead. Refrigerate them in the baking cups and when you&#39;re ready to bake, bring them up to room temperature and bake as above. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 64219,&quot;Creme Fraiche and Macadamia Nut Terrine 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup butter 1/2 cup dark rum 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 cup creme fraiche 5 large egg yolks 5 large egg whites, beaten to stiff peaks 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted 4 ounces chopped macadamia nuts 4 ounces cold butter 8 ounces brown sugar 4 ounces all purpose flour 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup creme fraiche 3 tablespoons pure vanilla extract 12 egg yolks 6 eggs 1 lemon, juiced 2 vanilla beans, scraped 13 ounces confectioners&#39; (powdered sugar) Instructions: For the Caramel Cake: Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Peel off and discard any onion skin. Trim the root end of the onion to remove any hair or dirt. Put the onion on a cutting board root-end up. Leaving 1/2 inch uncut around the root end, make 4 vertical cuts evenly spaced around the onion. Continuing this action, make 3 cuts in each quadrant of the onion to create 16 \petals\ evenly spaced around the onion root. Put the onion stem-side up in a medium bowl and sprinkle with some salt and pepper. Mix the buttermilk and hot sauce in a measuring cup and pour over top of the onion. Allow the onion to rest in the buttermilk mixture for 30 minutes. For the dipping sauce: Meanwhile, whisk together the mayonnaise, horseradish, mustard, lemon juice and Cajun seasoning in a small mixing bowl. Set aside. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) For the breading: Use a mixing bowl that is wide enough to accommodate the onion blossom, and be sure to have a plate that fits over the bowl. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, dried parsley, Cajun seasoning and ground mustard. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper. Pour the vegetable oil into a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot. Preheat the oil to 375 degrees F over medium-high heat (the oil will drop in temperature when the onion is added, so adjust the heat as needed to maintain 360 degrees F). Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Remove the onion from the buttermilk mixture and allow any excess to drip off. Crack the eggs into the buttermilk mixture and whisk to combine. Place the onion into the seasoned flour, root-end up. Put the plate on top of the bowl to cover the opening, then invert the bowl and plate, holding them together and gently shaking to ensure that the onion is evenly coated in the seasoned flour. Invert again right-side up and remove the plate. Lift the onion out and shake to remove any excess flour. Place the onion into the egg mixture root-side down, being sure that it is fully submerged. Remove the onion and allow any excess liquid to drip off. Place the onion back into the seasoned flour and repeat the shaking process for a second time to ensure that all petals are evenly breaded. Carefully lower the breaded onion, root-side down, into oil. Fry until evenly golden brown and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes. Lift the onion out of the hot oil and place on the lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64231,&quot;Instant Pot Beef Pho 6 pounds small mixed beef bones, such as shin or marrow 1 pound brisket Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large piece ginger (about 5 ounces), halved lengthwise 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 4 cinnamon sticks 3 star anise pods 2 medium yellow onions, halved lengthwise 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled<br> 1 pound sirloin beef 1/2 cup fish sauce, plus more if needed<br> 1 tablespoon sugar 12 ounces flat rice noodles, cooked according to package instructions and kept warm 2 to 3 cups fresh mung bean sprouts 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced<br> 1 small jalape?o, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced<br> 1 small bunch fresh Thai basil, separated into sprigs 1 lime, cut into 8 wedges Hoisin sauce, for serving Sriracha, for serving Instructions: For the pho: Add the beef bones to a 6-quart Instant Pot?, then nestle the brisket on top of the bones.

Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 1 hour 30 minutes (it will take about 30 minutes for the pot to come to pressure). Meanwhile, put the sirloin in the freezer so that it partially freezes and will be easier to slice.<br> After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for natural release. After 20 minutes, being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid.<br> Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and allow to cool slightly. Set a large colander over a large stockpot, then use a slotted spoon to transfer most of the bones and vegetables to the colander. Use 2 kitchen towels to carefully remove the pot and pour the stock into the colander. Use the slotted spoon to press down on the bones and vegetables to extract as much flavor as possible, then discard.<br> Clean out the pot if needed, then return it and pour the stock back in. Skim the fat from the stock, if desired. Add enough water so that the stock comes halfway up the pot. Stir in the fish sauce and sugar, then turn to high saute and allow the stock to come to a boil. Once the stock is at a boil, taste it for seasoning and add more fish sauce if needed.<br> Meanwhile, thinly slice the brisket against the grain. Slice the sirloin very thinly against the grain.<br> Divide the warm rice noodles among 4 to 6 large bowls and sprinkle the noodles with freshly ground black pepper. Divide the brisket among the bowls and top with overlapping slices of sirloin. Top each bowl with 2 to 3 cups of hot stock. For the toppings: Serve immediately with the mung bean sprouts, red onion, jalape?o, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and sriracha, allowing your guests to dress their bowls of pho as they wish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64232,&quot;Jerk Chicken and Dumplings 3 whole chicken legs and 3 wings 1 head garlic 1 (3 to 4-inch) piece ginger, peeled 1 tablespoon Jerk seasoning Canola oil, for frying 1/2 sweet red bell pepper, seeded 3 small carrots 2 green onions 3 stalks celery with leaves 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 3/4 cup Jamaican Ginger Beer Dash ground cinnamon 3 Kaffir lime leaves 1 to 2 tablespoons or a nub of butter 2 limes Crunch Fried Dumplings, recipe follows Vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cornmeal 2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoon cold butter, cubed 1 1/4 cups milk Instructions: Cut the chicken legs into pieces - thighs, drumsticks, wings, and drop into a bowl. Peel and rough chop the garlic, and add to a large bowl. Rough slice the ginger into long thin slices, and add to the bowl. Toss in the chicken pieces and mix together. Add a good tablespoon or two of your favorite jerk seasoning spice rub into the bowl, and mix with your hands to coat the chicken really well. Cover the bowl, and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Put a large pan on high heat. Add a good layer of oil (a little more than just coating the pan). When the oil is hot enough, add the chicken. You should hear a sizzle as the meat hits the pan. Let the chicken pieces brown for about 5 to 6 minutes on one side. Then gently flip them over, and place the pan in the oven for about 10 more minutes of roasting, to make sure the chicken pieces are cooked through. Julienne the bell pepper, carrots, green onions and celery, and drop into a large mixing bowl. Add the cilantro. When the chicken comes out of oven, remove the chicken from pan, and set aside. Put the pan over medium heat, and pour the ginger beer into the pan to deglaze it, stirring up all the brown bits. Add the cinnamon and Kaffir lime leaves, and let simmer for a couple of minutes, and then add the butter, and stir in. Toss the chicken pieces with the vegetables, and the juice of a lime. Plate up in a mound, and drizzle the sauce over top, and place 2 or 3 fried dumplings on the side. Add a couple of lime wedges, for garnish. Pour 1/2 to 1-inch of vegetable oil into a heavy-bottom saucepan, and heat until sizzling hot. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Work in the cold butter with your hands, rubbing the butter bits into the flour, breaking them up and aiming for small pea-size pieces. Add the milk to make a loose dough that will barely hold its shape without running off a spoon. Drop by large spoonful into the hot oil, and fry about 3 minutes per side, or until nicely browned but not too dark. When you bite into it the crust should be crunchy but the inside soft and tender. Serve the warm dumplings beside the Jerk Chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 64233,&quot;Ginger Sugar Cookies with Vanilla Royal Icing 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons ground ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br> 2 large eggs<br> 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 3 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons meringue powder<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Gel food coloring, for decorating Instructions: For the sugar dough: Whisk together the flour, ginger, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Beat together the vanilla and eggs in a small bowl. Beat together the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to low, slowly pour in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, increasing the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters themselves as needed. Once all the flour mixture is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide into 2 pieces. Shape each piece into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. To roll, cut and bake the cookies: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Dust another sheet of parchment with flour and put 1 piece of dough on top. Dust with more flour and top with another sheet of parchment. Roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick (about 11 by 9 inches) and place in the freezer for 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough. Cut out cookies from one of the dough pieces using a 3-inch cutter. Arrange the cookies about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Refrigerate while you cut the remaining cookies. Reroll and cut any scraps of dough. If the dough becomes very soft and difficult to roll or cut at any point during the process, place on a baking sheet in the freezer for 5 minutes. Bake, rotating the baking sheets front to back and bottom to top about halfway through, until golden brown around the edges, about 12 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes. For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add the vanilla and 3 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water, if needed. Color the icing as desired with gel food coloring. Fit pastry bags with small round tips and fill with the icing. Decorate the cookies as desired and let dry for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64234,&quot;Caramel Apple Dessert Nachos 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> Zest from 1/2 lemon plus 1 teaspoon lemon juice<br> 10 caramels, unwrapped 2 Granny Smith apples, sliced<br> 1 Gala apple, sliced<br> 2 teaspoons sprinkles<br> 1 cup potato chips, crumbled, optional<br> Instructions: Mix the cream cheese, brown sugar and lemon zest and juice in a bowl until smooth.

Melt the butter over low heat in a medium (10-inch) saute pan. Add the olive oil, garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and cook over low heat for one minute. Off the heat, zest one of the lemons directly into the butter mixture. Meanwhile, arrange the shrimp snugly in one layer in a large (12-inch) round ovenproof saut pan (or 10 13-inch baking dish) with only the tails overlapping. Pour the butter mixture over the shrimp. Sprinkle with the sea salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Slice the ends off the zested lemon, cut five (1/4-inch-thick) slices, and tuck them among the shrimp. Roast for 12 to 15 minutes, just until the shrimp are firm, pink, and cooked through. Cut the remaining lemon in half and squeeze the juice onto the shrimp. Serve hot with the toasted bread for dipping into the garlic butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 64252,&quot;Chocolate Cookie Cheesecake 1 1/2 (9-ounce) packages chocolate wafer cookies 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly 3 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature 1/2 cup powdered sugar 14 ounces milk chocolate, at least 35 per cent cocoa solids 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 4 ounces white chocolate Heavy cream, to serve Instructions: Put the cookies into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until crumbled. Add the butter and pulse until well combined. Scrape the crumbs into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Using the bottom of an 8-inch cake pan, press down very hard all the way around so that the crumbs are flat and even. Put the cream cheese and sugar into a bowl and mix together gently, this will take only a few turns of the spoon. Melt the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water, or you can do this in the microwave. Pour a quarter of the chocolate into a small bowl, add the oil, set aside and keep warm.<br> Now add a large dollop of the cream cheese mixture into the large bowl of chocolate and stir well to combine. Add another dollop of cream cheese mixture to the chocolate mixture and stir to combine. Keep adding the cream cheese mixture, one dollop at a time, and mixing it like mad until the chocolate mixture begins to look uniform, smooth and silky. At this point, add the remaining cream cheese mixture into the chocolate mixture and mix together until it is completely incorporated.<br> Pour the mixture on top of the biscuit base and use the back of a large spoon to smooth the top. Press it down well so there are no gaps. Put the cheesecake in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes, or the freezer for 10 minutes, until the chocolate top is beginning to firm up a little. It won&#39;t be totally hard, but it will begin to feel a bit tacky.<br> Five minutes before the cheesecake is ready, melt the white chocolate and make sure the milk chocolate is nice and runny. You can warm it in a microwave for 20 seconds if it has hardened. Now remove the cheesecake from the fridge and, acting quickly, pour the milk chocolate over the top, spreading it out as you go until the top is completely covered. For a smooth finish, pick up the cheesecake and tilt it back and forth, letting the chocolate run over and cover the cream cheese filling. Now drizzle white chocolate lines across the top about 1/2-inch apart. The neatest way to do this is by putting the chocolate into a piping bag fitted with a very small nozzle. Place the cheesecake so the lines are running towards you, then take a toothpick and drag it from left to right, 1/2-inch apart so you have a grid. Then drag the toothpick from right to left between the lines that you have just made. You will need to do this quite quickly so the chocolate lines are still runny.<br> Leave the cheesecake in a cool place to set for about 2 hours.<br> When you are ready to serve, run a knife around the inside of the pan and remove the outside of the pan. Serve in wedges with a drizzle of heavy cream. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 64253,&quot;Baby Spinach Salad with Black Eyed Peas, Lardons, and Pecan-Vinaigrette 1 cup black eyed peas, soaked in cold water overnight Chicken stock or water, to cover 1/2 medium white onion, halved 1 bay leaf 1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns 1/2 pound slab bacon or thick cut (cut into 1/4-inch strips or \lardons) 1 tablespoon chopped shallots 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1/2 cup canola oil 1/4 cup toasted pecan pieces, finely chopped, plus 1/3 cup 1/4 cup pecan oil or other nut oil 1 pound baby spinach, washed and dried Instructions: In a saucepan, put the peas and cover with chicken stock or water.

Cut the crusts off the bread and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. You should have about 3 1/2 cups of cubes. Arrange on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully to make sure they do not brown too much; set aside to cool. Leave the oven on. In a saucepan, heat the half-and-half, cream, salt, and vanilla bean over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse 10 to 15 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together. Whisking constantly, gradually add the hot cream mixture. Strain into a large bowl to smooth the mixture and remove the vanilla bean. Add the bread cubes, toss well and let soak until absorbed. Fold the mixture occasionally to ensure even soaking. In a small saucepan, heat the orange juice to a simmer. Add the cranberries and simmer until plumped and softened, about 5 minutes. Drain and reserve 1/4 cup for garnish. Fold in remaining 3/4 cup of cranberries into bread pudding mixture. Divide the mixture among 6 ramekins, custard cups, or dessert cups, (or use a deep baking dish). Divide the soaked bread among the dishes, then pour any remaining custard over the bread. Dot with remaining cranberries. Arrange the puddings in a hot water bath. Bake until set and golden brown on top, about 30 minutes for individual puddings and 40 to 45 minutes for 1 large pudding. Serve warm or chilled, dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 64256,&quot;Chicken, Roasted Pepper, and Pesto Sandwich Basil Pesto, recipe follows 8 slices toasted bread Marinated Chicken Breast, recipe follows 4 jarred roasted peppers, sliced into strips 2 cups packed fresh basil leaves 2 cloves garlic 1/4 cup pine nuts 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino cheese 1 to 2 tablespoons vinegar, like cider, balsamic or red wine 2 to 3 teaspoons dried herbs, like thyme, oregano, rosemary or crumbled bay leaf 1 to 2 tablespoons mustard, whole grain or Dijon 1 to 2 teaspoon garlic or onion powder, optional 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 boneless, skinless chicken breast, each about 6 ounces Instructions: Spread 1 tablespoon Basil Pesto on 1 side of each slice of bread.

Place butter and sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer and beat until light in color. Add the red food coloring, egg and milk and beat to combine. Proceed with recipe and chill for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle a work surface and rolling pin with confectioner&#39;s sugar and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move dough frequently to prevent it from sticking and add more confectioner&#39;s sugar to the work surface and rolling pin as needed. With a 2 1/2-by-3-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut 36 hearts, re-rolling dough as needed. Place at least 1 inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets, and bake until cookies are set but not brown, about 7-8 minutes. Let cool on the pan slightly before transferring to a rack to cool completely. To make striped Valentine hearts, transfer half of the melted chocolate to a disposable pastry bag, twist the end closed, and using scissors, snip a very small opening in the tip. Starting at the bottom of the cookie, apply gentle pressure to the pastry bag and drizzle lines of chocolate back and forth over the cookie, moving up as the chocolate flows. Allow chocolate to set before eating or packaging. To make polka-dot Valentine hearts, color the remaining chocolate with pink food coloring to the desired shade of pink. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag, twist the end closed, and using scissors, snip a very small opening in the tip. Hold the pastry bag perpendicular to the cookie and apply gentle pressure to pipe a dot of chocolate. Release the pressure on the bag until the flow stops, and continue over the surface of the cookie, piping different sized dots, if desired. Gently tap the cookie to settle the chocolate and allow to set before eating or packaging. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Place butter and sugar in large bowl of electric stand mixer and beat until light in color. Add egg and milk and beat to combine. Put mixer on low speed, gradually add flour, and beat until mixture pulls away from the side of the bowl. Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle surface where you will roll out dough with powdered sugar. Remove 1 wrapped pack of dough from refrigerator at a time, sprinkle rolling pin with powdered sugar, and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move the dough around and check underneath frequently to make sure it is not sticking. If dough has warmed during rolling, place cold cookie sheet on top for 10 minutes to chill. Cut into desired shape, place at least 1-inch apart on greased baking sheet, parchment, or silicone baking mat, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until cookies are just beginning to turn brown around the edges, rotating cookie sheet halfway through baking time. Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes after removal from oven and then move to complete cooling on wire rack. Serve as is or ice as desired. Store in airtight container for up to 1 week.

Melt the chocolate and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat; stirring frequently until smooth. Stir in the sugar, cocoa powder and salt until all of the lumps are gone. Remove from the heat and let cool for a few minutes. Meanwhile, beat the egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until they form stiff peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the egg yolks into the cooled chocolate mixture, then stir in about a quarter of the whipped egg whites. Scrape this lightened chocolate mixture into the remaining whipped egg whites and gently fold until mostly combined (it&#39;s ok if there are some streaks of egg white). Pour into the prepared pan and bake until the center of the cake no longer wiggles, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan, on a wire rack (the cake will deflate slightly). Unlock the pan and dust the top of the cake with some cocoa powder.

Set aside to cool, then refrigerate until ready to use. In a saucepan, heat the cream, half-and-half, and vanilla bean over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture does not scorch on the bottom. When it reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat and set aside to infuse 10 to 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining 3/4 cup sugar. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the still-hot cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F, it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you do not have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Meanwhile, half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Strain the mixture into a smaller bowl to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Whisk in the orange zest. Rest the smaller bowl in the ice water and let the mixture cool, stirring often, then continue according to the directions of your ice cream maker. Put a large mixing bowl in the freezer to chill. When the ice cream is finished, transfer it to the frozen bowl. Using a sturdy rubber spatula, fold in the blueberry mixture until swirled.

Let cook for 5 minutes. While the cider is simmering, peel and core the apples and pears. Cut the apples into eighths and the pears into quarters or thick lengthwise slices and toss with the lemon juice. Add the apples, pears, prunes, raisins, and brown sugar to the simmering cider and return to a simmer. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook until the fruits are very soft and tender but not falling apart, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring very gently so as to not break up the fruit. As the pieces of fruit become very tender, use a slotted spoon to transfer the pieces 1 by 1 to a 9 by 13-inch casserole. When all of the fruit is tender and has been transferred to the casserole, increase the heat to high and cook the cider mixture at a boil until reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the brandy and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat and pour the hot cider mixture over the fruit in the casserole. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Place chiles in a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade and puree. With the motor running, drizzle in oil until creamy emulsion is formed. Pour over shrimp in bowl and mix thoroughly to coat shrimp. Cover bowl and refrigerate for 12 hours. Soak 12 bamboo skewers in water 30 minutes. Preheat grill to moderately high. Lay 6 to 7 shrimp on board in front of you, nestled together and flat, with tails all facing one direction and heads the other. Holding shrimp flat with the palm of one hand, insert one bamboo skewer one third of the way from one end. Insert another skewer parallel to the first, one third of the way from the other end, so as to create a flat panel of shrimp that can be turned easily. Repeat with remaining shrimp and skewers to form 6 skewers in all. Season each side of shrimp with pepper (the marinade is already salted). Brush grill well and wipe with oiled paper towel. Place shrimp skewers and grill 12 minutes per side until done. The center shrimp should be just opaque. Remove from grill and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 64313,&quot;Beet-Pickled Hungarian Deviled Eggs 8 large eggs, straight from the refrigerator 3 cups pickled beet juice (from about 2 jars pickled beets) 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons sour cream<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, plus dill sprigs for garnish 1 tablespoon white vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons prepared horseradish, drained<br> 2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard<br> 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika, plus more for garnish 1/3 English cucumber, unpeeled, seedy center discarded, minced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the beet-pickled eggs: Put the cold eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Heat the water to a boil, then cover the saucepan and remove it from the heat. Let stand for 12 minutes. Drain the eggs and rinse with cold water. Let the eggs cool a bit, then peel them while they are still warm (eggs are much easier to peel when warm). Place the hard-boiled eggs in a bowl or storage container and pour the pickling brine from the beet jars over the eggs, making sure the eggs are submerged. (You may need to place a weight or a plate on top.) Allow the eggs to sit for 45 minutes to 1 hour in the brine, but no longer or they&#39;ll start to get rubbery. For the sweet Hungarian filling: Mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, dill, vinegar, horseradish, mustard, paprika and cucumber. Season with salt and black pepper. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise. Gently remove the yolks by pressing your thumb against the back of each yolk to pop it out of the white. Add the yolks to the bowl with the filling and mash with a fork until smooth. Season with salt. Spoon the filling into the egg whites, or use a re-sealable plastic bag to pipe it in. Sprinkle with paprika and dill before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 64314,&quot;Salmon and Cod Fishcakes 6 large potatoes cut into quarters Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 stick butter, divided 1 pound salmon 1 pound cod 3 tablespoons olive oil, for dipping fish 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, for dipping fish 2 shallots, finely chopped 4 scallions, finely chopped Handful chives, parsley, fennel and dill, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 red cl, seeded and finely chopped Flour 3 tablespoons sunflower oil, for frying Parsley sprigs and lemon slices, for garnish Serving suggestion: green salad Instructions: Bring the potatoes to the boil, adding a pinch of salt.

Add the onions, bell peppers and thyme, season with salt and pepper and cook until softened, about 15 minutes. Add the corned beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, another 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve. For the tempura poached egg: Fill a high-sided pan halfway with canola oil and heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Mix the flour, seltzer and egg yolk together in a bowl. Mix in some salt and pepper and set aside. Preheat the broiler. Bring a saucepan of water to a simmer and add the vinegar. Crack each egg into a separate small bowl, turn off the heat under the saucepan and immediately slide each individual egg into the water, allowing the whites to congeal around the yolks. Cover for 3 minutes, then remove the eggs with a slotted spoon, letting the water drain off. Dip the eggs directly in the batter, and then transfer them immediately to the hot oil. Fry the eggs for 30 seconds; remove to a plate. To serve, sprinkle your English muffin halves with some Cheddar and place under the broiler until melted. Cover each melty side with some of the hash and put an egg on top. Not too much more to say except, knife and fork! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]</p><p>&quot; 64336,&quot;Spicy Fava Bean Fritters with Lemon Minted Yogurt 2.2 pounds fresh fava beans, in their pods (about 2/3 pound shelled weight) or 1 pound defrosted fava beans, skinned 6 sprigs fresh cilantro 1 bunch fresh mint Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 level teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 fresh red cl, seeded and finely sliced 1 lemon, zest and juiced 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 4 cups vegetable oil 1 small piece potato, peeled, optional 4 tablespoons plain yogurt A few handfuls mixed crunchy salad leaves, washed and spun dry Extra-virgin olive oil Pickled chiles, to serve Instructions: These fritters make a delicious snack. They not only taste awesome but they look amazing - dark and crunchy on the outside, bright green and soft inside! They&#39;re simple to make, and the spiciness just makes them work. This dish is best made with early season, fresh-as-a-daisy, pastel-green fava beans. Or you can use frozen fava beans - simply defrost them and pinch off the skins. Boil any larger white-skinned fava beans for 30 seconds, then drain. When cool, pinch their skins off - they&#39;ll taste less bitter if you do this. Now whiz the cilantro and half the mint in a food processor. Season with salt and pepper, and then add the spices, cl, fava beans and lemon zest and whiz until finely chopped (stopping once or twice to scrape the mixture off the sides). Sprinkle in the flour and pulse for a few seconds. Don&#39;t add any more flour or the mixture will become too dry. Get a large saucepan and pour in the vegetable oil until it&#39;s 2 to 3 inches deep. Be careful - keep kids and pets away, and make sure the handle isn&#39;t sticking out so you don&#39;t accidentally catch it and spill the hot oil. Heat the oil. To check whether it&#39;s hot enough for frying, drop in the piece of potato - as soon as it sizzles and floats to the top, you&#39;re in business. Remove the potato and discard it. Cover a plate with a sheet of waxed paper. Scoop up a small amount of the fava bean mixture and either use your hands or 2 spoons to shape it into little rounds, then put them onto the plate. When they&#39;re all done, carefully lower 1of them into the hot oil with a slotted spoon and fry until crispy brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with paper towels. When you&#39;ve got the hang of it, fry the rest of them - they should all fit into the pan at the same time but, if not, simply do in batches. For the lemon minted yogurt, squeeze half the lemon juice into the yogurt. Pick and chop the rest of your the leaves and stir them in, adding salt and pepper, to taste. Dress your salad leaves with a squeeze of lemon juice and some olive oil. Sprinkle the fritters with salt and serve with the lemon minted yogurt, the dressed salad leaves and some pickled chilies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 64337,&quot;Spicy Meatloaf Sandwich 1 pound grass-fed ground beef 1 cup your favorite spicy salsa or Mexican tomato sauce 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 egg 1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped 2 tablespoons ketchup 4 brioche rolls Grilled pickled jalapenos Bacon Tomato slices Cole slaw Sriracha Mayo (equal parts mayonnaise and Sriracha and 1 squeeze of lime juice) Blue cheese Pimento cheese And we always top with green onions. We love the color and the crunch! Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, mix the beef, salsa, breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire, salt, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, egg and jalapeno. Use your hands and mix well. Pat down into a loaf pan. Top with the ketchup, the remaining 1 tablespoon Worcestershire, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cayenne. Smooth over the top and bake until cooked through, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes. Now this is where the recipe gets fun and you get to use your imagination!!! After the meatloaf cools, slice into 8 thin slices (use 2 slices for each sandwich). You can use any kind of bread. We use a brioche roll, but you can use a kaiser, country Italian or anything that will hold up a messy sandwich. Use some of our suggested toppings to perfect your meatloaf sandwich.

Drain, chop and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, jalapeno, and shallots to the oil and saute until they soften, about 45 seconds. Make sure you don&#39;t brown the ingredients. Next, add the soy sauce, mirin and rice wine vinegar. Turn the heat up to a boil, and reduce by half, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat. In a bowl, add the mayonnaise, hijiki and the reduced soy sauce mixture. Stir until combined. Then, slowly add the sesame oil while stirring. Yield: 1 1/2 cups. For the oysters: Heat the lap cheong in a saute pan over medium heat until it is slightly rendered, about 1 minute. Remove the lap cheong from the pan and dice. Next, add the olive oil, garlic and shallots to the saute pan and cook over medium heat until they&#39;re nice and toasty, about 1 minute. Make sure you don&#39;t brown the garlic and shallots. Then add the spinach and cook until it is lightly wilted. Remove the spinach from the heat and allow to cool. Finish with salt and pepper to taste. Preheat a grill to medium heat. Wash, scrub and shuck your oysters. Remove the oysters from the shells and fill the shells with sauteed spinach. Place the oysters on top of the spinach. Then top each of the oysters with more sauteed spinach, some sesame aioli and lap cheong. Put the oysters on the grill, close the lid and within 5 minutes they will be ready to eat. To plate, place some salad on a platter, such as mizuna, a Chinese lettuce. Then, set the 12 oysters on top of the salad and garnish with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 64350,&quot;Balsamic-Baked Onions and Potatoes with Roast Pork 3 1/2 pounds medium-sized waxy potatoes (all-purpose), peeled and quartered lengthwise Olive oil 7 ounces butter, cubed 1 bunch fresh rosemary, leaves picked and chopped 1 whole bulb garlic, quartered or smashed 5 medium red onions, peeled and quartered 1 1/2 cups cheap balsamic vinegar Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 small bunch fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons freshly ground fennel seeds One 3 1/2-pound boneless rolled pork loin, preferably free-range or organic, skin off, fat scored in a crisscross pattern Olive oil 6 cloves garlic, crushed 1 medium red onion, peeled and quartered 2 stalks celery, trimmed and chopped 4 bay leaves 2 wine glasses white wine Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the potatoes into a pan of boiling, salted water and cook for around 8 minutes, then drain and return to the pan. Chuff them up a bit by shaking the pan. To prepare the meat, scatter a handful of finely chopped rosemary leaves over a large chopping board. Sprinkle over some salt and pepper and the ground fennel seeds. Roll the pork across the board, pressing down hard so all the flavorings stick to it. Get a large roasting pan that your pork will fit snugly into, and place it on a burner over a medium-high heat. Pour in a little olive oil and place the pork in, fat side down, sprinkled with any flavorings remaining on the board. After a few minutes, when the pork fat is lightly golden, turn it over and add the garlic cloves, onion, celery and bay leaves to the pan. Place on the bottom shelf of your preheated oven for 1 hour, basting it halfway through. (For the last 20 minutes of cooking, you may need to cover the pork with a bit of damp waxed paper to stop it coloring too much.) Get another roasting pan, into which you can fit the potatoes in 1 layer, and heat it on the stove. When hot, pour a glug of olive oil into it and add the butter, rosemary and garlic. Add the potatoes and toss them in all the flavors. Add the onions and all the balsamic vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes on the burner to reduce the balsamic vinegar a little. Place the pan on the top shelf and cook for around 50 minutes, until the potatoes and onions are dark, sticky and crispy - removing the pan to toss the onions and potatoes halfway through. After 1 hour, the meat should be cooked. Prick it with a sharp knife - if the juices run clear, it&#39;s done; if not, pop it back in the oven for another 10 to 15 minutes, keeping the potatoes warm. Remove it from the oven and let it rest on a plate for 10 minutes. Pour away most of the fat from the pan and mash up the garlic and onion. Place the pan over the burner and add the white wine. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, scraping all the meaty, marmitey goodness off the bottom to make a tasty little sauce, and season if necessary. Pass through a sieve into a serving pitcher. Then slice the pork and serve it with your incredible baked onions and potatoes, drizzled with the pan juices. This meal goes great with some nice greens or an arugula salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 64351,&quot;Broccoli Salad with Buttermilk Dressing Kosher salt 1 bunch broccoli, tough stems trimmed (about 1 1/2 pounds) 1/2 cup buttermilk 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest 2 tablespoons salted sunflower seeds Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Coarsely chop the broccoli florets and tender stems. Add to the water and cook until crisp tender, about 2 minutes. Drain well, pressing on the broccoli to release any excess water.

Sprinkle the short ribs evenly with the salt and add them to the pan. Sear well on all sides. This will take about 15 minutes total, so be patient; the meat should have a deep golden brown color and release evenly from the pan before flipping. Remove the seared short ribs to a plate. To the hot pan, add the carrot, celery, onion, thyme, bay leaf and pepper flakes. Cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until very fragrant and beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and caramelize for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the red wine and simmer for 5 minutes to reduce slightly. Stir in the beef broth and add the short ribs back to the pan. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer until the meat can be pulled apart with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Set aside to cool slightly. Place the short ribs in a medium bowl. Using two forks, shred the meat into bite-size pieces. Add about a 1/2 cup of the braising liquid to the meat and toss to moisten. For the remoulade: In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, cornichons, mayonnaise, capers, Dijon, tarragon, salt and pepper. Fold together with a rubber spatula. For the crostini: Spread a small amount of the remoulade on each of the crostini. Top with a spoonful of the shredded meat and another small dollop of the remoulade.
